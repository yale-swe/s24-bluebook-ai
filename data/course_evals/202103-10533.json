            "comments": [
                "One strength of the course is the fact that it was split into sections (fiction, poetry, theater, and other), which allowed us to get a good range of experience with different kinds of texts. \r\n\r\nI think this course was very disorganized. Often assignments were changed around at the last minute, and the due dates on the syllabus were almost never followed. It was hard to keep up with changes or understand what was going on at times. Also, this class is labelled a seminar class but felt a lot more like a lecture. There was little discussion during the class, and we often spent most of the period listening to the professors talk about the materials we read instead of discussing them ourselves.",
                "Strengths: interesting readings, section\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: structure of course, organization of syllabus\r\n\r\nI think the course would have been improved as a lecture with discussion sections or a capped, small seminar. As it was, it was a mix. I didn't realize when I signed up that it would be such a big class and with so much lecturing. It was hard to concentrate sometimes, and it was difficult to have a productive and focused discussion. I would have preferred a seminar format, or if there are too many students at least structuring it officially as a lecture with sections.\r\n\r\nI also think the organization of the units and readings could be improved. The topics sometimes felt a little all over the place, when we went from Camus to Homer. As a result, I don't feel like I learned as much as I have from similar courses. I think this could be improved by having either had a distinct, honed theme, or a clear chronological organization. There could also be more organization of the literary theory into discrete units. As it was, reading a few articles here and there didn't make me feel like I had a good picture of the theory or how different lenses fit together. Finally, I would love to see more full works added to the syllabus to dig into, in place of so many short texts or readings from the textbook which I found less helpful.",
                "I really enjoyed the section component of this course. At first, I was confused why a seminar needed a section, but as the course became more like a lecture, section became very helpful. Some of the readings were engaging and it was cool being able to read a variety of different texts. Professors Campe and Hever are also very knowledgeable and interesting. However, some of the readings were very outdated or excessive and I did not enjoy them. I also wish this class had been more of a seminar and we were given more chances to contribute our own ideas and readings. Although we were given more opportunities to explore in our papers, the class itself was very dry and rigid.",
                "For the professors not to lecture during the seminar and to eliminate the discussion sections",
                "It definitely needs to be a smaller seminar with one rather than two professors. I felt that generally this course was a lecture course masquerading as a seminar, which was disappointing. The readings were also quite sporadic. In the future, I think readings and discussions should revolve more around an underlying theme.",
                "This course is marketed as a seminar but feels much, much more like a far-removed lecture. As a result the class is very unengaging despite being such a small classroom environment. That is the main drawback of the course, although there are others: often it felt like there was no subject to the lectures/discussions, and often we would stick on subjects for way longer than was prescribed by the syllabus. I do not know why we spent weeks talking about Camus' \"The Stranger\"; none of our other texts got the same level of attention.\r\nRegrettably, I can't think of any strengths of this course.",
                "This course has a lot of potential conceptually, and the syllabus was full of interesting texts that I'm glad to have read. Sections were enlightening and I genuinely enjoyed discussing what we read there. However, most of the formal class periods were unhelpful at best--although lectures sometimes gave useful historical context, they were generally not the best way to engage with the texts, mostly presenting the professors' reading with only a short time for response (during which some students were consistently called on more often than others). The lectures were also confusing, and it was difficult to determine what we were meant to take away from any given lesson. This was both because of the style of presentation and because it was almost impossible to hear, despite the fact that the professors did not wear masks even well within 12 feet of us--against the University's COVID regulations. I would have appreciated much more time to freely discuss ideas with other students, which was the most fun and interesting part of the class and which was mostly relegated to the short weekly discussion section.",
                "- too much lecturing, not enough class discussion\r\n- students could have engaged with the texts more if some sort of written response was required in advance of class\r\n- too many straight white male authors!!\r\n- the final unit was a hodgepodge of graphic novel, film, and photography -- but students were not given the proper tools to analyze those. the course should either stick to more traditional texts or make room for analysis techniques for non-traditional texts",
                "The class covered some very interesting authors, and I believe the professors took the class in interesting directions. However, sometimes the syllabus felt too sprawling, and it wasn't always clear what the connections were between different works. While some classmates seemed consistently engaged, others seemed bored by the class, making the class atmosphere a bit weird.",
                "It is loosely structured and attempts to tackle more than it could possibly cover. I would prefer something more concise and inspiring. A bold renovation would perhaps be reading one piece of essential text for each class, without going into the theoretical side of it. I have tried taking it last semester and honestly it might be better if we ditch the theory for all. Advanced theory courses rely on the student's previous exposure to those texts, why should entry level courses require the same?",
                "Despite the efforts of the professors, the course has no real objective. I never understood what it aimed to teach and what a student is supposed to walk away having learned from this class. This seems like a Department-level problem, since I have heard the exact same complaint from at least three cohorts of my friends who took this course, each under a different set of professors. The problem is at the heart of the class itself, not with individual professors or teaching assistants. \r\n\r\nThe readings alternated between quite basic (textbook primers on \"Plot,\" \"Character,\" and \"Style\" in a college class) and overly narrow (jumping from primers on the forms of the Short Story and the Novel straight into Russian Formalism was a surprise). The course would benefit from someone thinking through what it aims to teach undergraduates.\r\n\r\nIf I were a first-year student considering the Comparative Literature major, and this was my first experience with the major, I might have dropped the major altogether."

                "No, the course was poorly organized. One of the professors scheduled an office hours with me, then forgot about the office hours on the day of our appointment (perhaps because he did not know my name). That professor continued to call me by the names of other Asian students in our class through the end of the very last class of the semester. I don't believe he ever learned the names of any of the students in our class. I was also mistaken for another Asian student in the class by my teaching assistant as well (although he later learned our names and made a sincere effort to lead our section well)."
