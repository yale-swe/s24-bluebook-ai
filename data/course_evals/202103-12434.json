General Equilibrium Theory is a cornerstone of theoretical economics, and you definitely gain a solid understanding of its overall mechanics. One thing that you learn in this class that is truly unique among core economics courses is the ability for multiple (and unstable) equilibria, which is typically not featured elsewhere. You learn about how debts can affect these equilibria, and how ultimately significant amounts of debt are at the heart of financial crises, including that of 2008. You will also learn some basic economics theory related to finance including the ubiquitous CAPM model, as well as cover models that attempt to explain the role of money, interest, and inflation in the economy.",

                "John G is great, although he lost some clarity in the second half of the course in differentiating between the various (similar) models. He has tangents, but they're dynamic, engaging and enjoyable. The problem sets are fair, the grading is more than reasonable. I wish there had been more sophisticated math, as it was stripped from the course.",
                "Some good insights of modeling individuals for mortgage applications, but the notation is unnecessarily complicated. The lecture notes would be much more comprehensible with less pomp.",
                "the material was quite difficult to understand, especially with the notation used, and though the professor was open to answering questions, I often felt too lost to even formulate a question to ask. a slower pace would be nice, as would more example problems in class",
                "Some lectures were a little hard to follow but overall the class was fantastic. TAs were super willing to help with everything.",
                "The course is in general good. Cannot tell a specific strength, but I have enjoyed it a lot.\r\nThe semester was a rush at the end, and we have to give up some really interesting topics. Maybe adjust the syllabus and select some topics, instead of doing all of them.",
                "Strengths: very interesting material, especially towards the end of the semester, where the prof touched on his own research\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lack of organization, lecture notes are hard to follow and problem sets are tangentially related to the actual lecture",
                "John G's lecture notes are obnoxiously long and complex but his discussion of the material is super fascinating and helps clear some of the confusion in the notes.",
                "Strengths: overall very interesting material. Psets that were of reasonable length and difficulty\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes it felt like we were glossing over lots of details in lectures",
                "strengths - prof g is super knowledgeable with the material, his stories entertain and humanize an entire generation of stellar economists, the TAs are helpful and interested and the lectures (although long) are illuminating \r\nweaknesses - the psets and lectures could be paced better, the more interesting models (L - Economy, CC Economy) could be prioritized and studied earlier, the online exam format (unfortunately) was a bit rough",
                "Discussions sections were extremely helpful in this course. Lectures closely followed typed notes and there is less of an emphasis on solving examples. The teaching fellows were helpful in filling in the gaps between the lecture material and the concepts required for problem solving for the problem sets and exams.",
                "Strengths: Very fascinating content in the second half of the course, which touched on credit cards, money, and the leverage cycle. Great professor as well!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish more of an emphasis was placed on the second half of the course. I felt like just as the content got interesting, the course ended, although that may just be personal preference.",
                "The lectures themselves were a bit too fast and rushed, but doing the problem sets help understand the materials.",
                "Strength is John G who is brilliant and a legend in the field. The course was structured well and expectations were clear. No significant weaknesses",
                "Great lecturer, interesting materials and supplemented with great stories",
                "Cut the simplex section and add to the leverage cycle/housing derivatives part.",
                "I would say a main strength is that the course is taught by Prof Geanakoplos, who is both entertaining and obviously extremely knowledgable. I personally really enjoyed lecture, which definitely is great for a course that one can imagine being more dry.\r\n\r\nIn terms of improvements, I might focus a bit more on the material we covered at the end (leverage cycle, financial markets), as that was really extremely interesting. The aspects of the course which seemed to most reflect what is viewed in the real economy are the most interesting to me; other courses will cover many models that are known to not quite fit reality, so seeing those other models was really additive to my general economics education.",
                "Weakness: You will have to teach yourself most of the course, especially the second half of the course. More often than not, Prof. Geanakoplos didn't even finish the lectures and expected students to read the lecture notes on their own time.  The problem is, the lecture notes honestly are very long and would take days to finish, and even longer to fully understand. Most of the psets were impossible to do unless you went to TA office hours or looked to online resources because the lectures only cover the concepts theoretically, but not how to actually do practical problems which were what the psets focused on. The second half of the course was disorganized. Many difficult and complex concepts were rushed through. What makes it even more difficult is there is no standard textbook for the course. Because Prof. G. teaches some of his own research or newer concepts that are not in textbooks, you have to make do with disorganized lecture notes that are written by Prof. G.",
                "The course could definitely benefit from some additional structure in terms of how it flows.",
                "The course material was a little all over the place. The professor assumes some concepts are obvious to student when they are not obvious to all students, so I had trouble understanding a lot of the explanations. Most of my learning came from asking the TFs about the problem sets at their office hours.",
                "I think that this course gives a truly in depth view on the mechanisms behind different models and provides a deeper understanding of the basis of Economic theory. It is more mathematically rigorous than many other courses in the Economics department and this gives students a better understanding of what the subject is really about. A weakness of the course is the structure. I think that it might help to make clearer lecture notes and have more precise demonstrations of the computational tools that are taught in the course."

                "Yes, if you like John G's teaching style. Shop his course. The material doesn't have as much mathematical rigor as I would have liked, especially since it is advertised as preparation for graduate school in economics. The content is interesting and worth learning.",
                "If you are a Econ/Math major, you have to take it.",
                "not unless it's a major requirement or you really like mathematical economic theory",
                "Absolutely. This is the best econ class that I have ever taken. It gives the entire theory of finance and is really fantastic being able to listen to Geanakoplos talk about his hedge fund's strategy. With that said, it's also by far the hardest econ class that I have taken as an econ/math major, but the sections are really helpful and ultimately you should be fine with the material. I literally felt like I needed to clap after every lecture because Geanakoplos is so amazing -- he tells so many amazing stories in class and is insanely brilliant, his lectures really are like a work of art.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to someone who is comfortable with math and wish to learn microeconomic models.",
                "Yes, if you want to get a taste of math-based and theoretical economics. However, you don't gain a deep or intuitive understanding of the material.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Depends on the student. The topics we covered in this course and the insights we got from each model were very interesting, but oftentimes solving these types of problems can be a bit grindy. To students willing to deal with numerically solving models, I would definitely recommend this course.",
                "yes, take it for Prof G! it is not easy, it is an intellectual challenge, and you will need to be on your toes - but a great class",
                "Yes, this is an interesting econ course and some of the models learnt can help guide ypur economic intuition.",
                "Yes, this course was phenomenal. If youre interested in economics, want a mathematically rigorous overview of optimization and general equilibrium, and also want to hear funny/sporadic anecdotes from John G, this is a great course to take. Problem sets felt relevant and exams were fair. Be prepared to put in some extra work though if youre not comfortable with real analysis. While most of the math did not rely on it, it would likely be more difficult to grasp without that background.",
                "Depending on the interest of the student, and whether they have time, since the courses workload is not insignificant.",
                "Yes, especially of youre more interested in the more theoretical side of economics",
                "Yes - a must take for quantitative economists",
                "I would definitely take this course. If you are an Econ/Math major, you are likely going to take this anyway but you do have an option -- I would advise taking this class. You will learn a fair amount of general equilibrium theory, and John G does a great job of tracing the development of many of the key ideas (he was the student of the founders of the area). He is also a very entertaining storyteller, which adds to the course, especially as some of the more math-y material could be viewed as more slightly more dry. You will also learn about some really interesting ideas he has introduced, such as the leverage cycle, which has become fairly well-known/accepted in both the academic and financial community. \r\n\r\nOne caveat is that you should be relatively comfortable with math. While the course does not really test proofs, having the ability to understand them will really help you get the most out of lectures (that do contain proofs), especially in the first half of the course. I took this concurrently with analysis, and I think having the familiarity with analysis-style argumentation helped me understand the material more fully. You'd probably be fine in taking the course without proof-based math under your belt, but you might get a bit less out of the more theoretical lectures (as Psets don't really ask for proofs of theorems).",
                "Unless you need to take it for the Econ-Math major, don't take it.",
                "I would recommend if you are interested in theoretical microeconomics!",
                "Maybe if you're interested in financial economics, otherwise take if only if it's required. The problem sets are long, often tedious, and sometimes have typos that change the meaning of the question. They were also assigned during fall break and into reading period. This relentless slog I assume is only worthwhile for students who are really interested in this material (I was not interested, so I can only assume).",
                "I would recommend this course to a student that is really interested in the mechanisms behind the largest models in Economics and can tolerate the level of mathematical rigor that this course brings. There are a lot of proofs presented in this class that might be hard to follow for students that don't have a mathematical background. This course provides a deeper and different view of the models that are taught in Intermediate Micro."
