                "The strengths of the course is that you get out however much you put it. You could coast in the course and get a fine grade however you will not learn much. This course really depends on the 'user'.",
                "Strengths: very hands-on and project based\r\nWeaknesses: not much actual teaching, essentially you self-teach yourself from youtube tutorials and experimentation",
                "Strengths: super flexible\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not very engaging and could be learned with just youtube tutorials",
                "The course is mastery-based which means you can redo assignments as many times as you need to get the skill down which is (I think) the only way to teach CAE. The course also meaningfully covers all aspects of CAE, not just CAD.",
                "I liked that the workload was low. I think class time could've been used more effectively (e.g., less lecture and more of the solidworks built-in tutorials would've been useful). Professor Freeman sometimes didn't know the answers to my solidworks questions.",
                "Only strengths! I loved how this course was so self-paced and project-focused. Dr. Freeman did a great job of making the class chill yet productive. I feel that the gentle pace allowed me to gain a better understanding of how to use Solidworks and finalize my projects rather than a rushed final product.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Freeman is has an in-depth knowledge of SolidWorks and more importantly understands how to convey it. Learning through practice (as opposed to just lectures) is emphasized so students actually leave with a firm understanding of the software.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: in terms of logistics, it is sometimes difficult to know when assignments are due and what the criteria for completion are because the canvas pages isnt updated regularly, but the professor is very understanding so not a huge deal.",
                "I think the course could include additive production engineering methods such as 3D printing with practical work on it.",

                "Yes! Super chill and a great way to learn Solidworks",

                "Yes, if you are looking for a gut MENG elective or just a gut engineering elective. Honestly, I really enjoyed getting to mess around in CAD, and it was nice to have one engineering course that didn't take up a shit ton of my time. You essentially can just do all the assignments in class, the only time I had to do outside work was for the final project, and that was only a couple hours. However, if you are looking to actually become very proficient in CAD and design complex structures, you are probably better off just self-teaching. You will learn the basics of how to design parts and perform very very simple motion studies and FEAs, but you will probably learn more CAD doing a self-directed project for a club or another class than in this class. Definitely would recommend for all MENG majors though just to get a little more CAD experience and to have one chill class (we be struggling out here)",
                "Yeah, its a fun easy engineering course. Workload is extremely low.",
                "If you are interesting in learning CAD or even just expanding your skills and adding more to your CAE toolkit, you should take this course. It's an easy course that actually teaches useful skills for engineers.",
                "It's a low-workload MENG elective. If you already sort-of know how to use solidworks, you probably won't get much out of the course unless you take it upon yourself to learn more advanced things, but it's still good practice.",
                "Yes! Great way to learn CAD at a slower pace. The grading scheme of submit until you get it right is also great to facilitate learning in a non-stressful way",
                "I would recommend this course to ANY engineering major!! It's a great way to learn about CAD without high-pressure deadlines or assignments, and the course structure rewards you for trying to explore other elements of CAD outside of the curriculum.",
                "If you are an engineering student, this course is a must take as SolidWorks is a fundamental software in the field. \r\n\r\nFor anyone outside engineering, take this course if you are interested in learning to work with computer models / 3D printing and are willing to put in time to get comfortable with the program outside of class.",
                "Yes, I course is well suited for students with diverse backgrounds and helps them develop designing skills through the use of software. Students without a background in mechanical engineering can take this course successfully.",
                "I think it's good just to review and know how to do some more specific operations in Solidworks"
