                "The professor was amazing and put so much effort into getting things graded quickly while also being willing to spend time to help! Overall, the professor helped to build a great environment that allowed me to not only feel comfortable participating and speaking up but allowed me to make friends virtually in class too!",
                "The class size is very small, the work load was high and the teacher was incredibly interactive, all of which fostered rapid learning and retention. The weaknesses are negligible, but it is worth noting that the class depends on conversational prompts much of the time. This is helpful but becomes problematic when the prompts are unclear, especially when they are homework-based.",
                "Despite our confinement to the digital realm, the structure of class, group projects, and peer review helped build a sense of community amongst the students and instructor. I also value how accessible our instructor was. There were also very good learning aids provided to supplement the textbook."

                "Breakout rooms were useful for this course to engage with classmates which ultimately helped reinforce our japanese skills.",
                "The course was easily and perfectly adapted for the transition to online learning. The class has students write compositions on various collaborative platforms, which was a total success. However, towards the end of the course, students would end up alone with their conversational partners while conversational prompts were thoroughly exhausted. Therefore, the only downside of this format seems to be that it is probably more difficult for the professor to gauge when the class as a whole should move on from a given exercise.",
