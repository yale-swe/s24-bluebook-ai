                "Yes, but only because the rest of the program is such an incredible experience. As a standalone course, no, I would not recommend it. Personally, I just wasn't as interested in an artistic and philosophical survey of five hundred years of Brazilian history. I did really enjoy when the course covered themes that were more relevant to the Brazil of today - samba, the roots of popular music, major recent historical events - but these moments were fewer than I would have preferred. I also sometimes had problems staying focused in lecture.",

The course did encourage meeting and talking to Brazilians through the personal project, which was useful. However, the main knowledge of the course consisted of a lot of identification of names, people, places, etc. - some of which is still relevant to modern Brazil, but a lot of which is no longer (unless Brazilian culture and history is a field of study you want to pursue.)",
