I found classes really interesting, he was flexible when students had issues, and the exams were reasonable. \r\n\r\nThis is a classic good, interesting, and not too challenging class. I enjoyed every lecture and I will miss Professor Bribiescas.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None. He got rid of section which was great!"

Overall, it made it so I focused more on understanding the questions and material rather than the rote memorization of random facts. I would take it as a fifth credit or just for fun. I do wish the Prof. allowed iPads / computer notes given a tree was killed per exam.",

If you can take one of his classes before you graduate you won't regret it. Also, he made the tests open note this semester which took all the pressure off of \"grades\" so it really was just about learning the super interesting content. Take this class. Take it. You gotta take it.",

                "Prof Bribiescas rocks!! Hes not wild and crazy, hes a clear, calm, lecturer, but he absolutely loves what he is teaching. You can hear the excitement in his voice as he talks about hormones and life history theory. If you are interested in that sort of thing, totally take this class. Very pop sciency in a good way. Hes nice in office hours and it was great without section! Finally, he is really good about being respectful and cognizant of the tricky issues around hormones, sex, gender, etc. For example, he is VERY vigilant about the use of male and female rather than man and woman so as to not conflate sex and gender and devotes class time to discussions around the spectrum of gender identities, how sex manifests, etc. Also, he brought in a fantastic guest lecturer for the pregnancy day. Very cool!"
