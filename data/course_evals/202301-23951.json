(Though nearly two-thirds of our work focused on the period 1770-1840 (which was super interesting!), we also read works written in the 20th and 21st centuries.) Additionally, I was able to practice and improve my German reading and writing skills.",

Weaknesses: most of the discussions were reading based, and the plays can often be very difficult to understand, so often times no one was able to answer the questions or the answers were overall very dry, which made for not very engaging discussions. Would be better if half the class was a lecture on the readings, and the other half we did discussions instead of only doing discussions for the entire 1 hour 45 min.",

The readings can get pretty intense though for a foreign language, so unless you're dedicated to spending at least 2 x 8 hours a week on this class, you'll be fine but don't expect to get much out of it/find it engaging.",
