Throughout the course, I had the opportunity to learn numerous concepts, including steady state systems, thermodynamics, entropy, enthalpy, and many more. This enriching experience has left a profound impact on me.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the course went beyond the syllabus and offered valuable insights into college life. The emphasis on collaboration and teamwork was a refreshing change for me, as it was something I had been missing in my previous summer school experiences. This aspect of the course not only enhanced my learning but also allowed me to develop essential skills for my future academic and professional endeavors.",
                "I developed skills to analyze any given situation. Ranging from tanks and turbines to rooms with any source.",

                "Flexibility and literacy in concepts of chemical engineering, including dimensional analysis and intuitive applications of chemistry.",

                "The course is good at teaching you how to improvise as there are many ways to solve the problems and the environment is very collaborative.",
                "for me, the course had it strength in its curriculum, and its classes. The curriculum was put together for a great introduction into mathematical modelling and chemical engineering, without scarring me like the high school textbooks. The classes were well engaging and collaborative for students to receive enough assistance and help from teachers and their peers. The teaching style of the proffesor was great for me to adapt to and understand concepts quickly. Another strength, which I personally appreciate, was the office hours and additional assistance offered by the professor, as it did never resulted in a pause or frustration while learning in the last 4 weeks.",
                "The course finds itself in a tough place as an intro course because you do need some extra background beyond the lectures for things to make sense, but the depth of the course is also limited because of the timescale if you do have the background. Overall, a fun course and Loewenberg is great.",
                "The course is delightfully challenging and the diet of material (Psets/Tests/Classwork ratio) is wonderful, stimulating without being stressful. The course could benefit from a slower, more granular approach to the problems it poses.",
                "I liked the format of short lectures in combination with group work! Also, the problem sets were a manageable about of work and they were instructive. In general, I think its hard to have active participation in class and during group work over zoom, but if there was a way to encourage this more, the class would probably more engaging for everyone."

The workload is super manageable, and you'll come out of the course understanding how a variety of different types of mechanical problems can be approached."
