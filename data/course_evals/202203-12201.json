The workload during the last half/quarter of the semester is absolutely horrible if you are doing grad-school applications, studying for the MCAT, or applying for jobs while taking 3-4 other classes at the same time.",
                "In my opinion, the course can be considered in two partsthe regular course itself, and the final project. I think the course itself, including the regular problem sets, exams, and lectures, is fine, probably just as good if not better than the average CENG class here. It's pretty hard to do the problem sets without office hours, but that's very typical.\r\n\r\nThe final project is definitely interesting in concept, but I think its biggest weakness is the fact that it relies on Simulink/Matlab, and none of us in the class have much experience in programming, especially in the former. This becomes a real problem when we are all trying to run the simulation modules and put the project simulation together because obvious, some bugs will happen, whether it is because we did something wrong or we don't have the right compiler or something. As a result, everyone is flooding Professor Altman with emails, and he has to help each of us debug our programs, which is time-consuming, while we have to wait for him to do so before we can really move on. Altman tries to teach us how to use Simulink with the tutorials, which I appreciate, and it gives us the basic skills we need to at least start the project, but our lack of experience with the program becomes really obvious when we have to do things by ourselves. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we don't spend any time in class on the project, we kind of just got the description in a PDF and were left on our own. Altman mentioned that we should start looking at it, but to be honest, I wasn't even aware of the timeline he provides until the first deadline, when I was informed by a classmate. If we spent a little class time on the project, that would go a long way both in terms of getting people to actually start the project before reading week and helping us better understand what we need to do for it."

                "If you are not a chemical engineering major, there is really not much point in taking this class. You need to have taken some of the other CENG courses to be able to keep up in this class at all, and even those of us that did take those classes had a hard time. The final project is also so much work."
