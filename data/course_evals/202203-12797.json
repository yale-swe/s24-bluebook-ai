I've only been studying Swahili since 2019, and before taking Doctor Wa'Njogu's Kiswahili literature course, I never knew that I was capable of reading or writing at the university level in Swahili. Not only that, but I did not know that I was able to read and write so much in Swahili. It is amazing what you can accomplish when you have a professor like Doctor Wa'Njogu gently guiding you, believing in you, helping you, pushing you, offering expert advice / counsel."

Something I appreciated a lot in this course (and which I feel is one of the course's biggest strengths) is that students are only evaluated against their own individual level, which is especially important for students learning Swahili as a foreign language. I appreciated this because it shows that Doctor Wa'Njogu is dedicated to creating a welcoming atmosphere for students at every level- all students are welcomed. To excel in this class... come to class, read, do the best you can do in your reading reflections and final project, and that's it! You will succeed with flying colors."

                "Yes I would highly recommend this course. It is not only the most extraordinary L-5 content course Ive ever taken, but it is also the best literature course Ive ever taken in any language. This course is a pillar of Swahili language and literature education at Yale and should be replicated across all language departments. The course is beneficial for both native speakers of Swahili and students like myself who are learning Swahili as a foreign language. The course is an immersion into a world that I feel exists only in Swahili literature. ThroughDoctor WaNjogusincredible curriculum, studentsexplore the most vibrant parts of this world, which is, in essence, a reflection of our own world where the best and worst parts ofmankind are put on display and explored extensively through poems, novels, and plays. Themes that repeatedly emerge in all of these works range from colonialism and neocolonialism to poverty, crime, corruption, politics, global warming, and more. I would urge all students at the advanced level to enroll (native speakers and students who have finished at least second year Swahili at Yale, or the equivalent). As a student who started learning Swahili only 3 years ago, I feel like Doctor Wa'Njogu'sgentle guidance through this course has helped meto accomplish feats that I never dreamed possible in a foreign language, and I want all of those who are serious about learning the Swahili language to experience the same marvels that I have experienced in this course."
