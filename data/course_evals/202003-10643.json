                "The strength is the professor and his willingness to help in any way possible, as well as the way in which he makes intricate religious concepts very easily understandable. The only weakness is that it could be approached in a more interactive way if there's a small number of students in the lecture.",
                "This course was excellent. Professor Bowering led phenomenal lectures. He is really well-knowledgeable of the various religions. Furthermore, Nate was a fabulous Teaching Fellow that gave us essential notes that helped in understanding various topics. He also led one lecture that was amazing.",
                "Strengths: The information was presented in a very organized way that facilitated learning and understanding.  Virtually, it can be a bit difficult to spell out terms without seeing them on a blackboard.  This problem was addressed by the TA who would send it to us in the chat.  \r\nWeakness: It would be helpful to have a few minutes every now and then to ask questions to the professor, but the TA was helpful answering them in the chat."

The professor gives a very in depth understanding and lectures are information heavy so if you're not interested from the start you will get bored quickly.  Overall I left with a really great understanding of religions all over the world and it was very enjoyable.",
