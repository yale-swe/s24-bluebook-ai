We covered monotone convergence, Fatou's lemma, and dominated convergence. We learned about the completion of sigma-algebras and weak-star convergence. We derived the Reiz representation theorem. We delved into the fundamental results of Lp spaces, including the Holder and Minkowski inequalities and the completeness of Lp. We used the Lebesgue-Radon-Nykodym derivative to relate sigma-finite measures and discussed the notions of upper and lower derivatives of Radon measures. We touched on Hilbert space theory, including the Freschet-Reiz representation theorem, and we used the RNL derivative to relate complex measures with their total variations. The last two weeks of the course were perhaps the most interesting, where we talked about ergodic theory, including Poincare recurrence and the Birkhoff ergodic theorem."

Another suggestion would be to spend less time on the nuts and bolts of theorems such as the Besicovitch covering theorem or the Reiz representation theorem. They were interesting but largely took time away from more interesting measure-theoretic results."

This was a great way to encounter analysis in a more general setting. The topics from this course have many application in statistical mechanics, dynamical systems, and number theory."
