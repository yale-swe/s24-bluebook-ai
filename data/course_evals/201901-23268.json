   "comments": [
    "I learned the importance of a public point in writing, and how to apply other writers' techniques to my own work.",
    "I learned how to write concisely and make every word, sentence, and paragraph count. Writing creative non-fiction in a variety of different structures was incredible interesting and often times a challenging process. But by reading other creative non-fiction essays and constantly revising my own, I was able to perfect my form and style into crafting creative non-fiction essays that captivate the reader, keep the reader intrigued, and sometimes even leave the reader wanting more.",
    "I did not develop any skills in this class based off of the pure incompetency of my professor.",
    "I developed a better understanding of how to write a nonfiction essay, as well as how to apply different styles to the writing. We explore the work of different writers while writing our own pieces, which I found to be extremely helpful in creating our own kind of tones for the pieces. I definitely felt I improved in essay writing through the course by using Dean Hills feedback and working with classmates to provide feedback on their pieces.",
    "Learned how to use better verbs and adjectives, to write succinctly while packing a punch, to manipulate the pacing of my essays, and to revise thoroughly.",
    "How to write with more thoughtfulness and intention - my writing STYLE improved dramatically",
    "I learned how to craft compelling and well-written personal narratives and short essays that draw the reader in and make a strong public point.",
    "First and foremost, I learned to write well-constructed narrative non-fiction essays of which I was generally very proud once the final draft was turned in.\r\n\r\nI learned to read essays by professional writers and appreciate not only the content, but also the tactics the author used that made the essay effective.\r\n\r\nThis class also allowed me to hone my workshopping skills: by commenting weekly on my peers' work, I learned how to identify what works and doesn't work in any given piece and, most importantly, how to give criticism that is constructive rather than progress-inhibiting.",
    "I loved this class because it allowed me to self-reflect on my own life and personal experiences as well as improve my creative writing skills.",
    "I had the chance to view literature and create my own through a variety of lenses. I wrote in styles I wasn't familiar with."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the course were that I had the opportunity to write creative non-fiction essays in a variety of different styles. From personal experience, to person, to place, to cultural criticism, to humor, I was exposed to many different approaches to writing and was constantly kept engaged with what I was doing. I think that a weakness of the course was the  consistency of the work load. You had in a draft of an essay every week so there is no down time. On top of writing your own essays, you are constantly reading other essays in order to learn from them. As soon as you finish one draft of an essay, you start the next one so that you can make sure that you will be ready to hand it in on time.",
    "A strength of this class is the ability for students to produce writing to be criticized by peers and given feedback. A weakness is the turn around time of these pieces as it rarely gives students the chance to breathe between writing assignments.",
    "This course encourages a lot of feedback from both peers and the Dean. I felt this was really helpful in improving our papers. The reading load was full of really enjoyable texts and helped immensely when preparing for our own essays. The grading is fairly strict though, and only a small number of people will get As, as the Dean told us early on.",
    "Strengths: lots of writing and improving! Most of the readings were short and interesting. A great break from other work \/ more dense readings\r\nWeaknesses: the writing took a LOT of time! You usually have an essay draft or final draft due each friday. That would sneak up on me each week",
    "English 120 is pretty perfect, I just wish more time was spent talking about the writing style of each author and the mechanics behind how they write rather than the content in the article",
    "Strengths: strong classroom discussion, a great emphasis on style over formal academic writing.",
    "Strength: This course's focus on reading to improve one's own writing, not just for pleasure, was very effective. I really do feel that I learned new writing techniques, and overall how to write a type of essay that I had been relatively unfamiliar with before. Discussing peers' pieces in a workshop setting also helped with my confidence and understanding of what makes a good essay.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I sometimes felt that the pacing of the class--either a first draft or a final draft due each week--was overwhelming, and I would have liked a little more time to work on more complex pieces. However, this was not a large issue, and the fast pace did encourage me to generate a lot of work.",
    "I wish this course focused more on technique and less on creating the overall storyline and public point of your piece. I felt a bit unprepared going in as I had never done any creative writing in the past, and I would have liked a bit more guidance as to how to structure creative paragraphs and sentences.",
    "Strengths: clear expectations; discussion-based\r\nWeaknesses: grading really varies by professor"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. It was my favorite class this semester. The workload was reasonable, and my professor really pushed me to write as well as I could.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is looking for the opportunity to expand the way in which you write. Writing non-academic style essays in an academic setting is extremely interesting and something  I thoroughly enjoyed.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student since there are much more fulfilling writing credits to take and English 120 is a waste of time. If a student does choose to take English 120, make sure to sign up for a section taught by a professor who will give constructive criticism towards writing and does not ridicule student work.",
    "I would recommend this course because I felt it improved me as a writer and as a peer editor. Through interacting with our classmates papers, we were able to gain skills applicable to our own. This course provides a full understanding of the elements of a nonfiction essay.",
    "Would recommend if you have the time to dedicate to putting effort into your writing and improving it! If you don't put in the time then it's not really worth it.",
    "Yes - this is one of those must-take courses at Yale! I only wish I had shopped a couple of English 120s before landing on one. Every English 120 section is not created equal, despite having the same curriculum.",
    "I would recommend English 120 if you are interested in getting away from the formal academic prose\/argumentative writing and doing more fun, shorter essays about interesting themes and topics.",
    "If you're interested in improving your essay writing skills, absolutely!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is interested in creative writing or needs a writing credit and seeks to get their credit in a fun, relaxed classroom environment.",
    "If you're looking for a writing credit, definitely yes. You're not writing a basic \"how this author argues their point\" essay. There's a greater freedom in writing your own creative pieces."
