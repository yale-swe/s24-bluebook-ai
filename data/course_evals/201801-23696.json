    "Very few, but I appreciated the opportunity to listen to spanish",
    "This course taught a lot of medical knowledge and focused on spanish writing skills.",
    "Developed my writing and reading skills in Spanish while expanding my vocabulary.",
    "great course",
    "As someone who knew almost nothing about medicine, MedSpan was the perfect opportunity. There were great readings, comprehensive and interactive work in class only helped accentuate it. I also learned a lot with my comprehension - my writing got much better as we turned in a few pages of work every class period - feedback was great too.",
    "I gained knowledge of medical topics, practiced a lot of writing and reading of articles, and practiced my speaking with the presentation.",
    "I was able to learn about the etymology and treatments of a wide variety of medical illnesses and diseases. I was also able to learn the specific spanish medical terms for these.",
    "I was able to further my Spanish skills in general as well as my medical knowledge in a broad range of topics and how to address these topics in Spanish and how these topics are different from the US in Spanish speaking countries.",
    "My Spanish improved and I learned a ton of new medical vocabulary. I also learned a lot about different illnesses and treatments and about the medical professions generally.",
    "I improved my Spanish vocabulary, writing, and reading skills. I also developed a better understanding of various medical disorders.",
    "I learned about many different diseases (mental, physical, chronic, acute) in Spanish, including the etiology, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment.",
    "Plenty of medical-Spanish vocabulary\r\nHow to write a article review\/summary\r\nHow to deal with difficult medical questions\/situations (in Spanish)"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Not enough speaking opportunities",
    "Sometimes boring lecture, but appreciated that it was a stress-free class.",
    "Strengths are the professor and topics. Seora Carreras is an incredible Professor. The only weakness are sometimes the writing assignments are repetitive.",
    "teacher is superb",
    "Strengths = Sra. Carreras. She is welcoming and really helpful with feedback, but also definitely never made me feel scare for anything. I loved coming at 9 AM! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses = sometimes, it was a little unorganized and it took a while to figure out what was the plan - nobody knew what the assignments of the week would be until the Saturday before, which meant some weeks were a crunch because I couldn't plan.",
    "The course is very interesting and engaging, but the daily writing assignments felt very repetitive.",
    "The big strength of this class is that it covers almost any medical topic you can think of; the course material is also very easy to understand. \r\nThis class could improve by having more oral discussion with students in the class.",
    "I thought one of the strengths of this course was that the work load was very reasonable and therefore students were able to engage with the course material without feeling stressed out or resentment towards the course.",
    "The grading of this course is extremely fair. The material is interesting, and relevant to anyone interested in human health. However, the course material is presented very lecture-style even though it is a small class, and this can sometimes be unengaging. There is not as much opportunity to practice speaking in Spanish. That said, Profesor Carreras is a lovely, kind person who is very eager to help her students.",
    "Strengths: The topics were very interesting and engaging, and Professor Carreras is such a lovely, kind, and encouraging professor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There weren't any formal assessments, which gave students less motivation to retain the information taught (though it shouldn't be this way, it is unfortunately seems to be the case for classes without tests\/quizzes).",
    "Strengths: manageable workload, wonderful professor, dynamic class activities\r\nWeaknesses: same homework type every night (article summaries)"

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Good for stress-free class.",
    "Yes, it is a more interactive way to practice your spanish: by learning interesting content.",
    "Absolutely. Seora Carreras has greatly improved my Spanish speaking capabilities and I would love to take another class with her.",
    "yes teacher was the best",
    "Absolutely. Take it; you'll improve any level of your Spanish.",
    "Yes, especially for premed students, I think this class would be very useful. Even though I am not premed, I found this class to be very interesting and fun. I learned a lot of interesting information and felt like I got to practice my Spanish a lot, especially my writing.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this class to other Yale students. This class involves a lot of writing each week which greatly helped improve my comfort when writing in Spanish by the end. Professor Carreras is also incredibly approachable and overall knowledgeable on the subject.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! Great topic, great teacher, manageable, and Spanish language credit!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The classes are fun, the workload is totally manageable, and the students learn a lot of Spanish medical vocab.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as a way of fulfilling L5 Spanish requirement and getting a bit of Spanish practice every week. It is interesting, but not the best way to improve Spanish skills.",
    "I would! It was an engaging and fun way to continue practicing my Spanish, which I hope to continue using into the future.",
    "Yes! The course is a manageable way to brush up on your Spanish vocabulary, but not a way to become a medical-Spanish genius. It is an enjoyable class environment, with a wonderful professor."
