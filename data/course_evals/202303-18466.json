Therefore, we were evaluated on our ability to perform tasks without any instruction on how to do them\r\n\r\nStrengths: \r\n- Professor's sense of humor\r\n- Multiple problem sets to practice",

                "I would because it's necessary for the sequence, but I've heard that the class is notoriously hard and doesn't necessarily help prepare you for the quant exam, so I would tell them to take it even though I'm not sure how important it is",
