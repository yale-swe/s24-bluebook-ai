No matter what we were looking at I was able to practice the skill of using multiple perspectives to analyze it as well as putting myself in the shoes of the author. I got to practice writing and got feedback and I learned just about what its like to take a humanities class at Yale. I also learned about my access to the many places like libraries and galleries.",

                "I went from not knowing how to write in an academic setting to really being able to write with much more confidence. I learned a lot about the writing process through actually doing it so often. This course has a lot of writing assignments, but this practice pays off. I also learned a lot about varying cultures as well as different forms of media and writing. I learned a lot about love, the self, and how love impacts one's self. I also learned much about sexism and the course greatly opened my ideas on how women have been treated in the past and how that impacts how they are treated today. It was extremely informative and I truly benefitted from the course. I also developed skills in conveying my thoughts more coherently through writing -- though I am definitely still working on this. Additionally, I learned about the collaborative element of writing, which included (but was not limited to) figuring out how to access writing partners, set up office hours with TFs, and reach out to classmates for peer editing. I discovered how you do not have to do classes on your own, and that mental health, empathy, and compassion are of high importance in all lines of work and all settings.",

            "comments": [
                "This is both a strength and a weakness  we were exposed too many different works very quickly. It couldve been helpful to spend more than one class on some of the text that we had to read because I felt like once I actually understood it we were onto the next thing. This was a demanding class because a lot of reading had to be done before every class. If it  were slightly less demanding I would have been a little more engaged. A weakness was the class-size: It was too big and it was hard to participate at any other time other than the small group discussions.",
                "It sometimes feels too over the place: there are a lot of thinkers and a lot of ideas covered in a week, so they sometimes feel disconnected.",
                "The content covered in the course was very interesting and consistently made me consider perspectives I hadn't encountered before. The professors and teaching fellows were very approachable and engaging, and made sure to support us while also challenging us intellectually.\r\n\r\nWhile the common thread of the 'self' was not always seen, this did not take away from the quality of the course. However, the class size was too large for a seminar, and the discussion sections were an optimal size.",
                "The lecture style class that got split into small groups was a very interesting dynamic. I felt the class size was too big, even after the groups were split up. It felt like there was too much of a disconnect between the students because of how large the class was. The professors did a very good job of getting to know each student well, and I think that greatly aided to the productivity of the class. At times, I do think the lecture at the start of class went on for too long, and that the breaking up into the smaller groups would have been more beneficial.",
                "The syabus was great. However, I wish that we knew how the texts related to each other.",
                "It is well organized and clear what is expected, which is a strength. However, a weakness is reading entire books or very lengthy readings to only discuss them for 1 class period.",
                "The strengths of this course are the professors -- Dr. Ramachandran and Professor Marta. These professors are outstanding. They are extremely engaging and understand how to connect to students in a way that heightens the learning of material that can date back to even Aristotle. Another strength would be the use of their teaching fellows. I had Francesca Beretta and she was absolutely astounding. The use of the TFs made a large seminar feel much smaller and provided that seminar element of small discussion in which people feel more comfortable sharing and exploring ideas. Another strength of the course is the use of lab on Fridays. The lab aspect of this course made it more engaging and more exciting all around. I really looked forward to it and when we had writing lab, I fully saw improvements in my writing from our lab discussions and presentations. Additionally, lab just kept that train of curiosity alive throughout the entire semester. A weakness of the course may be that a lot of material is covered but not all the material was discussed as indepthly as most of the students would have liked. I know this fact was discussed among myself and a few other students repeatedly throughout the semester. But this large spread of material covered is also a strength of the course, so I would not change a thing.",
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed all of the texts and films we engaged with this semester. I think the professors succeeded here in their goal of deconstructing the Western canon and bringing in lesser-known and -read texts. I appreciated the context the professors brought to each text, and the discussions were intellectually stimulating. My close-reading and analytical skills really improved through this class. Some of the collections visits, particularly those at the Beinecke and the conservation labs, were especially fascinating. Weaknesses: to me, the class could be improved by reducing its size. I thought that ~40 people was a little large for a first-year seminar, although the class is high-demand, and it made me more uncomfortable participating in the large group discussion or reaching out to the professors. I did appreciate the time we spent in smaller discussion sections during class. Another weakness was the writing labs--I enjoyed learning about writing, seeing examples, peer-reviewing, and the opportunity to meet in office hours, but I felt that we spent more time than necessary to transmit the material learned. Also, the collections visits were hit-or-miss; a few of them, especially those over Zoom, were not as engaging, although there were some that I really enjoyed.",
                "This course had a pretty hefty load of readings, but nothing that was not manageable. Being a writing credit, there was essentially always a writing task to be working on, but the pace at which they were assigned was very doable. There was a lot of freedom with these assignments, allowing students to explore any topics that they pleased.",
                "The course is too big to be a first year seminar. While the \"break out groups\" did help a little, we lost probably around five minutes every class trying to organize and reorganize ourselves into those groups, and I would have preferred that time to be more time with the professors, who are the main strength of the course.",
                "The professors and TFs are incredibly knowledgeable and are extremely understanding of the fact that this is a course comprised of first years with a variety of writing backgrounds. Every takeaway from the lectures felt important, every class felt substantial content-wise, and every text we had to read or film we had to watch felt meaningful. I especially enjoyed small group discussions and collections visits to the Beinecke (this is by far one of the best parts of the course, actually -- I found the archives fascinating!) The only struggles I experienced were that some of the texts were difficult to digest and discuss thoughtfully, especially at 9 am.",
                "I really liked the reading and conversations, but sometimes I felt a bit overwhelmed by so much conversation in such a big group.",
                "In theory this class is wonderful. Its under the umbrella of six pretty good ideas, and we meet weekly with the rest of the larger class for the Friday lab. Unfortunately, the grading is obscure and largely depends on the quality of your teaching fellow - essentially random. Also, content wise it wasnt always clear how things related and as the semester progressed fewer students did the reading since we had gotten so much and only talked about bits and pieces of what we were given",
                "Strengths were the small group discussions with my TF and also the dynamic of the professors \r\n\r\nThe weakness was at times the Friday labs because they lacked relevancy to what we were doing in class",
                "Strengths: the two-person teaching team was incredibly effective for this course, where each professor built on the thoughts of the other. As an immigrant and women of color, the diverse syllabustaking us from post-WW1 Manchuria to the hot summer afternoons in Alabama to the favelas of Brazilfelt refreshing against high-school's white-male-dominated readings. I also felt that the incorporation of different types of \"texts,\" especially film, allowed students to practice analytical skills across all genres.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: at times, the reading loads were heavy to the point where students read for comprehension of the plot rather than deep understanding of the different selves at work or enjoyment of language. Also, I felt that the layout of each class could improve: we would speak extensively about our initial thoughts, then explore the context of the piece, with only a fraction of time in small group discussion, and then we would have to go overtime so that the class could regroup. I think starting with context, jumping straight to small-group discussion, and then circling back as a class would allow for the deepest analysis.",
                "I liked how flexible the curriculum was and how we could really personalize our essays and write what we wanted",
                "This was what I hoped for in a first-year seminar - not only was I provided an intensive on writing that I feel has set me up for the rest of college, I also was deeply engaged in the media we were learning from and I appreciate the diversity of authors and perspectives. Through the Friday labs, I feel much more familiar with the resources around Yale and found the library and museum visits especially meaningful and impactful. A smaller class size could have helped optimize the one-on-one relationships with the professors and helped foster stronger relationships with more people in the class, but having the discussion groups and a specified TA helped compensate for the large seminar class size.",
                "Strengths: enthusiastic and dedicated professors that make class fun! As a first semester first-year, they were so welcoming and made writing at Yale less intimidating. Weaknesses: the class was marketed as exploring different models of selfhood but we more so analyzed different sources without necessarily considering selfhood at all.",
                "The course was well-organized and engaging, and the professors + TFs were extremely welcoming and encouraging. More specialized work during the Friday labs would have been nice, but I really enjoyed having the opportunity to sit and work with other 6PGX students.",
                "strengths: lots of writing\r\nweaknesses: the class wasn't the way it sounded. i thought we were going to explore our identities through \"six pretty good selves\", but we didn't.",
                "There was a lot of reading and I felt like we didnt dive deep enough into each reading. The way we discussed could be more facilitated and I actually wanted the professors to lecture more than we talked because they were so knowledgeable and insightful.",
                "Often, 6pgs felt inconsistent. It was a strange course, especially when it came to the labs. We'd spend time in class reading philosophy or 16th century poetry but then take a trip to Yale's West Campus and look at furniture and other artifacts, which was cool, but when you then come back to class and completely switch gears to something completely different, it doesn't make sense. I don't know. It felt odd to be reading Descartes and Augustine and then write an essay on an object from the YUAG  sometimes the class just didn't make much sense. I think it is a wonderful idea for a course, and was incredibly excited to take it, but was overall disappointed.",
                "Strength: the professors, with their diverse selection of the texts, ensured there was something intriguing and engaging for everyone.\r\nWeakness: Too many texts given the time constraints of the class. The texts are rich in content, and cannot be truly appreciated in just 1.5 hr.\r\nAlso, the course is only offered in Fall."

                "Definitely. This was more than a class it was an experience and I learn a lot about the world around me at Yale, and even places far away from me. In reading about all these selves I had the opportunity to find how these texts applied to my life and I looked at my own relationships and identity. This class didnt change who I am or anything, but I felt that I had the space to question everything that I knew to be me and to be true.",
                "I would if the student is interested in reading from several literary traditions. However, if the student is interested in different aspects of selfhood, i would advise a philosophy class, as this one didnt cover those topics in depth.",
                "Yes! Not only is it a great introduction to the humanities and literature, but it is also a good way to get to know Yale's resources.",
                "1000% recommend for anyone in any major. Your mindset is broadened on so many topics and this class has diverse content that we cover. Additionally, the discussion was fruitful since students, TF's (KARINA WAS THE BEST), and the professors were equally engaged in the content we discussed.",
                "Yes!!! I would definitely recommend this course to any and all students. I always wanted to attend class, and if you were sick, the professors were extremely nice about allowing you to be online that day in order to still gain value from class but recover from your sickness. All around, this course was extremely exciting and I learned so much about myself and how people and our literary elements work. I discovered a new relationship with writing that is much more exciting than the relationship I had with it prior to the course.",
                "Yes, especially if they are interested in the humanities. Overall, the course was a good experience for me and offered many opportunities to grow.",
                "I would 100% recommend this class to another student. The coursework is all incredibly interesting and you will be able to find something you love in everything that you read. Not only that but the myriad of texts allows you to understand more of the world because they are all so diverse. Finally, the instructors and TAs are incredible. The dynamic that Professor Marta and Dr R share makes every class enjoyable. Their banter when explaining concepts and assignments was one of the many reasons why I enjoyed coming to class. Moreover, the TAs always provided support and clarity in their feedback, helping students to grow and encouraging them in that process. Overall, this class felt like a little family and because of this discussions were always a place where we could share our opinions and open ourselves up to learn unashamedly.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but I would be sure to give the disclaimer that it doesn't feel like a seminar because it is so large.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! The lectures are extremely compelling, equal parts moving and humorous. The professors and TFs are amazing. The open-ended writing assignments allow you to spearhead your own writing journey. Writing the final paper felt empowering.",
                "I would recommend this course in a heartbeat because it exposed me to new and interesting schools of thought and philosophies. This class basically rerouted my brain in the realm of the humanities and expanded my knowledge ten fold.",
                "It depends. See above - depending on your TF. If you are in love with the humanities then sure. The essays do not always correlate with class discussion.",

                "I would recommend this course to any writer who has diverse, wide-ranging interests in the humanities. Your perception of yourself and how you fit into society will change drastically after this class.",
                "yes - but it is a lot of work and a lot of essays",
                "I would recommend this course to another first year student coming into Yale. I would explain that even though the course might have a higher workload and in-class time than some of their other classes might, the foundation it provides on writing is worth the work as it sets you up for further writing in college. The professors are also excellent and their insights always pushed me to think harder about the media we were analyzing.",
                "Yes, if you are looking for a class similar to AP lit. Prepare for a lot of analysis and conversation. Also, the seminar is very large and not necessarily an intimate environment. However, the professors cared so much about the students. One day, one of the professors came up to me and asked how I was doing, and then invited me to office hours just to talk about how the semester was going. Going to the Beinecke and West Campus Art Gallery was also fun.",
                "Yes - The course's curriculum was both interesting and useful for future studies in the humanities or in general, and the professors + TFs were great.",
