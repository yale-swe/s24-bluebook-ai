ENG 114 with Professor Misgen covers everything you need to succeed in classes at Yale and beyond: from citation format to creating a compelling claim and using complex evidence to sustain your argument. Not only have I learned how to read and debate complex academic scholarly works, but how to effectively interpret them and formulate my unique arguments and perspectives through writing.",
                "I learned how to conduct academic research and to time manage, as well as the amount of work that goes into writing research papers in the humanities.",
                "I developed my skills in the basics of essay writing. I learned and developed all the essential components of an essay, and I'm more comfortable writing one moving forward. Also, I feel more knowledgeable about the content material: the politics of pain. My ability to speak and contribute in a group/ discussion setting improved.",
                "I became a much faster reader and writer! The \"textbook\" that the ENGL 114 classes follow is short, straightforward, and helpful; it gave me better language to use when talking about my own writing.",
                "I found this course to be very helpful in further developing my writing skills. I learned to formulate more complex arguments and expand on them throughout longer pieces. I also felt this course was a good introduction to college writing, while at the same time allowing me to become comfortable sharing my ideas in class without being forced to speak when I was not ready.",

Interesting texts. \r\nWeaknesses- drafts and final drafts almost every week, so a heavy workload. The grading rubric makes grades weird and hard to improve.",
                "I do not have any weaknesses to list. At first, getting used to the terminology and writing techniques such as claim, warrants, motive, \"so what? who cares?\", piggybacking,  etc., was a bit challenging. However, Professor Misgen reviewed these concepts with us several times during the semester and promoted activities that made me finish the course comfortable with the terminology and strategies of academic writing. Also, The Politics of Pain was exceptionally well organized, the grading was very clear, and the feedback was constant and very helpful!",
                "The readings were all very good and built upon each other as the semester progressed. Essay feedback was also very helpful. The only weaknesses was some essay topics being weird or difficult to understand.",
                "This course is well-paced; the four papers build naturally upon each other, and the readings were consistent without being overwhelming.",
                "This course was very well organized and I knew what was expected of me at all times. If I ever had any doubt about anything, I was always able to reach out to my instructor (Sara) and she would be more than willing to help clear up any misunderstandings."

                "I would recommend this course to other students if they want to improve their writing skills. It's going to be a lot of hard work and rewriting your essays because your first draft most definitely will not be your final draft. There are a lot of research skills you build, and this class definitely prepared me for any challenging writing intensive class.",
                "YES, YES, YES! Take this class. It changed my perspective on life, and the professor is absolutely incredible. She always ensured everyone was comfortable in class, was very understanding, and worried about us as students who were (mostly) getting used to Yale. Also, if you do not come from an Anglo-American education system, that's one of the best classes at Yale to develop your English writing skills. When I started this course, I had never written a paper in English (or taken a class taught in English, lol), and now I feel extremely comfortable doing it, using complex sources, making compelling claims, and all). Absolutely take this class!!!!!",
                "I would recommend this course to a student if they enjoy an intellectual challenge and are able to manage a considerable workload, Professor Misgen is lovely and super understanding but if you like creative writing/free writing better, I would take English 120",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend an ENGL 114 course in general, but I would also suggest this specific one. It strikes the perfect balance between teaching students how to improve their writing along with presenting an interesting subject matter. The readings can be dense, but the discussions are always helpful in clearing up any gaps in understanding.",
                "I absolutely recommend this course to anyone! Especially if Sara is teaching, but the curriculum is pretty standardized, so the experience will probably be good in most sections. The workload is manageable, and the course definitely builds skills in reading, writing, and seminar-style discussion in the least painful way possible.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The content was incredibly interesting throughout the whole semester and I felt that the assignments were do-able and did not require an extreme amount of time out of my day. I also found the papers to be engaging and I constantly felt like I was learning something new."
