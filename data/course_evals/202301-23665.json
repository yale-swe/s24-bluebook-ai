                "This course could only be improved - it was the worst course I have taken in years. Everyday we completed a worksheet which taught us nothing and could not have been less interesting. Everyday could have been asynchronous. Professor Glenski never taught us one skill, we simply filled out the sheet as a class and would leave. It was truly a waste of 50 minutes.",

It was the worst class I have taken in a decade and while I believe Spanish 130 could be a good class, it certainly cannot if Sarah Glenski is the professor. It was incredibly boring, taught students nothing, and was graded extremely harshly.",
