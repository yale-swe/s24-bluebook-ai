                "Professor Anderson has a lot to teach but this class is not a seminar. It's a 2-hour lecture. There are no contributions from students and Professor Eli talks two-hours straight. There is absolutely no structure for this course and he does not follow the syllabus. There is no indication of when reflection papers due, the frequency of them, or the length that is expected. One time, we had three 6 page reflections due almost back to back and then had to prep for a 10-12 page midterm essay. Also, the information that Professor Anderson provides is incredibly repetitive. Lectures contained the same information every week and it didn't matter whether or not people did the readings. I think Professor Anderson has a lot of amazing knowledge and information to share but he needs a ridiculous amount of help when it comes to structuring this course. The DUS should also consider changing it from a seminar to a twice a week lecture as well.",
                "Professor Anderson has some incredible, illustrative stories. He does tend to repeat those stories a lot throughout the semester though and the class eventually becomes really repetitive. Professor Anderson also springs somewhat unreasonable assignments on you at the last second (example; write a 10 page paper due next week comparing an entire book you were to read for last week's class to another book you're supposed to read for next week's class)",
