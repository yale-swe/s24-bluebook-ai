    "lectures were a little slow, tutoring was hard to navigate because there wasn't a ton of instruction\/direction given during class or a sense of shared experience with classmates",
    "The tutoring is awesome and Professor Jaynes is great",
    "It's a mess lecture wise. There's so much potential and it's just kinda squandered. The class's analysis doesn't get deep enough, the work doesn't push any true grappling with the material, and class engagement is so low. This class would be better served as a seminar, reading academic papers\/legal briefs and\/or econometric analyses of issues in education policy.",
    "Unfortunately, the class has the reputation of not being very challenging. The majority of students in the class were taking it for this reason and as such lectures were only attended by the small fraction of the class (10-20%) who were actually interested in the material. I think this class could be improved by turning it into a seminar and selecting only the students who genuinely want to be there. Ironically, the most rewarding class days were when attendance was particularly low, and Prof. Jaynes abandoned the lecture format and instead turned class into a seminar-like forum for discussing the material. On these days, discussions were engaging and participatory. I believe this class would better serve students with this structure, and it would also be able to avoid the \"gut\" label.",
    "This class was very disorganized and did not engage in a high level of critical thinking.",
    "Organized. A lot of cases that are pertinent to class"

    "This is a great senior spring Credit D class.",

    "It's a gut but i have no clue what my grade will be at all. The assignments are weird hypothetical questions, they're not clear about what exactly they want in terms of responses, and quizzes were trivial at best.",
    "Depends on how serious of a class you want",
    "No. You do not learn very much and the class was very disorganized.",
    "Yes. Definitely was interesting to learn more on this specific topic."
