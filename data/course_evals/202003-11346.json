This gave me a better understanding of how new innovations affect the market, how firms can protect their IP rights, and how firms' decisions will affect the consumer. I also learned about the current technology-related trends in various industries (fintech, healthcare, music, auto, etc.). Topics that we covered include price discrimination, price competition, patents, copyrights, licensing, vertical mergers, durable goods, industry analysis, network effects, infringement, venture capital, etc.",

She is an engaging lecturer, explains concepts very clearly, encourages us to participate and ask questions, and holds office hours every week to help us with the homework. The topics are very interesting, the workload is manageable \/ relatively low (1 pset per week, 2 midterm exams, 1 group assignment), the exams are extremely straightforward -- everything on the exams is exactly what we already covered in class, and there are no tricks. I also really enjoyed the group project, which was an industry analysis. As a senior, this was the perfect class for me: low stress with interesting material. Weaknesses: none!!",

                "great course!",
                "The strength of the class were the assignments. Sometimes it was difficult to piece everything together just watching lecture, but doing the problems and applying what was learned made it much more digestible. The weakness of the class was the limitations placed on students, specifically regarding which area of innovation to study. We had a project where we worked in groups to explore different areas of innovation and how that would shape the future of an industry, but I think the class would be better served if groups got to choose which areas of innovation they would research. Or it would be nice to add another project where students write a 3-5 page summary of an area of innovation they are excited about and the ramifications. Giving students more freedom to apply what we learn in class to what they're passionate about would make it a little more engaging.",

                "Professor Chalioti managed to create a culture of cameras on, which I really appreciated. At the beginning of every single class, she asked us to turn on our cameras, and I think that this constant reminder really encouraged\/compelled everyone to do so. I would encourage other professors to give their students this constant reminder as well. In some of my other lecture classes, although everyone had their cameras on at the beginning of the semester, by the end, only a handful did, and it was as if the professor was talking into an empty void. This did not happen in Professor Chalioti's class. As a student, I know how desirable it is to turn off the camera during a Zoom call and just listen to others talk. However, I also know that when you do this, it is so easy to just zone out and maybe do other things on the computer or walk around the room. Im definitely a more active listener and participant when my camera is on. When everyone's camera is on, it makes the class feel more like an in-person class, and it makes the class more engaging. In Professor Chalioti's class, since everyone had their cameras on, it felt more like a community, and there was more class participation when it came to asking\/answering questions.\r\n\r\nProfessor Chalioti also stayed on the Zoom call for 30 min after each class, but stopped the recording first so that only the lecture, and not these 30 min, would be recorded. I think that this was really helpful because it gave students the opportunity to ask any questions they thought of during lecture, without the pressure\/nervousness of asking in front of the entire class. These 30 min kind of simulated a student walking up to the professor at the end of lecture, or walking with the professor back to their office after lecture, in order to ask questions.",
                "Professor Chalioti blocked off ~30 minutes after each class as an additional office hours. She also had virtual office hours on other days and made sure that she could be accessible not only for course-related concerns, but also for more general advising. She also blocked off the end of each class for student questions.",

                "Having recorded lectures is a must in the COVID-19 environment and something that I greatly appreciated. I would say that test taking practices need to be improved. The CTL recommended to Professor Chalioti that we have our webcams pointed at our desks while we take our exams closed-book. We also weren't allowed to print out our exams, so we had to look at the exam on our tilted-down screen all the while. I just felt this placed a lot of unnecessary stress on students. I took ECON 330 as well this semester, and Professor Mendelsohn made all exams open-note, which I feel is a much better approach."

The workload and intellectual challenge of the course was similar to that of many other econ courses. It is math heavy and very similar to intermediate micro, just with different applications. It is an extremely fair course, and Eva is a delight.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to a senior econ student as their seminar. Eva is the best econ teacher who gives very fair assignments and exams. All the psets can be found in her slides and she also gives review exercises that are almost identical to her exams. She really wants you to do well and to learn. It was pretty stress free. Just a few nights of grinding before exams and you're good. Very chill econ seminar with the best teacher. Take it if you just trying to get through econ with an easy seminar.",
                "Yes this is a great senior seminar for Econ majors!! I'm someone who is really interested in both technology and economics, so this course perfectly covered the intersection between those 2 topics. You'll learn a lot about patents, copyright, licensing, vertical mergers, price competition, the effect of technological innovations on various industries, how you can analyze all of these topics with mathematical models, etc. These are all relevant topics, especially since the rise of AI and antitrust cases are frequently discussed in the news these days. Professor Chalioti is extremely kind and helpful, the workload is manageable (1 pset per week, 2 exams, 1 group assignment), the exams are very very fair (there are no surprises at all on the exams). It's definitely one of the easier 400-level Econ classes, but the material is still interesting. Actually, if you've taken ECON 409 (Firms, Markets, and Competition) before, then there is some overlap between the 2 classes when it comes to the mathematical models, but you're learning much simpler versions of the models in this class (ECON 414), and you're applying them to scenarios related to IP and innovation. I didn't find all of the models super interesting, maybe because I recently took ECON 409 and Game Theory, so there was some overlap\/repetition for me, but I think the other cool topics of this class (patents, copyrights, licensing, technological trends, etc.), the fact that the class was low-stress, and the fact that the professor was so great, outweighed any of the cons. I would definitely recommend this class!",
                "Yes! It's an interesting subject and Prof. Chalioti is great. The expectations for the course were clear, and the problem sets were fair. I definitely recommend!",
                "Good class for those who enjoyed the more quantitative side of economics (if you like micro, game theory, etc), although there is also a fair amount of qualitative testing on the midterm and final.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to other students. Especially those who enjoyed Intermediate Micro and those who are thinking about working in Finance or Consulting. Professor Chalioti has put a lot of care into this course and it definitely shows!",
                "This is one of the better senior electives. It's very fair and doesn't require insane math or a ton of time. Be prepared for psets requiring about 5hrs a week plus a couple hours to review the slides. Tests were not unreasonable at all. There's a large number of problem types to master, but aside from that the course is manageable.",
                "yes! good senior seminar for econ",
                "Yes! It isn't a particularly onerous class (the workload is very reasonable and manageable), and the takeaways are interesting and pertinent.",

Professor Chalioti also breaks down the challenging economic concepts and is so willing to help. She really is invested in your learning and your success.",
