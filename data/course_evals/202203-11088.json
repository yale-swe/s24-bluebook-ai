                "This course is very interactive. Since its small classes it was very nice to get to know everyone and Orit really well. It was great for conversations and learning a new language.",
                "A major strength of this course comes in its ability to create a strong community given its small size. This makes it easier to engage and thus practice speaking, aiding in improving knowledge and fluency. A weakness of this course is the high workload due to meeting every day.",
                "It was overall a very good course; I especially liked the speaking focus. One small thing, I would say maybe give a little more opportunity to practice new conjugations before expecting students to know them.",
                "1. I enjoyed the variety of immersions we had throughout the week. Sometimes it was songs in class. Other times coloring. Other times an advertisement. Etc.\r\n\r\n2. I really loved the Quizlet vocal list. The audio, the organization, the exercises -- just fabulous!\r\n\r\n3. I liked how the exams were not intended to trick or trip us up. As long as you knew the subject matter, and reviewed the key lessons, a perfect score was easy. That felt nice! \r\n\r\nClass sessions were fun but not necessarily useful (i.e. I think I could have done well in the course even if I missed most classes). I think Orit knows this too -- she designs most of our time to be spent talking w each other, discussing. The main purpose was not to teach new content, but practice talking. And also get \"brief lectures\" on the modules. So it was like a chill space to practice Hebrew, not stressful where I had to jot down stuff for a test, neither too disorganized where I chatted the whole time.\r\n\r\nI didn't like that the groups always depended on where we were sitting. It made it monotonous at times. Only once Orit tried to shift us up, but she never sustained that. Mix the groups, that's funner. I also preferred competitions to just reading questions and asking each other -- but that's just the competitive side of me, maybe. Also, it is nice if we go through the binyaniim in weird order -- like, start from  then do  then , etc. To exercise our brain muscles a lil' more.",
                "I wish we had more opportunity to use the new content that we learned in class. Often, we'd learn a new family in a new tense, and then really only use it during the quiz/test. Overall, more structured conversation would be better, and I also feel that some students who were not learning were holding others back by being weak conversation partners. There should be an oral evaluation after L2 to permit moving on to L3."

                "Yes! The professor is amazing and the community you will become a part of is incredible. With both of these, the possibility for improvement in Hebrew increases significantly. However, that being said, a lot of what you get out of the course depends on what you are willing to put in.",
                "Yes!",
                "10/10. Or as the Israelis would say ! Please don't just stop at L2! (or your high school exposure to this beautiful language!) Anything with Orit would be such a chill 5th or even 6th credit! Take it!"
