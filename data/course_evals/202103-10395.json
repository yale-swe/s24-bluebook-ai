                "Strengths  students are presented with a broad range of material to engage with as ethnic studies majors\r\nImprovements  given the large scope of material, changes can be made to the syllabus that ground the material in students' lived experiences, home communities and the local history of ethnic studies in Yale / New Haven. Hopefully this makes for a more engaging and relevant junior seminar for the ER&M major.",
                "The opportunity for community was the greatest strength of this course. It's really meaningful to engage with and learn from ERM peers. I also really enjoyed many of the texts from the syllabus. I would love for class discussion to be a bit more student-led, though.",
                "The main strength of the class to me was being able to spend time with other people in my ER&M cohort and get close to each other. A lot of the texts and materials across the units were familiar to us in different ways, so it was really meaningful to get a sense of grounding in all of it together and do so in a very kind, positive, open environment. Professor Tran is so, so sweet and was radically open to our feedback and dialogue about improving the class as we went along."
