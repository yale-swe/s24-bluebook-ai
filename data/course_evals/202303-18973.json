                "I learned a good understanding of the history advanced industrialized economies in Europe and how politics interact with capitalism.",
                "I learned significantly about the differing political-economic developments of European countries since the post-War period. I gained a comprehensive understanding of welfare systems, political party competition, and tax systems. This course lays the foundation for folks interested in comparative government studies.",
                "This course does a deep dive on the development of European labor\/market institutions in the late 19th to the 21st century. We get to see where it started, and how it turned into what it is today.",
                "Learned about the evolution of labor relations and welfare policies in various European countries, as well as broader reasons for why policies and parties developed the way they did.",
                "I learned how to look at the world differently with the lens of the economy and culture within the country as motivation for certain policies. I also learned how to look comparatively between countries and now feel like I better understand the motivation for the actions of certain countries.",
                "This course was by far the best course that I've taken at Yale. Throughout Professor Mares's teaching, I gained an immense understanding of the intricacies and progression of the political and economic systems in Germany, Sweden, Japan, learned the distinctions, upsides, and downsides of the welfare systems in different countries, and examined what, retrospectively, should have occurred in recent notable world events, including Greece's 2009 debt catastrophe. Most importantly, I believe that, through this class, Professor Mares has given me to tools to further analyze the approaches that world leaders are trying to use to solve the most pertinent issues of our era - such as finding viable green energy solutions, addressing increasing migration in Europe, and more. Sam Dunham was a fantastic TF, described concepts extremely comprehensively, and posed questions in section that made discussion very fruitful and exciting. He was prompt with responses to questions outside of class, scheduled zoom calls for additional inquiries, and made himself as available as possible, even though he was simultaneously juggling his responsibilities as a graduate student. I have nothing but extreme positives to say about this course.",
                "Learned about the history of post-WW2 European capitalism and some modern issues in Europe, like the immigration crisis.",
                "I learned about histories of European markets, corporatist institutions, and levels of governance that varied between actors. I learned about financial and migration crises that occurred throughout history and why they happened. Also learned a lot about the formation of parties and a lot about policy feedback.",
                "I learned more about capitalism and its implications on European economic and social structures.",
                "Learned a lot of information about economic developments and social welfare in Europe, and how to comparatively analyze these differences by nation.",
                "Reading and communicating complex ideas effectively",
                "I learned a lot and thoroughly enjoyed this course. I learned about primarily the labor markets in Europe and how they have evolved. it was very interesting to learn."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: strong cohesiveness of course material, revisiting similar themes and chronological progressions of policy and political movements. Discussion sections were very helpful for supplementing lectures and building understanding of the material. Weaknesses: lectures often felt rushed, and it was difficult to tell if more attention should be paid to the political history or concepts. Lectures tended to cover much more individual nations' histories + examples, but readings and sections focused on political theory and larger movements.",
                "The professor is very knowledgeable about the topic, but she speaks very quickly so it is difficult to understand\/follow some of the things she says.",
                "Strength: Prof. Mares is fantastic; shes incredibly enthusiastic about the material, and insightful. Shes someone I would describe as switched on; although I will admit a little hard to follow at times. My TA was the same way, and I actually found myself learning just as much or more in sections as I did in lecture. \r\nWeaknesses: THIS SHOULD NOT BE A LECTURE. I cant explain how frustrating it is for me to see courses that should be taught as seminars end up as lectures, leading to bad results. I think this class is a prime example of that. We had around 15% turnout to lectures (granted, 9am Monday lecture is not a good idea to begin with). But it was such a shame because the enthusiasm of the teacher was limited by the class itself. In addition, I just feel like the material would have been more interesting in a discussion setting. Did I learn a lot about European institutions and theories for their development? Yes. Would I have enjoyed learning more if it wasnt a cramming exercise but instead a group discussion? YES.",
                "Strengths: fascinating topic that is really grounded in specifics; good balance of theory\/practical application (both 'what are these policies' and 'why did they develop that way'). Midterm\/final aren't too hard but allow you to synthesize what you've learned. No assignments other than two exams and weekly short discussion posts. \r\nWeaknesses: it's an early-morning lecture that very closely follows the PPT slides, which are posted on Canvas, so attendance\/engagement was pretty low. My discussion section, at least, was pretty bland.",
                "The lectures were very disorganized and the professor often went over the class time. The lectures were very word heavy.",
                "This course is great at making you think comparatively and giving interesting details about policies within countries and the reasoning for this. I will say a definite weakness of the course is that it is taught in a firehose way with lectures that are very hard to follow and are thick with content. Oftentimes in lecture I had next to no idea what was going on.",
                "Professor Mares is an incredible professor",
                "The primary weakness of the course was the timed exams. It was quite difficult to cover the extensive subject matter in depth in the short amount of time given in the exams.",
                "I think lectures were a bit rushed every class and it was difficult to get takeaways from some lectures because we skipped a lot of slides. Strength is that expectations for the midterm and final are clear, also strong course for teaching comparative corporatist models throughout time!",
                "I wish the material was better-organized; often I found myself struggling to prepare for exams. More exam preparation materials, like sample questions, would also be welcomed.",
                "Strength - Lectures very informative and sections were tailored to the lectures for review which is appreciated\r\nWeakness - Sometimes too much material (60 slides of full text was probably not necessary)",
                "One of the strengths of this course is its organized curriculum.\r\n\r\nOne of the weaknesses of this course is the overly dense lecture slides.",
                "Prof Mares is very knowledgable on the subject matter and the TFs make the material very digestible. An area of improvement is shortening the lecture slides, as at times they could get slightly overwhelming.",
                "Strengths: Good structure, interesting content, straightforward expectations\r\nWeaknesses: The content is a bit much at times, most lectures went over time and Mares would have to speak very quickly to get through it allI would suggest either reducing some of the details or leaving more for section discussions",
                "Strength: The material is very well structured. Prof. Mares and TAs are incredibly knowledgable. Though lectures are very fast-paced, doing well in this class isn't too hard so you can actually focus on learning, not getting grades. Weakness: 9 AM class.",
                "Pros: interesting material, low workload, manageable and interesting readings, \r\n\r\nCons: the lecture slides were almost always too long for the 50-minute class period, so we generally either ran a few minutes overtime, skipped slides, or moved too quickly; many of the lecture slides feature figures and studies from the 90s, which would ideally be updated where possible.",
                "strengths - tests were very fair \r\n\r\nweaknesses- the PowerPoints could have been organized better ie indent so thoughts are flowing better and it is easier to understand .  there was a Lot of random info we did not need to know too,"

                "Yes. This class is universally applicable to anyone interested in gaining a foundational understanding of why we have arrived at the current state of party politics and welfare systems. For economics majors, it's a very solid way to learn about the \"qualitative\" side of topics covered in Intermediate Macroeconomics (monetary systems, labor markets, welfare systems).",

                "I think it is an interesting concept and some of the overall ideas that we discussed were engaging, but overall I wouldn't say that the vast majority of the course was consumable content that was accessible for the students, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend this course.",
                "Yes! Very Euro-centric but I learned so much",
                "I absolutely would recommend this course to another student that wants to examine the complex interplay and progression of political and economic structures that affect our current era.",
                "Yes, very easy workload (no papers, just a midterm final and section participation). Also pretty interesting if you engage with the readings, as a PLSC student it was a new breadth of info for me which I really liked learning",
                "Yes, I would specifically recommend this course to students fulfilling requirements for the political science major.",

                "Yes! It covers important topics for anyone interested in understanding how capitalist systems developed over time and why",
                "ABSOLUTELY. Prof. Mares is truly an expert, lessons, though they are fast-paced, are structured very well and the readings are incredibly insightful. Very useful material, and not a stressful learning environment.",
                "This course would more appropriately be called Comparative Political Economy of Welfare Systems, or something to that effect. Despite this, I enjoyed PLSC 387 a good deal and highly recommend it if youre interested in connecting the dots between political structure and policy design. It happens to also be a very easy class, with light readings and easy exams. Prof. Mares is very kind, approachable, and cheery during the lectures.",
                "Yes, it opened my eyes to the various intersections between policy, voter trends, and the economy.",
