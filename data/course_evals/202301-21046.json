How could there be a good God in a world with so much suffering? Why is God hidden, if he does exist? If God exists, do we have free will? What place does rational/critical thinking have in religion? To what extent does science confirm or disconfirm the existence of God? AND SO MUCH MORE.). \r\n\r\nLearned how to write a philosophy essay, got to read philosophy for the first time, and have cool seminar discussions",
                "More than any other philosophy course, this one helped me develop my critical thinking skills. The sheer amount of good modern philosophy papers - as opposed to what might be considered primary texts (yes, the distinction is a bit contrived, but I'm sure that any philosophy major reading this will know what I mean) - that you read in this course, coupled with the variegated approaches to philosophy writ large taken by each of these authors, is enough to guarantee this. The phenomenal lectures, which are always clear, incisive, and fair-minded, only add to this. There are many other specific skills you'll gain or develop: the two that come to mind at the moment are a passing facility with modal arguments (many many many parts of PoR rely on these forms of reasoning) and the ability to read Plantingese (the language Alvin Plantinga writes in.)",

You hit all the major topics (problem of evil, divine knowledge, etc.) and Professor Pittard is a wonderful lecturer. \r\nWeaknesses: lowkey more work than you would expect. You do have to keep up with all the readings and juggle three exams and two papers. Finals season could be particularly brutal.",
                "Strengths - section is fun\r\nWeaknesses - online exams not fun since lots of people likely cheat and those who dont could be penalized by curve, tough to follow lecture sometimes, lecture notes a bit overwhelming",
                "This is a fantastically-taught course which covers a wide gamut of topics, in a clearly organized fashion. It serves as a wonderful introduction to the topic, while the papers and sources discussed are themselves of high philosophical merit. Prof. Pittard is highly skilled at devising thought experiments and other arguments to really emphasize the weak points (or the main point) in a certain argument, and that is in itself a master class.\r\nIt is very apparent that there is simply too much to cover in too little time. I find that the course would be greatly improved if it were split into a two-course sequence, which would allow for a) not skipping any material and perhaps adding some important things, at the discretion of the professor, b) really opening up the floor to questions and facilitating discussion/debate in lecture (I know, I know, that that's what section is for, but section focuses mainly on the readings, while in lecture sometimes we introduce ideas and arguments, no hint of which is given in the readings [e.g. Boltzmann brains, axiarchialism, if I'm not mistaken]).",

This is not a course for those who value practical applications of philosophy. The arguments are interesting, but highly abstract and it can be difficult to ascertain how these arguments are relevant to practical applications of philosophy. Lectures also tend to be highly abstract and they can be difficult to follow without some exposure to philosophical metaphysics.",

Pittard lectures are fire and his notes are a national treasure. It's an absolute metric ton of reading (and it's the philosophical kind), but your philosophical acumen will develop in proportion to the reading (it's mostly 20th century philosophical papers, which train your brain to think in a way that most philosophical primary texts don't.",

                "If it is interesting to you and you think you can keep up with readings then yes (about 30-40 pages a week but pretty dense Philosophy reading)",
                "Absolutely! It was interesting and challenging.",
                "Absolutely, I think the course is structured well, allowed for me to understand the major concepts of religion, and with a little improvement to the lectures, I think I would recommend the course to all students interested in religion.",
                "I definitely would. This was one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale. I'm not a philosophy major, but I took the course because I'm genuinely uncertain about the existence of God, and I wanted to understand what others have thought about this question throughout the ages and frame my thinking within this philosophical context. This course did exactly thatand also taught me the basics of epistemology and helped me think more rigorously and precisely. Do be aware that this class has a slightly higher workload than other classes, mostly because 1. the readings are very dense and 2. the class is structured in such a way that you kind of have to do the readings thoroughly to do well in the course. But honestly the workload made me get more out of the class, and the grading is pretty reasonable, so don't be scared away. This class is only taught once every few years, so if you have a chance I'd highly recommend that you take it while you can!"
