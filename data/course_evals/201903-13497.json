   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about social change in contemporary Britain and how this change was reflected in the literature. We read a lot of interesting and important works, and I learned a lot about how literature is useful in understanding the way social alienation affects lives and families.",
    "I learned how to take the context in which the author was writing in account when I read. I also learned how to question why characters make certain decisions within the works or why they lapse into certain patterns. Authors rarely include details arbitrarily. In this class I learned how to press on those details.",
    "In this course I read a lot of really exciting literature, which gave me a new perspective\/ knowledge\/ awareness of british fiction and drama (with a distinctly feminist and postcolonial lens). I feel like I gained a real understanding of the history of Britain in terms of its literature and film.",
    "A considerable insight into the effects of class, race, and gender on contemporary Britain and how fiction was able to reflect the various problems and contradictions of these changing times in a way that allowed both outsiders and British people to better reflect on their society",
    "This was a real crash course in understanding 20th century Britain, but from a literary rather than historical perspective, which gave us a unique idea of the situation. I learned a lot about the social background and repercussions of literature.",
    "Developed close reading and writing skills in this course. Learned about changes in British attitudes towards race, class, gender and nationality in the 20th century."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I course has really interesting texts and discussions, I also found the final paper very valuable although difficult.",
    "Professor Phillips did an excellent job of structuring the class and ordering the texts so that each work builds on the one that came before it. I also liked the system of presenting on the author before we discussed the text.",
    "I loved the syllabus, the weekly readings and the big final paper. I felt that reading + weekly discussions were really conducive to my kind of learning. The only weakness is that the class really depends on class discussion and who takes it, making things slow when people dont want to talk as much.",
    "The course was very well designed thematically and took the readers through a nice generally chronological selection of stories, around the themes of class, colonialism, race and gender. My only potential suggestion would be to add something even more recent to round out the year (perhaps as suggested reading rather than required reading).",
    "Strengths: well-organized, lots of engagement with an insightful and knowledgeable professor, very interesting readings \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: cant really think of anything",
    "The seminar setting fosters a high level student engagement and discussion. The broad selection of works gives a good overview of British literature of the time period. The long final paper is a bit daunting but plenty of time is provided to discuss topic ideas and plan."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I came into this course as someone who likes reading but  not an English major, and I loved it. The texts were really good, although sometimes quite intense, and Professor Phillips did a great job showing how the textual analysis connects to broader social issues. I really enjoyed the works, and enjoyed gaining a deeper understanding of them through the class discussions.",
    "Yes. If you are willing to put in the work, professor Phillips will support you along the way. The readings are great, but don't underestimate the 20 pager at the end. Get an early start and you'll be fine. Take the course.",
    "Definitely. The reading is amazing, and I loved writing the final paper. I think you have to really commit to doing all the work and seriously engaging, and if you do its totally worth it. You get to engage with amazing authors and a professor who knows a lot about them, and thats very cool.",
    "Absolutely, it is a very good seminar that explores a lot of literature in a way that feels more like a sincere engagement with a society through its literature rather than strange academic reflections or various instances of 'thus, Britain has xyz problem'. The takeaways were nuanced and reflection included stylistic ones (perhaps it helped that Prof. Phillips is a writer).",
    "Yes, definitely take this course. Its quite engaging and Professor Phillips has a lot of valuable insights to share. The readings are greatI actually enjoyed doing my homework. Be aware that participation is 50% of the grade, so if participation isnt your strong suit, youll need to step it up. Professor Phillips is pretty helpful and understanding about that, though.",
    "I would recommend this course to any students interested in British literature."
