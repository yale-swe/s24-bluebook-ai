                "The \"above and beyond\" grading component was highly arbitrary and often inconsistent. I felt like I was often guessing at what needed to be done to get full points on the problem set beyond what was actually specified or asked by the question.",
                "Strength: JDRS is incredible, lots of office hours and support, the class material is very do-able and not hard, you get to learn on your own pace/asynch\r\nWeakness: a lot of it is self-motivated and you should be on top of your own work (it's easy to fall behind and hard to catch up), and the engagement with the course is low (think of it as an online course), but honestly I enjoy that.",
                "I really liked how this course explored many different ways to analyze data, especially since many of these methods are important to social sciences. However, I found that the extremely theoretical explanations of the statistical/mathematical processes lost me greatly throughout the lectures. I also wish there was a comprehensive review of all of the different methods and when they're used. The change in the grading system (where to get 100/100 points on an assignment, you have to demonstrate that you went \"Above and Beyond\") was also extremely confusing, and neither the TFs nor the course manager could provide good clarification on this.",
                "Keep this course in its current asynchronous format forever. It is so well-organized for student learning, and functions so much better in this format than it would as an in-person unrecorded lecture. However, I wish we got more feedback on our homework  many of my projects got points off for not going \"above and beyond\", but still didn't get any suggestions for improvement.",
                "Strengths - super thorough, hybrid structure\r\nWeaknesses - I sometimes felt like the analysis methods got really complex and that I was mainly just learning how to code them -- I'd have liked to explore them in more detail",

                "Would have appreciated more one on one time in office hours - due to the large nature of the course, often spent most office hours waiting to ask my question (even if I arrived early) and feeling rushed.",
                "The hybrid format is great and it's very useful to be able to use our own data for problem sets. However, the course spends a lot of time on the details of various stats programs, which becomes a bit of a time sink when your preferred program isn't being discussed.",
                "Loved the asynchronous format and options, very accessible. Did not like the project peer grading, really pits students against each other in an unnecessary way.",

                "The workload is manageable. Particularly enjoy working in groups for both homework and final project as I feel like I learn more from discussions. Even though in depth understanding of the mathematics lying behind the different methods are difficult, they are not required to do well for the course. I can watch lectures at home but have a lot of office hours to ask questions. There is no weakness.",

I thought the grading was weird and confusing (this was the first year it was altered, so I guess it makes sense), which made me constantly unsure what my grade actually was.",
                "Given that the course could be taken entirely asynchronously, I thought it was incredibly flexible to the individual preferences of students and the office hours allowed for a high degree of assistance. No real recommendations for improvement.",

                "could cover more coding part",
                "The grading needs to be fixed. The professor can't continue to avoid changing the nature of the assignments (which takes work) by finding new ways to move the grade distribution to where he wants it post hoc. The whole \"grading out of 90\" thing was ridiculous and misleading. Also the code is basically just given to you for every assignment and you just have to copy-paste it and apply to your own data, which is kind of dumb.",
                "Different formats of taking this class are amazing.\r\nInteresting professor to learn from.\r\nTechnical knowledge but reasonable arrangement of the information.",
                "Hard to engage given the asynchronous format and group project. Possible to get by doing very little actual work.\r\n\r\nGRADING WAS HORRENDOUS. So unclear the entire semester how grading works. Every homework is graded out of a baseline 90/100 points, with 10 extra points awarded for \"Above and Beyond\" work. Some TAs told me the \"Above and Beyond\" section did not factor into my grades, others did. The final project is also graded horrendously. The comparative peer grading system makes absolutely no sense, and I don't think any real grading should be done by other Yale College students. Please make this clearer in future years. I would suggest eliminated the \"Above and Beyond\" section and grading the finals properly. Make the homeworks more difficult rather than circumventing proper grading through ridiculous tactics.",
                "Get rid of peer grading. Please. It's so unfair and ridiculous that 40% of your grade is dependent on how random other kids in your class grade your project (especially given that they have to grade it in direct competition to other projects).",
                "It was nice having an asynchronous way to cover material, but there was low interaction with the teacher and the course grading is not very clear in some areas. But, it was a good way to learn about all of the content.",
                "I think one of the strengths of this course is that it's not overly theoretical, which makes it very approachable for students who are not majoring in mathematics. Despite this, the course still provides a wealth of specialized knowledge, and the teacher provides a large number of examples during class, which makes the learning process enjoyable.\r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, I can't really think of any. If I had to suggest an improvement, it would be that the professor should offer more courses because he is such a fantastic lecturer! I would love to take more classes taught by him!",
                "I really like that this course can be taken in any of the 3 ways in or out of the classroom. The online materials were carefully prepared. There were plenty of resources for Q&A. However, there were a few small issues regarding the final project and peer grading.",
                "very detailed instructions, helpful ta&ula team",
                "Strengths are the unique topics which aren't necessarily covered anywhere else. Also the organization is top tier. Could be improved by more background about how all the techniques compare to one another, as it seemed like ordination factor analysis discriminant analysis, etc. all just did the same thing. Also some more theory.",
                "Strengths: JDRS is a great teacher. His lectures and recorded videos are awesome and explain things really well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The grading of this course was absolutely horrendous. At the end of the day, the grade you get in this class is dependent on how nice your TA is. To account for the high grades in past years, it was decided that the baseline grade for doing everything in the assignment would be a 90/100, and to get more it would be considered \"above and beyond\", essentially extra credit for doing extra analyses, formatting well, etc. You could put in hours doing extra work and still only get 1-3 extra credit points (which is what happened in my situation and is honestly really frustrating) because that's simply what your TA thinks you deserve. It's frustrating that the grading ended up being so arbitrary, and there was often not enough helpful feedback to be able to improve between psets.",
                "Great",
                "strengths: asynchronous and you can work at your own pace\r\n\r\nweaknesses: everyone gets perfect grades so the curve is broken pretty arbitrarily. Even worse, that arbitrary choice is made by other students since the final project is peer graded. A component of that peer grading even asks other students to compare your project to other projects, which means you could end up with poor or terrific outcomes due to chance. Additionally, when you are peer graded the grader has no idea if you did the project alone or if you got to work in a group of 5. Not really fair for your work to be compared to that of 5 Yale students collaborating.",
                "Strengths: Learned a lot. Pretty deep into the stats major and never heard of some of the tecniques mentioned in this class. It's a pretty low workload and can be interesting if you choose the right dataset to work with. Also, you can work in a group for every assignment... just make sure to choose the right partner(s) so you don't end up doing most of the work. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: To prefrace, the strengths outweight the weaknesses, still take this course, but I have a lot to say. The fatal flaw with JDRS courses is the way the final project is graded. Peer grading. Never got why it is done this way. Sure, it's a large class, but peer grading is a mess. Sure, it works since he takes the higher of the mean and median of your peer graded score, but the rubric is not speific enough. Some people might take .5 off point for a mitake, other's 3.  It is unstandarized... also there were several questions about grading on EdStem that were never answered. Speaking of EdStem... you have better luck of winning the lottery than getting a timely response on EdStem. Sure, there are tons of office hours that have very useful TAs, but EdStem is supposed to also be a place for questions to be answered. This simply was not the case. It seems like TAs forgot EdStem existed, especially during the last few weeks of the course. It's an absoulte disgrace, checking EdStem right now, of the last 17 questions only about 2 of them got answers from course staff. Really? 2 for 17? Looking like Russell Westbrook's shooting spilts. Many of them were questions that needed answered to correctly grade others projects. Spefically, about how to assign extra credit points in certain cases, what to do if the group project you are grading has no group name, etc. Please do better for future courses, maybe consider hiring a peer tutor/TA who's sole job is to monitor EdStem.",
                "The course can be entirely virtual which makes it very convenient to take on your own time. There are a lot of office hours with very helpful TAs.",
                "super good",
                "I thought that the material was incredibly interesting. I did not love that all the psets were group projects though - I ended up in a group of four thankfully, but I imagine that this would have been a very difficult class to do alone. I'm sure the standards are different depending on group size, but this would be really challenging for just one person!",
                "It's great that you can complete this course in whatever format works best for you but that also means it's not super engaging. Grading was all over the place. The fact that you got a 90 on PSETs if you did everything right was crazy but also, we kept losing points for not doing things we had done and repeatedly had to ask for regrades that sometimes went ignored.",
                "Strengths: love how there's different ways to engage with the course in person and asynchronously. The professional recordings are great. Weaknesses: the grading is wild... the 10 above and beyond points are so subjective and make no sense, and getting a regrade feels impossible.",
                "This course is asynchronous which provides freedom to the student. The student also has the ability to work in groups and choose their own data set for analysis, which was a strength.",
                "I don't think this course had any weaknesses. Strengths include the pacing of the course and the numerous office hours that were available.",
                "Well taught course and very useful content",
                "weak at actually teaching you the stat theory",
                "Strengths: clear modules and content\r\nWeaknesses: limited engagement or feedback on some assignments. I also wish final assignments were graded by JDRS/the professor or TAs and not as a peer grade.",
                "Think there was too much focus on outdated methods. Also wish there was more on what contexts to use the methods in.",
                "The course is very well organized, and the modules are easy to follow with plenty of example code. However, I wish the grading is more straightforward since 10 out of 100 homework points can only be earned for going \"above and beyond\", which makes it frustrating if you want to get an A in the class.",
                "weakness: the pset grading from our TA wasnt very fair a lot of the times. for instance, 6.5 points were taken on merely for graph titles. Feels like sometimes the TAs were just looking for nitty gritty things to take points off for. \r\n\r\nthe final project, which is 40% of your grade, is completely based on peer grading.",
                "I would appreciate more personalized relationships between students and the lecturer.",
                "Strength: you could work with a group. The online pre-recorded lectures were VERY good. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: if you try to go in person or watch the recording of live- lectures , you will learn very little.",
                "Strengths: This course is very flexible. The professor and TA are very helpful!",
                "I really appreciated the flexibility in the mode in which we can attend lectures (whether it's attending live or watching pre-recorded lectures). The slides were very clear and easy to follow along which helped tremendously in taking the quizzes. I also loved how we could work with our groups to do the HW assignments. One thing that I would suggest is that for the final project, sometime during the semester, it may help to assign a project proposal where we share information about the dataset we hope to use and what kind of statistical analysis we'll conduct. That way, students can be prepared far in advance to work on their projects.",
                "I love the flexibility of the course. the lectures were really engaging and interesting and the material is organized in a manner that is straightforward and easy to understand.",
                "Strengths: JDRS is an amazing professor and super smart person. He'll answer anything you need accurately and correctly, and going to office hours is super useful, even if you go to one hosted by a peer tutor. The class also is set up to make the final project manageable, as long as you find a dataset early and make headway on analyses through the homework (the project becomes pretty much copy-paste). The lectures and asynchronous style make it easy to understand and grasp the content at your own pace. It is very well-taught and well-explained, and you truly do get what you put into the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The grading is a little rigid and scuffed at times, with a single mistake bringing your pset grade down by several points at times. The fact that of the 100 point assignments, 10 points are subjective \"above and beyond\" points is a little annoying, and can make for extra stress and a lot more work. The work did start piling up near the end of the semester in terms of psets being due too close to one another, but JDRS did help adjust the pacing. By far the biggest weakness, though, is that the final projects are pretty much just peer-graded, and that there are places to compare other projects. Your grade depends on how other people do, which can make for some extra stress on the project.",
                "The biggest weakness is the grading. 10 points (out of 100) are allotted to effort, and it is extremely rare to get all 10 points, meaning you could do everything correctly on your pset and still only get a 90. Also, when points are taken off, they do not clarify exactly what your mistake was or how to fix it. A",
                "Strengths: some interesting techniques, ability to work with our own data, lots of resources clearly explaining/demonstrating  how to perform techniques.\r\nWeaknesses: lots of content packed quickly into lectures, some techniques felt not very useful/applicable for many datasets, easy to get through without gaining super strong understanding of techniques.",
                "Overall I liked this course! This course offered a lot of flexibility in how it was offered, like the options between prerecorded and in-person lectures, and the way it covered mutliple methods like R, SAS, SPSS, etc. \r\n\r\nI did personally find it somewhat frustrating that our assignments were evaluated based on extra effort, but I'm not sure this is a weakness - I have a tendency to do only what is asked, particularly for topics that I was already familiar and comfortable with, but the recommendation for extra effort meant that it kept me engaged with the content rather than phoning it in, so in an overall \"learning\" sense I think that was useful since it forced me to work a bit harder.",
                "Strengths: asynchronous. Weaknesses: Literally everything else. This is such an important topic for people interested in data science, and it would be greatly improved by more focus on theory and understanding why we are doing what we are doing instead of copying prewritten code and using packages with built-in functions. I retained virtually nothing of value because the material was so haphazardly taught with little focus on the underpinnings of the methods we were learning. It felt like a waste of a credit. Also, the curve is incredibly brutal with very arbitrary and peer-based grading, so it's not even like it's an easy A class.",
                "Strength: we covered a lot of stuff! So you are bound to learn about a technique that you personally find useful and will use later on. Weakness: Not a very engaging class in my opinion, but definitely interesting",
                "Strength: learn a lot of techniques and get to apply to your own dataset \r\nWeakness: you can take this class like almost entirely online and get behind on lectures very easily. Also the above and beyond points are a bad system",
                "Strengths: Chill class, JDRS is a great lecturer\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Grading is excessively harsh",
                "Strengths: you can go at your own pace, pick your own dataset, and everything was structured very well! I was able to take a lot from the course in the end.",
                "I think a highly motivated student will be okay, however its easy to fall behind on online lectures",
                "The course is structured really well.",
                "I love that the course encourages group projects. In previous stats courses, I have always worked solo. But this time I was part of a group that played a huge role in helping me learn. I also really liked how the professor offered many ways to keep in touch with course material and many options for office hours.",
                "I think everything is good",
                "Strengths: JDRS is a great professor! Really funny and engaging. I like that I have the option to watch lectures online. Weaknesses: some of the material is difficult to understand without seeing the previous lecture so if you don't keep up with lectures you'll fall behind quickly.",
                "Very flexible on your schedule. Psets are also only due every 10-14 days which makes it feel like a pretty low workload- as well as that you can do it in groups! I found there to be a lot of accessible office hours for when I didn't understand all of the class content or got stuck on the homework",
                "The course was holistic in scope and examples of code was very helpful",
                "Asynchronous was a huge help, especially in terms of being able to work at your own pace",
                "Strengths: JDRS is a great lecturer and clearly is really passionate about the course. The options for watching the lectures - in person, livestream, or prerecorded - made it really accessible. Overall I came away with a significant grasp of the concepts. Weaknesses: The TFs and grading were a disaster. Every assignment felt like they were desperately trying to find something to take points off for, even to the extent that they frequently marked things wrong incorrectly. The 10 points for \"above and beyond\" on every assignment made getting a perfect score extremely difficult, which was demoralizing and didn't promote good work. The quizzes had lots of trick questions and didn't feel like they were actually testing your knowledge of the important aspects of a technique.",
                "Some of the methods seemed too specific to be widely applicable in multiple social science research settings but otherwise a good course",
                "Strengths: Flexibility in carrying out the assignments and tasks. Lectures were extremely clear and JDRS is an exceptional instructor. Weaknesses: The R code for completing the PSETs is something of a patchwork and not all of the links currently work or work exceptionally well on all datasets. It was quite difficult to do the methods on our chosen datasets, meaning that sometimes we did carry out double work in figuring that all out. Also, the grading system, while transparent, did not feel very fair given that we were somewhat arbitrarily graded by our peers as opposed to the instructor on a shared metric of success. Another issue is that the feedback we received was usually very marginal, and being docked points for \"not going above and beyond\" again felt quite arbitrary.",

                "Yes! If you're doing the S&DS certificate, take this. For sure.",
                "Yes! Love JDRS! Take it if you're involved in S&DS in any capacity, or if you're experienced in R and looking to apply statistics to social science research.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. you will not regret taking this at all! however, beware of which TA you get. some TAs grade more harsh than others. also, like s&ds230, the final project is graded by other students. so, there is a high chance you will not get a great grade on the final project, but if you do well on the assignments, this shouldn't be a problem.",
                "Yes. Really useful for practice",
                "Yes for S&DS certificate or major. It's low stress and group work. No if not pursuing either of those things",
                "Definitely! Very useful and I'm quite confident I'll continue using these skills in my research.",
                "Sure. This course is very helpful.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in learning some multivariate statistics.",
                "Yes, especially if it counts towards your major. Learned a lot of programming techniques in a low-key way, and enjoyed the real life applications of the class.",

                "I wouldn't take it unless you need it for the major or certificate but if you do need it for one of those ya, it's pretty easy. The peer grading on the final project is so dumb and means that 40% of your final grade depends on how other students grade your exam (JDRS literally doesn't grade the projects, your grade is the median or mean of your peer graders' scores) so beware of that. But all in all, pretty interesting and not that hard and no exams.",

                "Yes!",
                "Depends on your tolerance for risk. Everyone gets perfect grades so the curve is broken pretty arbitrarily. Even worse, that arbitrary choice is made by other students since the final project is peer graded. A component of that peer grading even asks other students to compare your project to other projects, which means you could end up with poor or terrific outcomes due to chance. Additionally, when you are peer graded the grader has no idea if you did the project alone or if you got to work in a group of 5. Not really fair for your work to be compared to that of 5 Yale students collaborating. If you get lucky, this course can potentially be an easy A with low workload.",
                "Yes! You don't have to attend a single in person lecture, the class is low workload, and you learn a lot. One of the easiest classes in the stats major/",

                "super good",
                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend this course if you want to learn about multivariate stats methods, but not if you're just looking for a stats class to take.",

                "ABSOLUTELYY!!! This has by far been one of my favorite classes at Yale. I would highly recommend this course to someone who has taken at least one statistical course at Yale since I do believe that it really helps to have that foundation in order to better understand the concepts discussed in this class. Everything that we've learned is extremely applicable to the real world so students can benefit greatly by taking this course!",
                "Yes! This was the first course I took that introduced me to multivariate methods. The lectures were well organized and the notes were very thorough.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student only if they are willing to put in the time (and have partners to work with). The skills you learn in this class can be applied in many other contexts, which makes it suitable for anyone in any major. However, it can be frustrating having to do the project and homework by yourself or with just one partner, especially since it takes quite a bit of time to perfect the assignments to receive full-credit. The skill you learn, though, are very valuable and transferrable.",
                "Only take it if you need it for the certificate/major",
                "It depends. Its a decent data elective, similar in format to other JDRS classes. Some techniques are really interesting, and you can apply them to your own data, but dont expect to find everything interesting or applicable.",
                "Yes, I think this course gives students useful tools for data analysis that go beyond some of the basic methods covered in an introductory stats/data analysis course. I would recommend it not only to other students in statistics but to students in other technical fields who are interested in dealing with data.",
                "Absolutely not! Do not take this course thinking you will get an easy A because the grading is insanely arbitrary, with almost 50% of it being a project that is peer-graded! Do not take this course if you actually want to learn multivariate stats (which is a super important and interesting topic), because you will learn none of it. I retained nothing from this class and probably didn't even get an A. Again, do not take this class! I have no clue why everyone likes JDRS so much because he completely butchers such a fundamental topic.",
                "Yeah. Not the most fun or interesting, but okay all around",
                "Yes you learn good techniques but more so conceptually more than really knowing how to code these techniques",
                "Yes! This is a great class. Anything with JDRS is a must-take, since he's such a good teacher (go to in-person lectures! They aren't required but you won't regret it!). The workload is extremely chill and you get to work on everything in a group setting, which is helpful for the times when we blow by content very quickly. I just wish the grading was more generous (like they grade you out of 90 with up to 10pts extra credit but the denominator is 100, and for the final project that's 85), so even though there wasn't much work, getting an A kinda comes down to who your grader is (this year, per an end-of-semester email, a third of the class got an A but over 70% got at least an A-). Just make sure you do all the work on time and keep up with the class, and it'll be a very fun way to learn more stats that you don't really see in other classes.",
                "Yes! This was a great course and I would recommend it to anyone wanting an introduction to multivariate statistics.",
                "Yes, I think everything you learn is very applicable!",
                "Yes. The course is really helpful for those in social sciences.",
                "Yes because this very useful.",
                "Yea!! Really useful course. Broad overview of different types of multivariate analysis.",
                "Yes for expanding on R knowledge or specific application/prep for your own research. I used it for the S&DS certificate!",
                "Yes. However, I wish YSPH offered advanced AAME so I could've taken that instead",
                "Yes, would recommend to someone wanting to do statistics",
                "Yes, it is a great way to learn and practice some very important techniques and JDRS is an incredible professor. The grading/assignments were annoying but not a dealbreaker",
                "I would recommend this course to students who want hand-on experience with multivariate analysis and practices with R or SAS.",
                "Yes! This is a great way to rapidly pick up a bunch of important Stats skills, if you have any interest in research or data science. Having not done S&DS 230, it was also quite readily accessible to somewhat with a bit of an unrelated background in Stats. If taking it for S&DS then you must take it for a grade, if you are taking it casually I would recommend taking it pass-fail to alleviate any grading stress. Also, I would recommend finding a group you really trust and then getting started on the final project early and focusing more on making it clear and aesthetically pleasing than on getting the coding right.",
