    "I learned about the city of London throughout the century.",
    "Learned lots of specifics about the history of London and how to discuss historical themes in a college seminar setting",
    "As the name implies, I learned a lot about London (its history, its culture, its people). Admittedly, I went into the class not knowing exactly why I was taking itafter all, what good is an intimate knowledge of London as a city going to be for me as I go about the rest of my (personal and academic) life? Still, I am so glad I took this course. Although some of the readings were dense and dry, most were incredibly fascinating. I also improved my research skills, specifically in finding primary sources.",
    "specific knowledge of modern London including: food, fashion, planning, transportation, various immigrant groups\r\n\r\nlearned how to use the YCBA archives"

   "comments": [
    "Good wide reaching view of Londons recent history. \r\nOften class was not directly taught though and left excessively for students to interpret.",
    "There are many weaknesses of this course. The professor did not seem engaged during class discussions, the readings assigned had no correlation to our written assignments, and the professor never took the time during class to have writing workshops yet criticized our writings very harshly.",
    "I wish that the class had more learning elements rather than just do the readings and discuss them. It would have been nice for class to be led by the professor beyond just questions about the reading.",
    "Excellent course in terms of promoting engagement, every class is essentially a class discussion on the readings, which were very intriguing\r\nNo weaknesses in my opinion",
    "Strengths:\r\n- Most of the readings\r\n- Nice class camaraderie (does that count?)\r\n- Very interesting course material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Student-led to the point of not seeming like an actual class at all\r\n- Did not receive much feedback on writing (essays would be graded + corrected thoroughly, but most of it was left to seeing a writing tutor)\r\n- Weirdly gut-y but also not (workload is pretty light as in you don't necessarily have to do all the readings, but essays seem to be graded very meticulously, probably as they should be)\r\n\r\nNeutral:\r\n- Professor Conekin allows the students to drive the class discussions, but I really wish she would participate more! She's so knowledgable + seems like such a cool person that I wish I had gotten to hear more of her insights and perspectives throughout the course.",
    "Strengths- material is interesting and variable \r\nWeaknesses- difficult to engage in class if you are not the presenter",
    "This course covers a lot of interesting material and the freedom to choose your research topics is nice. The course might be made better by having more active participation on behalf of the professor.",
    "strengths\r\n- great low-pressure environment\r\n- relatively low workload\r\n- interesting readings\r\n- lots of self-direction and choice for papers\r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n- Prof. Conekin doesnt say much in class; only activity is discussing the readings which is student-led; I wish she shared more of her knowledge with us"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Would recommend to those looking to have a deeper understanding of London while at the same time not doing too much work.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course because it is not well organized and the course does not have clear assignments. The readings assigned were excessive and had no connections to our written assignments.",
    "Absolutely, was not a ton of work and really learned a lot, bonded with the other students in the class because of the seminar style\r\nProf. Conekin is great and very helpful in answering any questions you might have, especially about the midterm\/final papers",
    "Tentative yes? If you want to take a class about an interesting topic with an interesting professor, then absolutely. But I'd advise only taking it if you are already confident in your writing skills. Although there is not that much actual writing done in this course (2 short papers + 1 long paper), the grading seems to be harsh and skewed in favor of students who already have strong writing foundations.\r\nThis class also comes off as a gut (and for most people it probably is), but don't take it expecting it to be one. (Though you also shouldn't just be taking classes for the sake of getting an easy A, so balance out the two, I guess.)",
    "This can be a great 5th class and writing credit. Dont expect too much from Professor Conekin in terms of teaching, but she will provide great feedback on writing. This was overall a good experience, though, and was a good introduction to the History department."
