More importantly, I learned how to read and understand writing about syntax, and was pushed to learn to write about syntax on my own as well.",
                "I learned how to present in a linguistics class, how to read academic syntax papers, and how to write a formal syntax paper.",
                "In terms of course material, we started with a review of Syntax I and tree drawing, and then moved into discussions of locality constraints, which led into a discussion of Phase Theory. I think that the most valuable skills I developed were my reading and writing skills for Syntax. I now feel competent in reading primary research and responding to it."

                "Strengths: Jim Wood is a very knowledgeable professor; I still can't fathom how he just remembers the names of all those linguists and their works and the years those works were published. Interesting material (if you're into syntax). Syntax Jeopardy last day of classes was fun. Weakness: The Citko \"textbook\" was a little hard to grasp at times.",
                "The course is very fast and the readings are definitely required. I think the biggest strengths of this course are Jim's humor and flexibility. He slowed the class down when he could tell we were struggling with material, but still pushed us to learn the new content, and I found myself challenged, but wanting to understand the topics we were covering. The course is hard to keep up with when the rest of the school year gets busy, but that's not a weakness of the course itself. The one weakness I would note is that it felt like there was quite a short amount of time between the midterm paper and the final paper, so I felt a bit rushed in understanding the research I used for the final.",
                "Strengths: you learn A LOT and really develop skills necessary to meaningfully engage with syntax. Prof Wood is also super helpful, and it's clear that he always wants you to improve and understand.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Pacing -- I think there could have been more assignments due in the beginning, but I understand that there's just a lot to cover in this class.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Engaging readings and problem sets\r\n- Syntax news updates demonstrating what syntax research looks like\r\n- Helpful peer review/feedback system for final paper",
                "I found there to be a large learning curve as I had a year in between Syntax I and Syntax II. I think that there could be a better structured review section at the start of the course perhaps."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who has taken Syntax I and felt confident in that course. Even with that background, this course felt like a leap in difficulty to me, so the student should definitely also genuinely enjoy syntax. I left this course with a broader understanding of syntax and as a better linguist and writer, and I believe that other students would find this course equally rewarding.",
                "Yes, but only if you know you like syntax and are ready for a challenge. This course is really rewarding but also very challenging.",
                "Absolutely! Especially for syntax majors. It was very engaging and enjoyable and I feel much more prepared to tackle the senior essay.",
                "If a student enjoyed Syntax I and wants to continue to learn more about the field, I would sincerely recommend this course. This class ranked as a personal number one in terms of enjoyment of a course this semester, and the feeling of having the aha! moment hit when understanding a new model or representation of structure was second to none. The course challenged me to keep an open mind receptive to new ideas as my whole perspective on Syntax sometimes changed every time we met. As a class, we also discovered more effective scholarly paper-reading techniques and collectively worked on making our writing clearer and more compelling. I would take this class again if offered the chance.",
                "Only if the person was considering taking it for the major, otherwise I dont know how much they would benefit, or how worth it the class would be."
