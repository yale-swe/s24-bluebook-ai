I learned how to formulate ideas about these authors, discuss them with my peers, and ask questions. I learned also how to write an extensive (around 30 page) research paper on a political philosophy topic, which was incredibly rewarding.",

                "I really enjoyed the discussion of the course, but I do believe that the sessions can be more organized.",
                "I wish the discussions were more organized. Because there were students from different disciplines the discussion often felt scattered. I wish the professors commented on students' thoughts more coherently or in a way that combined everyone's ideas to the readings. Maybe one professor should lead the discussion each week instead of both just facilitating the discussion. I also wished that the secondary literature was better; the syllabus should have recommended secondary readings on the list. Lastly, I wish the feedback on the final paper was better.",
                "The syllabus was fabulous. Discussions could have been better structured with more clarity from instructors about the questions on the table.",
                "The choice of readings and the abundant support for writing the research paper were both strengths of this course.  I believe the course would have been strengthened, however, if we had focused more heavily on Democracy in America and Black Reconstruction in America as opposed to other writings by the authors, preferably reading all of both books."

                "Yes if they want a very grounded, real political theory class",
                "Absolutely. This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The readings, first of all, are amazing, and it's rare to be able to put Tocqueville and Du Bois in such close conversation. The professors are also incredible: they made insightful points, engaged students, and facilitated conversation. I loved that it was co-taught, because we could hear the professors explore thoughts with each other and hear different perspectives on the same question. The research paper, though daunting, was incredibly rewarding in the end. Everyone in the class was also very committed to learning and understanding the texts, which made for a vibrant seminar atmosphere. Most weeks, the only work is the reading and, based on which option you choose, your only assignment might be your research paper. There is a lot of reading, but it's doable if you treat it like the assignment for that class, and I would urge you to do so: this is a class where, as with many things, you get out what you put in. I really hope Prof. Oskian and Prof. Nakhimovsky co-teach a class again! If they do, please take it.",
                "I would recommend it for the professors and the texts.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student.  Tocqueville and Du Bois are enormously deep and incisive thinkers about America, and this course immerses you in their thought."
