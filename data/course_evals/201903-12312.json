   "comments": [
    "I developed strong skills in researching as well as time management with a heavier reading work load than I am used to.",
    "In taking this class, I believe I have developed a better sense of seeing thematic connections throughout history. History has lots of not-so-obvious cause and effect patterns that Prof. Conekin helped us learn how to identify.",
    "I gained a comprehensive knowledge base of the subject matter and feel very confident with the material we covered throughout the course.",
    "I developed a new lens in historical analysis.",
    "I gained knowledge on fashion trends in Europe from 1950 to the modern era, and the evolution of different types of clothing and how this was influenced by society.",
    "I learned a little about how fashions evolved over time and how they affected and were affected by culture and politics.",
    "I learned useful skills of annotating readings we had throughout the course and developed useful insights of research based skills.",
    "I gained a broader understanding of the history of modern western fashion, the styles and influences of impactful designers, and the interactions of fashion with gender, race, politics, and art.",
    "I learned a lot about Fashion history\/fashion trends throughout history and how they stemmed from events and cultural practices at the time. It was a good introduction to group discussion in a college format, and to presenting in front of the class. I also gained experience with doing my own research on a topic and writing an in-depth research paper on that subject."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I found the structure of the class to be very repetitious, which did make the class seem dull at times. I would prefer a variety of methods in teaching the subject rather than the presentation + discussion format for every single class. With that being said, I really enjoyed the guest visits from the 2 lecturers, especially the second one!",
    "The readings for this class were very interesting. Most students realized shortly into the course that it was not necessary to do the homework readings, as someone presented on each reading every class. I, however, always wanted to do them anyways, because I learned more that way and it was genuinely interesting material. \r\nAlso, you can tell Prof. Conekin knows a lot about this material and really enjoys it, which makes the class overall more enjoyable. \r\n\r\nThe readings did, however, tend to be on the longer side. Some days after reading for two hours I just needed to move on to other subjects of homework with more pressing deadlines\/obligations to know the information. \r\nIn addition, the class gets rather repetitive. Every class, someone would take 20-30 minutes to present on the homework reading(s), and then we would break up into groups and answer a couple discussion questions, before reconvening as a class and sharing our responses. This never really changed except for the occasional guest speaker.",
    "The entire course was based on student presentations and I feel that because of this we lost a lot of knowledge that our professor could of been sharing with us through leading discussions.",
    "A strength was that there were lots of opportunities for student engagement and participation, such as through weekly student presentations on completely different topics, so I was able to hear different voices and learn about different time periods and designers from each person. The weekly student presentations made classes very interesting.",
    "The course covers interesting material however the class was not engaging. Every class was a student presentation or a guest speaker. The professor would only speak when answering a direct question.",
    "The strengths of this course is its uniqueness and the way it taught the students the history of fashion.",
    "The range of reading materials and the consciousness of the course of the values and limitations of these reading materials was a strength. The presentation-basis of the course was at times a weakness because it led the course to be dependent upon students' efficiency and engagingness as presenters, which could be boring and unengaging, with discussions limited to fairly stagnant questions.",
    "The way the class was structured, it was the same activities each day. For most of the class, a student presented information from the reading that was homework. Then for the rest of the class, we discussed questions relating to the reading. Some may see this as a strength, others as a weakness.\r\n\r\nStrengths: The readings were very detailed and informative, often from prestigious writers (or even the professor herself). Students were given a range of experiences to start off their college career, from readings, presentations, in-class discussion, research, and paper writing. Students learned and understood a tremendous amount of information in a short amount of time. The professor very clearly was an expert on the subject. It also has some engaging experiences outside the classroom, in the Yale Art Gallery and the Center for British Art.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Oftentimes, the information we learned was repeated three times: once for homework, once during the presentation, and once during discussion. Discussion was often fact-based, rather than opinion- or connection-based. The structure of each day was repetitive, which some students liked and others didn't. As for the information, there was not as much connection or analysis; more factual information."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student. This subject of material is very specific and niche -- not something that one could easily learn without taking a structured class in it like this one. It's really interesting and not a super high-commitment class. Highly recommend.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it because it was very engaging and I really enjoyed the topics we explored.",
    "I would not recommend taking this course for those merely interested in fashion. I found that many students were dismayed to find that the course had a much more focus on analyzing the historical and social importance of 1750s to the present Western Europe and American fashion. It is a history course, so do expect to have to do readings and write papers.",
    "Yes, because you get a chance to research and learn on your own and share with others, while also being able to learn about different topics from other people.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was very interesting and I learned a lot. It is the most engaging history course Ive ever taken, and it helped me improve my research paper writing skills.",
    "No, I thought the class was dull and did not facilitate learning",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student because it was a fun writing and humanities class to take. It gave me a different perspective on things.",
    "It was a very interesting course and seriously explored the importance of fashion in a way that is often overlooked, so yes."
