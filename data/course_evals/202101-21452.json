If we could do a more formal/fleshed out journal club during hour long waits, for example, it might be a good way to continuously engage students with both hands-on and more conceptual work. Also, I wish that we had more time to do more comprehensive journal clubs, since we usually only got to discuss lab techniques + one or two figures rather than talk about data analysis and implications for the reproductive biology field as a whole.",
