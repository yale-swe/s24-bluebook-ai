I suspect that either because it was a 9am seminar in Watson or because people came from such a wide range of disciplines and with differing goals. The kind of engaging seminar discussions that youd expect between students were largely absent except for a few instances when we were discussing more polarising topics or when people posed questions to each other directly which felt like a loss.",
                "The class covered a host of important issues that ethnographers must keep in mind when conducting research. We explored the entire research process, from how to craft a compelling research question, to how to design an ethnographic study, to issues like positionality, voice, ethics. A weakness was that the class discussion sometimes fell short because there were a few students who were taking this class as their primary introduction to anthropology, and I would have liked it if we were able to push our thinking beyond an introductory level"
