I believe that I gained a more in-depth and intensive look at Melville's contribution to American letters from this class than I would from an English class. Melville's Moby Dick served as the anchor for our course discussions about the representation and symbolism of the ocean in culture and the arts. Professor Dorfman's instruction allowed me to apply the concepts and critical readings of Melville to other works of art, literature, film, and literary criticism."

                "The course was a lot of fun and the subject was engaging. It was nice to study a broad subject from a lot of different angles. I especially loved how we left the classroom to look at materials in the Beinecke and visit a whaling ship, which really supplemented our in-class discussion. I think the reading load was a little heavy at times, and a few of the classes were less interesting, like the one on global shipping.",
                "The strength of this course lay in Professor Dorfman's ability to engage me and my classmates. The course material was interesting. Our applications of critical readings and theories to the readings and film viewings were especially valuable as they allowed us to develop new ways to think about and explore the arts and sciences. The class trip to the Mystic Seaport Museum to explore a real whaling ship was the icing on the cake. It allowed us to bring to life the world of Melville's Moby Dick and walk the floors that iconic characters, Ishmael and Captain Ahab, once walked. This course had no major weaknesses."

                "yes 100%",
                "Yes! If you are interested in the sea, this is a fun, relatively chill class where you get to study the subject from different perspectives. We had fun discussions and Professor Dorfman assigned great readings.",
                "I strongly recommend this course to students whose majors do not cover theater, literature, and the arts. It is a great introduction to the impact and influence that literature has on history and culture and vice-versa. I also recommend this course for majors aligned with the arts, as this course provides an in-depth look at literature in a way that may not be applied outside of this course. I also recommend this course for those looking to try something new."
