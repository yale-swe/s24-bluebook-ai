                "This course was adapted quite well towards the online learning format. The one weakness is that asynchronous days tended to have at least double the \"in class\" work as a normal day.",
                "Cons: Just way too much work. It was unreasonable compared to my other classes, work was spread around too many different sources, several sudden video assignments were sprung on us with only a few days to complete them, and so on. It was very stressful to have multiple assignments due daily with no way to make them up. Catching up felt unrewarding and exhausting. Harsh penalties for each day late on super site made it unappealing to even try to catch up, since honestly I'm only taking this class because I have to. It felt like a punishment driving me away from ever actually getting engaged in the subject matter because small failures or outside stress snowball so quickly with this class compared to others.\r\n\r\nPluses would be having some asynchronous classes. This would have been impossible if class met in person each day. My professor was also kind and receptive, always very quick to reply to emails.",
                "Could transition more smoothly into reading the book, I'd appreciate a set of vocabulary to keep in mind while reading (ie. balsa = raft). Also could have given feedback on participation and comprehension consistently throughout the semester (maybe three checkpoints through email?) so we could understand our mistakes and improve them gradually instead of being hit by the participation grade mid semester. Thank you!",

                "Asynchronous classes were good. Some remote assignments worked. Small group work really made sense for this class. However, some of the small group assignments were pretty hefty projects which were assigned abruptly. This wasn't helpful and was pretty stressful one time in particular when it was assigned several days before due, but during a week where most of us had midterms and several of us were not in the same time zone. We had normal homework (busywork honestly) and had to coordinate to complete this video assignment which was stressful. It would have been nice to have known about that requirement earlier.",
