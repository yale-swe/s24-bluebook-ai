                "I learned what an epistemology is, as well as how to apply different epistemologies\/epistemological frameworks to literary\/artistic works. I learned how to strategically break down a research paper (8-10 pages) into obtainable steps (working and annotated bibliographies, the \"ballroom\" method, topic proposal, outline activities, initial drafts, etc. I also learned how to use the Yale Library system, and how to successfully complete research with peer-reviewed sources. I also learned alternative methods for essay writing as well (like utilizing personal narrative as well as diverging from the three paragraph model). I learned how to skim academic texts efficiently and do research with a broad scope. I learned how to read and understand complex, dense academic thought from scholars like Frantz Fanon, Judith Butler, bell hooks, etc.",
                "A lot of insight into the world of feminist epistemology and body liberation, especially when it comes to schools of thoughts of different philosophers and writers, such as Fanon, Butler, Haraway, McKittrick, amongst others. This was one of the most eye opening courses I have taken, showing me the deep social constructs, biases and behavioural patterns of society that lead to the oppression and reduced capacity of movement\/ action across everyday life and space."

                "The texts are very engaging and the class structure was approachable and not overwhelming. I do think some of the concepts\/what we seemed to be expected to look for were a little too abstract at times (like epistemologies, for instance). Perhaps spending a little more time on understanding those abstract concepts fully before trying to apply them would be helpful. It could also be helpful to have the concepts more clearly lined out before we read texts, so we know what to be looking for when reading.",
                "It is a fairly new course (I think we were the first class) so I definitely think the syllabus should be refined and better organised, as well as the deadlines and overall structuring\/ flow of the teaching. It would have also been helpful to have canvas reminders and assignments set up to not have to send emails or forget where the readings\/ collaborative documents are. I think it could also be nice to have a little bit of context on a lot of philosophical\/ ontological terms that are used in the readings and in a lot of the work we did because often it was hard to understand some of the arguments. However, I do think my overall experience with this course was great and I really enjoyed our class discussions and having a small class were I got to know all of my classmates, share ideas and work together."

I appreciated how we learned intriguing content relating to the topic of the class and how we used that content as a guide\/example for how to create our own academic writing and discourse.",
                "Definitely. Especially anyone who is looking to expand their perspectives on our society and how bodies are oppressed within it. I think it is a very valuable and eye-opening as well as critical way to get a writing credit. The grading is extremely harsh but at least that forces you to re check your essay again and again."
