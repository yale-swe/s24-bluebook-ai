                "I learned about laboratory techniques mostly having to do with mechanical properties and material imaging. I learned about report writing and presentations for lab based classes.",
                "Through this course, I learned how to use common materials science equipment and how to better write technical reports, and I also improved my understanding of the content covered in Intro to Materials Science.  The biggest skill I gained from this class was learning how to justify the data we found through our experiments, rather than simply summarizing it.",
                "I learned a lot about materials science and testing methods and applications. Essentially everything from the syllabus was covered.",
                "I further developed my knowledge in materials science by analyzing how the concepts learned in MENG285 are applied experimentally in a lab. Comparing both classes, some of the theoretical contents are now understood from an experimental point of view, including cold rolling, annealing, tensile testing, and X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, several other topics are covered to analyze the mechanical properties of materials, such as nanoindentation, ultrasonic testing, wear testing, among others. Finally, the professor also wants to make sure that the students learn how to properly write lab reports, so that was another useful skill that I learned during the class."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths were the incredibly knowledgeable professor and assistance from TA's and students who work in the lab. Also, the final presentation really helped to synthesize and understand the labs fully and there was good feedback on the lab reports.",
                "The strengths are that the professor is very willing to help you learn and become a better scientist. You get tons of hands on experience and the classroom environment supports you actually learning and understanding the material. The professor is a bit tricky to work with at first, but once you figure out the class pattern it is easy to manage. In the future I think the professor should  set clearer guidelines about group work.",
                "The biggest strengths of this class is that it gives you hands-on experience with engineering equipment you will most likely use in your professional career, and that it makes you a better technical writer. The amount of work required for the final presentation can certainly be a bit overwhelming, but if you are on top of correcting your lab reports throughout the semester, the final lab report at least won't be too bad. I think this course could be improved by fixing harder deadlines by which students must have their final project proposal determined and their experiments completed so that they will start working on the presentation a bit earlier.",
                "This course was honestly pretty awesome. I really enjoyed flexible class dates and the labs were great in length. Sometimes there was a lot of content in a single lab which made things a bit too rushed. Also the final report took forever to format since it did not copy and paste nicely and we had to redo the numbering on every single citation.",
                "Strengths: The course provides hands-on experience in the study of the mechanical properties of materials as well as how it correlates with the theory behind them during the results and discussion section of the lab reports. Most of the devices are operated by the students, which also helps to understand how they work.\r\nWeaknesses: The lab should have access to more equipment"

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student studying mechanical engineering, though please make sure that you take Intro to Materials Science before you enroll in this lab, for both your own sake and the sake of your labmates.",
                "I would recommend it! It is a great way to get hands on experience with materials science and I looked forward to it each week.",
                "I would highly recommend this course for students interested in materials science that plan to take it concurrently or after MENG285: Introduction to Materials Science. Professor Datye is deeply invested in the students success and he wants to make sure that we understand the concept. He may make jokes or make fun of your lab reports for not following the correct formatting if you do not read the instructions carefully, but he really wants you to learn and do things properly."
