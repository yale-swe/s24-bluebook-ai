    "Learned a lot about different theories behind democratization and also about developing political science papers",
    "I learned so much from this course! This was completely out of my comfort zone but Professor Brancati is an amazing and knowledgeable professor that makes everyone engage in a fruitful way.",
    "This class is an upper level undergraduate and graduate seminar examining the mechanisms behind democratization. The class covers much of the recent literature on democratization and focuses class time on the discussion of arguments presented in the readings. In addition, students work on individual research projects that are presented at the end of the semester.",
    "This class was a fantastic look into the subject and how political scientists are actively measuring and understanding democracy. Beyond just understanding the process of democratization, this class taught the necessary methodology for carrying out a political science research project over the course of a semester."

    "Really great selections of readings and good discussion each weak. No big weakness",
    "The course had a lot of reading but it wasn't impossible. You just have to make time for it because it really helps you engage better in class.",
    "Professor Brancati really helps you to understand the arguments made in each of the readings and is always available to answer questions (seriously, I think she sets a record among professors Ive had for responding quickly to student emails).",
    "This course is fantastic due to the balance of interesting readings with real-world applications, all while learning the step-by-step processes to build a successful research project. This is a great course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. The course is super engaging. The readings are excellent and discussion is centered well around them. The paper is a lot of work throughout the semester, but each step is spaced out and very clearly explained and you learn a lot in the process.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course especially if your interested in this type of political science. I learned a lot and professor Brancati made this class so worth it. She was very knowledgable but was still able to make the course accessible to people who were not as familiar with the material.",
    "Definitely! The class certainly has high expectations for students, but its definitely doable",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any Yale College student, especially political science majors who are looking for an introduction into how to complete a senior essay, but really for anyone with an interest in the topic at all."
