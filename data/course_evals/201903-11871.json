   "comments": [
    "I learned about early Spanish Literature as well as Spanish history. I read lots of interesting book and plays from Fuenteovejuna to Don Quixote to El filosofo autodidacto and others. I learned a lot too about how books were made and bound during that period.",
    "I learned a lot about medieval Spanish literature as well as the cultural impacts of Muslim and Jewish traditions on Spanish literature.",
    "The readings from medieval Iberian literature taught me about the society and culture of the Iberian peninsula in this time period, but more importantly allowed me to uncover ways in which the experiences depicted in these texts can be connected to modern human experiences.",
    "I learned a lot about poetry, religion, and history in the Iberian Peninsula. My ability to read old Spanish literature also greatly improved.",
    "I gained a better understanding of medieval Spanish literature and history. More importantly, however, I learned how to pay attention to the smallest details in literature and to seek a deeper message beyond the words. This class taught me how to have a greater appreciation for literature, art, and history in such a way that I will never perceive and experience the world around me the same as before.",
    "I gained a greater understanding of the intellectual and cultural environment of medieval Spain through reading and discussing a collection of  literature that was produced during that period. In addition to developing my speaking and listening abilities in Spanish, I also developed my writing skills in wiritng my first paper in Spanish."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths:\r\n-phenomenal professor\r\n-you really improve your Spanish because you're reading things that are very difficult and also have to talk about them\r\n-very interactive and engaging\r\n-FUN!!! (get to read plays)\r\n- course material was made accessible to people of all academic backgrounds. Whether you were a political science major or an engineering major, Professor Velasco made the class interesting for all\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Assignments\/deadlines were sometimes a bit confusing",
    "I think the course should have utilized more works that were originally written in Spanish. At moments it was difficult to remain engaged because so many of the texts didn't have accompanying translations and were written in older variations of Spanish or Catalan.",
    "There was sometimes a lot of reading which made it hard to complete all of the material in two days between classes. However, the class was incredibly engaging and it was very fun to help teach and also discuss the readings in class. I loved the diversity of material and authors - including Jewish, Muslim, and many female writers.",
    "A strength of this course is Profesor Velasco. He is hands down the most passionate, thoughtful, and brilliant professor I have had. He would often take a simple comment from a student and make a whole lecture on the spot. One thing that could improve is the structure of the class. A selected student would lead the class discussion every time without any guidance. Some students may thrive on this, but for others this may be daunting.",
    "The small class size and engaging discussions made taking this course an enriching experience. The only difficulty for students was in understanding medieval Spanish, and offering a small lesson in some of the differences between modern and medieval Spanish prior to reading the texts would help students in understanding the texts before coming to class."

    "ABSOLUTELY!!! Professor Velasco is super kind and also very knowledgeable. This is a great class if you want to practice speaking Spanish, learning about history, and even getting to try leading a class yourself in a fun atmosphere. I loved this class, and there was only one essay due the whole semester on a topic of your choice which is really cool because you can devote yourself to something you are interested in. Plus you get to read a lot of classic Spanish literature that you may have never had access to otherwise. The Beinecke sections are really cool too because your get to see the books you read about in class in real life.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who is particularly interested in medieval literature. There was a heavy focus on works from that period of Spanish history, which is not my niche but still could be very interesting to a student who is interested in that era.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Velasco is a fantastic and engaging professor with a lot of knowledge and enthusiasm about the material. I loved reading and putting on some of the plays we read.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student that is interested in studying literature, European history, or just wants to maintain fluency in Spanish."
