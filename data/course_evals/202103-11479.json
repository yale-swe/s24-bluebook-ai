Coming out of high school where I learned and studied a language for four years, it was difficult to keep up with the pace of this course. However, the activities and assignments were engaging and made sure that the student will actually learn and get something out of it.",
                "This course is very engaging and teaches a lot of grammar and vocabulary. I wish there was more of a focus on culture, but that is a small gripe considering the importance of learning the language.",

                "This is a very rigorous course and you learn a lot. Very fast-paced and difficult when coming into the class with no knowledge of the language -- the expectation of only using and speaking Spanish a few weeks into the semester prevents students from getting to know each other and becoming friends."

It's honestly not that much work (~ 1 hour/night) and is usually enjoyable and relevant to the class. I took this class as a senior just trying to take a fun class and would highly recommend it as a great way to learn the basics of Spanish and learn more about the Spanish speaking countries of the world.",
