   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about how social science occurs around the subjects of gender and culture. This course is a brilliant way to better understand the ways that gender inequality manifests all over the world, even though it focuses specifically on South Asian countries. I learned to read analytically, lead discussions in class, and write a final paper that allowed me to explore a topic of interest in gender studies.",
    "This course taught me a great deal about the politics of South Asia, specifically the intersection of gender and politics. This insight was extremely important given that most classes are very Western and White focused. I also learned how to critically analyze Political Science research.",
    "I learned so much about South Asia, which was a region I really did not know much about. It was very interesting looking at it from the perspective of gender.",
    "This course dove deeply into topics of gender theory and political economy in South Asia, focusing largely on India and Pakistan. The readings were interesting and diverse in subjects, ranging from work, domestic life, development strategies, social structure, politics, among many other things.",
    "Learnt the Economic and political implications of gender in the South Asian context. Gained experience in writing my own research papers and reading a lot of papers from political science, economics and WGSS -- this in particular helped acquaint me with different methodologies and was helpful in crafting my own project",
    "Definitely my writing skills for research papers"

   "comments": [
    "The only weakness of this course is that assigned readings could be a bit more diverse in including media\/visual\/other elements, but everything else about the course, from syllabus design to professor to final paper deadlines to in-class discussion, was a strength.",
    "Strengths: Interesting content, knowledgeable professor\r\nWeaknesses: Harsh grading, overlap between the units. \r\nIt could be improved through more transparent grading and also more distinct units of the class",
    "It was taught very well, I think the biggest weaknesses were the reading responses just because its hard to know what shes expecting from them.",
    "This course had a broad range of readings and topic discussions. The people and instructor of the class enabled a healthy and good academic environment that encouraged growth and knowledge.",
    "Strengths: Professor Khan is wonderful, super helpful and knowledgeable. I also enjoyed seminar because all the students were fairly engaged in the topic and contributed meaningfully. The syllabus was well crafted.\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of!",
    "I really like the way the class is structured and how it includes both student and instructor-led discussions. The workload was fair and it was really helpful to have the final paper broken down into manageable parts throughout the semester. Class was always interesting and I thought Prof Khan did a great job facilitating and teaching at the same time. She always had interesting insights to share and is incredibly encouraging."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. This course leaves students with a better understanding of how gender inequality is systemic, and the challenges that exist to rectifying that system.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The content was very interesting and much needed, but it did get slightly repetitive towards the end. However, this topic is extremely important, so it is worthwhile. Grading was unnecessarily harsh though, so watch out for that.",
    "Yes!! Its so interesting",
    "This course was very well taught, well organized, and interesting. You should take it if you have any interest in gender politics.",
    "Yes most definitely! This is a wonderful course and even if you have a remote interest in South Asia and\/or gender then I would strongly recommend taking it. I especially valued this course for how it helped me prepare for my upcoming senior thesis next year.",
    "Yes, definitely take it! Especially if you're interested in gender politics and South Asia. Professor Khan is fantastic and cares a lot about her students."
