    "This class should be offered as a lecture, there was no seminar style engagement",

    "This class is an awesome option if you need to fulfill an econ\/applied math credit. It's quite chill, but you get a great understanding of a few key concepts of game theory. Pradeep is genuinely concerned with his students learning, not just making them do work. He's funny and highly enthusiastic about what he does.",
    "Would absolutely recommend this course! Professor Dubey is an amazing Professor and truly cares about his teachings. Topics are very interesting.",
    "Absolutely. I loved this course and the professor is awesome.",
    "great easy senior seminar, you do have to show up though",
    "This class is extremely low workload, but isnt really worth it. Interesting material, but painfully boring delivery in long Fri morn seminar.",
    "Great senior seminar if you are interested in game theory. Even if you have taken game theory courses in the past, you will likely learn lots of new material in this class.",

    "Yes"
