    "The course got me writing regularly and working on assignments with the thought of carefully-chosen assigned readings in mind. It allowed me to improve in both my genres of choice and in writing drama, which I had never been exposed to before. It also made me a better contributor in workshop and helped me learn how to get more out of critical workshop commentary.",
    "The most important thing I took from this class was the ability to translate my thoughts and emotions into cohesive writing. I also had never written poetry or drama before, so it was fun to explore those modes of expression in a supportive environment.",
    "I learned a lot about the different forms of creative writing. I learned a lot about writing fiction, poetry, and drama.",
    "I learned writing techniques and launching points for fiction, poetry, and drama. I learned where the three genres are most different, and how they overlap."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The readings in my section were great, and we spent a good balance of time workshopping our work and talking about what was effective (or perhaps ineffective) in the readings. Workshops were productive and effective, and the assignments were all thought-provoking and challenging.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion for improvement would be more of a focus on writing itself--connecting discussions about process into our discussions of the readings, and perhaps sharing more of our writing assignments with the class. A full workshop every week isn't feasible, but it would have been nice to have more thoughts and feedback on the assignments in between unit workshops. I also would have appreciated a bit of writing time \/ informal writing assignments during class time; I was surprised that this was not a feature of the course.",
    "Strengths: the workload is mostly manageable. You are exposed to a lot of different styles of works within each larger category (poetry, drama, fiction). The assignments, especially the shorter ones, are often very enjoyable and clear, and if you get a good group of students in your section, you receive a lot of thoughtful feedback on your workshop pieces. But Brandon is definitely the biggest strength of the course.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes workshopping 4-5 other pieces, doing readings, and working on my own piece all due on the same day felt a little excessive, and sometimes the guest lecturers can be a little dry.",
    "I think the strengths were that we spent enough time in each unit to really get a grasp for it all. Another strength was all the visitors they invited to speak about each genre really helped build the excitement to learn that new unit. I think they could maybe change the order around a bit so it flows a bit easier.",
    "The plenary and guest lectures are really cool and helpful! It's interesting to get so many perspectives."

    "I would highly recommend English 123! For me it was one of the more important classes I've taken thus far (as a prospective English major \/ writing concentrator). It completely reaffirmed my interests and challenged me, but I can also see it being a great fifth class \/ low-stress humanities credit for people not as serious about writing (not a writing credit though!) The course structure (in genre units) give an opportunity to be exposed to work outside of your typical reading material. The visiting artists also all provided excitement and enthusiasm as well as interesting perspectives for each unit.",
    "Yes, without a doubt. The effort the English department puts into this course is so apparent. It is very organized, expectations are clear, and there is a lot of support. Also, take anything you can with Brandon. He is the nicest, most helpful, and accepting instructor I've had at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class as it was a great outlet for creativity and learning.",
    "Yes"
