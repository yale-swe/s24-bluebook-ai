                "It was a very helpful course that was quite well-designed. I learned the skills of multivariable calculus and this provides the background needed for a lot of advanced classes at Yale.",
                "I sharpened my problem-solving skills and strengthened my ability to visualize 3-D space. I learned the importance of developing a process to solve a problem rather than relying on pure intuition.",
                "This is the basic next step after Calculus II. We learned about vector functions, surfaces in 3D, etc. Typical Multivariable Calculus things. Definitely became a more efficient worker in this class and a better problem solver.",
                "I learned that just because I am great at math in high school does not mean it will come as easy in college-level math. While I really enjoyed MATH 120, the class was very difficult for me. I learned how to enjoy difficult courses outside of my field, for which I really value this course.",
                "I learned about vector calculus in better depth and also gained study knowledge and used past exams to study.",
                "Developed by analytical skills, attention to detail, persistence, and problem solving",
                "I learned a lot about three-dimensional calculus: how to represent 3D curves and surfaces by parametric equations, how to visualize surfaces, how to find the work done by vector fields along a curve or the flux through a surface, how to multiply vectors in different ways, how to relate partial derivatives and integrals to geometric properties of 3D entities, and how to find minima and maxima of multivariable functions over a 2D region. The course gave me practice taking integrals and using some basic integration techniques like u-substitution and integration by parts. It helped me understand how to relate 3D curves and shapes with equations."

            "comments": [
                "The course was taught at a suitable pace and concepts were explained very clearly. The textbook was a helpful resource. The size of the class was suitable for teaching.",
                "The pre-class videos ensured that each section received the same base-line education. Reviewing that same material in class, however, was quite repetitive. I believe section leaders should have focused more on problem-solving and complex application rather than rehashing the basic concepts. The problem sets were much tougher than the tests, so they prepared us well. I also question the course's emphasis on calculations by hand. Some of the problem sets and test questions were conceptually simple but calculation-intensive. I wonder the purpose of such questions in today's world.",
                "One strength of this course is that everyone gets to view the same videos, no matter what section you are in. It is a very linear and organized course, where everything builds on itself. It could be improved by having clearer in-class lesson plans.",
                "The biggest weakness of this course is how the grade is ENTIRELY dependent on the three exams. I think having only three exams determine your entire grade makes it much harder to accurately show your understanding of the content in the class. Maybe problem sets should count for more, or maybe there should be a fourth exams (i.e. three exams and a final) to distribute the grade more fairly. I did poorly on the second midterm and that grade completely screwed over my chances of getting a good grade in the class. The grade in MATH 120 should rely on more than just three 8-11 question exams.\r\nI think the problem sets and the availability of office hours were good strengths for this class. There were a lot of resources for students to get help: professor office hours, peer tutor office hours, problem sessions, etc. I appreciated the availability of these resources and wish I capitalized on them more. The problem sets were also well constructed to promote collaboration between students.",
                "Plenty of resources available, Ximera was great.",
                "The course had good instructor support and was well divided into smaller sections. I wish the classwork was more standardized between sections though.",
                "honestly, this course is run incredibly well.",
                "The videos made by Prof Hall are amazing. I think one could probably learn all the material well just by watching those videos. One weakness of the course is the strong emphasis of exams, which make up 85% of the course grade. That's a big disadvantage for those who are generally slow test takers. For me, the tests were too much about time crunch since each test contained a lot of problems. An issue seemed to be that the problem sets were long and rather repetitive, even though they were only worth 10% of the grade and contained more interesting, complex problems than the exam problems. \r\nStrengths included the pre-class videos, good communication via Canvas, and good teaching (also well-paced) in the classroom."

                "This is an important course and the knowledge it provides is helpful for students with different interests.",
                "In terms of difficulty and required skillset, this course is fairly similar to the other calculus classes and high school math. The problem sets are fairly time-consuming but the tests are manageable. Most importantly, it's great to have a background in multivariable calculus for other classes, so I do recommend taking this course. The course on its own, however, is not all-that-inspiring.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to continue the math that they did in high school. I took a gap year after taking BC Calc my senior year and easily picked up where I left off. Obviously, I'd also recommend to anyone who needs it for their major/distributional requirements.",
                "I would only recommend this course to someone who really likes calculus and computation. The course is not great for learning about abstract math, but I understand that this is designed to be a prerequisite to many other courses and thus isn't \"expected\" to be the greatest course of your life. So for those students who have to take it as a prerequisite, I would say that there are definitely ways to make this class enjoyable.",
                "I would recommend MATH 120 to students who are interested in pursuing higher-level mathematics or need it for their major. I would not recommend it for someone who is just looking for a QR credit.",
                "Yes, Id recommend this course to anyone interested in math because it was foundational for my calculus knowledge and ability to visualize.",
                "yes, but only if there have a math interest/background",
                "Yes, I'd recommend it, but only if you think you'll really use it for your field of study (e.g. engineers or mathematicians), or if it's required. Otherwise it's a lot of work, and the exams are stressful because they're weighted so heavily. I do think it's a very cool class if you're interested in using math for 3D modeling or simulations."
