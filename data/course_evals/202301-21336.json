I developed both a more creative, but also academic writing style through the class because of the myriad of paper topics and expectations.",

                "One huge strengths of the course is Professor Aslanidis. He comes to class and prompts thoughtful discussion, stimulating conversation effortlessly about topics that can be quite difficult to discuss. The material we engage with coming to class prepares us for an enriching discussion, but the supplemental materials and videos Professor brings to class elevate the class's understanding of the subject matter in an important way. The assignments do not feel like busy work and allow students freedom to explore the fields they so please.",
                "Paris is a great professor and there was a lot of healthy and good discussion in class that really enriched my experience.",
                "Professor Aslanidis is definitely one of the biggest strengths of the class. He does a phenomenal job of leading seminar by balancing student participation with his own prepared slides/lectures. He also makes sure to incorporate the work that we do outside of class in the classroom in a way that makes the work feel more meaningful. For example, he would share excerpts from everyone's reading responses and have the two people sitting on either side of that person play devil's advocate in response to what that person had written. His encouragement of debate in the classroom leads to a ton of learning and growth. One potential weakness is that the class focuses predominantly on the US/Europe (partially reflective of the existing literature). It would've been nice to cover other parts of the world in more depth, though.",
                "Strengths: Professor Aslanidis, the readings\r\nCant think of a weakness of this course really",
                "Strengths: fascinating reading, discussions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: was not a fan of the reading responses as they felt restrictive (esp second and third). I would prefer more like the first (applying something we've learned to a case study as we all ultimately have our own research interests)\r\nAslanidis gets a little lecture-y sometimes especially when it comes to Greece & Western European extreme right which is super interesting but I feel like that came at the cost of learning more about other regions of the world.",
                "I think that the discussion based model of the class was extremely valuable. I almost felt like the slides the professor had prepared with definitions for useless because he went through them rather fast and it was tricky internalizing the information while copying it down, but when he, or other classmates, would speak about the contents of the slide or the readings, that was really informational."

                "I would certainly recommend this class and take it again if I could. Professor Aslanidis is a great instructor and brings a passion to the subject matter that allows conversation to flow in class. Materials are interesting and diverse from many different regions, and supplemental videos and sources provided in class only add to class discussions. Though the subject matter is difficult to talk about, the class manages to find a balance between candid discussion and civil argument. Take this class if you have the time. You will not regret it.",

                "Yes! The topic is incredibly interesting and relevant to the state of international politics today. Plus, Professor Aslanidis is amazing!",
                "Yes! If you have interest in the extreme right certainly",
                "Yes! Overall a great learning experience and probably one of my favorite PLSC classes at Yale. Opened my eyes to a lot of topics that I did more research on outside of class",
                "Certainly! I loved Professor Aslanidis and his teaching style. He was certainly an engaging professor and knowledgeable on the topic. He really pushed us to learn and think differently by pressing us on our viewpoints or having us debate one another."
