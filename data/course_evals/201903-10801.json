    "I learned about not only the various types of writing in Japanese history, but also how that writing connected to what was happening in historical events. I particularly liked that we explored all different kinds of texts, not a set and rigid canon. Especially with the writing reflections that encouraged us to consider text outside the context of Japan, but rather in the modern day and in our own lives too, it made me think in new ways about how I engage with text myself and then apply that interpretation to thinking historically about Japanese texts",
    "I learned about Japanese history and how to craft a reserach paper.",
    "This course introduced to me new ways of thinking about how important writing is when examining history to better understand the people, politics, and economics of the time. This course is really engaging because it spans premodern Japan, which is a lengthy spell of time to cover, but given Yales long(ish) semesters and the way that Professor Curtis designed her curriculum, every week covered a unique and thought provoking theme or time. The readings were all well selected too, even the ones that provided more foundational knowledge about how historians approach studying language or writing that may not relate directly to the events happening in Japan, but provide us with the necessary tools to allow us to critically engage with the Japanese primary sources.",
    "This class helped to improve my writing, big time! I also can now cite references, Chicago-style, without using a style guide, which I think is an incredible resource to have on your hands for other classes, as proper references are often hard to come by and look quite professional. It also helped me to think creatively in my phrasing, as I did weekly reading reflections on Twitter (which was a really fun and innovative tactic for increasing engagement in the responses), which confined me to an explicit number of characters and taught me how to be more concise. Moreover, I got a fabulous overview of early Japanese history and learned so many connections of historical events to texts, which is so interesting as I plan to study the Japanese language further and ultimately attempt to read some older (not too old, those are too hard!) texts at some point in my life! Finally, I think I've become a better communicator, as the class discussions and Professor Curtis's intriguing questions helped me to learn how to phrase my thoughts sensibly in a small classroom setting.",
    "I really enjoyed the course! As someone without much of a background on Japanese culture, it was a truly enlightening experience that really helped me refine my research skills.",
    "I gained a deeper background knowledge of premodern Japanese history and a theoretical understanding of how text can be used in various registers. I also found the course particularly rewarding in that we often were asked to make connections between the week's historical reading or ideas about how text was used and modern expressions of similar ideas. In that sense it was particularly challenging and interesting in that it forced us to transport our understanding of premodern Japan to a different context and test those ideas.\r\n\r\nThe course's structure in moving from concept paper, to historiography, and finally onto presentation and final paper also will help me in the future since it provided a framework for how to begin a history paper and get into the thick of writing it. \r\n\r\nOverall I feel more confident navigating premodern Japanese history now.",
    "Excellent survey of Japanese history and culture from ancient times to 1600."

   "comments": [
    "I appreciated the approach to text from multiple angles, both historical and modern. I also appreciated that the professor used the resources we have here at Yale to go on \"field trips\" to the Beinecke and the Yale Art Gallery. I got to see originals of these amazing texts, a chance I may never have again. It was amazing. I also found it very helpful that we were required to turn in sections of our final paper throughout the semester. It helped avoid the final paper becoming an overwhelming hurdle and receiving feedback in multiple stages was very helpful. There were no major weaknesses of the course. I don't have any complaints.",
    "Excellent course! There isn't much I would change. The classes are interesting and encourage student engagement. Feedback on papers is clear, and the papers work together well so everything feels like it matters to the overall concepts of the course!",
    "The strength of this course was the curation of readings which were really well put together as they highlighted written works from all varieties of people, so there was a diversity of thought. Professor Curtis is very knowledgeable about this topic and her mini lectures to help us contextualize our readings and discussions were excellent. Our online discussion board freedom was nice too as we could pick Twitter or Instagram to reflect on the readings. I would recommend Twitter because there is a great academic community on there already that you can connect with. Finally the build up to the final project is very well organized and students are given ample time to research what they are interested in while also receiving a lot of support from the professor through frequent feedback and office hours.",
    "This course has so many strengths. Just to focus on a few, there's the impeccable organization, the clear guidelines, and the fun and interactive activities that we engaged in! Professor Curtis makes it so easy to stay organized in her course, by giving detailed handouts for each assignment that are incredibly easy to follow and creating guiding slides for each class that give a concise historical context for all of our readings. Finally, all of the activities Professor Curtis had planned to keep us engaged were incredible - one week she recreated mokkan, or small wooden slabs used and reused for anything from shipping labels to poetry in early Japan, and allowed us to analyze them. Another time, she got a replica scroll for one of the texts we were studying and narrated the exciting story to us in class. We also visited the Beinecke library to review actual examples of ancient Japanese texts and the YUAG, where we got to see applicable sources in Japanese art. Overall, the class and all of the activities that intertwined with weekly discussions were such a great time, and I really wish it wasn't over.\r\n\r\nI can't think of any weaknesses for this course, other than the fact that it was on a Monday when I took it, which is just kind of awkward schedule-wise, unless you like doing your work on the weekend, of course! It's really just a personal preference of mine, not an actual weakness of any sort.",
    "The structure of the course really helped guide students to slowly but surely create a viable final project. While I was at first skeptical of having a final project proposal due at a rather early point in the course, it ultimately served to force us to complete some of the heavy leg work long before the end of the term. Another strength was that we did not read exclusively premodern japanese history scholarship, but also theoretical papers about text. Because of this, I think our discussions were much more fruitful and interesting than if we had focused on historical scholarship alone, especially in a course where it is not expected that everyone has a specialty in premodern Japanese history. \r\n\r\nWhile I thought using social media as a platform to present our reading reflections was novel and at times interesting, I also felt that the disparate platforms that everyone chose hurt our ability to regularly read and interact with classmates' posts. Even though there was a place they were all collected, because of the structure of some social media platforms that aren't conducive to textual engagement, it may have hurt students' engagement with each others' posts. Although, I don't necessarily think that using a discussion board is the best solution to this problem.",
    "Thoroughly planned lectures. Syllabus was crafted to maximize student learning and was considerate of student schedules."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. This would be a great course both for a Japan specialist or for someone entirely new to Japanese text and history.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The material is interesting, and Professor Curtis is a great professor!",
    "Yes for sure take this course because it provides a lot of foundational knowledge about Japan and its society\/culture. The readings are great, discussions are well led, and the professor is very knowledgeable about said subject. You will leave wanting to learn so much more on your own free time which is great!!",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student, as it not only helped me to hone my writing skills, but also served as an excellent overview of early Japanese history. I had an incredible time discussing the readings with our class, and Professor Curtis does an incredible job of making the weekly class discussions feel like a natural conversation. If people had nothing more to say, or we were stuck on a certain topic, Professor Curtis would always be there with an incredibly thought-provoking question that had everyone engaged. Moreover, the weekly readings were interesting and helpful in teaching about some of the commonly-neglected topics in history classes, which are visible through the analysis of text, including sources shedding light on the daily lives of people in these periods, sources focusing on commoners and sources honing in on women. The best part was our reading responses, which we did on social media platforms (serving as another example of textuality!) Not only did this unique method make it fun to interact with other people's responses, but since the reading response questions were always focused on relating our sources on text to relevant applications in the modern day, it was so interesting to see what everyone came up with and discuss the implications of our choices of modern connections in class. Please take this course if you are interested in Japanese history, and you want to improve your writing! Professor Curtis gives incredible feedback on every writing assignment we do, which is useful outside of the classroom and helped me to do better on other essays in other classes!",
    "Absolutely! Paula Curtis is a great Professor who works with all her students so that everyone is learning and understanding the material.",
    "I would recommend this course for those interested in taking a premodern history course that makes fun and interesting connections between past and present. Especially if a student is particularly resistant to seeing the relevance of premodern history to the present, I would encourage them to take this course to subvert that notion. I would also recommend it to those students with a wide variety of interests in premodern Japanese history: from Buddhism to literacy, trade and more, especially since the course captures a number of those topics.",
    "This is one of the best courses on Japan I have had the pleasure of taking. The amount of planning and work that went into this course was evident."
