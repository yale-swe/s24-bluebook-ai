    "I improved my Korean speaking and listening skills significantly, while expanding my command and knowledge of Korean grammar and vocabulary. I also learned to read and think about poetic\/slang words in Korean, because of the course's use of lyrics. This gave me a more intimate understanding of idiomatic phrases in Korean, which I found really useful.",
    "Learn more Korean vocabulary and grammar notes through different songs and themes.",
    "learned a lot more ~relevant~ vocabulary associated with pop culture",
    "Professor Lee Smith really allowed the class to advance in more literary readings of Korean as opposed to just colloquial language learning.",
    "I learned much more colloquial Korean through applications to music. We learned a lot of new vocabulary from songs throughout modern Korean history.",
    "Korean conversational and debating skills, colloquial phrases as well.",
    "More ease with communication!",
    "Learning about korean culture through songs, readings, and structured discussion. New vocab and grammar were introduced every class, with a focus on speakin.",
    "The course was great for improving speaking skills since much of the classes were more free-form and focused on a discussion over an element of Korean culture or a Kpop song. We didn't learn much new grammar or vocab, but the course definitely helped with speaking more naturally and descriptively! Highly recommend since Lee SSN is also so sweet and really willing to provide extra materials and explanations if you are interested!",
    "Learned a lot of Korean speaking and writing.",
    "I learned how to communicate better in Korean. This class helped me correct many of my common mistakes. Additionally, I learned how to plan an event in Korean.",
    "I learned about Korean casual language and slang, Korean songs and how to translate them, and vocabulary for love songs and for debating more topical topics."

   "comments": [
    "The biggest strength of this course is its professor. It is always a pleasure, privilege, and honor to be taught by a professor as engaging, respectful, accommodating, intelligent, and bright as Professor Lee-Smith. She makes every lesson engaging, intelligent, and thoughtful, and gives every student ample opportunities to participate, break out of their comfort zone, and engage with the material. \r\n\r\nThere is a weakness of this course that comes from the simple fact that it is the first iteration of a K-Pop oriented class, as well as a weakness that comes from larger pedagogy of Korean language (from my experience as a student). As a class, I think we quickly found that learning songs, new vocabulary from the lyrics, and then writing sentences using the new vocabulary was repetitive, and not very engaging. That being said, Professor Lee-Smith realized this and pushed to be more creative in how we understand and learn (pulling from Korean news articles, contemporary discussions about K-Pop on- and offline, and more). To improve this course, in particular, I think she should think more about how K-Pop engages not only new vocabulary, but also engages critical thought and discussion. We did engage with this kind of thing at times, but I think the curriculum should be built in a way that allows us to first read articles\/news\/watch music videos and build certain thoughts about specific subject material, and then discuss them with our peers. There needs to be time and energy put into giving us different arguments and ideas, and allowing us to synthesize that with our own understandings and prior knowledge, as well as build language-learning into that.\r\n\r\nFor example, the issue of hate comments has been a big problem in South Korean media recently, as multiple K-Pop artists' suicides and deaths have been allegedly linked to online hate. What different articles and arguments surround this issue? A unit on this issue could start with some of the songs of the deceased artists, online commentary surrounding those songs, and then news articles about their deaths\/related commentary on hate comments. There is so much to be learned from that in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and speaking\/listening practice, but also engages a wide variety of media: music\/songs, online comments\/perceptions, articles, etc. Professor Lee-Smith did this well with our lesson on SuperM, but I wish something like that were a bit more developed. You could do a similar lesson on K-Pop vs. K-Indie genres (why K-Pop doesn't summarize ALL Korean music). \r\n\r\nOn the whole, I think there is fantastic potential for K-Pop to serve as a medium through which to learn language, the curriculum just might need a little bit more planning and research going in. Professor Lee-Smith is, of course, a language expert, not a K-Pop expert, so some deeper understanding of K-Pop and the different issues and points of view that surround it might aid the curriculum a lot.\r\n\r\nMore than anything, this issue stems from the fact that Yale is simply not investing enough in Korean Studies. Yale should be hiring more professors who not only teach the Korean language, but also actively understand and teach about a wide variety of issues surrounding Korea. Korean Studies deserve more institutional support, and a class like this would be incredibly benefitted by that. \r\n\r\nOn a higher level, I also think Korean language pedagogy in general could be more organized. Sometimes, it feels like we learn one type of grammar in the beginning of the semester, and a very similar but slightly nuanced version of it 2 units later. Part of me wishes I learned them together, so I could distinguish between their nuances more clearly. This is not an issue of Prof. Lee-Smith at all, but a larger issue surrounding pedagogy that I even witnessed when I studied Korean at Seoul National University as well. Just something for the professors to keep in mind.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, this class was a huge huge highlight of my semester.",
    "Classes could sometimes be a little unorganized\/ class time isn't always used efficiently, but there is a lot of opportunity to practice conversing in Korean with your classmates. It is up to the students to take the initiative and always speak in Korean\/ really study and memorize the vocabulary to get the best experience out of the class.",
    "strengths:   is very energetic and kind. workload is pretty low\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the laid-backness of the class didn't really motivate me to memorize my vocab or really focus on improving my korean. also i am just not particularly interested in kpop so ...",
    "I would have appreciated more time in guided writing practice.",
    "I think that the class could be much more fast-paced. Oftentimes it felt like we were doing the same thing for very long periods of time. Though, I really like that Professor Lee-Smith does not give homework for the sake of just having homework. Homework is always applying what weve learned in class.",
    "It might be a little too easy, so I wasnt motivated.",
    "Since this class hasn't been run before, some of the activities or schedules we planned out didn't happen or drastically changed. I don't think I really minded, but it was sometimes hard to know what was due the next day.",
    "Strengths were definitely learning more about the culture and improving speaking skills. Weaknesses were that some days were less structured so we didn't learn much new material. Future improvements could focus on teaching more grammar\/vocab at a higher level so the course is a bit more challenging!",
    "I think the strengths are the degree of involvement. I felt really comfortable with all the students and the teacher.",
    "Strengths:\r\n\r\nYou practice a lot of speaking so you will improve \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nNot that many quizzes so there was no reason to really study vocabulary.",
    "I really enjoyed coming to every class, despite the early start time. The course was fun and casual. I just wish that the course would be more challenging and rigorous because I felt that I was never challenged to learn."

    "Definitely! The Korean program here is great and this is a great class of non-heritage speakers who all make a fantastic community.",
