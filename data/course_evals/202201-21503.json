Professor Zarin is great and really makes the class a place you want to be.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I dont really think there are any, but one thing I will say is that we didnt receive much feedback over the course of the semester. Ive never been in a class like that before, so it was definitely frustrating at times.",

One possible improvement would be to move the imitation assignment earlier in the semester (since it seemed like a very impactful week for a lot of the students in the class)."
