                "I came to Yale thinking that I had a solid understanding of what it meant to write; this course entirely redefined that for me. I learned what it meant to craft a debatable claim, how to make an argument that matters, how to back up my ideas with meaningful evidence. Additionally, the conversations in class were really constructive in helping me think deeply on the spot about everyday things such as celebrity behavior and social media.",
                "I came in Yale thinking I was already good at writing. ENG 114 made me realize everyone can improve at writing. Professor Lofton's ENG 114 shaped me into a better thinker, listener, and writer. TAKE THIS COURSE YOU WILL LOVE IT AND GROW SO MUCH!",
                "I learned how to make effective arguments in papers and how to make strong claims",
                "This course taught me a lot about writing at the college level. From the art of close reading literary passages to the art of writing a strong, debatable claim, I feel much better equipped to write analytical essays going forward because of the skills I learned in this class.",

                "Small class discussions are amazing, freedom with topics on large assignments, check-ins with research paper, use of modern cultural questions to answer questions on theory.\r\n\r\nWould have liked one more check-in during early stages of research project.",
                "Since this is a writing course, I wish it spent more time going step by step for the writing process and how to write the paper that 114 wants. I think 114 is a very humane extension of high school writing, and I believe gave me skills to make the rest of my Yale writing experience easier. The textbooks that were cited were also helpful and will be useful in the future. Profiling celebrity was a captivating course, EVERYONE should take a class with Prof Lofton before they graduate. She is truly the smartest person I have ever been placed in a room with; Lofton is endlessly inspiring. I do hope to have the chance to enroll in another one of her courses. In seminar we got into fun conversations about popular culture, but the discussion became \"low brow\" to \"high brow\" very quickly. Lofton allowed students time to speak but always elevated the conversation. Lofton is also incredibly empathetic and understanding when it comes to workload. She is not easy and has expectations for students' work, but is always a proponent of a needed mental health check in. \r\nWeaknesses- as Lofton is a superstar she can be hard to track down. All of my meeting with her had to be planned a week in advance and were only 15 minutes. This is tricky when it relates to 114 because learning to write requires some hand holding.",
                "The course was incredible! Professor Lofton is unlike any other mentor I've ever had and I'm glad I took this ENGL 114 section. The seminars were always a lot of fun and it was interesting to hear the students' perspectives on various topics in celebrity culture. That being said, Professor Lofton had really high expectations about our essays. The first month was particularly stressful for more because I didn't know what I could to improve my writing. Eventually, though, I began understanding Professor Lofton's vision better and was able to implement her strategies in my pieces. I had a lot of fun with the essays especially the big paper. Thus, despite the course difficulty, I saw my knowledge and critical thinking skills improve greatly over time. My only suggestion is to get more detailed feedback on essays so that there is more transparency about areas of improvement.",
                "This course was super engaging, the subject matter was continuously interesting and I never got bored. Additionally, the way in class discussions functioned were great and very thought provoking. One weakness was that there wasn't much feedback given on writing until the end of the course; feedback throughout would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: Class discussions flow naturally + intellectually stimulating, Professor Lofton guides us and provide ample opportunities to improve in our writing, the class atmosphere was very collaborative and engaging",
                "strength was the teacher and we all had super engaging conversations. Weakness was there wasn't a lot of time to meet with professor loft individually.",
                "I think the biggest strength of this course is using the fun and exciting subject matter of celebrities and pop culture to help students think about how they might make sound arguments that could be debated and supported with evidence. The familiarity of the topics in the course make it easier to imagine how one might generate their own unique takes on a specific subject.",

I will always look back to the work I did in this class for inspiration and validation, and I hope to have Prof. Lofton as my professor in a class in the near future.",
