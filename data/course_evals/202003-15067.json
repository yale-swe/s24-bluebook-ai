                "I learned a lot about how Asian Americans have interacted with the law from past to present, as well as how to delve into and critically analyze legal documents. Professor Lui also makes sure to bring in a lot of primary sources that aren't legal documents, and guides her students in figuring out how to glean valuable information from them for understanding a cultural moment.",
                "So much  branching out from the background on Asian American exclusion we learned from Professor Lui's Asian American American history class (a must-take but definitely not necessary for this course), we delved into topics of housing, education, criminal justice, exclusion from a historical-legal, cultural, and political lens. I learned how to take a legal document and historically analyze it in a broader context of domestic\/international politics, culture, and racial formations.",
                "I learned to think more critically about the history of Asian Americans in the context of the law throughout American history. This class allowed me to not only learn more history about Asian Americans in the legal system but also study how it changed throughout the 20th century. The courts constantly changed interpretations of race, and Asian Americans felt the direct effects of persecution such as exclusion, incarceration, and internment.",
                "Knowledge\/ insights: I learned so much about American legal history and the history of Asian American populations in California, D.C., the Mississippi Delta, etc. We covered several landmark court decisions and immigration laws, broadly spanning education, housing, and criminal justice.  \r\n\r\nSkills: legal analysis and how to effectively read law journals and legal opinions; ML pushed us to be accurate and specific in our discussions (the class always stressed covering the facts of the case\/ law and periodization), which enhanced our discussions and grasp of the material",

                "Mary Lui put together an amazing reading list that discussed different issues affecting Asian Americans. We explored the conception of the model minority myth, racial triangulation, environmental racism towards Asian Americans, the position Asian Americans held in the South, etc.",
                "This course provided me crucial knowledge in Asian American history, law, and justice, particularly around education, housing, and criminal justice. I also gained skills in reading cases and legislation and understanding how to read and analyze court opinions. This course helped me to see the role of the law in history and race formation. I gained insight into how the law can be used to seek justice as well as the limitations of the law. I also honed my research skills, specifically around building a historical argument around a legal case and additional primary and secondary sources.",
                "We discussed Asian American legal history through analyses of court cases and secondary sources. We considered the context of these court decisions and the impact they had especially under the topics  of fluctuating racial identity in law, and education, immigration, and housing.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: There was always clear feedback on assignments. Professor Lui made herself very available to students, despite her own busy schedule. I also enjoyed the community of our class, which Professor Lui did a great job facilitating! \r\n\r\nPlaces for improvement: The amount of reading was a little challenging, especially since we were reading long judicial opinions almost every week. The assignments were also quite challenging for me both in terms of frequency and expectations. Even though we had a lot of small 3-page assignments, the expectations for what we should cover in the 3-page assignments felt more suited to a 5-6 page assignment, so I found even the small assignments to be quite stressful.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lui made this course amazing; meeting 2x a week instead of meeting for one longer seminar a week (it was easier to stay engaged, I was able to contribute comments on Thursday that didn't come to me during the Tuesday course); the READINGS!!!!! (particularly all the Mendez v. Westminster readings, the readings on affirmative action, the readings on Sing Shen v. Southwood, the readings on Fong Yue Ting, and the readings on the cultural defense and environmental justice, the I-Hotel... actually basically every reading was so fascinating); the class environment was great and such a fun group of students; also we did fun intros for each other for our final presentations and that was SO fun",
                "Strengths: It covers a lot of legal content, and does so in a way that is approachable, while pairing it with useful secondary sources. Professor Lui is also an amazing professor who creates a welcoming and supportive environment in her seminars, even in Zoom world, and provides a lot of feedback on your work throughout the semester (even on shorter response papers!). I found myself really looking forward to class. You also have the opportunity to engage with everyone else's work through presentations, which is fun. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of reading, that it simply isn't always possible to finish!",
                "Professor Lui has to be the biggest strength of this course. She fostered a learning environment such that everyone in the class could critically engage with and participate in each of our seminars, and she really helped us be a community in a challenging time. Most importantly, the breadth of her expertise in Asian American history is immense  we all learned so much not only in class, but through her guidance in our independent projects. No weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: engaging discussions, amazing classmates, encouraging professor, manageable assignments\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the readings were a little long\/dense",
                "Great class overall! I loved the content, environment, and assignments. Professor Lui led the seminar effectively and was very knowledgeable about the material. The readings were also paired together very nicely-- we usually had a mix of primary and secondary sources spanning legal documents and journals, political and cultural history articles, and even some readings from other disciplines (excerpts from memoirs, etc.) that really enhanced the units. \r\n\r\nThe assignments built up to the final paper effectively by helping us make incremental progress toward the research project throughout the semester. I appreciated that she brought in a research librarian and that he pulled together several primary and secondary source databases according to our topic proposals (these resources ended up helping me with my final papers from other classes as well). The final presentations were also a great way to end the class (learning about each other's research and doing fun bios on each other).",
                "Strength - Prof Lui and the other students in the class. Lui is one of the best professors I've ever had, and I was very lucky to be able to take this class. Everyone in the class was extremely fun and open. Discussions were great. Only mild weakness was not knowing which readings we were going to discuss each day, so you had to frontload all of the reading and try to get it done before the first class (and there was a lot).",
                "This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, even during the time of the pandemic. Mary Lui did a very good job in making sure that our classroom environment was one filled with laughter, caring people, wonderful insight, etc. I always laughed so much during class while also being challenged to go further with the point I brought up.",
                "One strength of this course is Professor Lui. She is incredibly knowledgeable and cares a lot about the material and her students' learning. Given that this was the first time the course was being taught, she was flexible and developing it along the way, but I think it all came together very well. Another strength of this course was the guest speakers. Kao Kalia Yang, in particular, was one of the most beautiful, eloquent, and inspiring speakers I've ever heard. Finally, this course is well-organized and has a comprehensive reading list that balances legal cases with other primary and secondary sources.\r\n\r\nA weakness of the course was that for some weeks, the readings were really long and sometimes harder to understand. I think splitting the seminar up into two sessions was beneficial, especially for online classes but could possibly also be helpful for in-person. However, in terms of improvement, I think having a clearer sense of which readings we were going over on Tuesday and which we could save for Thursday would allow us to focus more attention on each reading.",
                "The course was very engaging and the topics we discussed demanded our careful attention. Though the readings were long, the nuance in the legal documents and yielded thorough discussions and an expansion of our understanding of the tensions between asian identity and the rights of citizenship within the law. The seminar format is the classs greatest strength and potential weakness. Professor Lui helped make the class a lively place to be during online learning and her moderation of discussions enabled us to cover most if not all of the desired subjects. This iteration of the class shared in this collaborative energy, which lead to a fantastic learning experience.",
                "thought the material was super interesting and engaging, though some weeks readings were a bit too long. class discussions went well and I appreciated usage of the breakout rooms. overall no complaints! presentations were super interesting and a lovely way to end the class :)"

                "Dividing the class from a long seminar into 2 was very helpful for engagement. I do wish we had a little more variation from always discussing readings in class (ie different activities). I also wish the seminar was a bit smaller because I sometimes found it difficult to participate.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Lui assigned us to different breakout rooms and gave each room a different primary source to discuss, which made it a lot easier to engage with each other. She also encouraged us all to introduce ourselves when we split up into breakout rooms so we could meet each other if we hadn't yet and share fun facts about ourselves. Splitting the seminar up into 2x a week instead of of 1x a week was also GREAT and should be implemented even if the class is in-person!! It allows us to reflect more on discussion and on the readings, makes me more engaged during class, also makes us feel more connected as a class because we get to see each other more often. also huge shoutout to everyone else in the class who made it such a fun time. Hands down best class this semester. We also had an avatar screening night.",
                "I really appreciated how Professor Lui would have us discuss readings in smaller breakout rooms, and have us introduce ourselves\/get to know each other in a non-academic way. Sharing our work with each other via presentations was also really helpful, and allowed us to engage with other student's work in a way that doesn't always happen in history seminars.",
                "Though it was a seminar, we actually split it up into two shorter segment sessions in a week. I think this led to a more vibrant discussion as it gave us time to sit with the material.",
                "This class was the best at fostering a community within the class even though it was virtual! Professor Lui made sure that we got to know each other outside of the class and learned about each others' personalities and interests. We all became fairly close after the class ended and I really enjoyed how we were able to bond virtually!",
                "I loved that the seminar was broken up into two weekly sessions instead of the usual 2-hour block (this was especially effective for minimizing zoom fatigue).",
                "Extremely engaging class! Smaller breakout rooms which we got to know each other were very effective.",
                "I think if there was a clear designation between which readings would be discussed on Tuesday and Thursday, it would have made the reading course load less intensive. Overall, the discussions never felt too long and always felt fresh.",
                "Splitting into breakout rooms occasionally was helpful in enabling us to do introductions and get to know each other better as well as discuss the topics more in-depth and allow everyone a chance to speak. Professor Lui cared a lot about making sure we were able to build relationships from the class so she implemented practices for us to get to know each other. For our final presentations, we were each randomly assigned someone to introduce before we presented. Each person put a lot of thought and effort into their introductions. It was a super fun part of the class and a great way to candidly learn about one another.",
                "Because of the remote learning format, Professor Lui brought in speakers for a few of our meetings. The speakers Professor Rob Chiang and Kao Kalia Yang were extremely memorable and helped enhance what we all took away from the course. \r\n\r\nThe only recommendation I would have for the remote learning format would be to clearly divide up the reading assignments in the syllabus so that each meeting would have designated readings to be discussed. Flexibility is still important, but declaring priority would certainly help during some weeks. Several times during the course did I find myself going over all of the readings for the week before the first out of two weekly meetings.",

                "Yes!!!!!!! Definitely take this course. Each week the readings and discussions were fascinating. Asian Americans play such a prominent role in U.S. legal history but are so rarely taught in history class and the cases we learned about also have huge present-day implications. Take this class if you've learned about school segregation and never learned about Mendez v. Westminster or Gong Lum v. Rice, if you're curious about the debate over affirmative action and the model minority but never learned the history behind it, if you're interested in immigrant rights and deportation but never learned about Fong Yue Ting v. United States, if you're interested in intersectionality, or if you're interested in going to law school, or all of the above. I learned SO much from this course. Professor Lui is also amazing.",
                "Yes! Professor Lui is a professor that you should definitely take a class with before you graduate from Yale. If you're interested in the law, this is also a great class to help you ease into legal material and understand its wider social implications. It's also an enjoyable class with a really welcoming environment.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Whether or not you already took Professor Lui's Asian American History (if you did, this seminar is a fantastic next step; if you didn't, you learn everything you need to in this course), you really get to sit with and consider the question of \"justice\" through reading and learning about some of the most important cases and social movements in US legal and racial formations.",
                "YES!! Please take this class if you are admitted!!! Much of traditional American history skips over crucial events and court cases that have directly impacted the Asian American community, and it's important to understand how the legal system has impacted the community and also changed over time. Prof Lui does an amazing job at making the content engaging as well.",
                "Yes, definitely! The seminar covers important historical material that more people should know about. I think it's especially useful for people interested in immigration, education, and legal history, though I think anyone could gain a great deal from taking this class.",
                "100%! Take this class if you get the opportunity.",
                "Yes! It is a lot of work but very much worth it to take one of the few classes at Yale that teaches about Asian American history!",
                "Yes! If you're interested in law, justice, or Asian American history, then I would definitely recommend taking this course. If you're thinking about going to law school, this class also provides a good introduction to reading legal cases and analyzing court opinions. Professor Lui is also an amazing professor so I would definitely try to take a class with her if you can.",
