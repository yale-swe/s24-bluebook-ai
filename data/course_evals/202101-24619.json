                "I learned to read a variety of texts, most surprisingly of which were philosophy pieces.",

Gained perspective into several specific subdisciplines of medicine such as neuroscience, family physicians, statistical medicine. Learned the ideas of past and present scholars such as William James, Tolstoy, Wittgenstein, Lydia Dugdale.",
                "In this course I learned more about the field of medicine and the mindset of doctors. This class was not focused on the technical side of medicine, rather I learned about how doctors must handle patients and different cases presented in front of them from an ethical standpoint. Further, in the context of these discussion, I learned about philsophers and thinkers such as Aristotle or Tolstoy and how their ideas applied to medicine.",
                "This course covered everything from Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics to Tolstoy, from the Ars Moriendi to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. It was the perfect blend of literature, philosophy, art, all viewed from the lens of a life-well lived and medicine.",
                "As a non-pre-med, I was introduced in a fascinating way to the medical world, learning about everything from the journey of young medical students to accounts from current or famous doctors. I also learned about many famous philosophers and their general work.",
                "I learned more about doctors' lives and their thought processes in their every diagnosis and interaction with patients. Dr. Morrison also encouraged us to continue challenging ourselves and view the world more critically and insightfully, and ultimately feeding those perceptions and lessons to better ourselves. In particular, I learned about different schools of science philosophy and how they apply to medicine. I also learned the importance of studying humanities courses to simply prepare ourselves to living the world.",
                "I learned a great deal about the medical professions, and how to use the Humanities to think about what we do and where we want to go in life.",
                "We gained a lot of exposure to seminal medical literature and a few fields of philosophy. We had guest speakers, mini lectures, and discussions almost every class, so we had a lot of opportunity to share our thoughts and questions. The class is really interdisciplinary, but that allowed me to feel like I've come away with grounder, improved understanding of fundamental philosophical questions in science and medicine."

            "comments": [
                "The content of this course is very strong and has a wonderful opportunity for learning. It could be improved by leaning more into the seminar format rather than scripted lectures, so that students have a better chance at parsing through some of the more challenging texts and interesting ideas. All the guests are incredible and add to the class, however, they can be a bit frequent.",
                "Strengths: The course gives an in depth look into many aspects of the medical field such as the mindset of doctors, areas for improvement, and leading research. But by observing and contemplating with such detail the field of medicine, I think the course teaches more broadly how brilliant people of the past have lived their lives and how we as students should critically analyze the decisions we make everyday in terms of choosing a career that would be meaningful to us and the world. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "This couse was great. All students were fully engaged in the discussions and the readings for the class were all interesting and insightful leading to great conversation. Also, the format of the course, specifically the essay assignments, allow the student to apply the knowledge from classs to their own life in their own individual way.",
                "Strengths - hands down one of the best courses I will ever take at Yale, most of which is because of Dr. Morrison. I would take this class just to meet a professor who is so kind, knowledgeable, helpful, warm and cares deeply about your personal and academic growth.",
                "Strengths: The kindest professor! Additionally, the readings are across a broad array of sources and topics, and I particularly enjoyed some of the medical stories and books we read. I also appreciated the introductions to some philosophers, their work and their history. Other than the readings, essays or the presentation were reasonable asks with lots of time for us to work on in advance.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Our class size was just slightly over the normal size of a seminar, and there was just a slightly noticeable impact in discussions. Partly because of the number of students but primarily because we always had so much to learn about, some lecture classes would have time for just two questions. Discussions, on the other hand, sometimes came to a crawl because people had already participated, and for some reason, we didn't always have those fully fledged, multiple-person discussions. While there was always something interesting in the readings, we mostly didn't have time to get to all the assigned readings, and a select few felt unnecessarily long or a bit out of our recent discussion topics.",
                "I'd say everything was great! My only weakness for this course, which is not from anyone's fault but the situation we're put in, is that we could not see each other in person in a physical classroom setting. \r\n\r\nHowever, everything else was great. I already said this in the personal thank you email to Dr. Morrison, but I am sincerely grateful for all that he taught us in the past few months. Before the semester started, I was actually getting serious burn-outs with the pandemic and social isolation. I had forgotten why I wanted to become premed and was simply trying to check the 'premed checkboxes' without truly letting my heart\/passion resonate with the activities. \r\nDuring these difficult times, Medicine and Humanities seminar was like an oasis that slowly but certainly returned to me hope and purpose in life. It reminded me of what series of events and feelings I had gone through before coming to Yale and granted me the chance to think about who I am and how I want to live my life. Allowing such questions and directions of life to develop in me is probably the foremost important quality of a humanities class.",
                "This course is far and away the best course I have taken, at Yale or otherwise. Dr. Morrison's level of engagement and enthusiasm is unrivaled and very contagious. I am not a huge literature fan, but Dr. Morrison made me love the readings, and I got a lot out of them and out of writing the papers. I could go on and on, but I'll just say: get Dr. Morrison to teach more classes! He is an absolute rockstar of a teacher and brings the most fascinating guest lecturers. The course was a pleasure, no suggested improvements."

                "One thing that was a remarkable success was a virtual tour of the \"brain museum\" at the Cushing Center at Yale. Even though seminar classes inherently sacrifice a lot due to having to meet online, getting some of the feel that this class would have had in any other year was enjoyable. Another thing that was a massive success was the ability to bring in guest speakers - they no longer had to make it to New Haven to speak but could rather speak from their own homes all across the globe, giving us the insight that after all our medical superheroes are people too. \r\n\r\nOne thing that could be improved is the time for one on one discussion with classmates. The class project was very enjoyable inherently because it allowed for the ability to work with someone else from the class and discuss our takeaways, thoughts, etc.",
                "Although we were not in person, the discussion still went smoothly over Zoom. Also, Dr. Morrison was still able to have guest speakers almost every class which allowed for even more engagement.",
                "As a seminar, everyone had their cameras on most of the time. Dr. Morrison had a cool way of ensuring people did participate by going around and asking students to read quotes or passages in his lectures.",
                "Dr. Morrison was generous in granting extensions during difficult times in COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, for the midterm paper, I was stressed out by my family's direct contact with someone who tested positive for COVID. When I explained the situation, he gladly gave an extension. \r\n\r\nI'd also say despite the online form of learning, students were able to discuss insightful thoughts about the readings. Dr. Morrison fostered an encouraging environment, in which we can all speak up when we have our hands up, and I also loved his comments in response to what we shared. \r\n\r\nFinally and most importantly, I think online schooling definitely had its challenges, but it also allowed us to talk to guest speakers, some of whose readings we had read for the week.",
                "Zoom provided a really cool opportunity to bring in a lot of guest speakers. All things considered, the seminar still had a pretty intimate atmosphere. At the same time, the lack of unscheduled time before and after class to chat with other students made it difficult to get to know peers."

I originally had the worry that this course was out of my domain since I am not a pre-med student but that couldn't be further from the truth. Nothing in this course requires prerequisite knowledge of medicine, and the course served as a kick-start to my interest in medicine. As long as Professor Morrison is teaching this course, I would suggest taking it without hesitation. I thoroughly enjoyed every guest lecture and class discussion we had, and this course applies to life, not just any sub-branch of medicine.",

This class taught valuable skills and information about the humanities and approaching situations or ethics that can be applicable to anyone's life and Dr. Morrison did a great job of explaining this information to the class.",
