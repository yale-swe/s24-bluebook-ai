    "This class is a wonderful introduction to child development.",
    "I learned so much from this course. I can arguably say that this is a course that I learned the most throughout my Yale career. \r\nFirst, I learned how to write with clarity. I was given detailed feedback on how to write, and these feedbacks were tailored to individual growth. Second, this class was a great means to do some self-reflection. The class created a safe place where everyone was invited to speak up and share their beliefs and values. This safe place allowed you to become a good observer in the observation- and I could relate it back to my background as well.",
    "I learned how to become a better observer, differences in play amongst 3-5 year olds at different early childhood education programs, and how to conduct a child assessment.",
    "I learned a lot about early childhood education and child development.",
    "How to observe young children and analyze their behaviors",
    "I learned, for the first time, stages of child development in terms of linguistics, sociality, and cognition as well as general intelligence. I also learned some basics of child observation!",
    "A lot about early childhood education and whats important about play & literacy"

   "comments": [
    "The strengths are that the class is structured very well that the readings are very relevant to the observations and themes for each week. Also, clear feedbacks are given.",
    "The observations at Calvin Hill and other early childhood programs, lectures by individuals who are experts in their respective fields, and conducting our own child assessments were all strengths. One way the course could be improved would be switching classrooms one week to observe, firsthand, the differences in curriculum among the threes, fours, and fives at Calvin Hill.",
    "The readings are really interesting and Nancy and Carla are so knowledgeable! The observations are so great-- they are the best part of the course. The class is a little disorganized though, and there isn't a lot of discussion because there are so many guest speakers.",
    "Strengths: lectures, feedback given on assignments, the teachers, the final assignment\r\nWeaknesses: more discussion between the students would be nice",
    "I love it! Really cool guest lectures"

    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It was a wonderful experience and a great class.",
    "I very much do. This class would require to stretch out of your comfort zone for sure. But, do not be alarmed! The professors have structured the class very well that you will be given clear instructions and guidelines throughout the course. Does that mean this class is a dead end that stifles your creativity? Not at all. In fact, this class would be an excellent course where the teachers will actually take into account individual differences (whether it is your writing style or your weakness\/strengths or even your cultural background) and help you develop your own writing style.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was well-structured, the materials relevant and fascinating, and Professor Close and Horwitz are wonderful, caring people. Highly recommend!",
    "Yes-- the observations are fun and you learn a lot!",
    "Yes of course! It is a great course to learn about early education.",
    "absolutely, it was one of the more personally engaging and satisfying classes I've taken at yale.",
    "Yes!! The kids are so cute"
