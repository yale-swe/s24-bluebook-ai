                "I learned about wetland ecosystem function and restoration",
                "I learned a lot about wetlands, specifically the scientific, regulatory, and policy perspectives! i appreciate the way that this course broadened my perspective on what a wetland is and what it can provide",
                "I learned how to identify different types of wetlands, the ecological benefits they provide, and the natural and anthropogenic threats they are under. I learned to identify wetland plants and animals, as well as identify in the field what category of wetlands were present. We thought critically in class about mitigation plans for preserving, replacing, and restoring wetlands as well as the pros and cons of each one. Wetland protection policy was another main focus of the class, and I felt like I now have a solid foundational understanding of what that includes.",
                "We learned about different types of wetlands, how to classify/delineate wetlands, the governmental agencies that control the management of wetlands (such as EPA), and recent regulations. We went through several case studies of people/entities/companies who wanted to destroy wetlands for different construction projects, and how wetland scientists (including hydrologists and soil scientists) would determine if it's a good idea. We also learned about impacts of climate change on wetlands (including how bogs degrade and release carbon), how wetlands sequester (or surprisingly release) carbon. We also learned about wetland carbon banks and mitigation banks, and the policy behind them. We learned about wetland flora and fauna such as obligate plants, animals (such as beavers and their importance as ecosystem engineers), and invasive species. We also read a LOT of primary literature (5-6+ papers per week)."

                "I loved the wetlands in the news component, it was very interesting to learn about the different challenges in managing wetlands in the US and around the world. The professor did a fantastic job in incorporating insights and case studies from wetlands based outside the US, making it very enjoyable and well-rounded especially for international students. Field trips were also well-organized and very effective - couldn't ask for a better experience learning wetlands! No significant weakness.",
                "Very well structured class, very engaging atmosphere. Its was great to get to go to the field and experience what we learned in class! Some more international case studies would have been super interesting.",
                "Very similar class each week which made it very stale.",
                "it was very repetitive and boring at time to be honest and the content and readings often felt to similar",
                "This course could have been boiled down into half of a semester. It addressed extremely intuitive aspects of ecology and discussion around wetland management and climate change mitigation was extremely redundant and lacked nuance",
                "One strength of this course is the wetland in the news presentations, which allow students to present on things of interest to them and broaden the scope of the class that way. I also think the student-led discussions could be improved by changing the format from a presentation towards more of a facilitation, so that more of the class would do the readings and engage with the discussion.",
                "i thought the assignments were really well-planned, and made the course activities manageable and engaging. the amount of reading each week felt very accessible, and i thought this really helped me feel like i was able to engage fully with the course materials. I think class discussion was also a really strong part of the class, and I felt most engaged on days when more of the class was taken up by class discussion, which happened more frequently later in the semester.",
                "I love the size of the class and the structure of part lecture part student discussion. I felt more engaged this way, more inclined to do each day's readings, and generally more excited about coming to learn. I think the student discussions felt quite redundant sometimes due to our own lack of knowledge of the subject, and it felt like we discussed the same things in our small group breakouts no matter the topic of the lecture that day. I really enjoyed the field part of the class, and feel like field trips should become a larger part of the course! I felt like I learned the most when applying class knowledge in the field, and the least when trying to apply class knowledge to papers we read.",
                "Strengths: almost everything. There was a good balance of focus between the policy and regulations behind wetlands vs. the natural science and classification behind wetlands such as soil, hydrology, vegetation, fauna, etc.\r\nWeaknesses: weaker discussions likely due to laptops. There should be a minimal laptop policy or some other mitigation method. I understand laptops are important in pulling up readings and documents, but some students were distracted and it felt like both a physical and mental barrier to facilitate discussion. However, most students were thoughtful and engaged."

                "Definitely! This course has a nice balance of breadth (in terms of exposure to the natural science and policy side of things for wetlands) and depth where readings are carefully chosen so that they do not overwhelm students but facilitate learning. Field trips and discussions are effective and fun. This course truly embodies how learning about something important can be fun and looked forward to.",
                "Definitely recommend, it is a very specific class but the concepts and ideas taught are very relevant for many ecosystems today and it was helpful to dive deep into one of those very complex groups of ecosystems. We learned from industry experts and knew early when to prepare for presentations and field trips.",
                "I would not recommend unless you have specific interest in wetlands",
                "I would NOT recommend this course to other students. Even if you plan on specifically working in wetlands management, this course will not prepare you for outside work, and also doesn't provide enough ecological learning to justify its name: ecology and management. Take an ecology course instead, or take an environmental management course, but do not take this course. The field trips were the best part of the class, as they provided enrichment and application, however, there were only two. There should be many more.",
                "Not unless wetlands are a particular area of interest for you.",
                "definitely! i think that this course provides a really comprehensive and in-depth look at a specific aspect of the environment, so this type of class is not as common in the normal EVST offerings but definitely worth taking!",
                "I would recommend this course! It does a great job of talking about science while talking about management, and further how those two things continue to impact each other throughout the existence of a wetland.",
                "Yes! Wetlands are CRUCIAL in the world's ecosystem but unfortunately they are often overlooked as \"swamps\". Taking this course will hopefully spark an awareness of wetlands and their importance in supporting flora and fauna."
