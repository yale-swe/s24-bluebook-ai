I feel like the skills I honed in the most were my research and synthesizing skills, as well as critical thinking.",

                "This class gave me the structure to learn how to write a 25-page paper which definitely made me feel more empowered to do more serious history research in general. Prof Marcus was very available to meet and discuss the project and the workshop format at the end of the class was great for working through ideas. Also the pacing of the different stages of requirements for the paper (bibliography, outline, etc.) was super helpful for getting it done on time.",

I felt like there was definitely a much heavier emphasis on Jewish points of view.",
                "Chill but maybe a little too chill",
                "I really enjoyed that the readings in this class were almost entirely primary sources; it felt like it allowed us to consistently engage in the historical method rather than just rehashing the secondary literature. I also felt like the structure for completing the 25-page essay was very helpful. One area of improvement is that I feel like Prof Marcus felt like he had to structure the seminar discussion more than was really necessary. Especially towards the beginning of the semester he clearly had a set of key points that he wanted to hit in the discussion that he was guiding us through, but it didn't leave much room for us to explore in depth things that we might find interesting but that weren't on his agenda. That being said, as the semester went on he let us lead the discussion much more. I just wish he had done so earlier because I think we were ready to sooner than he realized.",

This course felt more as an examination of Jewish points of view, and there was a lot of focus on polemics.",
                "Yes if you want to write the paper and have some interest in religious studies",
                "I would recommend this class if you're interested in the subject matter and prepared to write a slightly longer research paper. If you find the paper daunting, I would say that the class is very well structured to support you through it. Be aware that the seminar might be slightly more professor-led than one might like. Prof Marcus by no means lectures the whole time, but especially earlier in the semester he does heavily structure the discussion in a way that makes it a little less free-flowing. He did do that less as the semester went on, though.",
