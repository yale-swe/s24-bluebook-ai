                "I learned so much about social movements including resource mobilization theory, collective identity construction, media framing, and political opportunity structure.

This was my first time incorporating theory into a research paper, and I actually kinda enjoyed it! Dean Barlow gives you multiple chances for experiential learning (i.e. researching a real-world, active activist or local movement)go for it! It felt very fulfilling. One insight from the course: identity and strategic movements are not mutually exclusive, and the ways they overlap can define a movements outcomes.",

                "The class discussions were facilitated very well. Both the students and Dean Barlow were highly engaged in conversations.",
                "Strength is that you definitely learn different words to describe aspects of a social movement. And the assessments are interesting and engaging because you get to pick your own activist, and movement, to apply what we learn to actual real life situations and write papers on them. So that was fun! You also get to learn a BIT about the histories of different movements, but thats definitely not the focus of the class so if you want the history of social movements only, don't take this course. \r\nI guess weakness would be that sometimes the readings were too long, and it felt occasionally like we just jumped from topic to topic without finding a thread through them all.",
                "It was heavily discussion-based, which aided my understanding of the materials. Also, the daily discussion posts were a helpful little recap of the daily readings.",
                "One strength was that the readings were very interesting and were not repetitive. However, one weakness was that we spent the majority of the time of discussion going over the readings.",
                "The course was very clearly structured. I enjoyed how the lessons were organized thematically. I also enjoyed the assignments, which allowed us to focus on social movements of our own choosing. Of course, the class is probably better taught in person. However, Dean Barlow did a wonderful job keeping us engaged.",
                "Strengths: Dean Barlow is very understanding and receptive to student feedback; she did frequently check in to ask if assignments were interesting/too much/made sense with the level of understanding we were developing throughout the course. The discussion style of the course was also really nice and the class was able to engage with all the material, even some of the denser readings, pretty well. We also had some really cool guest speakers. \r\nWeaknesses: I can't think of any significant weaknesses. The course is pretty heavy on the political science theory behind social movements, which can be repetitive at times, but I personally found that interesting. I will say we don't get much feedback on the essays we submit, but Professor Barlow does always say she is willing to go over your grading one-on-one if that is something you'd like.",
                "Strengths: lots! - Diverse means of learning (reading, blogs, discussion, breakout rooms, guest speakers, research papers) that all felt fulfilling - Dean Barlow is a wonderful professor who expertly leads discussion - Mixture of (mainly) scholarly theoretical papers, but also a good number of more informal, activist-penned accounts. - Atmosphere: Our seminar truly felt like a seminar, where the discussion flowed organically, people brought up their original ideas, and the atmosphere felt just right (not too formal nor informalfriendly, inclusive, and focused). Weaknesses: hard to think of any. - perhaps historical, narrative-like accounts could have taken a larger share of the reading list, or Dean Barlow could have paired each scholarly, theory piece with an informal, news-related or activist-authored piece for application?",
                "Strengths: interesting readings (if you like political theory and how it applies to social movements), great course structure, interesting assignments, Dean Barlow is awesome, my classmates always had very insightful things to say. It was also interesting to learn about countermovements / more conservative social movements, which I didn't expect. \r\nWeaknesses: Can't think of any",
                "I think the discussion format was really great and encouraged all students to participate and talk in class which was nice, and theres not much I would change."

                "The course was set up like a seminar based around discussion over Zoom. I think it worked pretty well; our class usually engaged in pretty lively discussion and if there were any lulls Dean Barlow was always able to step in and redirect the conversation. We were put into breakout rooms periodically to discuss certain material/scenarios which I think was helpful; sometimes 10 minutes to discuss certain scenarios was a little bit too much time though.",
                "I really appreciated Dean Barlows inclusion of blogs, breakout rooms, and guest speakersfeatures she added (or adapted) really well for the virtual class setting. Short bi-weekly blogs gave us the chance to process what we read and hear other students thoughtsand Dean Barlow incorporated students blog questions/comments into discussion, which always enhanced discussion. Breakout rooms changed the rhythm, gave us a chance to discuss (perhaps a bit more candidly) in groups of three-four. Finally, the guest speakers were fantastic: they introduced real-life narratives from various professions (one journalist, one activist) that connected with our readings and allowed for real-world applications. The two speakers were wonderful features of this course, especially given virtual teaching conditions!",

                "Absolutely! This class was, by far, one of my favorite classes of my first year. Dean Barlow was an amazing professor who was clearly knowledgeable in her field. Even though we often tackled dense readings, the discussions were always enjoyable and lively.",
                "Yes! If you have the space in your schedule and are interested in learning about how social movements form, I would definitely recommend this class. It's also very relevant to our current moment. Even though I am usually a STEM person, this class was engaging and interesting.",
                "For sure I would. This course will add to your knowledge of how social movements actually work theres so many structural dynamics that go into a movement, and this course raises lots of important questions that any social movement participant or leader should consider. In some seminars, it can be harder to find chances to speak here Dean Barlow encourages everyone to speak to their satisfactionthis is a great course to practice speaking your mind (and even debating), which I feel many classes dont facilitate. Finally, Dean Barlow is a wonderful professor and discussion leader.",

I genuinely enjoyed all of the discussions we had in class. This seminar definitely prepared me for my future classes."
