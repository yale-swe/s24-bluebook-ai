   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Moderately cool material. \r\nWeaknesses: Professor literally could not be worse.",
    "The material was very interesting, but Andrew Barron was a challenging instructor to learn from.",
    "The only prereq for this class is S&DS 241, but there should be some additional prereqs. Professor Barron brings in information from a lot of other S&DS classes, including Markov chains and hypothesis testing, which he does a good job giving a high level overview of. However, it would be better if a student taking this class had prior background in these areas.",
    "The content is interesting and the textbook is decent. Problem sets were somewhat dry but reasonable, and it was good to have them every week so you didn't get rusty. The course itself moved far too slowly - Professor Barron is very kind and clearly cared about both the students and the material, but lectures were often dry\/slow (hence lower student engagement). Too much time was spent focusing on historical details instead of presenting the material, and we barely covered the end material (which seemed very interesting). Sometimes the material also didn't feel particularly coherent.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- good overview of a lot of different topics\r\n- good textbook with good problems\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- professor's lectures are almost orthogonal to psets and exams",
    "The lectures were quite disorganized and the psets were often not that aligned with what we did in class. The second exam was substantially longer and more difficult than the first, which was frustrating.",
    "The strength of this class is the offering of the course itself. Other college does not usually offer Information Theory for undergraduates.",
    "Have someone else teach it if you're gonna offer it, I guess.",
    "This course covers interesting material, but Cover's text is not well-organized for learning, and the absence of clear connection between lecture and homework could be frustrating."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "No. Not with this professor at least.",
    "I would take this class as a \"capstone\" after having taken many other classes in the S&DS department. This class provides a useful way of viewing things that you learned in other S&DS classes. However, it can be confusing if you haven't had these classes beforehand.",
    "With caution, I would. The material itself is super interesting, accessible, and relevant to a variety of fields. But be wary of who is teaching it -- it can still get dry, and problem sets can feel somewhat mechanical.",
    "At this time, I would not recommend the course to people who are reliant on lecture to do psets. I felt throughout the course that the material covered in lecture was an attempt to challenge us more than it tried to reinforce our complete understanding, which left me lost while trying the psets. The textbook is very good, so most of this course was self taught by the end. His exams are very fair.",
    "No, I wouldn't recommend this class. Professor Barron's lectures started well but within a few weeks they became kind of disorganized and filled with somewhat confusing tangents. The textbook also isn't particularly helpful or well-written, so understanding how to use the material that you learn was a challenge. Also, the class had two exams, and the first was very easy but the second one was much longer and more difficult. In general, it was hard to gauge what we needed to know. Beyond the technical aspects of the class, the topic itself ended up not being particularly engaging or enlightening.",
    "Please, don't take anything that Barron is teaching. He simply doesn't know how to teach. Basically everyone thought so.",
    "This covers an interesting topic, but I would not recommend if Barron is teaching--lectures devolved, and I felt I could learn equally well\/better just from reading the text."
