                "This course allows for a  lot of exploration but requires discipline to allocate sufficient time for the weekly creative writings. The prof was very encouraging. It would have been great to have more guidance or smaller practices to apply our learning to different kinds of writing.",
                "strengths: Verlyn's an amazing professor and offers a lot of useful feedback and general tips that help you understand your writing\r\nweaknesses: none",
                "The course was very easy to stay on top of, due to its limited expectations outside of a small weekly essay. Verlyn is absolutely a strength  his insight, critiques, and great personality made the class extremely engaging and helpful. The class itself is a bit too long, though. Students became tired towards the end.",
                "Verlyn was a wonderful professor and the course format was conducive to building comfort writing.",
                "This course is AMAZING! Verlyn is great and so so helpful, this was one of my favorite classes. Even with 15-20 students in the class, I consistently received really personalized feedback and comments on my writing. This class is phenomenal.",
                "Strengths: manageable workload (1 essay a week about anything) with no tricks (no final, midterm, reading week etc). The class is interesting because the prof is interesting. Nothing surprises you, you know what class will be like and what you need to do outside of it. You get to write about anything which is enjoyable and refreshing. It's also not difficult writing because you are meant to be as short and clear as possible.",
                "The strengths of this course were the small classroom setting and schedule of each weekly seminar. The professor cultivated a stress-free environment, where many other writing classes feel more vulnerable. Criticism, regardless of the specifics, came from a place of care and investment in the improvement of the students' writing.\r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses of the course, I feel I learned about people's backgrounds and interests through their writing, but never got the chance to talk with many of them. This may be no fault but my own."

                "Yes! This is a great way to work on your writing because you write a piece each week and receive plenty of feedback that can help you develop your next piece. Verlyn's a great professor who cares a lot about his students and helping his students become better writers.",
                "Absolutely. I have become a  far better writer because of the critiques and suggestions on my work.",

                "Yes! This was an amazing writing class that focuses on simple and clear language. It feels very applicable to future writing that is not academic. Even something as simple as emails. The prof was great and had a lot of interesting stories to tell. Class never lasted the whole 2.5 hours.",
