And now I have a sense of the ways all those strands intertwine in the Comedy. More generally, I developed strategies for understanding and appreciating a challenging work from another era. You'll carry around some mind-blowing passages or insights from lecture or section with you forever.",
                "I learned that it is necessary to read the Divine Comedy in its entirety to understand Dante's intent behind each canticle as the three are highly interdependent. I also learned so much about the purpose behind Dante's writing of the Comedy, as well as his take on the corruption of the papacy and his interesting way of defining love.",
                "We read the entire divine comedy! Always something I've wanted but haven't had the time to do.",

                "I felt that I learned how to effectively study and prepare meaningful questions for in-class discussions, successfully analyze literature through new theological or historical lenses, and grow a large appreciation for the awe-inspiring medieval literature of Dante's Divine Comedy.",
                "knowledge: dante's divine comedy, dante's vita nuova, historical (and modern!) context to dante's divine comedy because christiana is just that good\r\nskills: critical thinking\r\ninsights: how relevant dante's divine comedy still is. how illogical binary thinking is. how important discussions are.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Awesome lectures that really illuminated the text. Short but dense readings were very manageable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the memorization required for quizzes and assessments (specifically canto numbers), in the experience of many students, didn't really augment our learning.",
                "Strengths: The lectures are super informative and fascinating. I learned so much about Dante through Professor Purdy Moudarres' lecture more than I could have through the commentary that came with the text. Professor Purdy Moudarres' passion for Dante and medieval culture shines in her lectures! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is a lot of memorization required for the passage id section of the quizzes and exams, which can be a bit tedious. Having both a final exam and final paper at the end of the semester can also be grueling if you are bad at time management. No weaknesses otherwise!",
                "It is a considerable amount of reading, but the content is interesting enough to make it doable even for those of us who don't read much otherwise. The lectures are very engaging and go in depth on commentary that add to the comedy considerably.",
                "I felt that this course was the perfect first-semester course to take. It helped me develop the necessary skills and understanding to perform at an expected standard of Yale students and to go beyond and truly explore the deep truths and fascinating ideologies brought up through a close reading of these books.",
                "strengths: christiana. i love her so much. she is a brilliant storyteller who weaves together historical and modern context for dante's divine comedy, which made even the most \"boring\" cantos (according to popular opinion by current dante scholars) exciting to analyze. i walked into this class a skeptic in more ways that one. when christiana told us that everything was in dante's divine comedy, i thought \"wow. no way.\" her passion compelled me to stay in the course though, and i fell in love with dante's approach to critical thinking. as a stem student, i didn't realize how discouraged i had felt about learning until christiana and dante revived my own passion for learning. this class is the reason that i am now deciding to double-major. this is, without a doubt, one of my favorite classes of all time at yale.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the classroom we had to learn in was cramped. i'm left-handed, so those desks were... frustrating, to say the least. i also personally found it hard to keep up with christiana's speaking because we were required to handwrite all our notes - while i believe that handwriting does help with memory, i have always found it easier to remember what i type, especially because i am a horribly slow writer. in this way, i think it would be nicer if digital notes were allowed. (then again, i do understand that there's more risk for distraction)",
                "Strengths: lecture content is really interesting and lectures are well organized, the poem is amazing. Each reading assignment is pretty short, which gives students the opportunity to read the text with a lot of care, something I hugely appreciated. Weaknesses: opportunities to engage creatively with the text and share ideas could be more robust - maybe this is because it's a relatively large lecture course.",
                "Strengths: Christianas lectures are simply amazing. The Divine Comedy is one of the greatest works ever written and you are given the opportunity to really dive into it. Weakness: Having to memorize the Canto numbers for the quizzes and exams was a bit much at times.",
                "Strengths: sheer knowledge and passion of the professor, a great opportunity to explore one legendary work of literature over an entire semester, an active Canvas forum for discussion, great TAs \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: pace moved very quickly, especially in the second half of the coursealthough that is hard to prevent because we read all 100 cantos! \r\nI found I missed a lot of religious references that other students with a background in Christian thought saw easilysometimes the professor assumed a much deeper knowledge of the Bible than I had. Perhaps more basic explanations of key Christian themes/characters would be helpful.",
                "I loved inferno and liked purgatory but didnt love paradise",
                "Strengths: great way to read the complete Commedia. Dante's journey is so ambitious, and it's amazing every time we find another character or idea that's linked to several previously mentioned ones (vertical reading!). Professor Moudarres is a Dante expert and great lecturer. Her overviews of the readings we had done were always very interesting, packed with explorations of a religious allegory or surveying interpretations of a curiously strange detail in a canto.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this semester, our class was more a leminar than a seminar. I wasn't able to meet all my peers or hear about their thoughts and takes, and it took slightly more courage to raise uncertain questions in class. The work, including ~ 8 cantos (chapters) per week, weekly discussion posts, and passage-recognition quizzes every two weeks, was heavier than I expected and sometimes took away from my focus on the text (though it was probably necessary to motivate me to keep up with readings). I'm almost curious in how the class might be different if there were two essays and less quizzes/discussion posts?",
                "I was not prepared for the amount of memorization that would be required for this course and the difficulty of the exams, especially since I was just taking it for fun. I think more study sessions and memorization aids could be useful. The TFs and Professor Purdy Moudares were so enthusiastic and amazing though! They made the content so much more interesting.",
                "Strengths: the Professor!!! Professor Purdy Moudarres is absolutely incredible and kind and understanding and super knowledgeable about the subject. Her passion for the class is evident in her teachings. Amazing TAs! I really enjoyed the lectures but they could go by really fast so I was scrambling to write notes. The sections were also really nice to ask questions and get things clarified. The discussion posts were low-pressure and a really nice way to hold yourself accountable to the readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None really. The quizzes could be stressful sometimes since with passage identification, there's a lot to cover, but Prof responds and listens to our feedback and gave us a list of passages covered / talked about in class to help us prepare. Also. the quizzes are such a tiny part of your grade anyways.",
                "The strength of this class is that there are no surprises in terms of the workload/coursework. Our weeks looked the same. However, this was also a weakness in that the class felt a little monotonous."

                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to explore Dante, or more generally, go out on a limb to delve deep into a challenging but rewarding pocket of history and literature. However, for anyone looking for a literature class, know that as the semester progresses, Catholic theology becomes more central to the later parts of the Divine Comedy, and the time spent in lecture, reading, or studying necessarily includes more of it. It's not a typical literature classwhich can be a plus or minus depending on what you're looking for.",
                "Yes, if they have a passion for Classics and/or the Bible and are interested in learning how Dante amalgamates the two in his text! However, if they are simply looking for an easy humanities credit, they may want to reconsider, as the material is fascinating but requires much reflection and consideration.",
                "I would, I already have actually! It's a great excuse to read a phenomenal piece of classic literature, and the commentary adds to the understanding considerably",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student because I believe it not only prepares a student for complex, in-depth readings and studies of literary masterpieces, but it is truly an engaging course with animated class lectures and meaningful class sections.",
                "999% recommend this course. PLEASE take this course no matter what you are majoring in. as a stem major, this course made me reevaluate everything about how I see the world, how I see my research, and how I see myself. this is an incredibly engaging course with one of the most passionate professors you can find at yale.",
                "Yes. This course took a while to grow on me - I didn't love Inferno, and I came away from some of the early readings and lectures asking myself \"so what?\" As the semester progressed, I started to engage a lot more with the poem. I find it kind of shocking that few people read Purgatory and, especially, Paradise. For me these two canticles that are most revealing of Dante's worldview and, by extension, the context in which he wrote. I can say that, having read the whole work, I agree with Prof. Purdy Moudarres' claim that \"everything is in it.\" I'm also surprised by the extent to which it is in everything - towards the end of the semester, I found myself noticing Dante references and resonances all over the place, in my other classes and in my life. It is an incredible poem, and I came away from the class feeling like I had read something foundational. I don't think I would have gotten half as much out of the poem had I not had the context provided in lecture, but the course is worth taking for the experience of reading the Comedy alone.",
                "Absolutely! This is a once in a life time opportunity to study one of the greatest works of art ever with an amazing instructor, an opportunity to be delivered from a dark wood to paradisedont miss out!",
                "I would probably recommend this class if you are interested in Catholicism, Italy, or just have a general curiosity about medieval thought. Professor Purdy Moudarres is so knowledgeable and also so sweet. This class had more of a focus on quizzes and exams than a typical literature class, but I feel I learned so much and overall I loved this class.",
                "Yes, I really liked the class. The Comedy is more Italy-focused than I expected, but I'm glad I read it and can appreciate references to it.",
                "Yes! New perspectives and stories",
                "Yes, if they are excited to read the one poem for a whole semester. It is by no means an easy courserequires a lot of memorization and juggling of many themes and ideas.\r\nAlso be prepared to feel in the dark at times if you do not know much about Christianity or Virgils Aeneid, which Dante references a lot.",
                "Yes",
                "Possibly! Completing the whole trilogy was very satisfying  a journey in and of itself. I feel more cultured with stories, quotes, and religious or medieval figures that are still referenced today. However, while we weren't actually assigned that many pages per week, the text can be dense, and the work of weekly discussion posts and quizzes every three weeks was sometimes more stressful and time-consuming than I had anticipated.",
                "I would take this if you're into the classics or if it counts towards your major somehow. I was taking this for kicks, it did nothing for my major or graduation requirements, and it took a lot of time away from my required classes.",
                "If you're interested in Medieval history and/or the Divine Comedy, then this course is certainly for you!",
                "YES!!!!! Definitely! For students of any major! This is your chance to read the Divine Comedy for the first time, second time, third time -- it doesn't matter! There will always be something new to learn and discover. This is a pretty chill class with usually ~3 cantos/ class and a quiz every 2 weeks. The midterms are fair and the final paper gives you a lot of creative leeway in what you want to write about.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone interested in doing a thorough read of Dante's Divine Comedy."
