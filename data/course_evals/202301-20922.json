            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the course is a very open way to approach dissection and oriented as a self-guided exploration each day rather than a long lecture or highly structured process. \r\nWeaknesses: I do think that some video lecture before hand that students could optionally view that reflects what the specimen actually looks like would be very helpful. The diagrams make it challenging to translate to the physical specimen. Coming from other labs which are highly structured and specific, it was actually a bit of a shock to have little preparation for lab day.",
                "I think the major weakness of this course was that it should have been more structured, maybe with some sort of identification or questions due at the end of each lab. There were many times the lab felt a bit aimless which was really tough when we were dissecting animals which is sad enough even when you feel like you are advancing your scientific knowledge.",
                "The actual lab days felt very helpful for learning and the daily prompts, while sometimes challenging, felt like a good way to engage with the content. The lab practicals involved an absolutely ludicrous amount of rote memorization of the names of anatomical features, and for the dissections, the features we were expected to identify were often obscured, damaged from the get-go, or simply not present in our individual specimens. Therefore you would be asked to identify an object that you might not have ever actually seen in person, based on a list of dozens and dozens of anatomical features. This was especially difficult for the musculoskeletal systems, which constitute a significant portion of the course and are incredibly difficult due to the number of things to be memorized and the fact that you also need to memorize the difference between different species, such as memorizing almost every bone in the skull and then being asked to apply it to a crocodile, human, dolphin, and cat, where the bones are significantly different.",
                "The first practical was hard for no reason, really difficult. Make it more condensed and focused. Prof learned and made the second one better but still would've been better to not have had the first one cause so much stress. All of the specimens were also super fuN!"

                "If it is required, it is not a bad course and you will learn a lot of useful skills. If you are not a E&EB major than I would recommend taking a different course, as this one would be very challenging if you don't have course background and/or are not taking the lecture."
