    "A good overview of Western music from the medieval period to the present day.",
    "Analyzing music and understanding its relevance to history",
    "background info on music",
    "One thing I can say about this course--without a doubt--is that I learned how to listen to music and identify the following: what era the music belongs to (from Medieval plainchant to Modern atonal jazz) and 2) why (instruments, tonality, orchestration, form, genre, etcetera). I've learned about compositional techniques, significant composers (and Professor Davis and Alexandra, our TA, clearly attempted to move beyond the typical all-white, all-male canon), and genres. I've been exposed to music that I probably wouldn't have been exposed to outside of this course. I've been able to delve deeper into some of my favorite composers, and I'm grateful to have a more detailed and expansive vocabulary that I can use to understand\/describe\/analyze music for myself and others."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It is good for anyone who wants a general overview without much music theory. However, the course progresses so fast that you don't get much detail at all for each period, so it often leaves you wanting for more information.",
    "The lectures could be more oriented towards exams",
    "Broad range of topics covered",
    "Strengths: Both Alexandra and Professor Davis are obviously passionate about music, and I thought Professor Davis effectively conveyed to us her vast musical knowledge with each lecture. I found both writing assignment super worthwhile and enjoyable. For the first one, we were required to analyze\/compare various journal articles that discussed how people listen to music in their everyday lives and subsequently apply those findings to our own lives. For the second one, we were required to see a YSO concert and write about our experiences using our course knowledge. I wish they were weighted more heavily. I left the class feeling A LOT more knowledgeable about various genres of music, from bebop jazz to symphonic works. I loved learning about the evolution of musical genres across time and making connections among genres across time. I'm glad to have taken a class unrelated to my major for the sake of learning new and valuable information about music, which I simply couldn't live without.\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that, despite her beneficent intentions, Professor Davis attempted to cover too much material throughout the semester. A significant portion of our grades came from quizzes (six total, with our worst score dropped). Although we were given study guides to prepare for the quizzes in advance, most study guides included an unreasonable amount of information. I found myself spending hours preparing for these quizzes, and I always felt very stressed. These quizzes were a major source of anxiety for me. Perhaps we should've been required to memorize less information. Perhaps the quizzes should have been structured differently. I'm just not sure they were an effective course component. Moreover, I took notes throughout the semester (we were given handy worksheets to help us follow along with the slides), but note-taking felt increasingly less important throughout the semester because the quiz material was sourced from the study guides that we were also given. I enjoyed the lectures for the content, and I quickly realized that I could mostly just engage with the material without scribbling notes because I wouldn't need them, for the most part. Not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing. I was also VERY stressed before the final exam. We were essentially asked to remember everything we ever learned (while being assured that we'd receive partial credit for incomplete\/vaguely correct answers).  Oh, and since we were quizzed\/tested on songs from our textbook (the review playlist for our final exam included nearly 100 songs), I don't think I could've taken this course without my Spotify premium account (I made playlists to study for each quiz), and that feels unfair. Perhaps the course can subsidize music streaming subscriptions for students?"

    "If you want a light workload for a music course that doesn't include music theory, this is a good option.",
    "yes",
    "Dependent on the student",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if the course covers less material than we were covered this semester. It was just TOO MUCH. I came into this class as a newbie, and I was excited to learn as much as I could. But I found myself feeling overwhelmed all semester long. The course became a source of stress, which made my overall leaning experience much less enjoyable. Moreover, if the course is unchanged, students seeking an easy, straightforward course should understand that this is definitely not a \"gut.\" Every other week or so, you'll need to memorize a significant amount of information for the quiz, which might be stressful. And the final exam is cumulative, which felt unreasonable and unfair. Nonetheless, I am glad that I took this course because I can confidently say that I've learned valuable information that I otherwise wouldn't have learned."
