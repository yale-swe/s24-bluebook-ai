    "This was the first class that I have taken at Yale that gave me some understanding of what economic researchers do and how economists arrive at their conclusions. I gained an understanding of how economists apply econometrics to answer questions about governments, policies, history, and equality. I felt that my understanding of what economics is and how economics works improved immensely. The class assignments allowed me to read, write, and present about economic papers about a topic of my choosing. This was really valuable because I was able to improve my skills in understanding and analyzing economic research.",
    "Learned so much about how taxation works in the world.",
    "I learned a lot about the methods used by the best current economists, got an idea of where the literature stands on some interesting macro questions, and learned a ton about the specific area I did my paper and presentation on. Other people may not feel this way, because there were no exams and you were not required to learn anything, so many people probably did not."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that the strengths of the class were the topics of the lectures and the flexibility of the topic choice for the assignments. I learned so much from the assignments and from the lectures and I improved my understanding of economic research. I thought the class was both a great review of econometrics and an insight into how researchers apply economics. In the future, it would be really interesting to learn more about how economic research translates into governmental policies.",
    "I would much rather have more lectures from Professor Werquin than have student presentations. I would not have been as eager to take the class had I known there would be so many student presentations. Some were actually quite good, but some were less so. I think the course could be improved by setting a definite syllabus before the course begins. Nothing was really clear about the class until it was too late to drop it, and while it ended up being a very worthwhile and interesting class, that is not ideal. I doubt this will be a problem next year, since this semester was the first time Professor Werquin taught the course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely! If it is taught again, I highly recommend. It was a great opportunity to learn about the intersection of government and economics and it was also really fun to be able to have assignments that allow you to explore a topic of your choice.",
    "Yes! I have never taken a class like this one where the professor cares so much about you learning and getting something out of the class. We were given so much freedom on what we wanted to present on and research. The class presentations and professors lectures were thorough and allowed for a great learning experience.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yeah this was a good class. You have the opportunity to learn a lot if you choose to, or you can browse the internet the whole time like most people, but that seems like a waste. Our version of the course only had one 10 page paper and one 45 minute presentation (based on\/related to the paper), so there wasn't much work. Professor Werquin says his only goal to make sure you learn something about a topic you're interested in, and by the time you finish the paper and presentation you will certainly have done so. He is quite helpful and very laid-back about deadlines; he genuinely cares more about his students learning than about his students meeting arbitrary deadlines. If you're looking for a survey of what the best macroeconomists are doing, this is an interesting and relaxed way to find out."
