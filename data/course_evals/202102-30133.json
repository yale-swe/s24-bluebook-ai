            "comments": [
                "A major weakness in this course is its lack of accommodation towards those in engineering\/physical sciences and those interested in computational research. With the majority of the course and cohort having a biology background, it was difficult to navigate things from a physical science perspective.",
                "Strengths: The class possessed a lot of intellectual infrastructure and support with regards to the teaching staff when it came to students that were pursuing research in the biological sciences. There was an in-depth examination of the structure and content of biological scientific literature. The class also provided exposure to many resources across most scientific disciplines, as well as disciplines in the social sciences. On a related note, the class exposed us to the EndNote citation manager software, which in retrospect, was a useful way to compile a centralized bank of scientific literature that could be readily available to cite in any assignment that we were doing for the class. Additionally, the class ultimately did facilitate the development of the endurance and skillset necessary to present a 15-minute talk on scientific research, albeit these presentations did occur virtually. \r\nWeaknesses: This class is not really built for folks who are not involved in research pertaining to the biological sciences. While much of the presentation feedback was most likely helpful across all disciplines, from what I have heard from folks in the program who were involved in research pertaining to the physical sciences, the lecture content was not very helpful or applicable to their own fields of research. It is also pretty inexcusable that all three of the teaching assistants were biologically oriented, yet nearly a third of the students in the program were pursuing research relating to computer science, physics, as well as other physical sciences. Furthermore, there was a lot of inconsistency among the three sections that didn't really even relate to the scientific aspects of the class. Expectations when it came to slide and graphic design, presentation delivery, and harshness of grading were very imbalanced and inconsistent across all three of the sections. On a completely unrelated note, the ArcGIS project was irrelevant to the research that 29 out of the 30 students in the program were pursuing this summer. I would say that the project was a huge distraction from the actual purpose of the program and should not be included in future iterations of the class. I still personally do not understand what the point of the project was, considering we did not learn the software in anywhere near enough detail to use for anything more than personal side projects. While I do understand that ArcGIS can be useful for certain applications, like epidemiology and climate change\/sustainability, the software is best suited for a semester-long course and not really a six-week period in a course that is already operating on somewhat of a compressed schedule.",
                "I really liked the accessibility of the teaching team. I was able to get a lot of feedback on my work and was able to make sure every assignment I submitted was high quality. The course had 3 sections and students were split based on their research topics. Each section had very different experiences with the course. The course was geared towards biology, so students with physics\/engineering based research definitely struggled a lot more than biology focused students.",
                "STRENGTHS: Marina Carlson (thank you marina), my peers (ya'll are sum real ones)\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: this course is so poorly designed and i have no hopes that it will change bc it is a required course only taken by STARS students. we had an extra hour class session added to our already 75 min, 5 days a week schedule. this extra session was required of us without asking what our schedules were and was very pointless. additionally, we were given a group project on ArcGIS, which isn't related to any of our research. this class was definitely more QR than it was WR. for the assignments that actually pertained to scientific communication\/our summer projects (presentations and writing), we would rarely receive feedback and deadlines were not given to us with proper time. i should also mention that we never had a real syllabus for this class.",
                "No strengths.\r\n\r\nThis is easily the worst class I've ever taken at Yale. I was forced to rush my lab results and make conclusions bordering what could ethically be considered from an experiment. The feedback was inconsistent and rarely constructive. Grading is unknown as I am writing this course evaluation.\r\n\r\nI think this course should be completely removed as a requirement for the STARS Summer Program. It only made me have conflicts with my lab and depression on the side. Professor Purushothaman didn't seem to know what was going on, and both he and Michelle Luo were borderline cruel with their feedback, even making some students cry. I'm surprised that Purushothaman holds a position at the Poorvu Center.\r\n\r\nThe ArcGIS part of the course was quite useless and time-consuming as well. Again, I believe this course, as is, is completely useless for doing science, at least beyond biology and medicine, which are the only two disciplines that the instructors and administrators seem to be interested in.",
                "The strength of the course was definitely the availability of our TAs. I had Marina and she was absolutely amazing, encouraging, and always super helpful when I reached out. Dr. Nelson and Marina were the gems of the STARS Summer program <3 \r\n\r\nArcGIS was a huge weakness of the course!! I don't think it really added anything of value to the experience and just caused unnecessary stress amongst all of the students. It also took essential time away from our research presentations and I think the class and outside of class time could've been better spent. Also, the disparities between the three different presentation groups were ASTRONOMICAL. Two of the groups received much harsher critiques that went way past class time and created a negative experience for so many of the STARS students. Not only was the feedback largely negative and defeating for my peers, but it was also very inconsistent depending on the day. I watched many students stay up every night until the crack of dawn changing their slides over and over again when their PIs had approved them but that did not matter to the professors. In the future, I would recommend cutting the ArcGIS aspect of the course and students can still learn teamwork and project management in a less stressful way. Additionally, I would have better communication between all the professors and the TAs so everyone receives the same treatment and experience in the class. Lastly, although this didn't negatively affect me personally, I recognized that most of the expertise of the professors was extremely biology-heavy! Because of that, there was a definite lack of resources for the engineering and astronomy students. They were even pressured to make their research follow a more bio format even though it was not how the papers and presentations are typically done in the field.",
                "The class is oriented more towards students working in the biological sciences. It needs to work on supporting students who are doing other types of research.",
                "This course felt disorganized, especially in the beginning. I was unsure what I would be learning in class and what I would have to prepare. The ArcGIS assignment also felt like unnecessary, additional work that was added on top of the hours of research and reading I was already do. It ultimately caused more stressed and detracted from my efforts in the research itself. The presentation runs also consistently ran over time, which further detracted from research time and caused last minute rushes in gaining results and fixing the presentation itself.",
                "Weaknesses were definitely in the ArcGIS programming overall since it felt like a distraction from what otherwise would be a quality class. Strengths are definitely the professors and TAs",
                "The strengths of this course are the professors who have really good intentions and motivation to help and teach the students as best as they can. The STARS community while taking this class was amazing and a once in a lifetime experience. The TAs also are really helpful and are honestly open to any questions or problems you have.\r\n\r\nAlthough the professors attempt to share their knowledge gained from many years of experience, the method for conveying the information and teaching the class was not helpful. The class was unorganized in many things like deadlines, expectations, resources, and grading. The organization was okay in the beginning, but as the class began to have more projects closer to each other at the end, the lack of clear and standardized feedback and information frustrated many students.",
                "A strength of the class was the direct feedback I received from my professor and TA that understood my topic. After each practice run of my presentation, I felt it get better and appreciate all the feedback received. A weakness of this course was its organization. I was often lost with what the next assignment was and when it was due. The syllabus was posted weeks into the course, and it was not very helpful. It stated the days that class would meet, but additional details on each assignment would have been helpful. With the GIS project, we did not actually receive a description of the assignment. We were told to work on a topic with a team and were in many workshops with GIS team, but we were never explained what our end product was expected to include. We were initially told that on Tuesdays we would only have evening class with the ESRI team, however, we had morning and evening sessions on Tuesdays. It was tiring having to go from early class to lab to go back to class on those days. For our presentations, the feedback was always posted so late. The recordings were sometimes posted the evening before leaving us no time to think through our improvements. Feedback on our final paper were given two days before its due date which made us rush through the revising part. It would also have been helpful if class started and ended at the set time. Many times class started late and ended very late. I was late to lab several times due to how over time class would go.",
                "Strengths: the intensive feedback\r\nWeakness: brutally honest, sometimes rude feedback \r\n\r\nMaybe not be so harsh and rude. Telling us \"weaklings present first and stronger people for last\" was extremely rude and discouraging to those who are already underrepresented in STEM."

The students who pursued research in the physical sciences and computer science experienced a lot of unnecessary stress, frustration, and a significantly larger time commitment to the class, in some cases. A lot of the material taught in the class, according to themselves, is also not very applicable for their own fields.

If with the STARS community, meeting with the other fellow students is also an opportunity not to be missed.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. This course challenged me to understand research articles and to write my own report, something that seemed so out of reach for me. The lab experience with the STARS program helped me envision myself as a scientific researcher which I hope to continue doing during my time at Yale. My presentation skills improved during the summer because of the direct feedback that I received from the instructors.
