Several of the labs are a bit graphic with dissections and human brains and whatnot, so I also learned that I am not meant to be a surgeon.",

                "This course contributed immensely to my knowledge and skills as a neuroscientist. I learned how to work with various animal models (earthworms, frogs, and grasshoppers), operate a variety of equipment (oscilloscope, amplifier, electrical stimulator, microelectrodes, surgical tools, etc.), and collect data in an organized manner. I also refined my note-taking and statistical analysis skills. The pre-lab lectures complemented the material taught in the neurobiology lecture course, and I walked away from this lab with a greater understanding of and appreciation for neuroanatomy, electrophysiology, and transduction.",

                "I think this course could be much better with a different instructor. Professor K is the CEO of longwinded intros and wasting everyone's time with useless information we don't need. He made us stay later almost every lab just because he wanted to lecture us on random tangentially related topics. He is also rude and would constantly shush us and whistle at us if we were talking when he wanted to start talking. And it was never like we were being rowdy or loud. We would literally just be doing the lab, talking to our partner, and he'd whistle at us like we were dogs. The lab materials also failed to work most of the time so that was another reason the labs would take almost the full 4 hours every time.",
                "Great class!",
                "The labs for this course complement the lecture course well, and the pre-lab lectures are helpful for understanding WHY we carry out the experiments we do. It would be helpful in future iterations of the course to update the lab manual and -- in the case of longer labs -- to shorten the number of tasks such that students can collect reliable data without rushing. It was also noted that students in the Tuesday section often did not get data as they were the first section of the week. By the time we got to the Wednesday section (my section), we had a better idea of how to move through the lab efficiently -- but at the cost of the Tuesday students. It would be helpful to go over lab protocols in more detail with the TFs beforehand and to confirm that the pacing is suitable for undergraduates. Additionally, it was quite strenuous to dissect the frog NMJ for four weeks in a row. I feel that three weeks of dissection is more than enough for us to learn the procedure and gather meaningful data. Lastly, while the three TFs in my section were outstanding, they were stretched too thin as nearly every lab bench needed assistance multiple times throughout the lab. In future years, recruitment of a fourth TF would be helpful.",
                "Too much dissection",
                "Strengths - no quizzes so less stress, more laid back and learnt more from the pre lab talks with professors and TAs\r\nWeakness - organization problems, the manual did not align with most of the stuff we did",
                "more tips on how to do well on lab notebooks and lab reports in the beginning of the semester",
                "A more clear indication of what was expected from lab reports. It got better as the semester went along for sure but at the beginning there were times where it was difficult to know what we should make sure to include/if there was a way we could structure the labs. But the TAs were super helpful in giving us feedback which really helped with that later on during the semester.",
                "The lessons we learned in the class were extremely prevalent to real lab work that I will most likely be continuing in the neuroscience field. I really enjoyed being able to complete the micro dissections, as difficult as they were. I did find myself getting emotional with the flies, earthworms and grasshoppers being alive and in pain throughout the lab. I understand the prevalence of the experiments but that definitely made it more difficult for me to focus on the work at hand. Some of the experiments, especially in the bullfrog lessons were a little too fast paced and too dense so they were also hard to fully learn from while we were so focused on keeping up. I did really enjoy the anatomy lab and was very interested in seeing the human brain samples and enjoyed creating my own stain."

The procedures can be challenging, but I found it highly rewarding to phenomena that we had studied reflected in our data. What's more, no other course at Yale provides this much interaction with neural specimens across species. We worked with earthworms, frogs, and grasshoppers, and -- in our section on neuroanatomy -- human brains.",
