We read many influential texts such as the bible, Summa Theologica, and Malleus Maleficarum, analysing them through the lens of what it displays about the supernatural. The class also involved a reading summary and presentation which makes you deal with information critically.",

                "This was my first religious study class and I loved it! I learned a ton!",

I liked the format of lecture for next week's readings and then discussion for the current's splitting the class. I would've liked more engagement with Professor Eire as he didn't teach my section, but he made an effort to see everyone.",
                "It would be nice to explore the supernatural in America, specifically Native American life.",
                "No notes. Professor Eire is an incredible professor and person.",
                "A strength of the course was that it was structured around primary readings which allowed for a depth in historical studies and the development of close reading skills of primary texts. The course was well structured and by having lectures that prepared one for the readings it made conversations have more depth to them.",
                "Very interesting content, great lecturers. The lectures can be improved and perhaps shortened. Discussion sections should have starting themes to shape and guide the conversation. Suggest assigning more work and reducing the reading workload.",
                "Strengths: split course between lecture and discussion, interesting, unique topic\r\nWeaknesses: might be easier to follow if lectures that day were on same content as discussions/readings",

The content in the course should genuinely be interesting for just about anyone (levitations, vampires, etc.), and both the lectures and discussions are fun. Professor Eire is one of the best professors I have had here at Yale, and you would do yourself a favor by taking any class with him, but especially this one.",
                "Yes, the supernatural is an interesting subject and deserves a presence in academia.",

                "100%. It was amazing.",
                "Yes! The course was incredibly interesting and engaging. It also discussed elements of religious belief that are not always as closely examined and provided a fuller picture of historical belief systems.",
                "Depends, it's a good introduction to a \"history-ish\" class, but it is a bit difficult to stay engaged. If you are behind on the readings, then you will be entirely lost. It's too reading dependent, there are only 2 assignments, I'd have more to push students to stay engaged.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in religious studies",
                "I would 100 percent recommend this course to another student. It gives you the opportunity to learn a lot about a truly fascinating subject in a low-stress and incredibly engaging environment. Definitely take a class with Professor Eire if you can!!",
