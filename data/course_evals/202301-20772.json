It was kind of a bummer when we saw really cool work and not a lot of people were there to see it. Maybe setting the course at a different time would've helped? I think it might've also helped to have had some sort of talk about crit etiquette beforehand, just to set a standard of behavior\r\nalso, i felt like there was a pretty strong disparity between advisors and how they treated their advisees. It might be good to set some expectations or give some guidance to advisors as to their role in the project",

I personally would've enjoyed it more if we'd been assigned to do X studio visits with someone per week and do a writeup about it. When I'm in the studio with people I feel like it's so much more organic to talk about their work and have some back and forth, and a lot more generative and productive.",
