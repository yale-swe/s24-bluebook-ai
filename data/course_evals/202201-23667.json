                "This class helped me retain a lot of the material from German 110 and 120 and I felt that we improved particularly in conversation and writing. Overall I'm more confident in my ability to comprehend texts or audio even if I don't know all of the vocabulary.",
                "We practiced previously learned grammatical forms, and learned new grammar variations, expanded our vocabulary, and learned about the history and culture of different cities in Germany.",
                "I learned a lot about German culture and I improved my vocabulary and speaking skills.",
                "I developed better speaking skills this semester. My grammar drastically improved this semester which really helped my writing and speaking.",
                "A greater understanding of the language and culture",
                "I got really good at German!",
                "I learned a lot about German language, especially in my ability to speak freely about a variety of topics. My confidence in grammatical structures improved greatly and my ability to comprehend challenging texts and instructions also improved. We also covered a great deal of German culture and history which was very interesting. Overall, my ability to speak, read, and write improved greatly.",
                "I deepened my knowledge of the German language.",
                "Ido made sure we practiced listening and speaking German every class. Language is only mastered through practice!"

            "comments": [
                "I enjoyed the two essay assignments because they allowed me to take more time when thinking about grammar structures and trying to think in German without translating first from English. I found that they also helped me expand my vocabulary and I found the editing\/feedback process constructive as well. \r\n\r\nMindtap was much easier to navigate than Connect, which we used in previous courses. The text book for 130 was also an upgrade because it integrates some history in each chapter. Overall I found the material conducive to learning, and I was glad the work load was somewhat lighter than previous semesters. When assignments are too time consuming I find it difficult to absorb new information.",
                "The strengths are that it immerses you into German language and culture, and there are multiple mediums of culture we learn through (speech both spoken and heard, music, poems, movies, texts), which make class engaging.\r\n\r\nSometimes it feels like the grammar we're learning is somewhat obscure, such that we won't really use it that frequently and it may be forgotten. Another weakness is that there are multiple areas to submit assignments (over email, on Canvas, on MindTap, homework we go over in class, etc.), and it can get difficult to keep track of for deadlines and planning out our time. Also, on MindTap, we would sometimes have only 1-2 days to complete multiple assignments (from when they opened until they closed), which is difficult to manage with our other work. Having a way to consolidate all deadlines (like a reminder system) and longer durations on MindTap would be easy fixes. I also wish we had a bit more guidance on instructor feedback (and reviewed some basics more).",
                "The strengths of this course were the opportunities for speaking practice and the study of German culture through movies, songs, and poems. These activities really improved my speaking and listening skills. I would say the MindTap online software was a weakness; I didn't really feel like it helped me develop any of my German skills.",
                "Strengths are the multiple platforms that we use to lessen the language and there were no weaknesses this semester.",
                "I like the format of the workbook and I felt like the workload was very manageable and engaging. Occasionally the releasing dates of some assignments was a little late",
                "Keep hiring Ido, he kept me interested in learning.",
                "Great environment to speak and learn German. We learned more about German culture through cities and improved grammar and writing and speaking and listening. Biweekly exams great for revision",
                "I think the way that this class is structured is great. It keeps you accountable and makes sure you are learning throughout the semester. Frequent tests and assignments allow for a ton of feedback to improve. We also started writing essays in this level, which also helped improve our ability to write comprehensible, longer passages that had a greater level of meaning. The seminar\/more discussion based format is super conducive to learning a language, and it encourages participation for all. The only weakness that I could point out would be the lack of organization of the Canvas page\/syllabus. Sometimes it was difficult to understand when assignments were due or what exactly we were to be doing when.",
                "More conversational German (one-on-one conversations with peers would be nice)",
                "The tests were harder than the daily homework. The listening was especially challenging because of the speed of videos played."

                "I would definitely recommend this course! It helped me brush up on some of the grammar that I wasn't super confident with using in 120. I learned a lot and became much more proficient in the language in 130.",
                "I would totally recommend this course. Its the most fun Id had in a German course at Yale so far and the most useful.",

They are also fairly accessible. I am very glad I chose to take this class and German definitely, and I would recommend to other students.",
                "Yes, definitely. If you want to improve your German, this class will do wonders.",
