I found the course to be particularly insightful in shifting my perspective. As an MCDB major, I typically engage with topics in human biology on a molecular scale, so asking questions about why we are the way we are on a much larger and chronologically longer scale was fascinating.",

            "comments": [
                "I appreciate the format of having short exams every few lectures. There was less anxiety than needing to prepare extensively for a big midterm.",
                "The course does a good job providing a survey of the field. I think one weakness is that there's too much busywork. It's easy to get bogged down in keeping track of all the requirements and to lose track of the actual material in the process.",
                "Strength  easy. All the quizzes are open note. If you answer the study slides questions and do the readings youre solid. \r\n\r\nWeakness  Prof. Thompson is lousy on accessibility. I have a chronic medical condition that often prevents me from attending class. On multiple occasions she forgot to record the class  which she promised at the start  and just sent out an email saying oopsie this is unfortunate go to class next time instead of offering to make amends for students for whom lecture videos are a necessary access measure, not just a crutch to avoid getting out of bed.",
                "Strengths: \r\n\r\nStudy Materials - Professor Thompson regularly uploaded study guides, which contained questions similar to those that would be asked on the exam. It was a very effective way of narrowing down the information covered in the lectures to the most important details.\r\n\r\nMultiple Extra Credit Opportunities - If you are someone who does not do well on exams, Professor Thompson offers MULTIPLE extra credit opportunities throughout the entire semester. Though there are only 3 official extra credit assignments (which each add up to 5 points to your course total), each exam has a bonus question at the end!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n\r\nLack of Organization - A large part of the short exams we took during the semester had an issue with them (i.e. repeated questions, missing questions, questions in the wrong order). Though this was not a big deal, it did prove to be a little frustrating. Despite this, Professor Thompson and the TFs did everything they could to amend the situation, and it often resulted in us being given bonus points (thank you)!",
                "Strengths are the lectures and the labs. The Teaching Fellows and Professor Thompson are all serious professionals and they do everything they can to share their love of the material we covered. Weakness for me were the many different resources and readings. I had a hard time keeping organized. Probably my fault. I'm old. Much older than my classmates.",
                "Strength: Professor and TAs are super enthusiastic. Sections are so much fun and you learn a ton!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: PollEV was a good effort but ultimately slowed the class down.",
                "I thought the course topics discussed were so interesting! It was a good science credit for social science people.  I've always been interested in evolution, and I think the way the course was organized was almost like a history course and it was very academically interesting. However, the quizzes once every 3 classes were straight up not fun. They felt very rushed, often had structural errors, and I never felt like I was able to fully represent what I had learned due to the time constraints. they kept me accountable for learning, but I would've really, really preferred fewer exams. Also, I wish we would've been able to get through more of the slides in class, and I wish exam study guides would've been posted earlier.",
                "Strengths of this course is that in my opinion every lecture was engaging and interesting, Im an anthro major though, also did a great job aiming the course at a variety of dif students from ppl like me to ppl j looking for a sci cred. weaknesses are that its a lot of information coming at you really fast so you can not fall behind. feedback is also very clear and frequent which is nice.",
                "Strengths: 1) The teaching team is fantastic! They were so incredibly accommodating and understanding of students, and you could also tell that they loved what they were teaching and wanted students to learn! 2) I really enjoyed learning about the more cultural and social side of biological anthropology, like our lessons on forensic science and medical anthropology were fascinating. 3) I appreciated how this class addressed the anthropologys historically racist and colonial past. There were many discussions about scientific racism, which were so important. 4) There were lots of extra credit opportunities and bonus points throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class is NOT a science gut. It requires lots of consistent effort in studying and showing up to class and section, which was difficult for me when the semester became challenging and overwhelming.",
                "The main strength was super-engaging sections that allowed us to work with actual fossils. I also enjoyed the more spread-out pace of exams. The main weakness is that the professor feels a political need to tackle \"hot\" issues in biological anthropology, such as spending multiple lectures on past racism in the anthropological field, medical anthropology, etc. Focusing on simple fundamentals - human evolution - would be more appropriate for an introductory course.",
                "I enjoyed the content and the teaching, and the assessment structure was generally well-designed. However, I don't think the quizzes gave us enough time to demonstrate our knowledge of the materialI almost never finished them.",
                "Strengths of the course involve the vast knowledge that Professor Thompson has on every topic covered. No weaknesses come to mind for me personally.",
                "Very few strengths, outside of the fact that it is unbelievably easy to get an A without engaging with the material. Waste of time.",
                "Although the short exams were meant to encourage us to study and were part of the grading, the short exam study guides being released the day before weren't too helpful, and I felt like I was cramming rather than truly studying and picking up the material. I appreciated how the exams were open-note though, and that ultimately increased my engagement with the material covered in the course. The lectures were very interesting. The lab-based sections were somewhat difficult at times, but the TFs helped guide there, so I came out of those sections feeling relatively okay.",
                "A strength is that the material was quite interesting, and the lab sections were fun and gave hands on ways to interact with what we learned in class. A weakness is that the class is heavily reliant on numerous small exams throughout the term. This isn't necessarily a problem in and of itself, but the issue was that besides the exams having very restrictive time limits that often felt inadequate, on nearly every exam there tended to be some sort of error which required redressing after the fact, from missing or blank questions, to repeated questions.",
                "Strengths: If they were well organized, the 9 small exams could have been very useful for learning. Also, my TF made up for the professor's weakness by explaining much of the material!\r\nWeaknesses: This was a low-quality class. The main weakness was that the majority of the information necessary for the tests came from lectures. The lectures were incredibly disorganized. The. main problem was that the professor would get stuck on one slide and talk about it for half the lecture and then blitz through the remaining 30 or 40 slides so that you could not gather the information of those. Even if one were to go back through the lecture slides they were mainly pictures or a couple of sentences and could not give one the necessary information for the test. Lectures would also rarely be completed in one class because of the professor's lack of focus. Most of the work for this class felt like busy work, it was like a high school class in that regard. One was expected to memorize everything for the test and then spit it out over twenty minutes, and remember nothing by the time they got to lunch.",
                "The exams were oftentimes testing us on content that was not gone over well in class. I would have appreciated more direct correlation between lectures, slideshows, and exam questions.",
                "Strength- many extra credit opportunities, very communicative and engaged Professor and TAs, very in depth study guides for exams, useful TA office hours for lab work and psets, super interesting material that engages everyone if youre not super into science or stemmy, lectures are recorded \r\n\r\nWeakness- short exam malfunctions, lab work sometimes needs more background knowledge than we have"

                "Yes! I'm not even a science major of any sort but was very interested in learning biological anthropology. The topics are really interesting and biological anthropology can tie to so many other interests I other majors and topics. Dr. Thompson is also very kind and understanding and easy to communicate with.",
                "I would recommend this to someone who wants to study biological anthropology, as it's a good overview. I don't know if I would recommend it to someone who is just interested in trying something new, as I think it gets too bogged down in little details.",
                "Yes for a science gut.",
                "Yes, I would recommend the course to another student! I think the course is a good way to get exposed to science in a manner that incorporates a lot of social aspects. I loved how we spent classes talking about the racial injustices created by previous anthropologists and ways in which current practitioners are seeking to right the wrongs of the past. We even had an entire lecture given by a worker at the Peabody Museum who works to repatriate indigenous remains and objects! \r\n\r\nThough, I would warn any student looking to take this class about the short exams. Each exam is only 20 minutes and despite studying heavily for each of them, I often found myself running out of time. However, they are open note and open internet! They are not too bad, but be advised that they happen every week throughout the semester.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to anyone. You will come out the other side of this class with a new appreciation for Anthropology and the history of humanity.",
                "Definitely! If you have an interest in human evolution, you will learn a ton.",
                "If they're interested in learning about human evolution or want to be an anthropologist, yes! I thought it was good for what it was - an accessible intro class and science credit. However, if you have test anxiety, don't genuinely have an interest in evolution, or feel stressed under time constraints, I'd recommend a different class.",
                "YES, I would not recommend it as a gut science credit because its a pretty big workload but the grading is pretty easy if you do the work. I think everyone should have a general understanding of how humans became humans though and this course definitely teaches you that.",
                "Yes! It is NOT a gut science, but you will learn a lot of interesting information and can end with an A or A- if you show up to class and section and consistently study and turn assignments in on time.",
                "Yes. It's a great class for science credit. It isn't much work and offers interesting material with hands-on working.",
                "The material covered in this course is genuinely interesting, and the instructors and TFs are all very competent. However, the examinations, of which there is one roughly every three classes, were very challenging, mostly because they didn't give much time compared to the number of questions they included. Also, some of the questions were pretty arcane. I don't regret taking this class for a science creditthe material was very valuablebut you have to be willing to do the untimed extra credits if you are looking to get an A.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is open to learning about topics within the field. It is an intro course and she tried to balance novices with more experienced students. It does a good job covering the bases of bio. Anthro and introducing concepts and topics while touching on the nitty gritty. There are quizzes every three lectures or so which I didnt mind but might not be everyones preference. Paying attention to the lectures will get you far and doing the readings will get you further. Professor Thompson is very knowledgeable and encourages questions. I enjoyed the class and topics a lot and there is a frequent connections to current topics and issues.",
                "Absolutely not. This class is a wreck, and although the professor is good natured, she cannot maintain a structured class at all. I did not want to go to another class beyond the 2nd week.",
                "I would recommend this to a student who is very interested in human origins and wants to learn more about our species without getting into extremely difficult biological concepts, but would discourage anyone who is not comfortable taking tests at a very fast pace.",
                "Absolutely not.",
                "I would definitely not call this class a gut, so be warned about that.",
                "Yes! It is a great science credit or just fun class to take if sounds interesting. I never felt too out of my depth being a non scientifically gifted person and I took away so much more thank thought I would. Professor Thompson is super fun to learn from and the material is so fascinating and so abundant that it offers something that will pique your interest at least once!"
