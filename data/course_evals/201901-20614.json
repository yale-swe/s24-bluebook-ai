    "The syllabus was well chosen, and the workload was just enough to be challenging without ever being overwhelming. I think that it would have been nice to have more engagement with the Iliad, but I understand the limitations of the course and the need to focus on a singular work. \r\n\r\nI did feel, however, that the length of the quizzes was never quite right. This is the only class I've taken where I've felt that I consistently haven't had enough time even to write down my answers on regular assignments, and I think that slightly shortened quizzes wouldn't detract anything from the class but would only make the actual process of evaluation more manageable."

    "If you're even thinking of this course, you should take it, as it will open up the whole world of Homeric Greek for you. It not only gives you a great linguistic experience, but also allows you to read some truly fantastic literature in the original language.",
    "Definitely. I learned a lot from this course, and our professor Pauline LeVen was amazing throughout the semester.",
    "Absolutely! Professor LeVen was wonderful."
