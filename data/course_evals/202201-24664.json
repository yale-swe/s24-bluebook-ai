We ended up veering from the syllabus pretty substantially so I had to depend on checking emails for what the actual assignment would be. On the other hand, all of the content was super engaging!",
                "The vast majority of the course is lecture-based with readings supporting the lecture. I learn well with this style of teaching so I found it to be a very strong way to retain the information. \r\n\r\nThe only critique I could give is earlier knowledge of the details of the midterm/final, otherwise, it was an amazing course, and Dr. Weiss is a tremendous source of knowledge on the subject."

                "Absolutely. This course is an inquiry into the fundamental origins of civilization, with case studies from many different civilizations. Professor Weiss is passionate and has a wealth of experience. The scope and breadth of this course are unmatched, especially in the context of today's academic narrowness. I also greatly enjoyed the guest speakers who came to lecture about the civilizations in which they specialize.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it and already have. The course really helps establish a frame of reference as to where/how civilization began."
