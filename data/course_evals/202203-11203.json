                "For the first half (S&DS 10X) - Strengths - The exams are open note and you get a period of a few days window to take the three hour exam. All of the class material is easily accessible, lectures are recorded, and there are pre-recorded modules. PSets are all closely related to course content and straightforward. JDRS is a cool guy and makes lectures fun. No weaknesses. For the second half (S&DS 106) - Strengths - Wooster is a wonderful teacher, good sense of humor, and is willing to meet anyone at their level. Lectures are engaging, exciting, and easy to follow for someone who doesn't have any experience in R. PSets are closely tied to course content and straightforward. There's a lot of freedom for the final project. Weaknesses - I wish we had more time in the semester in 106 as opposed to 10X. It felt like 106 flew by.",
                "gives a good introduction to R, but it moves very quickly.",
                "This class was taught very well and there were so many resources. There were office hours that ran during most parts of the day.",
                "Strengths- I really liked the flexibility of the first half of the course. I was able to watch lectures whenever I had time. We're also given a decent timeframe to complete assignments. The course is super organized as well; everything is on Canvas and it's easy to stay on top of all the work. There are also a ton of office hours, which were very helpful when I had trouble completing the psets.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- not many I can think of",
                "Strengths: first 8 weeks are asynchronous which offers a lot of flexibility, TONS of office hours for help on psets/understanding difficult topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: because of the asynchronous model it was sometimes difficult to find a routine or people to work with on psets - ideal if you already have friends in the class, but this is also highly individual.",
                "I did not like how the first half of the semester included everyone in s&ds 100 since it made it harder to find others in 106.",
                "The module format was incredibly helpful.",
                "The first part of the course should be more engaging with the students who want to use R instead of Minitab from the get go.",
                "This course is well laid out, but the problem sets sometimes did not exactly correlate w the lectures.",
                "It was a pretty good course maybe putting more emphasis on participation and being in class would make it better / would increase engagement"

                "I would recommend this course to every student, regardless of their major or background. It is a great introductory statistics course. I especially recommend 106 if you're interested in continuing with statistics as the foundation in R is very helpful. 106 is my favorite class I have taken in three semesters at Yale.",
                "if you want to learn R, i wouldn't recommend this course as only the last month of the class is dedicated to learning R. If you've never taken stats however and still want to learn statistics without the data science then yes.",
                "I would recommend this course to people regardless of if they are a stats major.",
                "Yes! It was pretty chill and you can watch the lectures at your own pace. I had a lot of harder classes this semester, but I felt like I was able to balance my schedule a little more due to the flexibility that this class offers. I think you learn good basic statistics, but it might be boring if you recently took AP stats. I enjoyed the 106 section of this class. I never coded before, so it was interesting to learn, and Dr. Wooster was an excellent professor.",
                "Would definitely recommend if you want a solid understanding of statistics and its broader applications. The first 8 weeks are theoretical, and the last 5 weeks are fully applications of what we learned in the first 8 weeks. This worked well for me because I don't like applications unless I understand the theory behind it, but if you're just looking for applications of statistics in data analysis, then I would take SDS230 directly.",
                "Yes, learning R helped me a lot with personal projects.",
                "Highly,\r\nI really enjoyed learning stats from the ground up, and literally enjoyed the programming part of this course, as  was able to create programs that reflected what I learned in class",

                "Yes, it teaches basic knowledge that is useful for everyone.",
