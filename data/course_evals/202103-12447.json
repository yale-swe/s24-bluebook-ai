The second half of the class has a miserable workload. Definitely in future years break it up or get rid of the final project alltogether\r\n- TA sucks",

                "You'll only take this course if you're ChemE ABET. The first month or so of class was extremely doable and the pacing seemed fair. The course really picks up once the final project is assigned and the course load doubles. Professor Altman is really transparent about this. He's also extremely helpful and easy to reach. If you take this course, go to office hours and start the project right away. Professor Altman is, of course, helpful when it comes to homework and the project, but he's also really good at explaining course content by meeting you where you're at. The course will consume your semester, but it is manageable and Professor Altman is really great."
