                "I learned about the life and works of the Moroccan writer Mohamed Choukri.  He's a great writer with a very interesting life (which is the subject of the autobiographies we read).  I also improved my Arabic *a lot*.",
                "I improved my Arabic drastically, learned to deal with literary texts in a foreign language",
                "This class allowed me to dive deeper into Arabic literature in a way I had never been able to even as a native speaker. I learned to truly engage with arabic works which I would have otherwise not been able to.",
                "Through exposing us to the literature of a controversial Arab author, we were able to learn much about the state of politics and the functioning of social classes during Choukri's era. We delved deep into Choukri's personal life through reading his trilogy of autobiographies, watching him grow as a person and an author along the way. Topics such as censorship, societal norms, and religion among others were tackled and analyzed through Choukri's different series of short stories. All discussions were greatly beneficial and the nature of the class led to constructive arguments on every single topic addressed.",
                "This course helped me to develop my reading, writing, and speaking skills in Arabic. It taught me how to analyze literature and discuss complex novels.",
                "I learned how to analyze the Arabic literature texts of the great Moroccan novelist Mohamed Choukri, as taught by the extraordinarily talented and knowledgeable Professor Jonas Elbousty. I became much more skilled in analyzing Arabic texts and presenting and writing in Arabic. I developed a much deeper appreciation for Arabic literature, particularly Moroccan short stories and novels. I also learned the extent of work that goes into devoting one's professional career into studying a single author. We had multiple guest speakers, including Mohamed Choukri's nephew, and I left the class with a renewed love for Arabic literature. I also learned so much from fellow students in the class, all of whom were so intelligent and knowledgeable. This was an incredible class.",
                "I learned a lot about literature in the Arab world and was able to improve my reading and writing skills in Arabic.",
                "I have developed many skills, even as a native Arabic speaker. I have learned how to analyze a variety of literary texts through written and oral assignments as well as weekly discussions between my classmates and I. Professor Elbousty does an excellent job exploring the interests of everyone, so the course feels very personal in nature, and you get to have many options during the semester to learn a skill set that fits you the most. For example, Professor Elbousty gave us the option of writing our final papers in either Arabic or English (and I did Arabic as this is where I felt myself learning the most).  Asides, Professor Elbousty was always very excited to hear our ideas in class, and I got to learn alot about Morocco, history, philosophy, economics, and politics from my friends around me. As a STEM major, these insights are highly valuable and will stick with me way after I am done with Yale.",
                "I read many of the famous writer Mohamed Choukri's greatest stories and books. This class allowed me to grapple with many important questions about the Arabic language, Arabic literature, the contemporary Arab World, and language and literature in general. My Arabic speaking, reading, and writing skills improved tremendously because of this course. Our discussions touched on absolutely everything, from history to politics to religion to culture to psychology. We even read several excerpts of the works in multiple languages and discussed the challenges of translation and other linguistic topics. Not only did I become more fluent in Arabic, I gained a much deeper insight into one of the Arab World's most controversial writers. And because Choukri's works are censored in countries across the world to this day, I realized the great importance of reading his literature.",
                "The most incredible, in depth class on Mohamed Choukri (an author you'll seldom taught well in any place in the world). Even though we fixated on one author, El Bousty's knowledge spread to the entirety of Arabic literature and was contextualized with Choukri's life and the politics of 20th century Morocco. An excellent course.",
                "I have honed my Arabic and also learned about Mohamed Choukri and his life!",
                "I have developed extensive knowledge about Moroccan literature in general, and Mohamed Chokri's writings in specific. The scope of this course offers great insights into modern Arabic literature. We have always gone through a process of literary analysis and critique that widened my own literary horizons. After taking this course, I feel that I have gained much knowledge about a certain kind of literature I did not know much about, I feel that I have developed my own writing style through fusing with Chokri's own ever-developing style. I learned about literary development through following Chokri's trilogy and reading his biography that was created over a span of around 40 literary years. I have also developed some intuition about translation and how to think like a translator owing to our exposure to different versions of Chokri's work. Most significantly, I have also learned much about comparative literature, owing to professor Elbousty being one of the elite researchers in this field.",
                "I learned a lot about Mohammad shoukris context which equipped me with the knowledge needed to analyze his works effectively"

            "comments": [
                "The course is very strong.  Many of the students are native speakers to some degree (ranging from speaking mixed English with Arabic dialect at home in the US to being international from the Middle East), which can easily be intimidating to those of us who learn as 'adults'.  However, the course is incredibly inviting to everyone, and Professor Elbousty really does want to hear everybody's thoughts on the readings.  We always had interesting conversations, often led by a volunteer student.  This is Elbousty's guy, his specialty, and he really loves Choukri's works.  He's incredibly knowledgeable (even preparing the first ever English translations of some of the short stories we read) and has a lot to share.  The work is manageable, although it will very a lot person-to-person based on reading speed in Arabic.  We read two and a half novels and maybe a dozen short stories in the semester.",
                "Strengths - the course is well structured and fascinating intellectually. No weaknesses.",
                "This course was amazing. It was highly structured and student engagement was facilitated largely by the professor.  The syllabus was carefully constructed, and the assignments were very fair.",
                "I will go as far as saying that this was the single most engaging course I've taken at Yale. Professor Elbousty's contagious passion for this author paired with his desire to share these narratives make for a once in a lifetime experience. The class was structured in a way in which work never felt tedious  regardless of how much we read we always looked forward to gathering and discussing. Biweekly Canvas discussions allowed us to formulate our thoughts beforehand, coming into all sessions with expectations of what to debate productively. We were all given an opportunity to conduct one of the sessions, allowing every student to portray their passion for Choukri's writings through leading the consistently enjoyable classes. Midterm presentations that directly tackled our respective topics for the final paper were helpful in providing us with feedback from our peers as well as Professor Elbousty weeks in advance. The freedom we were given with the final paper made it a greatly interesting task as each of us wrote about a facet that touched them personally.",
                "This was the best Arabic course that I've taken at Yale so far! Professor Elbousty is extremely passionate about Choukri and his novels, and it shows in the way he teaches the class. I loved our in class discussions and that the professor encouraged everyone to participate.",
                "Strengths: such a caring, kind, knowledgeable, committed, genuine, and fair professor in Dr. Jonas Elbousty. He is likely the world's leading expert on the works of Mohamed Choukri, so to learn from him is such an honor. Yale is lucky to have Dr. Elbousty as a professor. Another large strength was the engagement of the students in the class, from whom I learned so much. These discussions were so fun and so rewarding. The workload was also very reasonable.",
                "This course has amazing capabilities for engaging students. I loved coming to class every day and discussing the readings. It keeps you very immersed in Arabic and feels like you're actually there with the author.",
                "Weaknesses: None.\r\n\r\nThis was a fantastic class. You get to learn so many skills especially when it comes to Arabic reading and literary analysis. You get to dig deep into Choukri's life. Impressively organized. We also had plenty of guest speakers, some of those that actually were related to Choukri! This is very rare to find in any other literature class, and I felt that this experience really mattered to me. Perhaps the major strength of this class is that Professor Elbousty is teaching it. Very accommodating and respectful, and he has a magical way of initiating discussions, digging deeper into the ideas drawn in class. The weekly discussion posts were a plus, as you get to engage with other students, but also start writing and thinking about your final paper along the way. Another major strength is the fact that we were able to cover (in detail) a lot of Choukri's pieces in such a short time. You really get to learn about the author from A to Z.",
                "Strengths: \r\nWe read a mixture of short stories and novels, and the novels even included some poetry in them. This allowed us to study a wide range of literary pieces and kept students engaged by changing the pace of the class throughout the semester.\r\nThe discussions were moderated by the students. Each class a new student led the discussion on the reading for that day and came prepared with their own questions for the class. Not only did this ensure the participation and engagement of everyone, but it also made the discussion MUCH more fruitful. Choukri's works are incredibly rich with many different angles from which they can be analyzed. Each student brought a different perspective to the table and introduced to us new ways to think about the text.\r\nWe read several excerpts from the books in other languages. This gave me a deeper appreciation for the Arabic language and its unique ability to express certain emotions.\r\nWe had free range on our presentations and were allowed to explore any topic we wanted.\r\nThe biggest strength of this course by far is Professor Elbousty. His passion for the subject matter is so incredibly valuable and was the biggest reason why students loved the class. He made sure discussions were exciting but respectful and valued each students' opinion.",
                "Strengths: El Bousty carries this department and is one of the kindest, smartest professor you'll ever meet. The course material is good, Choukri's short stories are excellent, the novels are less good, but still good reads to have. Still an excellent course as an L5 Arabic\r\nWeaknesses: none.",
                "Elbousty makes this class great!",
                "The greatest strength of this course is its instructor, Professor Elbousty. He is an imaginative teacher, an avid researcher, and the most humble\/kind\/gracious person I have met on Yale's campus. He has an amazing way of managing this class, in which he relieves any stress and makes everyone comfortable to discuss their thoughts no matter what their literary background is. He sees the best in his students and encourages them to grow and defy their comfort zones. He has the perfect balance between flexibility and structure, which makes his course extremely unique and distinct from any other courses I have taken or will take at Yale.",
                "Strengths: the high level analysis and discussions every class \r\n\r\nWeakness: we dont spend much time on each work"

Also, if you aren't a native speaker, this is a fantastic opportunity to be around a lot of them, which can really help your language skills.  Elbousty is also such a kind professor.  Since Elbousty is such an expert, we even got to speak with guest speakers and visitors including a friend of Choukri's and a member of his family.",
                "Yes. Absolutely. Elbousty is a phenomenal instructor and the classes are always enriching and vibrant.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is able to take it. This class allowed me to dive deeper into Arabic literature in a way I had never been able to even as a native speaker. I learned to truly engage with Arabic works which I would have otherwise not been able to. This course was amazing. It was highly structured and student engagement was facilitated largely by Professor Elbousty.  The syllabus was carefully constructed, and the assignments were very fair. Any class with Professor Elbousty is a gem, and I would recommend his classes highly to anyone. Mohamed Choukri's works are not easy to understand, but Professor Elbousty allowed us to digest his works together in class. The workload is very fair and was very engaging which made it feel like it wasnt work at all.",
                "Yes  I genuinely would take this class again if I could. The material is captivating, the instruction is engaging, and the atmosphere is constructive. It is very evident through Professor Elbousty's dedication and passion that he looks forward to each and every single session. You will fall in love with this course and end up dumbfounded regardless of what expectations you might have.",

If you enjoy Arabic and want to learn from one of Yale's best professors and from your fellow students who are always willing to share diverse viewpoints about topics, this is the class for you. If you want to dive deep into the life of one author and one of the premier scribes of the Arab world, this is the class for you. If you are passionate about Arabic literature and want to explore the field further, this is the class for you. Take this class! Elbousty is amazing!",
                "Most definitely! This class is a delight and I think that any student interested in learning more about Arabic\/literature should definitely take this class.",
                "Absolutely! Any Arab on campus or anyone with enough Arabic background SHOULD enroll in this class. I genuinely enjoyed it from start to finish and I am actually sad that it has ended. I got to get closer to my other Arab friends by discussing Choukri, and by engaging in highly sophisticated discussions about his literary work. Professor Elbousty would never say no to a sound suggestion that will only help you learn. He really cares about the learning process and I enjoyed how personal this class was. I actually wish there was a continuation for this class where we get to finish what's left from Choukri's work. Do not skip on this class!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This has been my favorite course at Yale by far. The literature was incredibly impactful, and the fact that it has been censored so heavily in the past made it all the more important to read. The discussions were exciting, and I learned so much about the Arabic language and about politics, philosophy, and so many other things just by listening and participating. Also, taking a course with Professor Elbousty is a MUST at Yale.",
                "Absolutely take this course with El Bousty. Choukri though in many ways strikes me as an amateur novelist, but that doesn't take away from how interesting he is, plus the short stories are really good anyway. Worry less about loving the author and be more engaged with his writing and how you approach literature. It is also a course you'll hardly find anywhere else in the world, nevermind a college in America. Quite the experience!",
                "Yes, 100%, loved it; take a class with elbousty before you graduate",
                "YES, DEFINITELY!!! This course offers a great review of Moroccan Arabic literature, which is an exciting field if you have not discovered it and are interested in literature in broad terms. Moroccan literature intersects with many other global literary works and this class exemplifies this. Professor Elbousty is the perfect person to teach it since he is one of the top researchers in this field, has extensive comparative literature experience, speaks multiple languages, and is hands-down one of the most fascinating personas one can ever interacts with. You will never ever regret taking this course.",
