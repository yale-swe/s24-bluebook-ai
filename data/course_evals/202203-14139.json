After this course I feel like I have a clearer picture on the important role of sports in our society and how we can improve it.",
                "how to think about sport more critically in relation to other societal institutions",
                "Taking this course has helped me challenge scholarly readings and create strong arguments. I found myself developing my scholarly voice with every assignment given to my peers and me throughout the course. Reading about different topics benefited me in capturing the different opinions of authors and connecting them to my research about sports' role in society. After taking this course, I feel more confident in how I depict readings and manage my time.",
                "This course opened me up to a different world to sports. Before taking this class, sport was only a topic that felts like it didn't matter to how we survive in our world. Each class I left with a new notion that never appeared to me. I learned so much more about how sport can serve as a conservative force, as an escape, as a contested terrain, etc. There was so much more that we could talk about and this class really helped me acknowledge the point of view of each individual involved in the sports world (athletes, coaches, fans, families, etc.). By taking this course, I was able to throw away the prejudice feeling towards athletes and became sympathetic to the history of Black athletes and how sports was a route for them to alter the opinions of others. This was my first sociology class and the way this course is formatted has made me become interested in sociology.",

                "Strengths: well organized course; the readings aren't too difficult and almost always really interesting and insightful; Professor Manning is a great lecturer; pair/group discussions make the hour and 15 min go by quickly; due date periods for assignments are a huge plus; Perusall for readings is a nice platform\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the weeks feel repetitive and it is easy to become cynical, but Professor Manning does a good job of addressing that",
                "strengths: best class ever. big breadth of content but it was presented in a super concise/ chill way, pretty good class engagement, paper topics were really fun. this was a last minute backup class but it ended up being my fav by far. there isnt a very strong focus on sociological theory so the class is perf for anyone interested in sports. the prof and ta were both AMAZING!! would genuinely recommend this class to anyone interested in watching/ playing sports (even if u hate writing  the writing portion isnt bad at all).\r\n\r\nweaknesses: this wasnt a weakness for me personally, but if youre looking for a class that focuses more on theory than real-world sports than this probably isnt the class for you. the second class focused on giving an overview of the theory, and a number of the classes introduced/described a sociological concept, but there wasnt an overwhelming strong focus on it. i personally loved this since im not big on theory.",
                "engaging discussions, interesting topics, fun readings",
                "This course had a great pace throughout the semester. Although each week was centered on a different topic, I did not feel as if we were rushing through the material. The readings were very straightforward and I didn't struggle in understanding each author's argument. I also enjoyed the lectures that each class included since they were all very informative. The one weakness that I found in this class was the opportunities given to students to participate. I found that these opportunities became more available during the second half of the semester, with chances such as writing in documents, creating PowerPoints, and adding to threads, and I think it would be great to implement these chances throughout the entire course.",
                "Strengths: (1) fulfilling topic, it covered the main subjects that we should be covering for that allows students to fully acknowledge the importance of sports in our society and how it can transform our thoughts, (2) open-minded, every student felt comfortable to express their opinions, (3) readings were straightforward and not difficult to comprehend the message, (4) very interesting topics, (5) a topic that athletes and non-athletes can discuss \r\n\r\nWeakness (1) some readings were not engaging enough",
                "The strengths of this course are the professor and the teaching fellow and their style of teaching. Both are very engaging and help students change the way they see sports."

                "Absolutely, very interesting course and if you engage in the class and material you can get a lot out of it and it will change the way you view sports",
                "ABSOLUTELY. The concepts learned made you look at sports in an entirely new way. I am not the biggest sports fan but every week in this course made me reflect a lot on my past and the structures that exist in our society. I genuinely would take this course again in a heartbeat.",
                "Definitely take this course!!! As someone with a very weak relationship to sports before, this class transformed the way I relate to and enjoy sports. The concepts we learn can also be applied to areas outside of sports, which helped shape my views on large institutions, media, and neoliberal capitalism. For the amount of theory and insights this course offers, it is very digestible. The readings and lectures aren't dense, but still very informative and engaging.",
                "yes!!!!! best class ever",
                "Yes. Fun course to take that wasn't major-related and is a topic (sports) that many have an identification with. Workload is manageable and you feel all the different things you learn in class connect over the course of the semester.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to any student that is looking to expand their knowledge of sports and their impact on society. Even as someone who has had minimal engagement with sports teams in their life, this course has helped me understand the underlying importance that sports have on every individual. This course was very insightful and touched base on problems that should be discussed more, such as racism, socioeconomic challenges, and misogyny. With Professor Manning, I was able to become more involved with the sports realm, and I believe it would be a great decision for students to take this course.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to every student whether or not they play sports. This course has truly changed my position on viewing the sports world and opened up my mind to accept the reality of how our world surround sports. This class was a wonderful experience for students to not only learn more in depth about sports but also a chance to practice writing as a sociologist. The Professor and the TF were extremely supportive and helpful to all students and encouraged students to go above and beyond on their assignments. The professor never pressured any student to participate. He used his own method to encourage introvert students to have a chance to use their voice and engage in the class discussion. A must take course!",
                "Yes I would recommend this course because the professor was great, the workload is manageable, and the content of the course is very engaging."
