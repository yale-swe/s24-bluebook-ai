                "I learned a lot about chords and chord notation, terms for the structure of music, and gained a lot of practice reading\/performing music. \r\n\r\nLearning terms for certain patterns in music (like the names of non harmonic tones, cadences, periods\/sentences, etc) helped me better understand them and their role in music, as well as better communicate musical knowledge in general.\r\n\r\nI think practice performing rhythms and singing was really useful in helping me gain confidence as a musician. I could have benefitted from some more sight singing since that was most difficult, but I really appreciate the singing skills I gained just by practicing. I think singing helps a musician tremendously, even if instrumentalists never actually have to sing. \r\n\r\nIf I had to pick one thing I learned that I appreciate the most, its definitely bass figures\/chord notation because I find myself understanding the structure of music and different notations of music so much better.",

Everyone had to sing something solo or clap a rhythm at least once every class, so along with regular homework, we benefit from consistent practice with feedback (eg being aware of jumps in intervals, aiming for more legato). \r\n\r\nWe also learned about Western chord progressions, starting from recognizing intervals between two notes and building up to identifying the chords and writing two-part phrases. However, I would garner this was not as rigorous as MUSI 210 might be in terms of learning how to be as perfect as possible at following composition 'rules.' For me, though, taking a less technically demanding class like 218 was my goal."

                "Strengths: The instructor was very nice, approachable, and willing to provide extra help if needed. The workload was low but I still feel like I learned a lot so it was a very enjoyable half credit class. It was probably my least stressful and most fun course this semester because the instructor was so nice and it was so interesting to learn more about music theory while also putting it to practical use. There is a good balance of new concepts with plenty of practice to reinforce the skills we learn. This course also created a better sense of community than many other classes, perhaps due to the small size and collaborative nature of the course. Given that I didn't get to know any of my classmates in my other classes, I'd say this course did a good job of making me feel like I had classmates! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As with any online course, it's still hard to really connect with other people in the class. There were also some concepts we learned that were rarely put to practical use in the course. For example, we learned about suspensions and non harmonic tones but rarely used this knowledge when analyzing excerpts. I also felt I didn't learn as much about resolutions in music as I could have with some more focus on it in class and more applications of this knowledge when analyzing excerpts.",
                "Strengths: good amount of work\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: More clear methodology for learning skills.",
                "Strengths: The professor was very engaging and kind. There was a lot of time to submit homework assignments. The assignments were exactly what we were tested on, so I always felt very prepared. The class is repetitive, but in the end, you will be much better at aural music theory than when you started. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is fast-paced, so if you are unfamiliar with sightreading or with aural training, you may be lost.",
                "Strengths: very reasonable workload, exercises structured so everyone will always participate at least a few times in class, nice feedback, generally chill class with Professor Tai. I enjoyed whenever we had collaborative exercises, like writing out a chord progression, and wish we a) got more time to do those in class, and b) got more similar activities outside of class so we could get to know our classmates better.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not many, one of them would be that my class was TTh at 8:15 AM EST, which is probably one of the earliest times possible!"

During rhythm clapping exercises, people's clapping would be silenced by Zoom, so we would have to hold our hands up to the camera to show the claps visually. Not a huge problem, but if some small mistake was made we would probably just move on and attribute the mistake to Zoom. Maybe double checking that everyone's audio settings are ideal for music?"
