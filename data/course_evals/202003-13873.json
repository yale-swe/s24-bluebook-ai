The only weakness is that we had basically no academic assessments and I have truly no idea what my final grade is going to be.",

I would have appreciated a bit of time devoted to a review of grammar, especially since Professor Darnell talks about Egyptian grammar slightly differently from what we learned in our earlier Egyptian language classes."

JCD is so fun to take classes with, and this course never had me stressed, even when I had translated something completely wrong and had no idea what was going on. You learn so much through osmosis without even realizing that you're learning it, until the end of the semester when you look back at things you did in the first week and wonder how you could've found them difficult.",
                "Yes. Professor Darnells excitement and enthusiasm for ancient Egypt is contagious. As a STEM major, this course provided a much needed change of pace from my regular courseload",
                "This course focuses almost entirely on reading ancient Egyptian rock inscriptions. If you like translating Egyptian texts and then seeing how good your translation is, learning more Egyptian, this is a great course for you. Rock inscriptions are one of Professor Darnell's specialties, which means he has a lot of insights into the material that help you get a lot more out of it. These inscriptions are not as conventional as some of the other Egyptian texts out there, and each tells you lots of interesting things about life in ancient Egypt. Hieratic can be difficult, but if you put in the work, it starts to make sense."
