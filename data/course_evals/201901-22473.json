    "I improved as a writer. I enjoyed reading the books, and being with the class.",
    "I learned about how to think more about music from a philosophical, perhaps academic, stand point. I learned how to conduct the writing of a research paper and analyze poetry from a lyrical stand point in ways that I hadn't before. I learned how we can relate seemingly drastically different forms of art\/music, for example poetry and music, the spoken word and music, or African American music and German music. I also was able to work on my analytical thinking quite a bit in the more challenging readings we did. I was pushed to think about theoretical texts in more literary ways and literary texts in more theoretical ways.",
    "I developed my writing skills. I feel like I've become a better writer."

   "comments": [
    "Some of the books werent great, and I did not get essay feedback which caused some frustration, but the strengths are that I got to know my class really well, Peter was helpful with essay feedback, and receptive to suggestions. I also appreaciated the class field trip we went on, and the final class discussion and meeting during reading week because it was really fun and rewarding.",
    "Weaknesses: Given the size of the course (only five people), each individual had a big influence on the group. That meant that if one or more people werent prepared for class, we were thrown greatly out of whack. Additionally, one or more students would never or hardly ever speak, and this often reduced the productivity of the class even more. The original lesson plan, while fantastic in its own right, did not suite the small number of students who ended up taking the course, meaning that we as a group pushed away from it, especially when Peter encouraged us to take an active role in shaping the courses direction. The lesson plan could have been adapted even more to the needs and interests of the class, however. Another weakness was the lack of any formal exercises during meetings. Some sort of initial question or structured activity may have led to more productive and efficient use of class time and better discussion.\r\nStrengths: The texts selected for the course, both essays and literature, were on the whole, fantastic (excluding Doctor Faustus, which, while fascinating and worth while, took up too much time). The discussions we had about many of them were illuminating, but not too obvious, which I appreciated. Often, connections would emerge between texts without searching for them. The small size of the class also had a ton of positives. We were able to form a really tight knit group and each have tons of one on one meetings with Peter to discuss papers and the books we were reading. I personally feel like I got a lot of attention from Peter because of this fact which was great for my learning."

   "comments": [
    "Yeah, I think I would because it was enjoyable and relaxing to read the books, the writing assignments were not overwhelming.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. This course made me listen to and hear music in a new way. I would definitely make sure that my friend knew about the aforementioned weaknesses, but in many ways, I think that these sorts of weaknesses are ones that can be corrected with repetition. So, I would expect that the next time round, this course would be improved further.",
    "I would. This course is really fun and interesting. I really enjoyed it; plus the class is really thought provoking."
