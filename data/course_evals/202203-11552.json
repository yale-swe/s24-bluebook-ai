                "Taking English 120 was an enlightening experience. It was my favorite class of my first semester, and I learned how to develop my skills as a thoughtful writer. I learned how to write in a new way thanks to this class, which was insightful and quite frankly, fun.",
                "I learned about different techniques, rhetorical strategies, tones, and stylistic choices that writers make in their writing and applied them in my essays to improve my writing. The class pushed me to try different styles and writing strategies and it definitely helped me in becoming a better writer.",
                "Different styles and techniques in non-academic essay writing",
                "I learnt to write far faster and more personally than I have up to this point. I was also able to ground my writing in a way that I did not know was possible or even necessary before. Moreover, I picked a lot up from the established writers we read in the class, even coming out with some new favourites. Lastly, the ability to workshop my peers' essays and have my peers workshop mine was a great way to learn how to assess work, constructively.",

                "This class is incredibly well taught and organized, and I don't think it should be changed in any way!",
                "The strengths of this course are its prompts and its professors. The prompts were open-ended and encouraged a combination of intellectual thought and creativity. My professor was also a strength: he was fun, engaging, and personal. The weakness of this course was the readings. They varied in length and content matter, and I found it difficult to consistently read before class.",
                "The class format was very engaging and the discussions in class helped me think about writing techniques and choices that other authors use which I adopted into my own writing. One of the biggest strengths of this class was the feedback that was given back for each essay draft and how it encourages students to think and edit like a writer. I especially enjoyed the workshops which not only helped in my essay revisions with help from the various perspectives of my fellow classmates, but also thinking like a writer in giving feedback and commentary on how to improve others essays.",
                "The structure of the course (five units with a different type of essay as the focus of each unit) makes it really easy to develop as a writer over the course of the term, and the reading in each unit is so helpful in providing examples of different ways to approach an essay topic. The reading, both in terms of quality and quanitity, was great, and it was fun to use the readings as a jumping point for my own writing. I also really loved the setup of first and second drafts of each essay getting submitted because I got such thorough feedback on all of my writing. The workshops were great too -- it was helpful to both have my writing read by my peers as well as to read work by my classmates throughout the semester!",
                "Strengths: Workshops, Craig's teaching style, Craig's feedback, the class environment \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No noticeable ones",
                "Strengths: Allows and encourages you to go outside your comfort zone. Definitely makes you a better writer. A lot of feedback to improve from. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A decently intensive workload. You need to buy the ~$50 essay packet or be forced to print them out yourself.",
                "This course does well to keep the students engaged verbally. There is an emphasis on the readings and discovering the author's perspective through various lenses. A weakness of the course is that it requires full class participation, otherwise it feels awkward with few voices in class."

                "Yes, If you are interested in a writing credit, and are willing to put in some work to improve your writing.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone at Yale. My writing improved so much within the course of one semester in a way that it never had before. The readings were really interesting, and it was fun to be able to peer-edit and read other classmates' works/recieve guided feedback on your own writing. \r\n\r\nI really appreciated how Professor Eklund gave extremely detailed feedback (big picture & some line-by-line) for each essay draft. This was incredibly helpful for improving my writing, since I would edit my first draft extensively before turning in my final draft. I know that not every ENGL 120 professor gives such detailed feedback, so I would definitely recommend Professor Eklund's ENGL 120 section.",
                "I would recommend this course to another Yalie. It was special to learn how to write all over again, and to do it with a group of people that I was able to get close with as the semester went along.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if you are looking to learn about various techniques you can use in creative non-fiction writing. The class is also very enjoyable and will push you to try different styles to help you improve as a writer.",
                "I would absolutely recommend English 120 to any student at Yale. I'm literally an engineering major and never considered myself a writer at all, but I truly loved this course. I realized that the writing that I don't like is academic writing, but creative non-fiction is actually so much fun, and anyone can learn to do it!!! I looked forward to doing the assignments (both the readings and the essays), and going to class was the highlight of my Tuesday-Thursday. This class is built for all levels of writers, so if you're just a little STEM kid looking for your last writing credit, look no further! This was way more fun than taking a gut writing in something I didn't care about (plus the workload of this class was simply so manageable). Craig was a GREAT professor, and he gave me such good feedback all semester.",
                "Definitely. If you're interested in writing, even remotely, English 120 is for you. It's a course where you get out what you put in, and then some. It's even better with Craig. We're all writers, even if we don't want to be, so we might as well get better at it. Take this course!!",
                "I would recommend this course to other students if they are looking to improve their essay (non-academic) writing and get practice using techniques that might usually be considered reserved for \"real authors\".",
                "Yes, I highly recommend this course to any Yale student. Your writing will get better as a result of taking this course."
