Problem sets were very fair and helpful for understanding course content, exams were also fair, lectures were excellently executed, and discussion sections were extremely useful.",

Each homework was out of a different number of points even though some homeworks were harder than others. Other than that I thought that the class grading was largely pretty fair! I think a strength of this course was the demos, it helped keep the classes fun!",

                "I really enjoyed all of the demos we did before class! They really helped solidify the material and they were always interesting. I wish we could've spent more time in olfaction, it went by very fast. All of the other senses were really well taught and broken up!",
                "Very well-taught, clear, with a manageable workload, and you learn so much! There are great demos and the TFs and the professor are wonderful.",

The professors do a fantastic job at guiding students through content, exams are fair, problem sets are helpful, and the TAs are amazing. We learned an incredible amount of content , but it was delivered in a very clear, non-stressful way.",

The material you learn is interesting but is not difficult to understand, which makes the class great for those who have some background in neuroscience. The homework/exams are also very reasonable. Even though it is a lecture, because there are group activities interspersed through each of the lectures, the class as a whole feels pretty interactive.",

The illusions presented during each class were an exciting way to start to learn about each sensory system and to consider how our biology comes into play for illusions.",
                "Yes!! I wish I had taken this course earlier. It's definitely one of the best neuroscience courses offered at Yale. Damon is a fantastic teacher. I think every neuroscience major should take it, but I could imagine it might be challenging without some background in neurobiology.",
                "Yes! This is a great course for neuroscience majors or anyone wanting to learn about the cellular basis of sensory systems. We spent the first half of the semester on the visual system, less time on olfaction, and then the least amount of time on taste, hearing, and touch/pain. Problem sets were only once every two weeks and there were only two exams: a midterm and a final that covered everything past the midterm. I felt that the grading was extremely fair. The professors were always excited to answer questions asked in class by students.",

                "If you are a neuroscience major, or just interested in started to learn about sensory modalities, I would definitely recommend this course!",
                "I would definitely recommend this class. The course subject is very interesting and the class itself is very engaging when being introduced to all the illusions and different stimuli to the senses.",
