                "In L4, the teacher you have is a game changer. I think Professor Alexandrov is one of the best professors I have ever had and the greatest strength with my experience in the course. First, she cares so much about every student's progress and comfort with Spanish. The environment in her class is always welcoming, despite the fact that we all have different backgrounds in Spanish. Second, her feedback is very clear and her assignments get you to think about concepts in Spanish and practice your grammatical skills without being excessively focused on just one aspect of language.",
                "A strength is that the professor let the students make many choices about their learning and willing to meet to go over exams.",
                "Strengths: Good balance between lecture and activity which allows students to practice speaking and writing skills. Inclusion of both Spanish cultural and technical skills kept the class more interesting. Breaking down the cultural project over the span of a few weeks was very helpful and distributed the workload quite well. Office hours are regularly held and there is good engagement with the professor.\r\nWeaknesses: Online textbook must be bought and I did not find the homework that helpful for the course. Besides the textbook material, it provided surface-level practice for grammar.",
                "I love the way this course was structured. It was very interactive and our instructor constantly asked for feedback to help her improve it.",
                "I thought this course was overall very well designed. I most appreciated how much we got to practice speaking and grammar. I would put, in general, less emphasis on aesthetic presentation in assessing assignments, but I understand why it's in there. I would keep the digitally-hosted content (no paper was great), but it could be nice to have a single reference document pinned to the top of the Canvas homepage with a running list of all the grammar we've covered and links to the associated presentations. This could be especially useful with respect to all of the L3 and below content we had to review. The asynchronous day was great. I also want to call out the feedback on the work we got -- all of it was so helpful and above and beyond (also, so patient: it took me a while to correct most of my mistakes). I feel like I learned quite a lot. VHL practice was generally useful."

                "Yes. It was difficult, but I learned a lot and the professor was very willing to fofer feedback.",
                "I would recommend because the class is a good environment, interactive, and encouraging. Your Spanish will definitely improve throughout the semester. The testing is a bit frequent. Although I find Spanish a challenge course, I generally enjoyed the projects and the workload was manageable despite daily morning classes.",
                "Definitely!",
                "Yes! It's a great way to continue learning Spanish. Good practice and good content all around. Although there was a bit of busy work at times, my professor made it a good class."
