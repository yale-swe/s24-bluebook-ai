                "I developed a greater understanding of the different types of papers that can be written within an academic setting. I also improved my writing skills very much and got to practice a lot of different styles of writing.",
                "I improved upon my academic writing abilities and learned how to conduct research at the college level, along with how to write in and analyze a variety of writing styles and forms of literature (i.e. academic articles, creative criticism, novels, etc.).",
                "In this class, I learned how to write well at a college academic level. For our papers on argumentative writing, I learned exactly what that should look like. I now understand how to write and produce that kind of paper for college academics. I know the different mechanics, such as warrants, resolutions, and claims. Depending on the topic and paper direction, I know how they can be facilitated and proposed. I learned how to share one's voice while writing analytical and serious writing. I took away valuable research, annotation, and reading skills.",
                "I greatly improved my writing skills throughout this course",
                "The topics in the class were very interesting and engaging. I felt like the quality of the material and my engagement allowed me to better learn how to analyze sources. During the research portion, I also learned how to navigate sources through online libraries and the libraries at Yale.",

                "The course was very interesting and engaging, with discussions relevant to the readings and the other coursework.",
                "I found that this class had a fascinating topic and made me much more interested in writing than I had been in high school where it was very focused on literature.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness of this course is that the reading and in-class discussions had very little to do with the essays that we were working on at the same time. I would simply enjoy greater correspondence between in class work and assignments.",
                "The course was organized very well. I liked how the schedule was planned out already at the beginning of the semester so we had a very clear direction and idea of where the course was heading. One weakness of the course is that during the period of time when our class was working on Paper 3, which is the large research paper in ENG 114, the readings for the class were unrelated to the writing. It felt a little disconnected in that we were reading about different trends but then we were writing on a self-proposed topic. I believe one way to improve this would be instead having the students bring readings to class that are relevant to their own topic or incorporate the readings as a way to show more writing styles and help students craft their own papers. Overall though, the class was very interesting and relevant to our own lives.",
                "Strengths: Readings were incredibly interesting, given lots of freedom to choose what topics we wanted to cover for our papers due to the nature of the class' focus (trends and how they operate and affect society)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes readings were a bit extensive (40-50 pages a night), but otherwise no weaknesses! Jessikah was amazing at teaching this class.",
                "Strengths: Very specific, descriptive content, Lots of teacher aid, Many opportunities to practice the writing skills you learn, Reading content was very interesting and engaging, Discussions were productive, appropriate, and open-minded.\r\nWeaknesses: Wasn't a lot of opportunity to partake in creative writing, wish there was more time set aside for finding and vetting research sources and materials.",
                "I feel there could have been use in more frequent smaller writing assignments in addition to the essays.",
                "This course is planned very well. The material and discussions were engaging and actually fun and good reads. I enjoyed the essay prompts and subject matter. I do not have any improvements for this course to suggest.",
                "Strengths: engaging readings \r\nweaknesses: none \r\nimprovement: maybe more different medias, i liked reading the magazines and watching movies!",

                "I would recommend this course to any student, since it truly made the topics very relevant to our everyday lives and felt very up to date and current, allowing for our personal experiences to play much more important roles in the papers.",
                "Yes! This course helped me to improve upon some foundational writing skills that I believe will be important for the rest of my college career and beyond.",
                "Anyone who is looking to take a relevant ENGL 114 class with an amazing professor should take On Being Trendy with Jessikah. She gives great, direct feedback on our writing, made sure the readings and class discussion were lively and interesting, and overall was a wonderful person to talk to and be around!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students, especially those unfamiliar with college academic writing. I believe the knowledge you gain is invaluable. This course takes an in-depth look at all the different parts of writing, especially argumentative, and how you shape them to convey your ideas and put them together to become a cohesive, compelling piece of writing. It is most likely the class I took this semester that the information I took away will be the most useful in my future courses and writing as a whole.",
                "Yes, the content is extremely interesting",
                "Yes, not only is the material interesting and a nice read compared to other courses readings, but the professor is extremely helpful and insightful. This course is engaging and a fun English class to have. I highly suggest it!",
