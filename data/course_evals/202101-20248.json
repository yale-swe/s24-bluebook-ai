I will definitely never watch a movie the same way after taking this class.",

I also learnt how to analyze Hitchcock films and other types of films more critically and closely, and how to communicate the analysis in a concise way and with proper film terminology. I also learnt how critical it is to analyze films within the context they are made, considering the other films made during that era and other historical events that could have influenced the reception and analysis of the film.",

I also really enjoyed the weekly film intro on the production\/reception.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I struggled to engage with the discussions at times (although it was over Zoom, so I don't think that was necessarily a weakness of the class in particular)",
                "Strengths: cover many Hitchcock films over a long period of time so it was good to see how Hitchcock's style changed or evolved. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: discussion sometimes felt difficult to get involved in with a large seminar class sizeespecially over zoom.",
                "This is an excellent course with a well-planned syllabus of different types of Hitchcock films with uniting themes!",
                "Strength is the material. Weakness was the online format. I wish we could have watched the movies together.",
                "This course has interesting content, but the style of construction could have used some work.",
                "I loved this course. Professor Peucker is so knowledgeable and enthusiastic, and our TF, Melinda, was amazing at engaging with students and encouraging them to share their thoughts. I can't think of anything to be improved.",
                "Strengths: Material, and M. Stang was an excellent TF",
                "The Hitchcock movies selected were very engaging and interesting, and the course was well-structured to give an overview of all the different types of movies Hitchcock made during his career as a director. Professor Peucker was also very passionate and knowledgeable, and the class discussions during the lecture were a great way to learn from other students and develop our critical film viewer eye. One of the weaknesses of the course is that drafts are not included to allow more improvement in our film essay writing, but we still received clear feedback on thesis statements and our outlines which helped make our writing more concise.",

                "Yes! Content is fun and exciting. You get to watch a film every week!",
                "This course was ok. The movies are very interesting and sometimes though provoking. However, the TA's desire to insert her own teaching style distracted from the Professor's efforts to teach. The TA would essentially run a second class discussion via Zoom chat, which was massively distracting and unprofessional. The professor's own lack of control over the chat made the problem worse.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned so much about film, and so much about the work of Alfred Hitchcock, with all of its interesting subtext and history. The weekly readings didn't feel like work--I genuinely looked forward to understanding more about each film and what it meant.",
                "Yes, I would it wasn't too much work and super interesting subject matter. But only if you can take it with M. Stang. What an incredible TF.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student that loves to watch movies, and wants to learn about the ways that Hitchcock inspired many movies we watch today. This course equips students with the skills to more closely analyze any movie, and consider the ways that the historical and societal context impact the way the film was made, and highlight the significance of certain scenes.",
                "I would not recommend this class. I say that not because the class was necessarily terrible, but simply because it was not what it was advertised to be. The class was called \"The Films of Alfred Hitchcock,\" but a more appropriate title would have been \"The Films of Alfred Hitchcock as Misinterpreted by the Excessive Use of Feminist and Freudian Analysis.\" I hoped to study the directing style of Hitchcock and the cinematic elements of his work, as I assumed was to be taught in a film class that focused exclusively on his work. What I experienced instead was an extensive discussion about a bunch of freudian concepts which were both out of date and entirely unrelated to the actual subject matter of the films. I admit that in the case of \"Marnie\" and \"Psycho\" the obsessive focus on freudian psychology was justified, but in regards to the other films I think it was entirely out of place. I also think the focus on feminism was a bit intense, and received more attention than it deserved. In general, I was disappointed by the fact that the class was more about feminism and freudian psychology than it was about film.",
                "yes!! it was so much fun and i learned so much. Definitely take this class!!!!",
