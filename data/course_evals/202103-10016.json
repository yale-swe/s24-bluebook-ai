            "comments": [
                "strengths: Craig really cares about his students, flexibility of deadlines, interesting assignments, engaging class discussions; weaknesses: some readings were inaccessible and some conversations about how to apply critical theory to education and working within the system felt inconclusive",
                "Strengths: most readings were interesting/relevant; professor was very caring/understanding; started each class with a meditation and check-in; flexible deadlines; weekly student presentations were engaging and fun\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: discussions were sometimes too unstructured that it was hard to follow/participate; some readings were too difficult to read and I would have liked them to be broken down/explained more; grading was slow, but it is a lot to do for one professor so I understand",
                "strengths- the policies! they aligned with what we learned with the course and this flexibility was stress relieving. at the same time, they also did not help me provide motivation for doing work in the course as mental health issues have prevented me from engaging with things without a deadline/penalty for not completing them",
                "This class was taught very hands off. It was good in some ways because of that, but bad in some ways because of that. It was good for a self guided course but not good for those who may need more structure.",
                "I genuinely enjoyed this course and appreciated the amount of guidance Professor Canfield offered. The readings were very interesting, and Professor Canfield legitimately cared for us as individuals and provided a great deal of flexibility. The one and only suggestion I have for the class is that I do wish we had discussed the readings in more detail.",
                "Strengths: The class definitely introduced topics to me that I never thought about. The projects gave me a chance to reflect and practice skills (ex. how to write a unit plan and write a policy brief).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The texts could be pretty dense and confusing at times, and I struggled to figure out how I could apply these theories into practice. I don't exactly think I came out of this class with strong tangible skills except knowing how to structure a unit plan and policy brief.",
                "Strengths: Great course organization and structure, good facilitation of discussions, great syllabus (even the assignments are interesting and fun to complete). Really important subject matter.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As much as I liked having a shorter class each week, I also felt like we were just getting into the \"good stuff\" of discussion as each class was ending, so I think this class would be better suited to a 1hr 50 minute seminar with a break in the middle. Also, perhaps this is out of our control, but it was really brutal to have class on Monday and Wednesday evenings (even just logistically, like being sure to grab dinner as soon as the dining hall opened or closed).",
                "Course was very good at engaging different aspects of learning, but often felt very disjointed in some ways. Questions about the relationship between theory and policy often felt somewhat superficial and were hard to parse. It often felt that difficult readings were not always presented in a way that could facilitate growth and understanding of complicated texts, as necessary as they were. On the other hand, the class was extremely effective at bridging the gaps between different intellectual histories and theories of oppression, in a way that I don't believe other classes I have had ever were. Class would be improved if it met once a week, as it often felt like we had insufficient time to discuss difficult readings.",
                "Some course readings were quite lengthy while others were difficult to understand.",
                "The strengths were in the teaching style and the wonderful assignments, which taught me so much. I think with a few more years of teaching, this course will be seamless.",
                "lots of space for student engagement (about half the classes are student run)\r\nwould have appreciated guided discussion questions"

                "Yes if you are interested in learning more about education policy and gaining an elementary understanding of critical theory.",
                "I would recommend this course if you want to be introduced to different theories and critical interventions in education, especially if you are passionate about policy. Having to think in terms of policy was sometimes constraining, but I guess that's the focus of the class. I feel like some of our discussions weren't as fruitful and engaging as they could have been, but I did enjoy the weekly student presentations. Because this class meets twice a week, it has a bit more reading than other classes. However, in terms of assignments, it was very manageable.",
                "yes",
                "I would recommend this because I think the topics are important to be exposed to and the professor was very kind.",
                "Mmm, maybe? I don't think there are other many other classes that deal with educational policy. But it is a lot of work, and I'm not sure how many tangible skills you get out of it. This class was not what I thought it would be.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, ideally sophomores or juniors. The content is fantastic and important, and you can tell the care and thought that went into designing the course syllabus to maximize student learning. At times some of the content is dense so it feels a bit breezed over, but generally I felt like core concepts were covered well. I also really appreciated how individual, diverse perspectives were valued and encouraged. Lastly, the assignments for the class are actually really fun -- an interview, class observation, policy analysis case study, and creative final project.",
                "Yes, in large part because it provided a very good entry into many different modes of thought!",
                "Although I was extremely excited to take this course, I don't feel as though I gained an incredible amount from it. I am grateful that it wasn't a stressful class (Craig ensures that students don't feel pressured by deadlines, and you can attend class virtually if you are not feeling well; he is also very accomodating if you must miss a class for any particular reason), but the readings were quite dense, and class discussions often felt repetitive in their generality. Also, the class is from 6-7:15, and it (at times) felt tiring finishing class after the sun had set or eating dinner alone before class. It's a fine ER&M course/writing credit, and the knowledge I gained about disability studies (incorporating a postcolonial/intersectional lens) I will carry with me for a long time, but just know that the readings might feel overwhelming, and you won't walk away with answers. I sometimes found this frustrating (crafting a world that doesn't feel attainable or using jargon that can't be applied in the world we currently live in), but there is also incredible beauty in imagination, and we often do not realize the power of courses until quite some time has passed.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student.  Not necessarily because the course was bad, but simply because at times it lacked a bit of direction and I personally dreaded the time slot.",
                "Yes! Its a great course to help in understanding how theory works in real life education settings.",
