            "comments": [
                "Strength: slides were usually engaging, liked the multimedia content.\r\nWeakness: boring at times, and we spent so much time planning the final project that we barely had any time to actually code it.",
                "Great overview of HCI concepts but the assignments were drawn out and instruction in the technologies we needed to use was lacking (but tfs were very helpful).",
                "No weaknesses except the midterm maybe (since it was hella memorization), but it is a So credit so it's worth it\r\nstrengths\r\nmarynel is a very good lecturer, very engaging content, engaging lectures, final project was fun",
                "Strengths: \r\n- The initial assignments are very straightforward and easy to appraoch.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- We are only given two weeks to implement our final projects, and we are not given proper training or instruction for implementing these. Students are forced to figure out the implementation by themselves in a very short (and extremely stressful) time frame.\r\n- All the assignments prior to the final project emphasize concepts that are too elementary (i.e. how to brainstorm)",
                "Strengths: Good lectures, different kind of content you wouldn't see in CS, easy Social Science credit for CS people; Weaknesses: Very backloaded work. We had 2+ weeks per the first 5 (out of 7) assignments which were all pieces of cake, and only 1 week for the entire implementation of the semester-long project. My group stayed up past 2AM on many days in that week. Took away an entire week of my life just because the deadlines of assignments made no sense",
                "Strengths: the actual content in the course is solid and interesting. It's generally presented in an accessible manner.\r\nWeaknesses: the whole interactive display thing with the Kinect is just plainly not fun to work with (for me and others I have spoken to). Simply put, the technology and experience of working with it is \"janky\". It would be nice to have even one other alternative to the kind of project that can be done to gain firsthand experience with the iterative design cycle. Additionally, the amount of time given to actually implement the prototype was too short. My group made (in my opinion) good use of A5 and A6, but we weren't satisfied with the time we had nor the final result. Aditionally, \"experienced\" students have to take on way more responsibility than is reasonable. In terms of content, I also found that some things were excessively over-explained despite being simple and intuitive to pretty much everyone (like the contextual inquiry, master-apprentice interaction) while things that were actually confusing were briefly mentioned and never explained again (like tasks, my god, questions about tasks came up again and again all the way into A6).",
                "I think it would be better to assign groups based on times students could meet. You work with the same assigned group on a project all semester and my group struggled to find times to meet sometimes. I think that when assigning groups that have to meet outside of class, the professor should have thought about that a little more, rather than just matching skill sets. I liked the interactive portions of this course and the guest speakers were pretty cool.",
                "The content of the lectures was very interesting. I learnt a lot about design principles and examples in real life. \r\nThis class is very fast paced because there are many assignments and most have a large group work component, with no late days.",
                "Class is great, i thoroughly enjoyed it",
                "The first 5 assignments didn't prepare me for the last 2. We should start coding after assignment 4 or 3. The workload ramped up so much in the end. Also, the first assignments don't consider the limitations of the technology we are using. We are only supposed to look at that after we considered the problem space which I find led to my team backtracking on our implementations.",
                "Strengths: The final project is fun to work on with a good group, and the course does not have a demanding workload. There is only one exam (midterm) and it is fairly intuitive and easy to get a good grade on, even if you haven't attended all of the lectures.\r\nWeaknesses: You start programming the final project only during the final three weeks of the semester, which can be stressful if your group is unresponsive or if you do not have a lot of experience with javascript. Lectures can be a bit dry sometimes, especially in the beginning of the semester. Also, prof does not teach you programming techniques or try to give students a greater understanding of the sensor used in the final project.",
                "The strengths of the class were definitely the lectures. Interesting and compelling with awesome content. However, the weakness is definitely the final project. It didn't feel like much of a CS class. The only coding we did was for the class-long final project, and it was worth almost nothing even within this project. I would have wished we did more mini projects that helped to more regularly showcase what we'd learned.",
                "Enable working with friends we know for the project",
                "Being randomly assigned a group is really hit or miss, but I felt pretty unlucky with my group, so it made the whole class frustrating. All of the assignments are highly dependent on how motivated each of your group members are. Even though nothing was particularly difficult, it became a burden to coordinate timing with the rest of the group and pester other members to finish their work.",
                "Was very interesting content-wise and had a very reasonable amount of work and engagement for most of the semester. However, the work did become very heavy towards the end with the project and the random groups are a big issue.",
                "This class is really well organized. The lectures are clear and the assignments are well structured. I am not sure if there needs to be any of improving to be honest. I enjoyed the class and think every single CS major should take this. It makes you actively think about your implementation when coding thereby making you a better software engineer.",
                "Strengths:\r\nWell taught, a lot of resources and explanations \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:",
                "Sometimes, the content in the lectures felt intuitive and unnecessary; I would have preferred to focus on content that was more technical and applicable to coding the semester project.",
                "Strengths: one of the most well-organized courses I've ever taken. The expectations were made extremely clear from the first day of what was expected in the course, and there was a lot of student support throughout. The material, itself, is also very interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were a bit slow at times. While it was cool to work on one project throughout the entire semester, I wish we had more time to work on the actual implementation.",
                "None, the class was great!",
                "The course project was great until the end. We were not given great guidance on how to write the code to interpret the body movements on camera and we were given very little time to write the code relative to the length of the semester.",
                "Well-paced and well-structured group project. Interesting guest speakers.",
                "Strengths: the content, course calendar, Ed stem system and low stress level\r\nWeaknesses: the pacing of the class. I wish we had more time to work on our final installation. It was like a mad rush working on our program and studying for finals/other projects in the last two weeks of May.",
                "This course was all-around a very would course. I had an amazing experience and would recommend it to any computer science/cognitive science student. The course faculty was amazing and the assignments were well designed.",
                "The bulk of the course load was all in the last two weeks. It was hard to manage.",
                "Strengths: Prof Vzquez is a great instructor and leader of the course. The organization of the lectures was also a high point, ie the order in which material was presented made a lot of sense. The TAs were also great when it came to developing the final project. The midterm exam was very fair. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A. This course is exactly as it should be.",
                "The quality of Professor Vazquezs teachings.",
                "Course was not engaging for most of the semester. I only felt like I learned things in the last few weeks when working on the actual project.",
                "Strengths: very engaging and interesting course.\r\nWeakness: only 2 weeks to code the whole project, should be more time",
                "For the most part, I felt that I came to class every day just to have the same core concept reemphasized to me: that if you want to design a system that's good for users, then you should talk to the users and find out what kind of design they want. Most of what was taught could be boiled down to that. As a consequence, lectures were hard to engage with and the course work was largely uninteresting. The in-class assignments felt far more like attendance quizzes than something necessary for the class, and as a consequence, makes any of the concepts learned/reinforced from them feel more like a chore than an interesting concept/idea to keep in mind. The biggest weakness of the class was the semester long project, which is unfortunately because it plays a large roll in the class. The first 80% of the assignments for the project felt extremely inconsequential and my group was able to meet the night before they were due and slap them together and get a solid grade on them. Assignments 5 and 6 felt like an extreme jump from the previous assignments, as we went from prototyping on paper and digitally to just immediately programming the entire system. Additionally, none of the necessarily languages were really taught in lecture, and so for someone with little experience in CSS and no experience in HTML/JavaScript, I felt like dead weight having to either spend my time doing non-programming tasks or make up for my deficiency by scrambling to learn these languages. I understand that the groups were meant to be optimized to have people who understand these languages in each group, but some elementary teaching of these languages in this class could really help the distribution of labor in the final assignments, as well as assigning the actual programming assignments earlier so students have more time to learn (especially if the languages aren't taught) and less pressure. Also, a lot of the HCI concepts required for the assignments (such as 'tasks') felt extremely ill-defined, and everyone in my groups and other groups I spoke to felt confused on what some of the assignments were truly asking of us, even after reviewing notes/lecture slides. Almost every other student I spoke with felt similarly disinterested/uninspired by the first few assignments and then extremely overwhelmed by the last assignments. Ultimately, I had been interested in the idea of Human Computer Interaction, and thought that the first few lectures were interesting regarding learning the history of the field, but was ultimately disappointed that the class turned out to be more about how to design a marketable product. It felt less like an introduction to the field of Human Computer Interaction as a concept and more of an introduction on how to be a start-up engineer if you want to make a successful business, which is not what I had expected at all going into the course.\r\n\r\nNot to be completely negative though, the professor was extremely kind and generous with mistakes in work. She was also a pleasure to listen to and did her best to make lecture interesting (despite the issues I've noted with it). You can tell she's dedicated to the field, and the various speakers she brought to the class were engaging and a great opportunity to listen to. Additionally, the course staff were just excellent and extremely kind---especially in the final weeks with troubleshooting and putting the final touches on our projects. \r\n\r\nI think it's important to note that I am not angry about the course, just disappointed and feeling a bit misled.",
                "the TAs were a strength: Sasha, Nathan, Austin, and the other TAs were extremely kind throughout the implementation of the final project. The guest speakers were interesting, with the highlight being Prof Scaz. I don't feel like I learned that much; perhaps, more hands-on activities that were more challenging would've improved the class. Marynel was usually accommodating and genuinely cares for the students.",
                "I wish we had more time to work on the programming aspect of our final projects. It was only fit into the the last couple of assignments of the project, when we should have started working on the programming at least for a few weeks to a month.",
                "I thought the lectures could be a bit boring, but I enjoyed the visiting lectures and the overall material. I enjoyed the project as well",
                "A strength was the class being accessible to everyone even non cs majors. I also feel another strength is that the content of the class is stuff that I could use when building projects for other classes. Even when building a project for another class this semester I found myself thinking of the hueristic design principles from this class. A weakness is that most of the actual building and coding happened in the last two weeks of the class. I",
                "The course is very well-organized, and the teaching team, including the instructor and TFs, are very approachable. It is evident that the instructor is passionate about teaching. The primary focus of this course is to undertake a semester-long project, which was a great experience. However, I wish I had more time to learn practical skills regarding implementing and interface design. While I understand the critical role of theory and the design process, half of the semester was dedicated to learning theories, leaving me with only two weeks to implement them.\r\n\r\nMoreover, after the first half, few lectures were directly related to assignments and projects, which discouraged me from attending and paying attention to them. It would be beneficial to offer more programming sessions relevant to web design, in addition to the lectures. I had limited knowledge in web design and had to teach myself most of the programming needed for the semester-long project. Including an individual assignment focused on web designing would also be great.",
                "strengths:\r\n- design research, user research, prototyping, and user testing techniques were all interesting and relevant.\r\n- group project (is only a strength if you get paired with a good group, like I did. I heard some horror stories though)\r\n- in class activities prepare you both for the HW assignments and fort he midterm\r\n- midterm questions were fair, if you just listen in class and actually follow during lectures, the midterm will be easy.\r\n- structure of the course: the course was structured in a really good way with 1 midterm and no final. the assignments were spread out and there was enough time between each one so that you were never too stressed about it\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- office hours: few and far between. also, each OH is only 45 minutes at a time which is not a lot of time. also, office hors were practically irrelevant for the 4/5 of the class till the final 3 weeks of the semester when we actually started coding. there should have been more office hours sessions for the times we really needed it (coding assignments vs earlier assignments that were straightforward)\r\n- timing of the assignments: the amount of assignments was fine, but the timing in which we were given certain assignments didn't make a lot of sense. we spent like 10 weeks doing very humanities based assignments like user research and brainstorming and drawing things out, which was fine. but then, we got to the last 3 weeks of the semester and had to implement an entire project using HTML, CSS, and all of this data from a sensor that more than half the class knew nothing about. it would have been much better to have fewer of the design and prototype assignments and start much much earlier on the coding part. luckily i was in a group that had 2/4 people that somewhat knew HTML, but if it weren't for them I literally would have gotten a 0 because we weren't taught any HTML and it isn't listed as a legit pre-req of knowledg",
                "Weakness: Poorly planned uninteresting material, lots of useless busywork.\r\nStrength: Very Easy A.",
                "Strengths: The content was interesting and useful. The assignments gave a good opportunity for students to experience the design process and work in a group. Weaknesses: Lectures were often not very interesting to listen to. Topics seemed to be repeated throughout multiple lectures and were sometimes over-explained (e.g., how to work in groups, how to conduct interviews). The random assignment of groups also felt a bit unfair, because they were assigned in such a way that there 1-2 people experienced with JavaScript/HTML/CSS/Git were grouped with 2-3 people who were inexperienced. This pressured the more experienced members to spend more time not only doing more work but also teaching their group members the relevant skills needed for the final project. I also felt that the less experienced group members were stressed about needing to learn new languages and frameworks very quickly to keep up with the pace of the assignments. Overall, there was not enough time to code, and I think allowing students to select their own groups would have created a greater sense of responsibility across group members.",
                "The assignments of this course is very helpful in that it takes us through the entire design and implementation cycle of a product",
                "First 80 percent of the class was just conceptual and then the last 20 percent was making the project. We went through many \"prototypes\" of our project before doing anything of substance. If this class really was about the design cycle and stuff, we should make a prototype, do user testing, and then change our prototype. We should have done real stuff before the second to last assignment.",
                "Some of the strengths of this course were that the course is very beginner-friendly for people who are not looking for a super intense elective, and Marynel is super supportive and sweet towards all students. One place for improvement is the course timeline, as I felt all of the heavy workload coding was condensed into a few weeks towards the end of the semester.",
                "no weaknesses, great course",
                "strength- in-class activities were interesting and not too demanding",
                "Strengths: Marynel is a great lecturer and her TAs care about the practice of HCI. A strength of the course is giving students exposure to the design and HCI history of many major technological innovations, having a cumulative project that reflects the iterative design cycle, and providing practice for implementing surprisingly challenging design expectations. \r\nWeaknesses: I think the teaching staff did its best to adjust the class to such a large course, but I think the course could be a lot better if there was more conversations facilitated amongst groups regarding their design thought process. It was hard given the classroom setup and sheer number of people taking the class. I also think that I would have grown a lot if we were provided with more opportunities to ideate a project beyond the Kinect Display format. I also think that coding psets, or a couple of optional psets to help people feel more confident in their web development skills before being thrown in the deep end in the last three weeks of class would have been beneficial as well. I also thought that the content was pretty vague, but I understand that the content could not always be specific because lectures were about covering HCI practices.",
                "A semester-long group project is a fun change from the structure of most other CS classes. This allowed us to learn more practically than in other classes. The group assignment was random though which was cool in that I met some new people. Other groups, however, seemed less functional and had group members coasting. Some of the content I felt wasn't super relevant to HCI we might do / disconnected from the project and I didn't love the participation exercises we had to do, but there was some flexibility so it wasn't too bad.",
                "strengths: clear and accessible lectures, strong course organization (slides posted ahead of time, detailed schedule), lots of TF support, Marynel is a very kind lecturer weaknesses: groups are assigned randomly, students evaluate themselves with the collaboration record instead of evaluating each other, so it can be difficult to communicate when certain group members don't pull their weight. also, programming skills (html/css/js) aren't really taught so group members with more experience may end up working more for the final project",
                "A6 should be assigned earlier so that we can begin coding and more time to debug. It seems that A6 should not have the same time to complete as the other assignments. Another major improvement that should be made is to ELIMINATE randomly assigned groups. From personal experience and from listening to other recounts from the class, in several cases, one person is stuck doing 95% of the A6 assignment.",
                "This is a really fun course. Each phase of the project takes little time to complete (except the final one). But since you have a semester group long project in several phrases and the group members are randomly assigned, it really really depends on luck. I'm lucky enough to get active and contributing group members who produced a great end product with me together. But I also have friends that got unlucky group members and had to do 90% of the work by themselves. Other than that, the lectures are pretty chill. Some parts are really fun and entertaining, some parts are boring. But the course is pretty well-designed overall because we get to practice each part of the course via small group assignments that accumulate into a big final group project which grants a huge sense of accomplishment.",
                "The course had a lot of emphasis and repetition on the course material and the important points to consider when designing a product, so it was fairly easy to review concepts from class.",
                "A lot of time was spent on design and user research, which are important topics but I wish more time was spent on teaching us how to implement projects because once that stage of the semester-long project started, it felt very rushed and many of us were confused as beginners.",
                "Almost no coding till the very end is really odd for a CS class, and then the final projects were somewhat sped up with no guidance",
                "This course possesses several strengths that contribute to its effectiveness. Firstly, it is accessible to both computer science majors and non-majors, making it a suitable option for a wide range of students. Moreover, the course strikes a balance between theoretical knowledge and practical application, allowing students to actively build upon what they are learning. However, there is one notable weakness in the course, which is the mandatory attendance policy. While attendance can be beneficial for engagement and interaction, it may limit flexibility for students with conflicting schedules or other commitments. To further improve the course, considering a more flexible approach to attendance, such as providing alternative learning options or recorded lectures, could enhance the overall learning experience for students.",
                "The course is well organized and prepared, but the schedule of each assignment is a little tight.",

                "Strengths: The prof + the actual material of the class + the very amazing guest speakers \r\nWeakness: Some of the classes honestly felt a bit boring, but that was not a big issue; I enjoyed most of the lectures I went to",
                "I think it would be good to have more smaller exams throughout the semester so that we can actually show our mastery of the Contant instead of just a big project which takes a lot of coding knowledge to complete",
                "Engagement was pretty low as a weakness. Furthermore, the pacing of projects as it went from conceptual application to coding was very, very bad. I think that if coding was part of the previous group assignments, not a lot of the groups would have had as much difficulty cranking the project out.",
                "Strengths: I could tell that Professor Vasquez was really trying her best to engage the class through in-class activities, along with more dynamic PPTs. Really giving her credit for trying to make this CS class more dynamic and less lecture-y than other ones in the department. I also really liked how we were able to apply these principles through an in-class project. Finally, I really liked that Professor Vasquez invited some guest speakers to talk about their work. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the lectures were a little bit \"fluffy\" in terms of learning principles. I think for a hands-on class like this, it would have been better to actually ask students to \"learn by doing\" rather than \"learn by understanding\" -- perhaps, by putting students in their lecture groups in class as the in-class activity.",
                "Strengths: guest lecturers were very knowledgeable about their fields, well organized course material\r\nWeaknesses: course material wasn't the most exciting",
                "Strengths: semester-long project, very digestible content presented in a way where it clearly builds on top of each other, good mix of examples and ideas within the field\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the coding/implementation part of the project seemed much more work in a short period of time and was a bit unclear with regards to implementation compared to the other parts of the project",
                "I feel like the structure of the course could be better organized, the project itself felt rushed even though it's a semester long project. I feel like we should start the implementation a bit earlier.",
                "Strengths:  I liked how we were assigned to groups because I got to meet and work with some really cool people all semester who I did not know at all before taking this course and we made something we could be proud of.   I liked the lectures (including the guest lectures) and the in-class activities.  Of course the in-class activities forced me to pay attention but it also minimized outside work for the class which is such a plus.  We also had opportunities to work with other people for some of the activities and that was really nice.    \r\nWeaknesses:  I wish we had more time, like a month, to implement the final project because it felt a bit rushed at the end and my team was grinding in the last few days to work out the bugs, adapt it for the display, and get it done."

                "I did not personally have a good time. Randomly being put into groups can lead to some unfortunate outcomes depending on your group. Even if you get put with a good one like I did (and other groups had some real nightmare stories), every assignment feels like an absolute chore because you have to depend so heavily on others. There were still some moments where it felt like I was the only one doing all the planning and thinking on how to get things done. A lot of students, based on the class's reputation, are in the class to \"coast\" and get the credit -- fine, but someone at some points has to actually do the work for the group. The final sprint for A6 was particularly unenjoyable. While the content (better) and assignments (worse) are ok, its a course I wouldn't recommend because of the lack of continued, genuinely interesting substance and frustrating assignments.",
                "Yes, it's a pretty easy class to do well in, even if it can be a little unengaging sometimes. It's a good 5th credit course.",

There are so many interesting considerations about design you learn in this course and also tools/techniques you can use to make your designs better. Also Marynel is amazing.

Over half of the course is a semester-long group project with a randomly assigned group. If you are a cs major and want a relatively low-workload course to balance out your schedule (ex: took this with 323), this is a great choice. This class is worthwhile for computer science students because it's helpful to learn about approaches to using cs to solve real-world problems and the project is fun.",

HCI is a woefully underrepresented field at Yale, and it's something that's very important to both other top CS programs as well as to industry. Remember, it's only us who interacts with the computer through bash. Everybody else is using interfaces, so knowing how to design and assess those interfaces is very valuable.",

                "This course seems to be really great for some people, and a terrible experience for others. It ultimately seems to be up to how much you care about the course content and how willing you are to work in groups that are pre-assigned.",

I think it is important for CS students to understand the design reasons behind the products they are making, and to be constantly conscious of the user perspective. If you listen in class, you get to hear a lot of interesting stories about design in the technical field. Professor Vazquez also brings in very interesting guest speakers!",
                "I would recommend it if you are up for mostly working on a Kinect web-app through the semester, with random assignment to groups. You learn mostly from practical experience rather than class. The class itself is fairly chill though I didn't learn as much through it as I had hoped.",
                "yes, especially if they don't have much cs experience or want a cs gut. it's all group work and a very fair midterm, so you can totally get by with fewer programming skills. the groups are assigned so there's a mix of skill levels in the group. the weekly workload is also very low up until the final project, which also isn't that bad. marynel is a good lecturer and the topics are all very high-level",

Before I thought HCI is just a humanity + CS subject. But after taking it, I realize that HCI comes in many shapes and forms. It's a multi-major interdisciplinary subject. For example, Mech E + EE + CS + Art + Robotics + etc etc etc. You have to design in an effective way, and ensure the product follows a thorough cycle for the best result. I had a ton of fun doing it, and my management and project structural management skill got a lot better. This class was a great experience simulator, and I had a lot of fun with it.",

Theres not much coding involved in this class but a greater emphasis on concepts, so I would take this class if youre looking for some design exposure. Plus you get to create a working project at the end of the semester which can be cool depending on what youre wanting to do.",

Additionally, the instructor's teaching approach and the overall ease of the class make it a must-take for students. The course offers a valuable learning experience that is both enjoyable and informative.",

                "Yes if you know a fair amount of programming + want a more moralistic view of computer science and how it is applied.",
                "Yes, this is one of those rare non-theoretical CS classes in the department that is actually interactive, dynamic, and shows how it can be tied to much more practical applications (e.g. software development, robotic research, etc.) Professor Vasquez is also one of the few teaching staff who actually cares a lot about making classes dynamic. She's very humble and sweet, but also really brilliant in her field.",
                "Yes. The workload was never overwhelming and I felt like I learned a decent amount. Great CS elective for a 5 credit semester.",
                "I'd absolutely recommend this course as a fun, chill elective where you still learn about something very applicable (the iterative design process from start to finish) and implement a cool, interactive project throughout the semester that mirrors the content. The course material is very straightforward and would make a great elective choice for any CS or CS+ major. The organization of the course is also very clear and instructions are provided to ensure little to no confusion, so it is very easy to know what is expected of the student.",
                "Yes, the material is very useful",
                "I would definitely recommend this class because you learn a lot and it is not unnecessarily hard like I find a lot of other Yale CS classes to be.  It's especially nice to take if you have other high-workload classes."
