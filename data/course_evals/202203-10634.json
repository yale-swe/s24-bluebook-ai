                "I learned a lot about Russian and Soviet history throughout the 20th century, and I improved my Russian greatly.",
                "This course offers an approach to Russian history, primarily Soviet, by way of various media: film, short story, news articles, surveys. We primarily covered the perestroika/collapse of Soviet Union period, the Russian Civil War, the \"likbez\" (liquidation of illiteracy), and female contributions to Soviet achievements. Each of these assignments included vocabulary to learn and grammatical structures to master/continue mastering. In this respect, I've learned a lot less, let's say, statistically or quantitatively, and more qualitatively about a variety of periods in the past 130 or so years of Russian history. The course is less about reading traditional historical texts, and more so about parsing through primary source materials that are artistic in nature. I've come away from the course with a more solid footing in the works we studied over the semester, and in general can more adequately express myself in the Russian language.",

                "Irina is the best professor Ive hadkind, brilliant, and fun!",
                "The strengths: we covered really interesting books and movies, expanded vocab, really focused on analysis of books.",
                "strengths: very personalized feedback depending on student language proficiency. quick feedback turnaround on homework assignments \r\n\r\nweaknesses: felt a little disorganized at times, not given enough warning about syllabus/grade weight changes",
                "No weaknesses, the course is perfect as it is!",
                "This course was very well organized! We often had input into which topics we wanted to discuss deeper, and the class discussions always resulted in meaningful conversations. Almost all homework assignments were discussed in detail during class, so any difficult text was always explained to us, along with why it's important. The movies and short stories picked to analyze all fit together with coherent themes, and we were able to build on previous media analyzed throughout the class, which was exciting.",
                "The strengths lie entirely in Irina. The course would not be this course without Irina's passion, knowledge, and insights. The way she explains grammar is excellent, and the homework assignments she provides are great for working on your grammar. The materials selected are also very interesting!\r\nAs for weaknesses, I'd say that sometimes the homework is just too long and requires far too much work -- especially if we are just going to discuss the answers in class. A 10-15 page reading with 10-15 written questions following it is a ton of work. I think we also had an especially difficult classroom situation, what with 5 or 6 heritage/native speakers and 5-6 non-native speakers. The divide based on language level was stark and made class contributions a little difficult to follow or provide.",
                "Strengths: Great instruction; interesting topics, readings, and films; excellent use of multimedia\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes a bit disorganized and I didn't always know what was due; everybody is on a different level which can make discussions difficult"

                "Yes, I highly recommend this course! For one, any class taught by Doctor Dolgova is sure to be an amazing class. It is a great class for students at every level of Russian. I especially recommend the class if you are now ready to take your first L-5 content course in Russian. This is the perfect first L-5 content course! If you are someone like me who just started learning Russian (or not a native or heritage speaker) and just met the enrollment reqs, then ENROLL. The class will be mixed with all levels (including native speakers). I often find that I am the student struggling to keep up in the class, but the professor, Doctor Dolgova, creates such a masterful curriculum which helps and engages students at every level. Grading / expectations are based off the individual level of every student, so a student who recently started learning won't be graded the same as a student who grew up speaking Russian. It is the perfect atmosphere. Lots of films, lots of short stories, lots of very interesting articles. This is sure to be one of of your favorite / most memorable classes at Yale. So if you're looking for a good L-5 content course for Russian, this is it!",
                "Absolutely! If you're interested in Russian history and/or improving your Russian, definitely take this class. Irina Andreevna is a wonderful professor who makes this class very engaging and will help you with any difficulties you have!",
                "Yes, for sure. If you've taken fourth-year Russian and understand how upper-level Russian course function, this class would be a perfect fit. I think, however, if you really want to get a lot out of a content-based class like this one, you need to put in a lot of independent work. I would make my own vocabulary lists and carefully read the homework articles to ensure I understood all of the words and expressions that were not familiar to me. Because assessments (and there are only 2-3!) are few and far between, you have to stay on top of the grammatical concepts on your own accord. And if you are too timid to speak up and make mistakes in a class discussion of this sort, I'd stay away. A class like this requires active participation, even if you're sentences are grammatically incorrect. The only way you will improve is if you speak up! So don't be shy, give it a try!",
