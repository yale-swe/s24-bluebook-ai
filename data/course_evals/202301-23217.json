                "This course helped me think more deeply about the intellectual history of thought on war, peace, and related matters, through the lens of several major philosophical traditions, and to articulate their shared (and divergent) priors. Often, radically different traditions share more in common than we might think!",
                "I developed my writing skills and had the opportunity to think deeply about political philosophy for the first time. The writers we read and the discussions we had about their work were lively, profound, and highly relevant. This course has taught me how to read, analyze, and discuss political philosophy texts and has provided me a set of core principles to guide my understanding of what is just in war, international relations, and interpersonal relations. I also felt like I really honed my writing skills over the course of the semester.",

            "comments": [
                "The course covers a lot of the fundamental theories, and having never taken a political science class, I feel that I ended the semester with a solid basic understanding of war philosophy. There was a lot of reading, to the point where we did not get to cover all of it. I think that reading could be more guided (as was done sometimes when focus\/guiding questions were given alongside the reading assignments). This way, perhaps, students might feel less lost in the extensive and dense reading.",
                "The course was good, but it did not really follow what was stated in the syllabus and discussed mostly philosophical issues rather than tying in current global events with past thinkers in a meaningful way.",
                "This was a really strong course! I loved our class discussions, and I think we had people who really pushed the class to think deeply about how these authors relate to each other. I feel like I generally came away from discussions with new insights, ones I am still turning over in my head as I formulate my own thoughts on war, peace, and the like.\r\n\r\nI think the one room for growth I'd offer is in the syllabus. I think we missed a few critical perspectives on war and peace that we would do well to include. For instance, I think many total pacifists provide a real foil for some of the other traditions we study. Beyond that, I think our thinkers deserved to be challenged on the role of commerce in peace -- Marxist perspectives on war and peace are quite important to have on the table, as divergences from the liberal international order. The course could also benefit from the inclusion of feminist voices, perspectives from soldiers on the ground about the political decisions made about their lives, etc. This is hard to do with a short syllabus, but I think the second half of the syllabus gets a bit stuck in the liberal consensus, when divergent voices are critical for understanding today's philosophy of war.",
                "Strengths: Professor Wilford, the selection and pairing of the texts for each week, the way discussion is structured (Professor's guiding comments followed by vibrant student discussion), office hours and essay feedback. Weaknesses: a fair amount of reading",
                "Professor Wilford was a great strength. She was very accommodating and helpful. We took ample time for each reading at it was never overbearing. A potential weakness was that we didnt talk as much in class with how to develop the most successful papers."

                "I would recommend this course, but really only if you're interested in war philosophy.",
                "Yes, but it would be a difficult class without a strong background in philosophy.",
                "Yes! This class really gave me a better grounding in trying to think about what war \"is\" (and how it relates to \"peace\") and how different thinkers have tried to understand it. The class was particularly relevant this term, given events in Ukraine -- and we did a good job grounding our philosophy in the considerations of modern life.",
                "Definitely! I learned a huge amount from this seminar. Professor Wilford's teaching (and my classmates contributions) have already changed the way I think about what kinds of political structures are just, both domestically and among nations on the international stage. This course pushes you to deepen your thinking, and that's what makes it so great.",
