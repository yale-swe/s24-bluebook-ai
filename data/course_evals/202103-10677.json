                "I learned generally about the major issues plaguing New Haven and cities in America.",
                "This course taught me to think in new ways about what makes a city great. DeStefano returns, again and again, to the concepts of social capital, social cohesion, and social legitimacy as the primary lenses through which we may be able to see a city's wealth. The course falls somewhere between using New Haven as a case study for these lenses and teaching us solely about New Haven's history of public policy. It isn't your typical polisci courseit feels more like an informal conversation with DeStefano, which for me made the topics feel accessible.",
                "I learned about the wealth of cities and strategies to increase it. I improved my urban policy vocabulary and exchanged ideas with fellow active citizens.",

                "Unlike a lot of political science classes, this class is all about real-world practice. The Fair Haven tour is really valuable. Most students come into the class already having some familiarity with the New Haven community, but a little more New Haven history/politics/geography could really help ground some of the conversations about housing, race, and inequality.",
                "I like how the course was very discussion based and I think the readings all served their purpose and made sense in the context of discussions.",
                "Strengths: Hearing Professor DeStefano's personal experiences in New Haven was particularly invaluable. I really enjoyed the Fair Haven field trip and having Mr. Outlaw attend our seminar as a guest speaker. I also thought the reading load was reasonable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings could be more pointed/curated, particularly on topics such as reparations and income inequality. I also wish we had spent more time talking about the ins and outs of New Haven and the major actors in the city today. Finally, when writing the final paper, I didn't feel like the course had particularly equipped me to make policy recommendations.",
                "Strengths: DeStefano really values class discussion and asks thought-provoking questions to get the discussion moving. He also clearly values our opinionshe often checked in with us about how the course was feeling and whether he could make any adjustments to make it more successful. The trip around the city with him was really great; he just knows so much about the city and getting the chance to see the places we discussed in class felt like a good way of grounding the course in the real-world people and places we were discussing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It often seemed that DeStefano thought his students were incorrect if they did not agree with his worldview. I sometimes felt like he saw us as naivewhich, to a former mayor of New Haven and seasoned public policy-maker, I'm sure we arebut this sometimes brought an antagonism and frustration among students to class discussions. I think in the future he should be careful to meet his students' opinions with a little less skepticism and a little more curiosity.",
                "Sometimes the class was a bit too much of a lecture for everyone's taste. But there were a lot of lively discussions and it sounds like this is an area DeStefano is actively working on. I had another class where people were not allowed to have laptops open during class, which I think was a successful strategy and maybe worth implementing.",
                "Strengths: use of New Haven as a case study, Fair Haven field trip, very engaging readings, reasonable workload, very approachable and helpful prof. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion in class sometimes felt overly unstructured, writing prompts (for reading responses and the final paper) overly specific in a way that made it hard to fit everything in while also including stuff that I felt compelled to write about.",
                "Strengths were the cool tangents about New Haven politics and history as well as the Fair Haven tour. Weakness was that the discussion wasnt really structured as a discussion."

                "Yes, especially if you have a prior interest in New Haven and urban policy. Professor DeStefano is a really refreshing take given that he actually did the job of governance and doesn't just research it. The workload isn't that bad, and assignments are very manageable if you follow guidance.",
                "Yes, I think this is a great course to learn more about New Havens history and examine urban issues through a political science lens.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student with the caveat that if you are not already interested in New Haven politics or city government in general, you will probably find some aspects of the course dry or difficult to get into.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to a student who is interested in how public policy makes cities. Students who are interested in New Haven will find lots to talk about in this course; there seems to be an unspoken prerequisite for some prior experience in organizing in New Haven, or at least a high level of familiarity with the city. I would caution students against taking notes on a laptopsince the class is discussion-based, it's easy to lose track of the conversation and get totally lost if you get distracted by the online world. Also, if you need a lot of structure to your classes, this course isn't for you. It's essentially an informal conversation every class, so note-taking can be challenging. Honestly, I wish I'd just put my computer away and listened to the conversation as if I wasn't in class. \r\n\r\nPlease take this class! We need more Yalies who understand the forces that have shaped New Haven.",
                "Yes! It was a good introduction to new Haven and prof DeStefano is a great guy. He was willing to have tough conversations and was always available to meet if any questions came up.",
