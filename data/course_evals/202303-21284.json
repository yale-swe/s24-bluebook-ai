I also learned a lot about systems of category, and how they can inform views of otherness and monstrosity in art, and in the every day media, as well as the role of perspective.",

I learned so much from them and they always encourages me to branch out and research things that interested me. I also appreciated that this class allowed us to explore so many assets this campus has to offer. I was able to visit more museums and collections in this class than I have in any other class.",
                "I found the teaching style remarkably informative and both the professor and Natalie did a great job of engaging the students and making it a group-based discussion that engaged with topics that are relevant even today. I thought it was great how we got to take trips to the rare book museums and art museums to engage with the art in-person to discuss relevant topics while immersed. The teachers were well informed as to the topics, and had great teaching styles, and they chose interesting reading excerpts that were both relevant and thought-provoking, which aided class participation and interest. I cannot think of any weaknesses for the course or teachers as both teachers were great, and I enjoyed the course structure and topic.",
