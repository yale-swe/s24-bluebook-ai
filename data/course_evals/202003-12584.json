                "I definitely learned some about geographic and place-based theories, research methods, and a lot of obscure knowledge about the LA River, but this class definitely builds more on how you think about and approach the world in a really fascinating way. Just seeing a lot more of the factors that go into constructing a sense of place is a really interesting lens through which to view the world, and this class does a great job of introducing you to the concepts.",
                "I learned to study geography and interpret it according to various framework. It was a move away from the temporal reasoning common in history to a spatial reasoning, which was completely new to me.",
                "I learned a variety of methods to understand spaces, places, and landscapes, as well as what these words mean. While I was somewhat familiar with geography as a discipline, this course helped me understand how it can be utilized in many fields.",
                "We learned a lot about the specific definitions of space, place, landscape, and other geopraphic terms, but more importantly, we were able to apply those ideas to projects about our home space, which were incredibly fulfilling.",
                "I was able to develop various skills regarding observational\/analytical work through the field projects",
                "Space, Place and Landscape totally reorients how you think about geography and space. With some basis in theoretical geography, mostly itll give you a lot of different methods for looking at the social and structural relationships in the world around you.",
                "The \"field assignments\" built into this class were helpful in teaching new ways of interacting with space, place, and landscape. They were effective in guiding students through various viewpoints and beginning to think as geographers about spatial issues. These skills are definitely applicable to other fields of study, and are useful in switching perspectives.",
                "I learned ways to critically interrogate space and my relationships to space. I simultaneously got some grounding in traditional geography and terms while also learning about the theories and methods behind multiple fields of critical geography.",
                "This course introduced me to geography and its essential role in the study of societal structures, people, and physical space. I learned new vocabulary and concepts that have completely enriched the way I think of myself and the spaces I reside in. Most importantly I had fun thinking of new ways to describe and understand what I usually take for granted."

                "I would say that the course is really well organized for online learning and generates really interesting discussions. The readings are hit and miss, but the discussions are always good. The home projects are so much fun if you really dig into it and choose a place that you truly feel connected to. I think maybe even less focus on lecture and starting the discussion and home projects earlier in the semester could be even better because I just felt kinda lost in the concepts early on in the class without grounding in examples, projects, and a model system because the topics early on are super philosophical and intangible which is hard for my stem child mind to grasp.",
                "The only weakness this class has is not starting the weekly assignments earlier so they could be more spread out. Otherwise, this class is pretty flawless. The readings each had its own purpose and were interesting. I felt like I learned something new from each paper and they were the perfect length for maximizing interest and time. Having the final project be a recollection of all the assignments made it a lot less stressful than other courses. A section on how to create our own geographic media would have been nice, I think that would really tie this course together.",
                "Professor Barraclough's ability to run an engaging and supportive class is one of the course's key strengths. Additionally, the project-based element of the course was way more fruitful and manageable than courses structured around big papers and reading responses.",
                "The course really gives a lot of freedom with the projects and also provides a good background of geographic material to get started. I think perhaps focusing a little more on the practical applications of geographic concepts rather than their abstract definitions might make the class more engaging.",
                "The seminar sessions were really strong because we were able to have fruitful discussions. Splitting up into groups for some portions of it was really effective as well because everyone had time to discuss their projects\/speak their thoughts on the weeks readings. No weaknesses!",
                "The syllabus for this course is pretty well structured. The readings are engaging and cover a variety of topics from differing authors, offering breath and depth to the topic. The field assignments were a nice change from standard written assignments. Although feedback was given on each assignment, it could perhaps be more specific with suggestions of improvement beyond just adding detail. I believe this course could qualify for a WR credit, in which case I would definitely expect more tailored feedback to the weekly assignments. Because the weekly write-ups are only 1-3 pages, a more clear set of guidelines at the beginning of the semester would help clear up what to prioritize within it, and to establish the level of rigor that is expected.",
                "strengths: how personalized it can be for each student, the amount of dialogue and small group discussion while also covering a lot of material, assignments in different mediums so that it can play to each student's strengths, class structure felt fairly collaborative and flexible, a couple scheduled individual meetings with prof and TF were nice\r\n\r\nweaknesses: there was just too much work (at least for now during COVID) even after kristin and professor barraclough made adjustments, didn't get to see much of the work the rest of the class was doing on their personal sites until the last class, sometimes felt like the expectations and feedback for the papers we turned in were unclear",
                "A strength in this course is definitely the intimate seminar format. I learned a lot from class discussions and break out room discussions with my classmates.",
                "While I appreciated the broader overview of the field provided by the readings, the discussions were often lacking and often just felt like we were being asked to summarize or restate the main points of the readings."

                "This course was the best adapted to COVID that I've seen, in fact I specifically chose it because the syllabus was so clearly geared towards remote learning and it did not disappoint. I think the home-place semester long projects work even better when you're at home away from campus and can rethink places you've been living in and passing through all your life. The discussion format on zoom is always tough, and it was a pretty solid discussion flow for most classes, but this isn't generalizable and really depends on who's in the class. I think forming groups based on similar home-place project topics was really great, and it was awesome to speak with my group each week, and in general the breakout rooms were always really engaging and active (in a sharp departure to the dead silence in most other classes).",
                "Being able to drop one essay helped a lot. Also, there was a large amount of flexibility when turning stuff in so that was great. The final project not being new material also made things a lot easier.",
                "I think this class transitioned perfectly to online learning. We set up class standards for Zoom, which was nice, and the instructors were conscious of Zoom fatigue. The seminars used breakout rooms often, which helped make discussing a bit easier.",
                "The class worked surprisingly well over zoom. Breakout rooms were super well done because you got a group you went back to each week and clear topics to discuss (usually your own projects and work). Obviously zoom seminars are hard for discussion, but the format worked really well and the small size did help make it feel like we really got to know each other and were comfortable around each other. Also, the class was made shorter to be aware of zoom fatigue, and at every point Prof. Barraclough was so understanding. The break weeks where instead of class we had two on one meetings (with the prof and TF) were also super helpful from many perspectives.",
                "succeeded: could have mics and video off, could use the chat instead of unmuting, cutting down the class time, breakout rooms\r\n\r\ncould be improved: keeping track of engagement in the chat, kristin and professor barraclough moving through breakout rooms with their mics and cameras off was a bit uncomfortable",
                "Having two of the regularly scheduled classes be replaced by one on one meetings with the professor was really helpful. It gave me the chance to form a relationship with the professor and ask questions that are harder to ask in class because of the virtual component."

It is also very well adapted to the online format and generates some fantastic discussions. At least for me, it was a decent amount of work because I am generally a pure stem person, and writing a 2-3 page essay per week is pretty daunting, but I definitely got used to it, and the assignments are enjoyable.",
                "Yes, I think this course delivers on its purpose. It was probably my favorite course this semester. It has the right amount of workload, by being both engaging but not overwhelming.",
                "Absolutely! Prof Barraclough is an intelligent and caring teacher, and the while the workload for this class was pretty demanding at points, it never felt like busy work. I felt like a grew a lot as a thinker and as a writer, and I liked the hands-on nature of the assignments even though this is an introductory course.",

                "Yes, if you are interested in understanding how to look at the physical world around you in a more critical, thoughtful way. The class was engaging, and the projects were honestly not too stressful, but incredibly fun to do.",
                "Yes I would 100%. It teaches you a completely new way of looking at and understanding places and spaces.",
                "Absolutely. Its a well balanced course which will totally reframe the way you think about them places around you. No matter what youre interested in theres a way in which the framework of geography will be fascinating and relevant for you. The home projects are such an amazing structure, spreading out the work and also switching methods each week, and Prof. Barraclough is simply wonderful, providing a lot of feedback and asking\/listening always to our thoughts on the class. Somehow even over zoom we were able to foster a real community.",
                "i would! there are very very few geography classes at yale (the only other one I can think of is \"plantation, prison, and ghetto\" which covers some black geographic thought). this is a great introductory class to a lot of traditional and critical geography work. it might be better to take this as a younger student primarily because of the workload, but i still valued it a lot as a 1st semester senior.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to other students that are interested in expanding the way they think about modern day problems and injustices, as well as their own place in the world. This course is a good introduction to geography as a tool for social studies.",
                "This course would be good for those who want a broader overview of the field of geography but most of those who have engaged in any significant way with spatial thinking or inquiry in other classes probably wouldn't find too many new insights during this class."
