   "comments": [
    "I honed my writing skills, paying special attention to clarity, simplicity, and writing for a broad audience. I also got practice interviewing and synthesizing information.",
    "Writing concisely. being precise and clear.",
    "This course helped me think a lot about how I structure my writing. Carl's teaching transformed the way I approach writing. I've grown as a researcher, a writer, and a communicator of science.",
    "I learned to read science journalism pieces with a much more discerning eye, reading for structure and authorial choices to help inform my own writing. I learned a lot about how to conduct in-person interviewing\/reporting. I learned to write easy-to-understand descriptions of scientific concepts for wide audiences",
    "Writing proposals, pursuing leads, interviewing experts and people, how to organize a magazine article",
    "My writing definitely improved after having taken this class. Most of the students in this class had little previous experience with this sort of writing, and all seemed eager to learn about it. We learned actual techniques about how to write for a general audience with emphasis on the structure of our pieces. You write four pieces over the course of the semester, which isn't too challenging. It's difficult to get above a 90, but not hard to get a B+. Overall, this is a solid class. The readings are great, and the assignments are for the most part open-ended and fun. You get what you put into this class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Drafts were an excellent part of the course, I feel like I learned a lot through the revision process. Workshops tended to be helpful for a similar reason, although workshops on final drafts didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Class time felt a little repetitive at times.",
    "It's very harsh and non-forgiving",
    "Some of the workshops can be brutal, but the feedback you get is very personalized and, above all, helps you grow.",
    "In the first class, Professor Zimmer asked all the shoppers and most of the wait-listed students to leave the classroom. Having those students leave was an unnecessary choice that turned other enrolled students away from the course.",
    "Lots of one on one feedback and great workshops in class. Prof. Zimmer is available all the time to help out",
    "Strengths: the class is well-structured. The readings are really interesting and great examples of the best science writing out there. The four assignments are spaced nicely throughout the semester and increase in difficulty and scope towards the end. You can really learn a lot if you are willing to start the assignments on the earlier side and invest time doing research and interviewing all sorts of people. Zimmer's comments are also amazing. It is clear he spends a lot of time reading and critiquing our pieces. Weaknesses: class felt a little monotonous. It didn't help that it was scheduled right after lunch on Mondays. The discussion of some of the pieces we read seemed shallow at times."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You get to choose what you write about for most of the assignments and get a lot of latitude to work on whatever you want to work on with regards to your writing. Writing clearly can serve just about anyone in any position, and this class will absolutely help you write clearly. Don't be off-put by the workload ratings, this class is comparable to other writing classes, its just that mostly stem kids take it and writing is hard.",
    "Yes if you're not doing anything else too hard. It's all-consuming. Sometimes in a frustrating way.",
    "yes. I think I'd recommend this course to another student. Keep in mind that the grades you get might not feel like they represent the effort you're putting in, though. Professor Zimmer's standards are very high.",
    "Yes, you get valuable experience doing first person reporting and learn how to bring article ideas to fruition",
    "This is a great class for anyone interested. I was initially nervous that Professor Zimmer wouldn't invest much time into this class, given that he is busy reporting for the Times and writing books. But I quickly learned I was wrong. He devotes a lot of time into editing our pieces and he is a really great and critical editor. I am leaving this class feeling like my writing has actually improved. It's a fun class with great readings and assignments."
