                "I've been able to improve my writing, speaking, and listening skills through this course. If you want to learn how to use Chinese in a more professional setting, this is the class for you.",
                "How to read, write, interpret, and analyze Chinese texts that far surpass HSK 6 level. The vocab is especially helpful for government documents and public speeches (i.e. Hu Shi's speeches on the trend of new world culture are printed verbatim in the textbook, pretty amazing that I can understand them with relative ease) as well as international affairs and cultural critique. Topics are all over the place, from Chinese history to global geopolitics, the reform of hanzi to ideology surrounding homeland stemming from antiquity, Confucius and the Classic of Poetry (sayings, excerpts, etc.) to environmental pollution, from SARS to COVID-19, everything felt alive and relevant. I gained a deeper understanding for the language itself, most importantly, and sometimes I feel that in English we lack the ability to speak as grandiosely as we do in Chinese. Plus, as a nonnative speaker in a class with 7 heritage students, it was daunting at first, but they were all very complimentary and supportive, and most importantly understood what I said and had to contribute-which was of the utmost importance. Chinese teachers are trained to understand American and otherwise accents, but Chinese-Americans I can only presume are not; if they can understand my obviously accented Chinese, that makes me feel proud of my growth and progress. Of which Zhang Laoshi multiple times commented on. He was really dedicated to the course as well, which was super helpful.",

                "This course is very strong generally.",
                "At this point, I'm tired of talking about the same couple of topics in L5 Chinese electives (environmental problems, aging population, one child policy & gender imbalance, US-China relations, the \"Taiwan problem,\" etc.)",
                "I enjoyed this class more than any other Chinese course at Yale because there was less emphasis on the grades and more on participation. I highly enjoyed the various projects we had to do because they required us to be creative and analytical.",
                "Strengths: Zhang Laoshi, wow what a gem. From the very first class all the way to the last, it was a joy to log on and see his face. He lets every single person speak to their heart's content, and if someone has a question, he'll stop what he's talking about to answer it. He's also very equitable when it comes to speaking time; the main focus for this class is speaking at a \"scholarly\" level (which to him means \"wenya\") and it's always more speaking more speaking more speaking. So, of course, there's a ton of discussion. And the topics are very pertinent to daily life as well. We cover environmental pollution, government cover ups, scandal and traditional Chinese axioms, identity crises and cultural inheritance, corruption, international relations, and the death penalty in China and the world, among other thought-provoking topics. Classical phrases and idiom accumulation is definitely a plus (although to the extent that we're tested on memory of ANY OF THEM, well that's another question.. b\/c we aren't). Structure of the class is great, too: unlimited time open book final exam, oral quizzes that were easy and sporadic, two essays, reading comp multiple choice hw with 10 tries allowed, 2 presentations, and a longer final exam oral report. This class was almost stress free for me. Readings were long, but doable, and came out of the same textbook the whole year that I personally think is expertly designed. \r\nWeaknesses: there's a really weird article on Chinese culture and huaqiao that should really be removed. It has a comparison to Jewish people in America that plays into stereotypes (i.e. Jews controlling the media) that while not overtly meant to be stereotypical, definitely is-as confirmed with a few other students I asked. Some of the articles in the textbook are a bit outdated, too. Reading load varied considerably (4 pages one day, or 10k words another) and we never finished any of the longer readings. There weren't very many opportunities to actually practice the grammar structures or vocabulary (only quizlets that you could easily fabricate and maybe once every few weeks \"use this structure to say a sentence). And I really did not like that the presentations were open topic. For the midterm, at least we had some guidance: watch a fantastic and emotional movie and do a review\/critique of it. So much easier than \"do a 4-7 minute presentation on anything.\" Other students fell asleep, zoned out, or could not understand what their peers were talking about for a majority of the time because of niche vocabulary-or simply b\/c the topics they presented on.. weren't interesting..? Like I get the importance of doing oral practice, but if it isn't structured at all, that's really not helpful. At least for the essays we could just pick a prompt from the textbook, which helped narrow down some of the potential topics. The way class is run could be changed, too: we'd just go through the readings, page by page, with a PPT showing us the grammar structures and new vocab identically to how they're presented in the book, like what's the point of the PPT at that point? The MUN simulation frankly could be cut. I didn't get anything out of it and it wasn't that fun. We debated whether Taiwan should join the UN and then had a vote as representative countries, and it was well done over Zoom, but I didn't get the point. And the frequency of debates was wholly unnecessary. Nobody ever adequately prepared and the topics were incredibly abstract (renxing benshan vs. renxing ben'e, like idk man both??) and there was next to no guidance on what type of background research (if at all) you were supposed to do to prepare. They were pretty fruitless and UNenjoyable. The excess reading comp homework was also pretty stupid because we never talked about any of it in class ever. And it had a ton of new vocab with no word bank at all. \r\nNonetheless, it was incredibly manageable, and Zhang Laoshi was amazing and accessible, please give this man a raise.",
                "The class size is usually pretty small, so I felt highly involved during every class session. The assignments are also very fair.",
                "Strengths are definitely the materials and Zhang Laoshi. He conducted class in a way that was interesting yet informative without being stressful, it was the best Chinese class I've taken at Yale!"

I took 6 seminars this semester, and I had this class during my 4 class Wednesday, and it was very manageable. Readings can be very lengthy, but you can get by with skimming sometimes. I do however recommend reading intensely if you're actually to get anything out of the lengthy essays, because they're all written by respected scholars in their fields (and complied by Zhang and his friends back at Princeton into a really pretty textbook lol). And if you're a non-heritage student hesitating to take class with native speakers, this is the one to do it in because you'll never get more lenient grading practices or easier but fruitful assignments again.",
