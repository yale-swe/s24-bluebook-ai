I've never taken another lab course quite like this one, and you'll get to do so many interesting things that build on what you learn in the lecture course seamlessly. The skeletonization project brought together everything we had been learning and the skills we had been developing throughout the lab in a satisfying way, and so you feel a real sense of accomplishment at the end of this course."
