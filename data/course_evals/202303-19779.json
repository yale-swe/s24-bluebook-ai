                "The discussions were fantastic. The readings were always interesting in one way or another. The central theme of the course was engaging and a constant point of return.\r\n\r\nI think time management was a bit of a problem in this course. Expert sessions were a lovely component of each seminar, but I think stricter time limits and group size restrictions would do wonders for the pacing of each seminar session.",
                "Great texts",
                "Strengths (also in question 9): 1) There seem to be entry points for both people with no prior experience in philosophy (like me) and people already familiar with a lot of the philosophers we read. 2) Sophie does a wonderful job fostering a sense of class community, leading classroom discussions, and motivating students. As a result, the class -- though it was conducted through student presentations  (in addition to some context provided by Sophie) -- functioned wonderfully: students always seemed to want to bring their best to the table. 3) The class is flexible enough that students have the opportunity to explore their own interests, which both enhanced my own learning and helped keep me engaged. 4) Sophie is a knowledgeable, understanding, and wonderful professor! One of the best I've had at Yale. If you have the opportunity to take ANY class with her, you should!!!!!!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None, except that we often ran out of time/some presentations and discussions had to be cut short. Seminars were often so engaging (even to someone who often just listened and took notes) that the 110 minutes often flew by. (This is saying a lot, as I get bored/distracted quite easily...)",
                "I learned a lot in this course and felt the syllabus was very well thought-through and cohesive. However, I think the time we had in class could have been managed better. This was made significantly more difficult by the number of students in the class ( I hope this demonstrated interest in the class encourages this course being offered again). We often ran out of time due to the expert sessions, and often did not have much time to discuss. I suggest that each student work on one expert session instead of two and that a strict time limit be imposed on the expert sessions. I think blocking out time specifically for seminar-style discussion would also be helpful.",
                "Strengths: fantastic professor, great readings, and engaging discussions. Weaknesses: I would've loved the professor to intervene, moderate and support the in-class discussions a bit more, and the bigger class size felt a bit too cramped sometimes. Also, some more feedback on our written work would've been great.",
                "Readings were super interesting and well chosen. The major problem with the class this semester was that it was too big for a seminar, which made the individual presentations kind of take over in a way that became detrimental to our ability to discuss the texts in depth. It was also annoying that despite the amount of people in the class only a few of them regularly participated, though I dont know what Professor Schweiger could have done to change that."

                "Yes, if you're broadly interested in how theories of language have intersected with corresponding crises of meaning, and how we've developed an increasingly comprehensive understanding of the many uses of language.",
                "Yes! Professor Schweiger is great. The caveat is that you really shouldnt take this course if youre not willing to put in the work for it, because discussions were really dampened by the amount of people who just never participated.",
