                "Professor Walls was the greatest strength of the course. Being in class felt like you were constantly in conversation with him, both in class discussions and through assignments and office hours. He always paid close attention to every observation each student made or what kind of topics were brought up in office hours conversations, and tied all of it back to their writing. He was also so passionate about all the texts we were talking about in class, as well as getting to know his students as people and giving specific feedback to improve their work."

                "Absolutely, and if you can, take it with Professor Walls. I loved the readings and the writing assignments, and I really felt like this class was my outlet to express myself and my ideas. I think this course is great for both people who already love writing and those who haven't been as exposed to it, because the personal essay is such a great medium that lets anyone write using their own strengths."
