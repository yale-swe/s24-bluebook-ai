                "strengths: interesting readings\/material covered, opportunity to experience the archives, appropriately challenging for a first-year student\r\nweaknesses: readings can be a lot on top of all your other classes, sometimes expectations not clearly outlined (Prof. Rugemer doesn't keep Canvas updated and gives a lot of instructions orally), you're expected to do a lot of work outside of class toward your final but not really told how to go about it.",
                "Strengths- great classroom environment, introduction to primary source research & writing, we covered a lot of topics\/materials, and I loved how Prof Rugemer incorporated secondary critiques of sources for broader perspectives\r\nWeaknesses-Prof Rugemer wasn't always aware of upcoming assignments on the syllabus--instructions were often delayed and unclear. Oftentimes readings were very long and we couldn't properly discuss them. I also think the pacing of the assignments was a bit off. We had little to no assignments besides readings, and then it all picked up at once. I think short essays should have begun and ended a bit sooner so we could have gotten feedback on our annotated bibs in a more timely manner.",
                "I think the course could benefit from more structure. A more clear rubric for papers could help students have direction when writing."

                "I would recommend this course! Viewing a new primary source every week was an amazing experience. The contents of this course are so necessary. I think every student at Yale could benefit from learning about the reality and implications of slavery. The reading load is high, much higher than other first-year seminars, but if you're even remotely interested in the topic--take this course! There were also some amazing speakers, this was an amazing introduction to Yale.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. I think it was exciting, it was engaging, and it was important. It was the course I was most likely to talk about with someone who asked about the courses I was taking last semester.",
                "Yes, its a great introduction to Yale especially for prospective social science\/humanities majors. The workload is doable and the class is really engaging and hands on."
