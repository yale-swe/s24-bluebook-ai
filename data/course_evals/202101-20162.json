I'm grateful to this course for opening my eyes to the works of Stephen Crane and Flannery O'Connor, while reintroducing me through a collaborative and critical lens to the likes of Morrison, Whitman, Baldwin, etc.",

This doesn't happen at the same level for the other papers, but you still receive feedback. The quality of discussion is very high, and sometimes the seminar could feel disconnected but that was mostly a pandemic virtual thing. I will say that the 2.5 weeks on Moby-Dick is not enough time (at least for a slowish reader like me) to fully absorb the text, and at times during that period I wished that we had delved into 2ish more normal-length novels in greater detail, but I understand the importance of Moby-Dick to American literature.",
