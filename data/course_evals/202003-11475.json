I learned how language impacts society through heritage speakers and language acquisition. I learned how to conduct a survey-based experiment from its conception to a final report.",
                "This is an amazing course. I learned so much about the intersection between language and cognition. The class was framed in a way in which it used the lexical item to lead all future discussion about how language related to the mind.",
                "I learned so much about linguistics and how language relates to the mind, something of interest to me as a psych major.",
                "I learned about a mind\/brain approach to linguistics and learned a lot about neuroscience\/cogsci\/linguistics in the process. The last third was more about these topics and was really fun. I also learned how conduct my own linguistic research project and collect data for myself, which was my first experience doing somethijng like that. I had a lot of fun with that project.",

                "The quizzes and assignments were extremely reasonable and really helped to put what we learned into practice. We received handouts after every class that consolidated each unit and helped me to focus on the main points.",
                "The course material is perfectly balanced between learning about the language system and learning about the implications of that system. The class sessions consist of open-ended discussions, which helped me stay engaged and were a nice departure from the typical Yale lecture course. The one area for improvement is that it would have been helpful to have a class session devoted to research methods the final project (e.g. how to present linguistic materials to participants, good scientific practices like having a control group).",
                "Strengths are the professor and the TA. The class was taught well, the readings were very interesting, and the quizzes were very similar to the homework. I never felt underprepared in the course, and Professor Pinango was very upfront on the material she would be teaching and how to present it. \r\nNot many weaknesses. The homework are sometimes very confusing, but they ended up being graded pretty fairly even if the material wasn't covered.",
                "A lot of material is thoroughly discussed in the class, but not before the homework is due. It is difficult to know if you are fully understanding the material before you have to submit the homework.",
                "I liked the small lecture\/seminar format of the class and how much we were encouraged to ask questions. It felt like we got off topic sometimes, but this was manageable. The homework assignments were great practice, but some were longer than they needed to be in my opinion.",
                "This course is very interesting, and the material is taught well. Professor Piango and Mr. Geissler were very fun and amazing teachers. Sometimes the material was presented a little vaguely, especially towards the beginning of the course, but it is usually very interesting. One weakness is that class often went over time which was a little frustrating. Another thing is that sometimes the assignments are about reading\/material we have not discussed in class, which led me to make mistakes in my assignments. The assignments were sometimes a little long, but they were mostly quite fun. Sometimes I felt we were going over the same material multiple times, which was good because sometimes the material was a little complicated, but could be superfluous.",
                "I think that the course was very well structured and I liked that there were a lot of opportunities to be graded. This made it less stressful if you had one or two hiccups during the semester... especially during this one."

The class sessions are very open and often, one student's question will spiral into a fascinating discussion. You will get to know your classmates. The material has something for everyone. If you come from a STEM background, then you will probably like the underlying structure behind the syntactic and semantic systems and the connection to the brain. If you come from a humanities background, then you will probably like the societal impacts of language that we discuss in the course such as heritage speakers.",
