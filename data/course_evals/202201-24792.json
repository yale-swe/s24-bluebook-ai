                "The fundamentals of performing rhythmic Karnatik compositions. A brief introduction to ethnomusicology and the historical context of the formation of Kartnatik music. The course covered a wide range of topics without ever feeling rushed or cursory.",
                "--learned about the history of the South Indian \"Classical\" style\r\n--reflected on our place as American college students learned other kinds of music\r\n--learned about the South Indian approach to rhythmic composition\r\n--gained skills in performing South Indian rhythms",
                "Although I came in with a lot of experience with music, I loved learning about rhythm from a fresh perspective and with amazing classmates who were so eager to learn.",
                "I learned a lot about the way I think as a musician, gained insight into the history of carnatic music, became more aware of orientalism, and grew a lot as a rhythmist!!",
                "I learned solkattu and a bit of carnatak music principles in very engaging and practical ways. I also learned about the culture, history, and practice surrounding the classical Indian music scene.",
                "I learned the basics of performing solkattu, and learned about rhythmic forms found in South Indian classical music; maybe that doesn't sound like a lot but it definitely was, and the fact that we learned through performing ourselves was amazing. Fugan really wanted us to learn both about the foundations\/traditions and how we could use solkattu in our own lives, which was a great combination. We also learned a lot about the history and politics of Carnatic music, which I enjoyed a lot and was incredibly well-taught; usually, history taught by non-historians tends to be boring and\/or clumsy and reductive, but Fugan really took the material seriously and made us understand why it was relevant and important."

                "A strength is that it is so interdisciplinary, that it encompasses both performance and historical context. There should be more of these kinds of courses in the Music Department. I think the final composition was a little overwhelming at the end, but it was never unmanageable.",
                "The strength of this course was how Fugan incorporated history, theory, and practice together so I felt like I had a well-rounded perspective on the material. \r\n\r\nTo improve this course, I would consolidate the assignments. For example: HW week #1: 50% annotating article, 50% video performance. This would be easier to keep track of than separate assignments in many different \"categories\" like video performances, essays, etc.",
                "The malleable nature of the course was great, and it facilitated learning and growth. I only felt that the class time was particularly long, especially when we would go into slides.",
                "The course's only weirdness was the long meeting times and the occasional lack of clarity on recorded exercises. Everything else was perfect",
                "A lot of the music practice in the course is taught orally\/aurally and in a group. This different way of learning music is definitely one of the strengths of the course, requiring you to participate and engage actively in class. It can be daunting at times, however, especially when there are such spectacular musicians as your classmates. Also, a huge weakness and frustration was the fact that a lot of the things done in class were done aurally\/orally but there often wasn't an online recording of any kind to practice along at home. This was a problem esp. for the exercises that didn't come from the book. It would've been really helpful to me personally to have these. In general, there was quite a bit of confusion and lack of clarity about expectations of assignments, homework, and projects.",
                "I have to mention how amazing Fugan is, he's incredibly knowledgeable and supportive and I'm so honored to have been taught by him. I was really scared of taking this course because it seemed like a lot of pressure, but it absolutely wasn't. We were still expected to know the material but if we didn't, Fugan was there to help us without ever seeming like he was judging us. He's also the most organized professor I've ever had, I love the modules setup and the videos he made at the beginning to help us.\r\nI think the balance of the class sessions in the first half of the semester was really good, having both performances\/learning sessions and historical discussions was a good way to break up the 3 hours. I also enjoyed the full performance classes near the end of the semester, but they were pretty exhausting in good and bad ways. \r\nMy only real strong criticism would be to not have the final group performance as a video, I know it already wasn't the plan but if it can't be person, at least let us split up the sections to record. I can perform all the sections, but trying to go 14 minutes with minimal mistakes on your own is not fun (everything else in the course was fun, so this was a notable departure)."

                "Yes definitely. I think this is a great course for music majors looking to fulfill a group I or IV. Truly unlike any other course offered in the department. It's difficult, but since everyone in the course is a beginner to some degree I think any non-major with a little experience in music could thrive in the course.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student since there are very few classes at Yale that teach a practical approach to non-western music. The material is super fun to perform and is very helpful at developing basic musicianship skills that help in all styles of music. The only drawback is that the material can be difficult, so I would not recommend it to someone who is not excited to learn about it.",
                "Yes, I definitely would. For me, it was a great break in my schedule. It's a very different and unique class.",
                "Absolutely. It's a shame it probably won't be offered again. It felt like a very pure and authentic look into another music tradition instead of examining it from the outside. The rhythm exercises were quite hard and yet we learned all of them!",
                "Yes because the music, in both listening and learning, is quite amazing. It was Fugan's first time teaching a course at Yale, so I expect the downsides of the course to get better.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course, it will definitely end up being one of the best classes, if not the best, I'll have taken at Yale. I had very limited prior knowledge of Carnatic music and have learned so much, and am looking forward to continuing to learn after the end of this class. I've so valued having a class where I'm actively creating music, the 3 hours every week were long but I always looked forward to them. Fugan really respects and values everyone's individual academic and cultural backgrounds, and it's an environment where we can learn together."
