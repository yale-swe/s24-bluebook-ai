                "Strengths: each week is divided up into an assignment, making designing your own study more manageable (particularly for those who are doing a thesis), with opportunity for feedback from the professor and class each week. Prof. Piango is an amazing professor who is exacting, but in a very good way; this course helped me be much more rigorous in my thesis research, particularly with regards to the rationale for each portion of my study and connection to the larger language system. By the end of the course, I was very satisfied with my work.\r\nWeaknesses: this course moves very quickly, particularly at the end of the course -- I was not very familiar with the statistical analyses I needed to do, particularly in a linguistics context, and might have needed more instruction. The course sometimes turned into a 1:1 conversation with the professor, who provided very helpful feedback for my project, but sometimes was a little less engaging for the rest of the class. At the end of the course, we did not get written feedback for some assignments, which would have been helpful.",
                "This course was great",
                "strengths: the fact that we were guided along the entire process of developing and executing a project over a semester, presenting our progress to our peers every week and getting feedback from them and the professor\r\n\r\nweaknesses: there was a lot expected of us in one semester and it felt pretty unrealistic. we started off very slow and ended up getting behind the syllabus, which meant that the last few weeks of the semester was very rushed and it felt like we went from 0 to 100 so quickly. by the end of the semester I was spending 10-20 hours per week on this class. it would have been nice to receive more support with data analysis. still unsure why we had to do the project in overleaf, as the coding required for that just added extra time and stress that would have been better spent somewhere else. \r\n\r\nbut I don't imagine how I would have done this project on my own without the class."

                "Yes, it was a very helpful course to take while I was working on my thesis research, and I'm very happy with both the progress I've made and the academic rigor that this course and the professor helped me cultivate. This course will take a lot of your time -- creating, conducting, and analyzing your own experiment in one semester is not a small task, particularly when you are presenting your progress each week -- but without it, I don't think I'd have made as much progress in my thesis.",
                "Yes it is great if you have a research question youd like to investigate",
                "I'm not sure. if you are wanting to do a linguistics project, maybe for your thesis, then yes because I'm not sure how you could do a project like that on your own without as much guidance as received in this class. however, it felt like this class was 2 credits for most of the semester, so I would not recommend this class unless you are for sure you want to dedicate the time to working on a project."
