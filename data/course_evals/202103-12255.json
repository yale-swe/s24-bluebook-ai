                "Introductory Latin is laid out incredibly well. The sequential order of how things are taught is incredibly well thought out, so things make a lot of sense and build upon each other well. Sometimes, however, studying grammar every morning for an hour gets repetitive and boring. Nevertheless, interaction and participation in this course is very high, so you stay engaged.",

                "Yes if they are interested in the language. This course is challenging but rewarding. If you want to learn latin, this course will help build you a solid foundation  for the language. If the student doesn't care much for latin and just wants and easy language requirement, they should look elsewhere. However, the course isn't too difficult, especially after making it passed the first few weeks. Daily quizzes make the student have to review material everyday, but the quizzes are always fair and helpful.",
                "Yes, Latin is a straightforward and interesting language to help you fulfill your language requirement. On top of this, Latin is solely written - no oral examinations - and almost all graded translations are from Latin to English, making it easier than most other languages in which you have to be able to translate both ways.",
                "Absolutely, Latin is a beautiful language, especially when taught by Daniel Graves."
