I learned how to be critical of the literary canon while understanding the importance of certain texts in American literature. Additionally, I learned about how we can read texts using a historical lense to determine how these texts shaped the American literary canon.",
                "I learned to interpret diverse works of literature, form my own ideas about what the author's message was. This class gave me a strong base for my future literary analysis, for example we analyzed Moby Dick, a novel that is frequently referenced in more modern literature. I learned how to successfully have group discussions and comprehensions of novels.",

                "Strengths: Selection of readings, Professor Kelley's general spirit and attitude, vibes of the other students -- class conversations were always really good and it never felt like it was toxic with someone trying to speak over everyone else.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: felt that the class was a bit too big. Also students constantly had their computers and tablets out, which I found incredibly distracting (especially when they were online shopping). An enforced technology ban would do wonders to facilitate conversation. There were also general technology issues with the virtual board or whatever that thing is which made it harder for Professor Kelley to fully implement her lesson plans. It also took a long time to receive feedback on the essays, mainly essay 2. As essay 3 was described as a combination of the skills from essay 1 and 2, I was hoping to have both back before submitting my proposal so I could meet with Professor Kelley to find areas of improvement.",
                "Strengths: Prof Kelley, reasonable workload, interesting readings and discussions throughout\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Moby Dick. I understand why it's on the syllabus, but like, we spend so much time on it that could be used for other things.",
                "I sense it depends highly on the professor, Professor Kelley created a really lovely, safe learning environment.",
                "Good format of papers and the texts were great, except maybe Moby Dick (why is this still a requirement...?). Your writing will improve and the class discussion is incredibly rich.",
                "I loved that my professor brought in newer texts that have contributed to American literature, using these in comparison to older texts, such as Moby Dick and The Sound and The Fury. I know that my professor was required to teach Moby Dick, but I do not think that text should be a required text for the class.  Since it was a longer and denser novel than other ones we read, we spent a large portion of the semester on it, but I felt that the other texts we read contributed more to my understanding of American literature.",
                "This course was successfully paced: it allowed me to become a confident fast reader and allowed the class to complete a large amount of novels in a short period of time.",
                "Strengths: the texts we read were excellent. I thought it was a great balance between making sure we were introduced the canon and its role in America and challenging its superiority. Professor Kelley was excellent. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it would have been nice to have our discussion posts viewable by the whole class. I often wished I could see what other students were writing. Thats the only thing I can think of that would have made the class better!",
                "Readings were good. My only criticism is moby dickI think that should be removed from the required list. Sometimes though, I felt like there was this intense pressure to say the right things in class.",
                "The variety of literature we read, spanning many different time periods and authors, gave me a good sense of what is considered \"canon\" for American literature. Our class discussions were always engaging and offered us space to critically consider what it means for a text to become part of the American canon. The essays we wrote offered a good opportunity to reflect on these discussions and learn how to communicate our ideas in more depth, and Professor Kelley's feedback was always incisive and helpful. I appreciated how our discussions were not limited to formal elements of the texts. While we learned how to analyze literary techniques, we also learned about the historical periods when the texts were written and how the connection between history and literature has implications for what it means to be American.\r\n\r\nProfessor Kelley did an excellent job of selecting readings that raised questions about American empire, identity, and history. We read Evie Shockley, Toni Morrison, and many others, but I got the sense that these readings went above and beyond the readings required for ENGL 127, whereas it was required to read Moby Dick. This took up a weeks of class time and, while interesting, I wondered if there were other works from Melville or other authors that might deserve equal or at least comparable attention.",
                "This course was absolutely amazing except for Moby Dick. Please just let us read Benito Cereno or something.",
                "This course was really good about allowing students to come in with their own expertise and incorporating that into course content. I liked the classroom discussions and activities because they didn't feel performative.",
                "Strengths: well-rounded syllabus; great contemporary works; engaging class discussion; helpful feedback\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class discussions were occasionally repetitive and off-topic. Strong personalities dominated discussion"

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I have recommended it to so many of my friends and think that Professor Kelley did a wonderful job teaching it. She was an engaging professor who gave a lot of historical background to deepen our understanding of the texts we read. I've recommended this class to non-English majors as well because I think it is such an enjoyable class!",

I loved Professor Kelley, she taught me so much about literary analysis and always made class fun and engaging, especially when discussing difficult but necessary topics in American history. She made the classroom setting very welcoming, no literary opinion or interpretation was wrong. She showed us there are always multiple ways of interpreting one piece of literature.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in American literature, but especially English or American Studies majors.",
                "Yes! Depends a lot on your instructor but its useful, fun, and not too much work.",
                "Yes, this is a great section of American Lit to take! I enjoyed reading the texts and not being expected to like them but learning from them.",
                "Yes if youre an English major and need to pick a foundational course. Great selection of texts. If you are not an English major you might find the course challenging because it requires more self-direction than other courses Ive taken. You must do the reading to get enough out of the course."
