   "comments": [
    "By far one of the best classes if not the best class I've taken at Yaleteaches you how to really gain insight from connecting different works.",
    "This course gave me the vocabulary to think about race through a comparative and relational framework rather than separating ethnic studies into black studies, asian american studies, native american studies, and latinx studies. It also cultivated in me the political commitment to bring this comparative and relational frame to all the ethnic studies work I pursue in the future. It was so generative to be in a class with other ER&M majors in my year and think through the methodological issues scholars in our field are thinking through in conversation with each other.",
    "I learned why I am an ER&M major, something that I don't think I thought could be taught. It was so empowering and beautiful to be reminded of all the hard work that came before me and is still left to accomplish",
    "It is really hard for me to sum up what I learned in this class because to be honest it feels like I learned anything--the lessons imparted by Professor HoSang, the readings, and my peers feel so foundational to how I understand and operate within ethnic studies (and thus the world) that I really don't know how to put it in concrete terms.",
    "I came away from this class with a sharper understanding of Ethnic Studies as a discipline, and the vocabulary to talk about the theoretical work that is the driving force behind the field of study. From the classroom space and Professor HoSangs instruction I learned how to have sensitive, empathetic and engaged discussions about complex theoretical concepts.",
    "THIS IS MY FAVORITE CLASS OF ALL TIME AT YALE. There are no words to describe what I learned here but to say that this scholarship and classroom time will stay with me as I move forward is an understatement.",
    "This course places into conversation the concepts of accompaniment\/coalition-building between groups, methods of protest within university spaces, and the production of\/challenging of colonial knowledge.",
    "This class was an overview into the history, theory, methodology, and future of ethnic studies. Having taken this class in the midst of the ER&M faculty withdrawal, I can think of no other better way to understand just how critical ethnic studies is to us as students and scholars. It was different from other classes I've taken in the department in that I didn't just learn about specific topics in ER&M. I felt instead that I emerged from this class with a much more clear picture of how ethnic studies functions as a discipline and how we can practice it. I am deeply grateful to this class for helping my reaffirm why ER&M is more necessary than ever."

   "comments": [
    "Great course and professor, variety of activities and out-of-class visits for real life application. Workload was fair. Consistent feedback.",
    "Strengths: diversity in methods and texts. I really enjoyed the inclusion of music, art, and film alongside more \"traditional\" academic work.  I also appreciate that the course was not divided up into specific \"fields\" (i.e. asian american studies one week, black studies the next week) but broader historical and methodological sections (i.e. the history of ethnic studies, women of color feminist methods, etc) \r\nNo weaknesses!!!",
    "Wish this course was thought about in conjunction w 200 so there would be less repeated material. Loved the learning and engagement we did outside of classroom w twelfth night, art galleries, and visiting artists.",
    "There are no weaknesses of this course. The syllabus was exceptional, the assignments generative and meaningful, and every second of every class felt deliberately designed to maximize our engagement with the material and each other. I cannot gush highly enough.",
    "This class was organized phenomenally well. The weekly (ish) reading responses were the perfect length to go in depth but not overboard with the reading assignments, which I found to be fascinating and extremely helpful almost entirely across the board. The way that classroom discussion was held made for a welcoming and productive intellectual spaceI enjoyed the mix of large group and small group discussionit helped give our class a sense of community.",
    "This is an incredible course and Professor HoSang did an amazing job of facilitating student learning. One of the ways that this course could be improved is if Yale gives more support to the ER&M department, students from other majors might be able to take this course because it could be offered more frequently. There were so many students who wanted to take this course and couldn't because there were too many junior and senior ER&M majors as is and it's required for the major.",
    "This course has fantastic readings, course materials, and discussions, and it incorporated so many different types of media from which to learn (including sound, music, podcasts, art, plays, readings, and discussions). I wouldn't change anything about it.",
    "The biggest strength of this course was by far Professor HoSang. I am constantly blown away by how much professors in the ER&M department, like Professor HoSang, have the capacity to care for their students even in the midst of an extremely chaotic and tumultuous semester. I came to class every day interested and ready to learn because the classroom space he facilitated was one of openness and caring that's very hard to find on Yale's campus. The syllabus was also amazing. The guest speakers and the trips to the British Art Center, The Twelfth Night, etc. really helped me apply what I got in the readings to the world around me. Having to do a podcast instead of a final paper was also a very unique and fun way to tie up the semester. I have nothing but praise for this class."

    "Yes yes yes! Hosang is a joy and one of the best profs at Yale.",
    "YES - this is amazing, please take it with Dan HoSang if you are able. He's simply the best. You will learn so much from the texts on the syllabus, but you will learn even more if you take it with Prof. HoSang.",
    "Absolutely. Unfortunately I think it is only available to ER&M juniors and seniors, but this is the kind of class that I think should be required for every single Yale student.",
    "YES Yes YESSS!!!! If you are not an ER&M major and can, I highly recommend it cause this teaches you to value of ER&M.",
    "Yes, yes, yes.",
    "Yes! I grew so much intellectually in this class-- the ideal junior seminar!",
    "I wish everyone could take this class, and Im so glad its required for ER&M majorsthe readings assigned have become essential to my understanding of Ethnic Studies as a field and I benefitted massively from Professor HoSangs weekly feedback on my papers. The community we built in this class was no accidentit was facilitated by the way the class itself was structured which leads me to believe future iterations will have the same feeling of closeness.",
    "Take this class! If you are not an ER&M major you should try to take this course if you can get in.",
    "I wish everyone at Yale could take this class.",
    "This course is one of my favorite courses that I have taken at Yale, and I would definitely recommend it. The contents of this course were rich, and I felt that I learned so much by being in this classroom space. Professor HoSang, my fellow students, and all of our guest speakers who visited provided me with an incredible learning experience."
