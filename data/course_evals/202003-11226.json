                "Strengths\r\n- Professor Hirsch offered lots of office hours \r\n- She encouraged you to think for yourself and gave you some help when you needed \r\n- Good setup of the class to learn topics and then think for yourself using what you learned\r\n- I like how they graded the drafts and the final paper for the group project \r\n- I like how classtimes were set aside for working on your own paper\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- I feel like sometimes more help and instruction on your papers could have been given\r\n- It felt like they took points off on the assignment for things we had no clue they were gonna watch out for (their guidelines would sometimes go against APA guidelines)",
                "This course was great! It was required for the Psychology major, but it was much more interesting than I was expecting. the teaching was amazing and the work schedule was manageable. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
                "The first half of this class basically asked students to cover an entire textbook containing information on research methods that wasn't really touched on later on. Most of it was self-taught by reading chapters and doing online quizzes but the engagement was low because of that and it really wasn't taught by the professor at all. Additionally, this course could've benefited from more interaction with the professor\/TF rather than students who were simultaneously learning the same material. The independent project could've had more support with specific revision recommendations like the first assignment to facilitate learning. At times, the provided feedback was vague which felt frustrating because research is rather complicated and the point of the class is to learn about the process. There could've been more engagement and feedback from the TF and overall, more guidance would have been nice to have, especially given the current learning circumstances.",
                "Strengths: you get a lot of hands on experience with the research process, data collection and analytics. Weaknesses would include the connection between the textbook and the class, and the unbalanced amount of work in the course. For the first half of the semester, having a textbook assignment, a writing assignment, and leftover in class work felt like a huge amount. The textbook, however, I thought was great because of the online learning component of it.",
                "The course was paced very well - work was spaced out so large research papers and other projects did not seem so daunting, and we received guidance throughout the whole process. Feedback was always very helpful. The most difficult aspect was how intense the grading was.",
                "The course was incredibly well-structured and I always knew what was expected of me. The collaborative group project prepped me well to complete the individual project later in the semester, and feedback was always clear and concise. Perhaps a little more upfront guidance in choosing an individual project topic would be helpful, but overall the course was very engaging and enjoyable.",
                "Strengths: The course was all encompassing of the different parts that go into a research project, including the different sources of bias and problems that researchers may encounter\r\nWeaknesses: The pacing of the course was not consistent, some weeks were very demanding while other weeks were not, mostly due to the different types of work assigned throughout the semester (1. group\/individual paper projects, 2. worksheets based on lecture, 3. the textbook & online work - separate to lecture content)",

                "The online textbook homework assignments definitely succeeded! I also thought the effort to engage with each student with lab groups worked well. I appreciated the frequency of the open office hours because I did feel that it was hard to get one on one help during working times in class.",
                "The fact that the class took place virtually never seemed to hinder our collective or individual progress. Zoom breakout rooms were well-utilized for lab\/workshop sessions or one-on-one meetings, and class handouts posted online always contained clear and specific instructions. The online textbook\/Inquiztive modules were extremely conducive to learning course material and provided a solid foundation for the rest of the course.",
                "The use of grace days (24 hour extensions) allowed for flexibility in turning in assignments, however one day extensions weren't that helpful when things were mostly due at the beginning of a week and would just layer deadlines on top of each other. For example, feedback for earlier parts of a group project was given Sunday afternoon but the next part of said project would require (or greatly benefit from) that feedback and was due that Sunday night; at the same time, there were textbook-related online quiz assignments due before the 9am class on Monday and needed to turn in unfinished in-class work also before class started on Monday. Although the expectation was to do these assignments WAY in advance, in reality, the structure of deadlines and release of assignment details during the Wednesday class meant that most of our weekends were spent doing work for this class (which spending all free weekend time for a class took additional screen time during the one chance I had to stop staring at a screen & was even harder when life-obligations of off-campus living came into play, such as getting groceries or taking care of family matters).\r\n\r\nIn short, the deadlines were much less flexible than all my other classes this semester."

I would only recommend it for students who have to take it for their major or who are generally interested in conducting research and writing scientific papers. If you are one of these students, you will get a lot out of it as long as you're prepared to work hard, be diligent and don't fall behind in your work.",

                "Yes! It is of course required for the psych major, but the writing intensive is a great way to get your second WR credit, and taking the course with Dr. Hirsch is a great way to strengthen your skills. Be prepared to have it be your most work-heavy course of the semester, however, and plan accordingly.",
                "I would recommend this course to a psychology student who wants to learn how to write a proper research paper. It taught me to pay very close attention to details and to be intentional in my writing.",
                "This course is definitely a strong choice for psych majors who need to fulfill their research methods requirement. Not only do you get to design and conduct your own study, you also have the opportunity to write about it and integrate it with previous psychological research. Examples from the textbook teach you about methods while also expanding your knowledge of the literature as a whole.",
