                "I learned how to collaborate more effectively and work for collective success rather than my own. I also learned about methods of storytelling and the importance of diversity in art-making.",
                "I learned a lot about the way I function as a member of a group\/team. I also learned about the different issues that can come up when collaborating with other people, and how we can address these. I also felt I learned a lot about movement, particularly the way my body moves.",
                "I learned more about storytelling, interpretation, and adaptation in theater by working together with people on creative projects.",
                "I'm so much better at collaborating and speaking up in creative settings because of this course. I am well versed in interpretation, design, and adaptation.",
                "I learned the basics of collaboration and gained skills valuable for teamwork settings both within the theater sphere and beyond. I got to read a variety of culturally relevant theater pieces, engage in exciting dialogues with my peers, build long-lasting friendships, and create some really deep original performances.",
                "As cheesy as it might sound, I've learned how to better collaborate with others in a creative context. By working with a diverse group of people over the course of the semester--working with the concept of \"collaboration\" in mind--I've tuned that group-project sense that helps me tap into an artistic hive mind. (I'm sure that might sound like spiritual voodoo, but it's true: I've gotten better at recognizing what other people are thinking and feeling when working together.)",
                "i learned the most during the design unit of this course. I felt that doing design presentations was the most practical and useful project we did, and I think that made it a much better intro theater class (since we learned about multiple aspects of theater). I wouldn't say this class teaches you how to collaborate -- it's more just that you have to collaborate for all of the projects, so it's a collaborative class.",
                "I have learned a lot about collaboration. Through our variety of different collaborative projects I not only worked with many different people, but in many different artistic settings. This allowed me to gain a better sense of where my strengths lie with regards to collaborating.",
                "Learning all about the collaborative process. Introduction to a wide range of theatrical works. Learning some important aspects of the production process and theatre-making (design presentations, immersive experiences, different kinds of storytelling.) Meeting some important people I plan to work with in the future. Learning how to give feedback for work.",
                "How to work collaboratively and, more importantly, reflect and think about collaborative experiences in order to pinpoint what worked and didn't work. I learned how to think about a play as a whole and as a world of its own, and how design and directorial choices contribute to its feeling.",
                "I learned a lot of collaboration as well as different aspects of the theater world, and specifically theater at Yale."

            "comments": [
                "I enjoyed that this course did not fixate on grades; it really felt as though we were creating for the sake of creating. \r\nI think the use of time in this class could be improved (it was 4 hours long and we still ended up having to meet outside of class for 2-3 hours a week, even though we really could have used class-time) \r\nAbout halfway through the class, we were typically exhausted and struggled to produce anything worthwhile I think this class should be twice a week for two hours or once a week for 2 hours plus office hours.  \r\nAnother improvement that could be made is explaining more why we were assigned certain plays. Some of the plays were intensely triggering and I'm not sure why we had to watch them for certain assignments. For example, Fires in the Mirror was difficult for me to watch since the Holocaust is a source of family trauma, and we did not really contextualize it in class discussion. Also, \"Night, Mother\" was triggering because of its representation of suicide and we only talked about props\/world-building during class.",
                "Strengths: fun\/low-stress assignments, wonderful and kind instructors \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 4 hour class is LONG! Sometimes, readings felt unnecessary or irrelevant to actual structure of class.",
                "Strengths: Getting to know people in the TAPS major, getting to work with Professor Morrison and Stokes, a lot of hands-on activities, care to students from the Professors.\r\nWeaknesses: Big time commitment that interfered with many classes, no syllabus, you hardly receive any feedback, there's no understanding on how assessments are graded, not much learning about theatre.",
                "Strengths: Very engaging. The structure of the course really felt like a thorough introduction to the major and to the study of theater and performance. We also really got to do a lot of collaborating with each other, which definitely was a big part of the course's design.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The four-hour class each week definitely felt taxing, which often led to a huge dip in energy levels by the end of each class. As we'd talked about in class, it would be interesting to see whether the class could be shortened, and whether there was a way to incorporate discussion sections into the course. Another thing I want to mention is the nature of the reading assignments and discussions. I think it would've been better if our readings were given a little more weight and importance in the class, and I feel like this could've been done by having students interact on the discussion board on canvas, and then having us come to class ready to discuss the points and reflections that were made. This would've definitely provided a much greater incentive to engage with the readings and course material.",
                "Class discussions and projects together made the course strong.  I was really able to learn more about and get close to my classmates which made the class really special. Also, the ability to work on projects in class was very helpful because sometimes scheduling out of class was difficult. \r\n\r\nPLEASE don't have it be 4 hours again.  I think having it as two 2-hr sessions for class, one where we focus on the week's major theme and one where we are able to work with our groups on creating our projects would make it better.  I also think more trigger warnings and advanced notice for when discussion of sensitive topics will come up would make the class better.",
                "The 4 hour period was a little grueling but not the worst thing in the world. I really enjoyed working in the small groups.",
                "The professors were phenomenal, and you naturally meet really cool, talented people by taking this course. The only downside was the four-hour length of each class - drink lots of coffee beforehand!",
                "Strengths - the course covers a wide variety of texts and collaborative processes, and organizes collaboration in several different, unique ways. The plays we read were interesting and the discussion-based format of the class facilitated several new insights for me\r\nWeaknesses - The length of the class was taxing and seemed unnecessary. While I know many studio-based classes at Yale are almost four hours in length, the content we covered didn't seem to warrant such a long class.",
                "The strength of this course is its freeform structure; when a certain project deserved more attention, there was room in the schedule to give it the proper care. Unfortunately, any criticism would cut at this core strength. The biggest improvement could be made by transitioning the class away from the 4-hour time block into something a bit more manageable.",
                "It gave us such a comprehensive, basic foundation for theater that is so necessary!",
                "One strength of this course was that a very close-knit dynamic developed among the students, due to the variety of activities (acting, brainstorming, discussing, movement, etc.) during and outside of class. However, the four-hour class time felt unnecessarily long at times, especially since 2+ hours of outside group meetings were often required each week. The class length make the course inaccessible to students with time conflicts and other commitments several friends have told me that they were considering the TAPS major but weren't able to take this class specifically due to the length. Additionally, I found that class time would be better used if a substantial portion of it were set aside for group meetings without outside meetings required. Scheduling those outside meetings was always difficult, especially since most students were involved in extracurricular theatrical productions with extensive rehearsal schedules. Otherwise, if outside meetings were kept, this course would work just as well, if not better, in a 2-hour, once-a-week format. By the third and fourth hours of class, I often found it harder to focus, despite having taken breaks, and I felt that some activities could have been cut or shortened. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would have preferred to do the consent workshop earlier on in the semester, and to accompany it with a discussion about consent and immersive performance. In preparation for the final project, it would have been helpful to either watch\/participate in an immersive performance for inspiration, since many students are not familiar with this form of theater, or to speak with an outside theater artist with experience in navigating audience consent during interactive performances. \r\n\r\nAnother strength of this course was the projects where students were given several options of plays to read and work with the course was at its best when we were able to make choices for ourselves, and I think this could be expanded to cover more of the syllabus. The times when one play was assigned to the entire class felt much more restrictive, especially since these plays, like Night, Mother and Fires in the Mirror covered sensitive topics which were difficult for many students to approach. For both of those classes, a second option (or a whole roster such as the ones offered for the projects) would help to accommodate students who felt uncomfortable with the first option; for example, one of my peers was highly triggered by the suicide-related content in Night, Mother, and as a Jewish student I felt deeply affected by Fires in the Mirror and uncomfortable when the themes of Jewish trauma and modern antisemitism went entirely unmentioned in the class discussion. A more sensitive approach to both these plays, and perhaps smaller discussion groups, would have been greatly appreciated.",
                "The professors are a major strength of this course. Profs Stokes and Morrison are so kind, thoughtful, and passionate, and that makes the class a fun and safe environment. They fostered an environment where people felt willing to try things without fear of making mistakes, and I think everyone felt comfortable enough to play and enjoy the class. \r\n\r\nI think the main weakness of this course was that at times it lacked direction. It felt like we were just doing a lot of \"artsy\" or \"theatre-y\" exercises without really being sure how they applied to practical understanding of theatre-making.",
                "The strength of this course was definitely what workload we were given. Rehearsal and reading plays felt very beneficial to the class. I think some of the particular works we were given to study could be reevaluated due to content.",
                "I loved Collaboration. Even though it was longer than I expected, it taught me how to work collaboratively as an actor, thinker, and creative using hands-on projects that I enjoyed. It was a fun, energetic atmosphere. I would say that I didn't enjoy some of the work we read earlier in the semester, as it drew upon trauma and I didn't think we were ready for that. I also do agree with allocating for some time outside of class (even though it's hard to do so), as meeting for projects proved difficult.",
                "Strengths: thought about theatre as a whole, not dividing it into acting or directing or its individual parts. Yes, we talked about the individual processes that go into a piece of theatre, but we looked at them as inherently collaborative, which of course they are. It made me appreciate every part of the theatrical process more, not just the bits that I'd already been able to explore. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was four hours long, and by the end of four hours, no matter how much you like the subject, you're gonna wane a bit. Our classes always seemed divided into textual discussion work and on-your-feet exercise work, so I think the class would be improved if it were split into two shorter chunks throughout the week, doing one type of work one day and the other the next.",
                "The professors were really wonderful and the material was engaging! The professors also brought in several really awesome guests which was a real highlight. I also enjoyed the different group projects we did. However, the four-hour long block made this course difficult to stay engaged with. I found that most students felt the classes dragged on and would have been more effective if split into two 2 hour classes twice a week. It sometimes felt like we were searching for something to fill the whole four hours with, rather than actually being productive."

The workload was manageable, especially since the projects were so creative and collaborative.",
