                "I learned to identify nearly all of the world's birds by family and order from specimen skeletons and skins. I learned about the characteristics that set certain families and orders apart and how the comprehensive phylogeny of birds is built. From learning to identify the bones of the birds, I saw new differences in backyard birds and broadened my understanding of the diversity of the planet's birds. I proved to myself that I could master the names of the families and orders and tested my ability to absorb and apply a great deal of information on a weekly basis.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: wide selection of specimens to illustrate the families and a comprehensive overview of each\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the latter half of the course lacks content on identifiable traits to distinguish the families despite identification being the sole object of the exams",
                "The course was pretty fast paced and it was difficult to study for weekly quizzes. There is a lot of memorization involved and it was hard to ace the practicals, especially if you're not an experienced birder.",
                "The strength of this course was the format in which Prof. Prum would give an engaging and thorough lecture on that week's birds, which would sometimes include demonstrations. Also, the course involved specimens taken directly from the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History's ornithology collection, which provided students with the priceless opportunity to connect with the rare birds discussed in class. The weekly ungraded quizzes were a great way to test student mastery of a bird group without serving as a source of stress. Having only two exams (midterm and final) in the class was stressful but I felt prepared for both of them. A weakness of the class was that we weren't aware of the groups we were skipping and it would have been nice to know which families we ultimately never learned. Another weakness was that there didn't seem to be great bonding between those in the lab. More emphasis on partner work could improve this.",
                "This course is a unique opportunity to interact with the holdings of the Peabody Museum of Natural History, which represents one of the finest ornithological collections in the world. It was a treat to engage with the specimens and see the diversity of the birds of the world first hand. I also really enjoyed the field trips!",
                "I enjoyed the course and the format overall, but I think it would be nice if lecture notes were posted online somewhere.",
                "I think it was a really strong class and complimented the ornithology lecture very well. The pace was fast but manageable, and by the end I had learned a huge amount about bird biodiversity. I really appreciated the fact that there were ungraded quizzes each week; they forced me to keep up with studying every week without being overly stressful. I wish there had been more time to cover some more passerine lineages, so one suggestion might be to try condensing a couple of the earlier days a bit to fit in more passerines, if that was possible. I also wonder about changing the format or structure of some of the test questions to make identifying the birds in the test a little more like actual birding. For example, for some tricky families (like Oceanitidae vs Hydrobatidae), maybe the continent or region the specimen came from could be included as a clue to help students identify them. Or for birds whose posture is really important for identification, maybe photographs could be included along with the specimens. It could allow the tests to include harder identification questions while still being reasonable, as well as help teach skills more applicable to birding in the field."

                "I would highly recommend another student to take this course concurrently with E&EB272. This lab course definitely aids you in mastering lecture content but stands well enough on its own to keep students engaged. Do not be discouraged by the first avian osteology (bone) lab. This, for me, was the hardest but was necessary to understand the separation of certain families later. Whenever you see a skeleton on display, test yourself on the bones! Thus, while it does involve a great deal of work to learn the family and order names of nearly all the world's birds, I found it incredibly rewarding. To study, I made a Quizlet set for each bird (~200 terms per week) that covered phylogeny and attributes, and included photos from the Birds of the World database. I enjoyed every part of the course and always looked forward to the lab.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone with an advanced interest in ornithology. Be aware that you'll be asked to memorize hundreds of latin names for taxonomic families and orders, but this is builds a strong foundation for subsequent studies of birds.",
                "If you like birds, then yes!",
                "Absolutely, as long as they knew what to expect and were genuinely interested in birds. It would be harder if you have no background knowledge of birds, but you'd learn a ton. For birdwatchers mostly familiar with more local species, it's a really great way to learn a lot about birds all across the world."
