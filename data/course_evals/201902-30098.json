    "Dr. Wolenski is a fantastic lecturer who actually cares about our learning and experience. The quizzes were very manageable. The multiple choice test questions were overall fine, but some were a bit tricky and some of the questions did not seem like it was material that had been taught. The free response questions on the test were fine. Other than that, it was a great class taught by a truly wonderful person.",
    "The strengths of the course were that Wolenski is an amazing professor who cares so much about his students and the class. The only weakness is that I wish we had more time to spend on some of the topics towards the end of the textbook. Perhaps some of the first few chapters could be condensed in a few days so that greater time could be spent on finishing the whole textbook. Otherwise, the class was honestly pretty perfect. The exams were fair in all senses, which is pretty rare for a Yale biology course."

    "Yes, absolutely. Dr. Wolenski is fantastic and you do learn a lot about cells and their inner workings.",
    "Absolutely! Take it with Wolenski if you can. There will never be another Yale professor that will care so much about the course he teaches, even if he only teaches it to 4 students! Honestly, this was the one of the better classes I've taken at Yale, and every single day I learned something new."
