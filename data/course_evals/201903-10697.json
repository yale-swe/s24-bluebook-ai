    "tools and techniques to analyze randomized algorithms, ability to solve many problems that involve counting, probability, and robots, an understanding of martingales and markov chains.",
    "This class gives you a good background in probability, random variables, martingales, and Markov chains, and their applications to analyzing algorithms. The algorithms themselves are interesting, and the techniques and concepts are useful for other classes."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Lectures tend to be messy and unstructured. But the notes are really well written.",
    "Teaching is funny and engaging. However, both problem sets and the exam were little work, and should be made more substantial. Less time should be spent learning about highly specialized algorithms (ex: localized hashing) in favor of more general techniques, etc.",
    "I thought that the lectures were not very helpful to me because they were taught straight out of the course notes, and provided little beyond that. There were also usually confusing because we spend a lot of time going through the calculations directly in class without much explanation. I did enjoy the problem sets though and found them to be interesting thought problems involving what we learned. Perhaps a higher emphasis on problem solving would be an improvement.",
    "The strengths include the well-written and formatted set of notes posted online by the professor. They were a very clear place in case lecture was not as helpful.\r\n\r\nSome weaknesses include the esoteric nature of some of the problems, where help was hard to come by. Also lectures could be improved to be more engaging and hopefully more accurate.",
    "Lectures are hard to follow and not super engaging, but the problem sets and final are fun and Professor Aspnes is very available to help.",
    "strengths: very clear lecture notes, assignments once every two weeks. homework and final problems are interesting and novel, and are good ways to learn how to apply what we have learned to realisitic problems. Aspnes probably comes up with them himself \r\nweaknesses: lectures do not offer much new intuition. more explanations, and neater handwriting would help"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes -- the teaching was good, and the material was interesting.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it unless they enjoyed working only with concentration bounds because that was what we applied the most throughout the course. Many of the other concepts we learned were very cool in principle, but rarely touched upon in application. I didn't learn much besides review concepts in probability theory, and felt that much of the unique aspects of the class (the algorithms and data structures that were taught) were only briefly touched upon. This class felt more like a statistics and probability class, which while I enjoyed, didn't teach us much more.",
    "If you're interested in randomized algorithms I would recommend just some self studying from the online notes. If you want to have a structured environment, then you should probably take the course. Just beware that lectures may not be the most helpful and most of the learning will be done on your own or with classmates.",
    "Most of the people in this course are grad students\/men so it can look and feel scary, but the things you learn are fun and it's not that much work. If you are very interested in CS theory this is a good course.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in theoretical CS and enjoyed 365\/366, this is the course to take."
