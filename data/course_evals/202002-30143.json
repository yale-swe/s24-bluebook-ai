   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about derivatives, limits and integrals.",
    "More ways to look at\/solve a problem.",
    "There are many things that I have learned from this specific course during the summer. It was great to have an insight of a university course as a sixth form student, however due to the ongoing pandemic, it was quite disappointing that I was unable to experience the campus itself. I have also learned a lot of skills and also the knowledge that I could apply to in my last year of sixth form. The things that I have learned will be extremely useful for me in the future.",
    "Calc 1 (limit, derivative, integral)",
    "A really good overview of Calc 1, more comprehensive than what I learned in high school",
    "I learned about the practical applications of calculus, how to calculate integrals and derivatives, to graph functions, etc. Additionally, I learned how to think in a more quantitative manner.",
    "I learned how to think more creatively and critically about my math skills.",
    "basic calculus",
    "I think the most important skill I developed was learning how to take derivatives, which is going to be incredibly beneficial and important for when I take intermediate microeconomics as well as intro macroeconomics. Furthermore, I got to brush up on my algebra skills (factoring, rationalizing, etc.) which I hadn't done since early in my high school career.",
    "I learned the basics of derivative based calculus.",
    "I acquired knowledge about different applications of calculus and developed skills surrounding how to use calculus concepts to solve real world problems.",
    "I solidified my understanding of Calculus.",
    "By taking this course, I learned how to differentiate, integrate, graph derivatives and antiderivatives, apply various theorems and limit definitions, and to analyze a problem. I developed a more open mind to looking at a problem through multiple lenses and perspectives. I also learned that not all solutions will come immediately and that planning out the steps and thought process before starting a problem is extremely beneficial.",
    "I gained a clear understanding of differential calculus, and developed skills for studying math subjects."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Prof. Sargent is great, the classes were dynamic and incorporated exercices nicely\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like sometimes the hws were too hard compared to the class",
    "It was great to see how skilled my instructors were when teaching face to face on technology as if it felt like they were right in front of me. There were no significant weaknesses of the course.",
    "Strengths: Pam was a great professor. Effectively used worksheets and explained concepts. I also enjoyed the Friday Workshops\r\nWeaknesses: At times, the class time was an issue. We wouldn't fit all the material in class time, and Pam would often just work out the problems we couldn't go over and post the recording. Being the lazy self I am, I never watched them.",
    "Strengths: super well organized\r\nWeakness: none",
    "Strengths: \r\n-Doesn't try and teach too much material or too complicated material at once\r\n-Builds on previous topics, thus reinforcing that knowledge\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-I found the problems on the written homeworks were oftentimes harder than the in-class problems and some of the exam problems, and I think it would be more fair if these problem sets were more representative of the in-class problems.",
    "I liked the pre class videos and assignments, but I thought the quizzes were a bit unnecessary.",
    "strengths: professor was very engaged in course and very willing to help \r\n\r\nweakness: very fast paced",
    "The strengths of the course can definitely be attributed to Professor Sargent. She was incredibly receptive and make awesome note sheets for us to fill-in\/follow along within the lecture. I think the weaknesses are potentially the gap between what we learn in the videos and what we cover in the lecture. I feel as though sometimes John would say important stuff in the video lectures, but it wasn't necessarily reiterated in the lecture, so I wasn't sure if it was important\/we were expected to know it. Additionally, I never really felt like the Friday workshop sessions added to my understanding of the material, and they often took up so much time. Luckily, I had a very engaged workshop group so we were able to get through most workshops with the help of the TF\/Professor, but I had classmates who were the only ones who spoke in their workshop group, thus never allowing them to complete the main problem in time. I also wish we could've gone over the main problem after everyone had a chance to try it, especially because the main problem was usually pretty difficult and would show up on Psets\/tests.",
    "The online aspect certainly makes the class harder as the material is crammed into 5 weeks and you are unable to dive as deeply into each topic as you would if the course was in person.  That being said, YSS did a decent job of organizing the course in a way that made it easier to learn remotely.",
    "The strength of this course is definitely the professor, Pamela Sargent. She was incredibly clear, helpful, knowledgeable and always there for her students. Maths has never been my strongest subject so I was concerned going in. However, Professor Sargent was amazing and I had a wonderful time in the course.",
    "It was very well run but we often ran out of time to go over all of the material for that day. I think we should have spent less time in breakout rooms.",
    "Strengths: there were a lot of resources available to help make sure that we really understood the content. The material provided was very clear and Prof. Sargent made great practice problems for us to check our understanding and prepare for exams. I also really liked the notes that she prepared for us to fill out during class and the pre-class assignment\/video set upthey were super helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the only thing I didn't love about the course was the fact that it was a lot of content to go through in a short period of time, but I think that must be a limitation of all summer courses, considering how there is a lot of material and not enough time to go too deeply into all of it.",
    "Watching videos before each class about the content to be covered the next day was very helpful. It allowed you to be fully prepared and primed for the content of the class and to ask any questions that had arrisen. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the problem sets were multiple degrees more difficult than any of the content covered in class or on the examinations. This system didn't seem to make sense.",
    "The strengths of this course are organization, amiability, and engagement. This course was easy to follow and easy to understand the expectations of the students because of how the course material was organized in Canvas (every lesson had its own Module). Moreover, the course resonated with amiability, which stemmed from the professor. The professor was very happy, friendly, and relatable to the class. We also had Friday workshops which promoted group work and collaboration - this was great because we were able to establish friendships and become comfortable working together. Moreover, the level of engagement with the class was excellent. Every class, the professor asked us questions and patiently and humorously waited for a reply. On Fridays, we were exposed to more difficult concepts and had the time to truly dissect the question and concepts involved, which consequently allowed us to understand the material more thoroughly. Also, the professor welcomed us to ask about any concerns or questions that we may have during, before, or after class; she acknowledged that the course moves very fast and encouraged us to email her if we have any concerns. This allowed for students to clarify all their questions and optimize their understanding of material. \r\n\r\nThere were very little negatives of this course. The only weakness was that the pre-class supplemental videos were a bit long. However, these were optional so it is not truly a weakness of this course. This could be improved by stating explicitly that the only videos we are required to watch are those in the actual quizzes.",
    "The main strength was lots of office hours and lots of chances to ask questions. I think it could be improved by having a few more practice problem sets available."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students as Yale Summer Session has a variety of courses to choose from. It is especially good for students who are currently at school and might want to experience the course they are interested in before applying to that specific course in the university.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's great for econ majors trying to get their math req out of the way.",
    "Yes! I have no complaints and I felt like it was easy to learn in this class.",
    "As a pre-med student, I didn't really have a choice in whether or not I took this class. However, I definitely found it more enjoyable than I was anticipating. This could be because I took it during the summer session and had more time to focus on it rather than get stressed out about it, but it definitely wasn't as bad as I feared.",
    "If you are looking to fulfill a math credit, yes. If you want to actually learn the math, take this class with in person instruction.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if the student needed to take it as a pre-requisite (i.e. for pre-med or the math major) or if they are planning on finishing the entire economics track, but if they don't fall into those categories, I would say no, I wouldn't recommend just anyone to take it. If you are a math person and enjoy taking math, then perhaps you would like this class. However, I just have a hard time with math and despite doing well on homework and the workshop, the tests were incredibly hard for me. Math has never been my strong suit, but if it is your strong suit, go ahead and take the course. But if it's not and you won't really need it at all in your courses, I don't think it's something I would recommend you take.",
    "It is a pre-req for many courses and majors so some people don't have an option.  But if you do, I would take the course.  It's a good way of getting a QR out of the way and a useful class to have under your belt.",
    "Yes! I definitely would, since the explanations were so clear and even though the workload is a lot, it is manageable with a great professor!",
    "Yes I thought taking this over the summer was a great way to focus on the class and get a great overview of calc.",
    "Definitely. I think Professor Sargent is a great teacher who was really invested in making sure that everyone was learning and understanding everything.",
    "If you can take this course with Pam, I'd highly recommend it",
    "All things considered, including that the class was conducted online, I thought it was a good choice. I wouldn't recommend this class unless you have to take it, but Pam was a great teacher and organized things well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it teaches the fundamentals of calculus, which builds the foundation for future math classes. Moreover, the professor for this course made this course not only informative, but also enjoyable. Because of the professor's teaching style, the  material in this course was easy to follow and keep organized, which reduces stress. Hence, I would recommend this course to others, and would especially recommend this course if Professor Sargent is teaching it.",
    "Yes! I thought this was a really good course, and gave me a strong foundation to explore more difficult parts of calculus."
