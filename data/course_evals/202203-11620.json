                "This course only has strengths. Everything is organized, the professor and TFs are always available to help, and there was ample study material throughout the course. I also enjoyed the topics we learned and am excited to continue learning econometrics.",
                "Strengths: \r\n-VERY well taught, especially given how difficult the material is\r\n-Problem sets are super reasonable and constructive\r\n-Exams seemed very fair\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Sometimes the lesson plans were ambitious and we often didn't finish all the slides.\r\n-There were a lot of redundant questions being asked -- it's ok to say \"we already covered this\" or answer very briefly. Sometimes we got sucked into long tangents about questions we had already covered.",
                "Prof Humphries was one of the better Econ professors I have had here. More R stuff in class could have been more useful.",
                "Very strong course overall- sometimes it felt a little fast paced, but overall I really enjoyed the content and the manner it was presented.",
                "The course was very well structured: lectures consistently moved at a good pace, problem sets helped reinforce the ideas we learned in lecture, and quizzes served as a good progress check for my grasp of the concepts. In that vein, I think the class did a really excellent job blending theory and practice; that is, I didn't just learn how to use these various tools, I got to see various applications of them in real research, which helped my understanding and engagement. I don't think the class had any major weaknesses; the only minor thing is that it was sometimes unclear why points were taken off on problem sets (more specifically, I would see that points were taken off on a particular problem, but even looking at the solutions, it wasn't always clear why).",
                "Strengths: course covers good breadth of topics, TFs were very helpful\r\nWeaknesses: lecture felt scattered at times, difficult to understand the main points to retain from each lecture",
                "Strengths: Great lecture from Prof Humphries. Well organized TA sections and office hours. Sensible and logical management of the course. Covers very important statistical materials in the right pace. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Not really weakness, but i think this course should be called \"statistics\", not \"econometrics\" - I dont think I have learned too much about economics in this course. It's basically a statistica course with economics examples.",
                "This course did not have any weakness. Professor Humphriess exuberant teaching style makes the lectures easy to follow. He includes real life research in lectures and psets which make the course very relatable to real life economics. But most importantly, what separates Prof. Humphriess and this course is the design of the course. Every aspect of the course is easily available unlike other courses at Yale. You do not face any surprises in exams because professor covers everything you are responsible for very deeply. Lectures slides are extremely thorough and are well designed. Everything in slides are relevant and you can study for the course reading lecture slides. Problem sets and quizzes prepare you for exams and make you actually learn. Overall this is the best course I have taken at Yale so far because of the way course was designed and the way Professor Humphries teaches.",
                "This course provides a helpful overview of statistics, its application to economics, and usage in R. The psets are an appropriate length and are very helpful for learning, the quizzes also proved helpful for understanding, and the exams were an appropriate level of difficulty. I wish the course had covered instrumental variables, which are very essential to economics research.",
                "The strengths of this course are that the TAs are very accessible and give good input for any questions.\r\nThe weaknesses of this course are just that the material is somewhat dull. If you're interested in statistics, it will be fun, but it otherwise feels repetitive.",
                "The lectures were really slow and I felt that there were economic\/social science applications for the concepts being taught but that it wasn't really an economics course as much as it was probability. The problems sets focus intently on R but there was less practice on exam type material in the coursework. The midterm exam was very difficult",
                "The course could be improved to provide more feedback on how well were learning the material. Having more theory on psets would be very useful.",
                "Strength: Prof Humphries is great lecturer. He also opens up the lecture so that students can ask questions during class (good incentive to come to class!). Psets are reasonable; Just two exams, though the exams can feel difficult but trust the curve. \r\n\r\nWeakness: If you've never used R before there might be some learning curve in the beginning",
                "No particular weakness as such. It was wonderfully designed and well managed. The professor and the teaching team were quite exceptional in responding to student feedback and ensuring the course flowed smoothly. This is the course with the best designed exams I have taken. Just the right amount of difficult and hitting on all the major concepts that were taught in class, no curveballs or extremely hard questions that shouldn't have been on the exam.",
                "Strengths - Professor is probably one of the best and nicest professors in a class that i've taken at yale and he really tries to make it engaging, and the TAs are also good. There are lots of office hours and resources for studying. Weaknesses - it was a really heavy workload class and difficult to keep up if you have no background in stats or coding, even though it's an introductory class. The lectures are really long and it's hard to judge how much time to spend on the quizzes when you want to do well but they only count for about 1% of your grade. The exams barely covered R even when this was the bulk of the work on the psets.",
                "Lecture was very engaging and interesting, TA sections were helpful",
                "Strengths: lectures were well delivered and interesting (nearly always included examples from a real econ study), psets were very helpful in mastering the material, the second half of the course dedicated to regressions and causal relationships was super interesting. Weaknesses: probability intro can be dry and confusing, didn't find section useful for someone comfortable in R until 2\/3 of the way through the class.",
                "Great course that compiles upon the theoretical beginnings of the course which has direct correlation with the regression modeling and focus later in the course.",
                "It was set up to facilitate success.",
                "The lectures did a great job in introducing the material yet would often have to go back and process it again while doing\/after p-sets to understand how to actually apply it to the problems of the class. There was support from TAs and office hours, yet these could have also been structured better to fit student schedules\/needs with regard to exams.",
                "Great lectures. Helpful sections. Difficult psets",
                "Taught very well",
                "Strengths: Logical flow of the course (the class started out with some basic probability and concepts within statistics, which were followed by methods of causation and correlation that used these calculations, and finally finished with some tools of econometric analysis that used the skills and calculations from earlier in the course), clarity and applicability of the problem sets (problem sets were clear and used the tools covered in class, so they were relatively straightforward to complete), usage of R in the course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes in class, the theory was explained but not enough examples were provided, the pace of the class was quite fast at times",
                "I loved that each lecture was recorded clearly and could be easily accessed on Canvas. Office hours were also extremely helpful as they were frequent and the TA's were very patient and helpful. Problem sets overviewed class materials very well, so even if I didn't understand a concept in class I could figure it out on my own by doing the problem sets. I do wish that there were more opportunities to engage with other students in the class, such as discussions during class or open group study sessions that are not just limited to study groups.",
                "Strength: really excellent case examples used to teach us the material. This kept the course very engaging and helped motivate me to do the work. \r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The slides are really good and well structured.",
                "Strengths: The professor did a good job including real studies as examples in his lectures, which kept the lessons interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found the expected value notation to be unintuitive and rarely useful, especially when it came to the definitions of variance and covariance. I understand that it has to be taught, but it unhelpful information.",
                "Very well structured lectures and guided psets. Great instructor feedback and accessibility.",
                "My strengths are the ability to understand the data and connect it with economic ideas. My main weakness is understanding all the statistics and it can be improved by taking another statistics course.",
                "Strengths: The lectures were very well organized, and there was plenty of support for students in the form of office hours with TAs, ULAs, and the professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of.",
                "Professor Humphries was an amazing professor -- very clear, supportive, and organized.",
                "Strengths - Resonable exams and interesting content\r\nWeaknesses - Honestly, none, really.",
                "I felt that since there was a lot of content covered, sometimes we did not delve deeply into some topics.",
                "The actual class could have done a better job of explaining concepts instead of just touching on them. It was difficult for me to follow.",
                "Strengths: lots of help available. JEH also makes himself very accessible.\r\nWeaknesses: the boys in my section laughed at my lack of knowledge on the first day and it was off putting. One of the TAs also scared me."

The topics we learn are not necessarily easy at first, but they become intuitive and by the end of the class, it's almost surprising how much you learned. The tools taught in this class are really powerful and are actually used in research, and Prof. Humphries' is an excellent lecturer who is engaging and did a great job blending the math with real-world examples.",

                "If you're an Econ major, you have take at least one econometrics class. But regardless the major requirement, I learned a lot in this class. If you are interested in stats and want to see how stats is applied in social science, this is a great course to take. The exams are challenging (which can be stressful during the exam) but they are graded on a curve. Psets are hefty (study groups help!), but they do aid you understand the material better. Not even half the class shows upto the lecture because they are recorded, but I think it was worth showing upto all lectures especially Prof answers questions during the lecture. Prof explains the concept\/theory pretty in depth during the lecture, but for psets and exams, you just need to be able to apply them on the problems.",
                "If you're an economics major you have to take this course as it is a requirement. Definitely take it with Humphries as I've heard less favorable things about the other professors who teach this course. If you're not an Econ major, consider taking an introductory course from the S&DS department as it might be a better intro course in general terms. However, if you want to learn stats with an Econ touch, take this. This course also is in R and teaches many helpful skills in that regard, so if you want to learn R and have a better intermediate understanding, take the class.",

Uncertain whether 135\/136 would have been a better choice.",

                "I would probably only recommend this course if it's required or the student is very interested in an introduction to econometrics and basic statistics. The class is certainly geared towards those with an interest in economics, so if the statistics and data analysis part is what the student is looking for, a different class would probably be a better fit.",
                "Yes! I think this class is a great overview of statistics and data science. I did find it very difficult content-wise and the course load was also relatively heavy compared to some of my other classes, so these are factors to definitely keep in mind before choosing to take this class.",
                "Yes, good class, humphries made it great",
                "Yes. The course gives you the tools you need to succeed and teaches you valuable skills.",
                "Yes it is important to learn basic statistics and R.",
                "If you want to learn econometrics, this course should be able to teach you well. The best advice I can give is to review lectures consistently to be well-versed in the material.",
                "Absolutely, if not only to learn about how to interpret the statistics we encounter in everyday life.",
                "Sure.",
                "Yes, especially if the enjoy economics and statistics.",
                "Yes, for both econ and non-econ majors. Studying econometrics, especially through the application-based scenarios taught in this class, allows one to gain better analysis skills and understand the world better.",
                "Yes. I believe this class introduces you to a new way of thinking about social issues from a quantitative approach.",
                "Yes! Especially if you are interested in stats and econ, this course literally combines both.",
                "Yes - it made me learn to think critically about data and see the applicability of data analysis to the real world.",
                "I would not unless they absolutely needed it and they have previously taken a stats class.",
                "Absolutely. But only if you hold a pure reverence for the study of data. Otherwise this might just feel like a ton of work."
