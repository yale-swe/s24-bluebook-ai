            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the amount of writing (4 proposals, 4 rough drafts, 4 final drafts) is great because it forces you to learn through doing. The readings are informative and enjoyable, and if you spend time on them you will pick things up to use in your own writing (actively or passively). Professor Caplan was a real highlight of the class, both in class, as an active listener and constructive critic, and on essays, with detailed responses to every step of the writing process. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the structure of the discussions would prevent us from talking about all the pieces, or give sufficient time to all the pieces. It could be an improvement to get actual edits on the rough draft of essays instead of just email responses, but the extent to which Professor Caplan gives feedback was still informative and useful. The grading was pretty hard but fair, so as long as other English 120 classes are held to the same standard, nothing wrong there.",
                "Lots of reading for homework, but it was for the most part very interesting readings. The workshop style was formulaic but it worked. I loved this class so much and would highly recommend it.",
                "A strength of the course is the diversity of selected texts that we would read to learn about each type of personal essay. Besides exposing us to well known \r\nand often contemporary writers, they showed us that there are very different approaches to writing the same \"type\" of essay.\r\n\r\nAt times I was not able to engage in the texts to the extent that I would have liked due to the length\/number of the readings.",
                "Strengths - time slot, at least half of the readings are really interesting, smaller class size makes for good conversation\r\nWeaknesses - the other half of the readings are bland, professor cuts students off a lot",
                "This course had great material, with dozens of essays from amazing authors, and I have never received more in-depth and useful feedback on my writing. The workshops were helpful, but since they were done after we finished our final drafts, we never got to put the feedback into practice. Therefore, I think it would be better to have workshops between the first and final drafts."

                "Absolutely. This class single-handedly improved not just my writing skills, but the way I approach consuming media and the way I interact with the world around me. Lincoln Caplan, specifically, is a wonderful instructor, and any other student would be extremely lucky to take a class with him.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because not only does it teach you how to write about important topics and stay informed about all different kinds of things, but it also teaches you about yourself, and what is important to you. It is as much a course about self discovery as it is about becoming a better writer and reader.",
                "Yes! If you enjoy writing and reading.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student; I would even consider making it mandatory for all students to take at some point during their time at Yale. It helped me find my voice, gain a better sense of self, and increased my confidence as a writer.",
                "I would recommend the course, but with a different professor.",
                "Yes. The feedback that Dr. Caplan gave me was instrumental to my growth as a writer, and the material we read was amazing."
