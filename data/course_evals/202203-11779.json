                "I learned about many parts of our political system: congressional committees, PACs, Super PACs, lobbying, reconciliation (the congressional procedure, not in general), the normal career paths of politicians, the job of the House and Senate party leaders, redistricting and gerrymandering, the evolution of the Democratic and Republican Parties since Roosevelt, etc. I also learned a lot of theories about how politics works: why partisanship and polarization is so strong, why and when bipartisan bills pass, and what constitutes good representation.",
                "You learn about how Congress works, with regard to politics, lobbying, elections, campaign finance, etc.",
                "I learned a lot about the process and systems set up to make congress run.",
                "Learned a lot about Congress via case studies (Obamacare, 1986 tax reform) and interesting readings. We did a few psets in R which were interesting too.",
                "I gained a good understand how Congress functions through studying case studies of various legislative battles. I was introduced to new ways of thinking about lobbying and campaign finance. And I gained a better understanding of voting rights law and redistricting.",
                "A better understanding of how the government works and why it works that why.",
                "How Congress works in the United States and how to use the program R for data science.",
                "Learned about the inner-workings of Congress and introductory data science skills in R.",
                "Although it was a small component of the course, I learned how to do basic data visualization in R with political science data sets. I also learned how to critically read political science research.

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The topics are very interesting and, especially if you have a more rudimentary understanding of our political system (i.e. you are like me and not a poli sci major), very useful for understanding what happens in politics. The professor grades very easily (apparently out midterm grades were delayed a week because Professor Kuriwaki raised all our grades from what the TF assigned), and you have the opportunity to resubmit the p-sets for more points. There is not too much work or reading most weeks. Lectures were great, very informative yet engaging and concise.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't love the use of the problem sets. Yes, I learned some R, but it wasn't very rewarding because there was very little creativity or problem-solving involved. Also, the reading for the class varied greatly; most weeks we had none or only a few dozen pages, but other weeks there was a lot more. In particular, in preparation for the midterm paper and final, we were assigned a whole book to read in a week. (I will say, though, that those books were not as dry as I would expect most polisci books to be.)",
                "Kuriwaki's lectures are really solid. He prints out the slides for students to take notes on, which helps engagement. They're well-organized and focused.\r\nThe PSETs are great for people just getting into quantitative analysis. They're not too difficult, worth a small amount of the grade, and graded generously. This is really helpful for people just starting out with R or coding as a whole.\r\nThe readings at times could be a bit dry, but for the most part they were fine.\r\n\r\nI was hoping the course would get more into how the Congress (or the US government more broadly) might be structurally changed for different effects (e.g., the effects of, say, term limits, multi-party systems, ranked-choice voting, etc.)",
                "It made good use of case studies to facilitate learning. I will say that the beginning of the coarse was a lot of work being given lots of reading and R psets to do as well. In some cases, it also assumes some knowledge about the subject, like taxes, that makes understanding the readings harder.",
                "Wished we had more instruction in the beginning of the course in R. I liked the readings",
                "Strengths: Professor Kuriwaki and David Herman are an amazing 1-2 punch. \"PLSC 277\" as a course is highly dependent on the quality of the instructor because there are a million different ways to teach Congress and a million different possibilities to focus on. Kuriwaki chose an interesting set of topics (spatial models, campaign finance, redistricting, polarization) for lecture, but the highlight for me was the exams. Yes, you read that right. The midterm essay was a case study of the ACA (Obamacare) and it was pretty fun. The final exam was based around an essay about 1986 Tax Reform and the book we read in preparation (\"Gucci Gulch\"terrible name but don't let that stop you) was great. The problem sets were interesting and relatively simple coding assignments, and there were only 5 all semester so the workload isn't tough. I actually would've preferred more of them. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures can get a little slow during the middle of the semester. Given how small the class was, I would've liked to see students involved more often. Like during redistricting when one student was asked to talk about the districts in his home state because it was relevant to the lecture. Build in more participation like that.",
                "I think this course did a goo job of using interesting and relevant case studies to facilitate learning. However, there was almost no instruction on the coding portion of the class which made it difficult for students without coding experience to complete psets. Also, stacking readings on top of psets in the same week could inhibit students' ability to do either effectively. The course could feel like two different courses in one at times.",
                "I like the coding assignments - I think it's really helpful to see the theories we talk about in practice.",
                "I think the professor explained things well, but the topics were things that could easily be googled.",
                "Organized and structured very well. Readings could get overwhelming at times.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kuriwaki is an extremely engaging professor. Although lectures can seem a bit boring, he truly put his all into the course to make the material accessible. He was always quick to respond to emails or questions and made office hours approachable. He taught the course in a way that made sense and was very forgiving to students in terms of attendance, etc. The course itself was not too large of a workload and the assignments just made sense. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The discussion sections were not too enjoyable and it didn't feel like much of a \"debate\" that Prof. Kuriwaki was hoping for. However, they were always helpful in clarifying material from class and breaking down the important sections of readings. I also felt like there was a bit too much historical readings\/analysis for a political science course.",
                "The course content was relevant and useful to understand modern politics. I think a weakness were the pset because they did not feel related to the course and were difficult to complete without a coding background.",
                "I think that this course should either full send it with the amount of computer science course and include a QR credit or just cut the programming aspect and instead just include data trends as part of the lectures. I think some of the readings could be too dense at times, but were otherwise especially enjoyable. Political biographies and books that did deep-dives into the histories behind landmark pieces of legislation were awesome. Professor Kuriwaki is engaging and makes sure students participate during lectures, which is also helpful. The midterm paper and final were not strenuous work at all, so the light workload added to the quality of the course.",
                "Strengths of the course were the assignment types.  Very appropriate.  In terms of teaching, I think that some of the topics could have started from even more of the basics during lecture."

This course is a wonderful introduction into many skills key to political scientists, including reading recent journal articles, analyzing data, and analyzing legislative case studies. Professor Kuriwaki makes this course painless, interesting, and enjoyable.",
