    "The course contains a lot of activities and interesting media. And the process of critique is very thought-provoking.",
    "Strength: diversity of projects and assignments\r\nWeakness: limited time for an ambitious course structure, and consequently little time granted to each of the concentrations",
    "Strength:I had a general knowledge of the forms and genres in art and their possibilities.\r\nWeakeness: Everything tends to be too general. I received nothing too deep in a specific art genre. But understandable due to short time in Summer.",
    "The strength of the course is that it incorporates various forms of visual presentations for the students to explore. The weakness of this course is that each of these forms are not explored on a deep level.",
    "This course provides a good chance for me to visit Yale' art gallery with instructer's leading and teaching. This course also encourge me to work on printing and other forms of art, which I experienced for the firt time. I also got presious advice from my instructor on my previous art projects.\r\n\r\nThere is no obvious weakness of this course as i experienced. But I would suggest to add more small- groups talks and discussions in oder to encourage more students to speak out their thoughts and make them ready and willing to share their ideas with whole class."
