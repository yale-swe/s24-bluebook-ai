                "Online class is online class. However, I thought that Professor Hartman and Prof Near did a superb job with this course. Level of engagement was quite high, and I now feel comfortable not only discussing the concepts we learned in class but also comfortable engaging with primary scientific literature. In just a few short weeks, that is pretty fantastic.",
                "The quizzes in the following course happen very frequently, and it might be a little better to space it out and allow students to have more time to digest the material. For the ecology and evolutionary biology portion of BIO106, it may be more helpful to split the final paper into smaller portion just like that of the genes and development portion. This allows for more step-by-step feedback and writing development.",
                "The course was very organized and the instructors provided lecture materials and a schedule at the beginning of each module. The pace of the course was easy to follow and the material was very interesting. For our writing assignments, we were only provided an exemplar paper for the module on development, and I wished we were also provided an exemplar paper for our clade assignment.",
                "The strengths of the course was the clarity with which the lecture content was thought. The instructions for all assignments and assessments was clear and communicated well before important deadlines. Although the course was fast-paced, the course did not feel rushed in any way.\r\nOne of the weaknesses of the course was the confusion surrounding the differences and disunity of Parts 1 and 2, as they were taught by different instructions and were structured in different ways.",
                "The strengths are the professors, both Prof Hartman and Prof Near are kind, knowledgeable, and engaging. I find it really odd that in part A, we discussed development before genetics; I think it'd make more sense of that order was switched. I also think that it's hard to find a topic that's both interesting and well-researched for the part B paper, because we have to choose our topic when we still don't know a lot about evolutionary biology. Since the paper doesn't take that long to write, I think postponing when we choose our topic would work well.",
                "Sometimes I felt like I was being talked down to. I understand lecturers have to balance catering the class towards students with varying backgrounds in biology, but sometimes class questions seem a bit simple. I also wish we went into a bit more detail about the things we weren't going to be tested on. Sometimes the professor would say \"I'm not going to test  you on this\" and then give us a bit of a fun fact, but I really wanted to know more background about that  fun fact.",
                "The workload for the first half is quite intense having a quiz and HW every other night, especially when the HWs require a ton of research and reading, but I understand why it was necessary. Maybe nothing can be improved necessarily, but it's good to know this going into the class.",
                "I think it was strong because the professors were interesting and engaging and their slides were really cool, and I think it could be improved by maybe having slightly less extra work in the first half.",
                "This was a fast paced course but I enjoyed it. I found the first part to be more work load heavy and to have denser lecture, but I really enjoyed the second half of the lecture and found myself engaged in the content.",
                "Strengths: both Prof Hartman and Prof Near were extremely knowledgable about the material, very kind, and willing to meet with students to answer questions and discuss things further. TA for the 2nd part of the course (evolution and ecology potion) was AMAZING!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: TA for 1st part of the course (Genetics portion) was not great, refused to meet with students, and was unhelpful. There were also some grading discrepancies between TAs.",
                "contents are abundant",
                "I loved that the class was made with office hours every day in case anyone needed it but the assignments were not so spread out for part 1 that caused a lot of anxiety.",
                "I feel like the first half of the course had too much work. This is in the sense that I feel my proposal was compromised in part due to having to study for the quizzes.",
                "I think that given the short time frame of the class, the structure was about as thorough as I think it could've been. The course not only aims to introduce us to several key topics, but it also helps us experience what it's like to be a scientist."

                "Yes! I mean, you likely don't have a choice if you are premed or in a natural science major, but these professors are renowned for a reason.",
                "Yes. The summer version of this last part of the intro bio sequence seems like the significantly better option compared to those offered during the school year. Yes, it may be a lot of work given the fast-paced nature, but the smaller dynamics of the class also made the material significantly more engaging. Prof Near and Prof Hartman are both amazing, and I recommend taking BIOL106.",
                "Yes. Finishing the intro biology sequence was a fun experience and I personally enjoyed these last two modules more.",
                "It depends on why they are taking the course. If the student is interested in the E&EB or MCDB majors or has a very high interest in topics such as genetics and evolution, I would recommend taking the course during the regular school year. This way, the students are able to spend more time learning the basics of these topics, in order to prepare them for upper-level courses. I enjoyed the course overall, but I do believe that some parts of it weren't taught as in-depth as during the regular school year, so I would only recommend it for other stem majors or people taking the course for any other reason except those I listed above.",
                "Yes absolutely! Finishing the sequence over the summer is one of the best decisions I made. The workload is very managable and is known to be much more preferable than taking it over the normal semester.",
                "I would, this is definitely the better half of the bio sequence. If you took a decent AP Bio class in high school, you might not learn that much in Part A, but it's still good review. Part B is really great, Prof Near is amazing and you learn a lot of stuff that you wouldn't have learned in previous courses.",
                "Yes, Professor Near is great. Professor Hartman is helpful as well.",
                "Yes. This was a great way to complete the intro bio sequence. The lectures are engaging and the projects were fun. Having a quiz every other day really forces you to be on top of the material.",
                "Yes because you learn the fundamentals while also staying interested because the professors do such a good job.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, I think the online summer format was intense but also very engaging because I could focus all of my energy on it. I would not recommend taking this summer session with another summer class if you want to have some free time. However, the repeated and short time helped me really engage in and soak up the information in class.",
                "Yes! Both the professors teaching this course are very knowledgeable and teach the course\/material in a well-structured, well-organized, and engaging way. Plus, both professors are really nice and approachable, and they love talking with their students. I felt like I learned so much from this course! This is also a great course for introducing students to learning to write scientific papers.",
                "Yes! Particularly taking 104 with Prof Near! He is so passionate about the subject which makes lectures fly by and made the course fun and engaging.",
                "yes. this course is very substantial",
                "Yes! It was very nice in a zoom platform and breaks were given and reasonable.",
                "Definitely, I think the summer format was good and helped me learn a lot and complete the biology sequence in a timely manner.",
                "Very fast paced class but would recommend, lots of interesting knowledge to gain from this class as well as knock out a prerequisite quickly if it's the summer course",
                "To be honest, probably not--I'd recommend others to consider taking the semester-long courses instead. This course is rigorous given the M-F schedule, but at the same time it feels like there's so much more to be learned. During the course, I felt that maybe this class might not have been worth it in terms of how much ground we were able to cover. However, many elements from the semester-long course were incorporated pretty well. Those that are serious about learning biology should take the year-long sequence."
