I found all my learning was from the textbook and recorded videos. I feel like the assignments and tests cause students to have a thorough understanding of the subject.",
                "The course is well-paced and aligns well with the textbook. Also, the recorded lecture videos by the head of the course were very helpful.\r\n\r\nI think the reading quizzes could be a bit longer so that they can cover the readings more comprehensively and allow students to recover a few points.",
                "Strengths; There is a good support system available for problem sets and exam reviews (course wide review sessions, many office hours, etc). \r\nWeaknesses: Teaching seems to vary greatly by section. The class is formatted so that you do textbook readings on a subject, watch videos on it, and take a quiz on it before it is ever mentioned in lecture, which makes it feel like you are having to teach yourself multivariable calculus (I felt this was slightly unfair, given that some students came into the class already having taken multivariable and some students have 0 experience with it.)"

                "My instructor began the semester working through problems with pen and paper, but eventually switched to using Google Jamboard, which I thought was a useful change.\r\n\r\nParticipation was generally poor during class and perhaps could have been stimulated by 1) waiting longer for student responses so as not to set the precedent that the instructor will answer his own question, anyway, and 2) asking for responses from each group after we work for problems to as to increase accountability.",
