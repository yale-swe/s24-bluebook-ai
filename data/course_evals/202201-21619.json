Everybody was aware of the expectations on assignments and projects, which removed a lot of the stress induced by the disorganized nature of some professors in the Korean department. There was definitely an emphasis on writing short essays which I appreciated.",

                "The instructor and the classroom environment she created was incredible! Nobody felt embarrassed to speak up with their opinions or thoughts and it was truly special. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe presentation based projects were extremely beneficial in improving not only our hard korean skills but also our confidence in speaking and presenting in korean. \r\n\r\nI felt the class found a balance between a structured textbook curriculum to ensure there were no gaps in our formal knowledge of the korean language, with a more personal-interested-directed project structure of the assignments. \r\n\r\nThere were virtually no weaknesses in this class. I truly feel like I am a better at speaking, reading, and writing in the korean language",
                "The strengths of this course was its organization and structure; I think the weaknesses was that there could have been more material on Korean etiquette and culture, and relevant language in the workplace and for other formal address.",
                "The greatest strength of the class was the immersive environment and the community that made learning and speaking Korean much more comfortable.",
                "In a course designed for native speakers, the presentation of course content felt too rigid and structured since the class goes by the textbook. However, at times when the content was flexible, the students in the class made the class interesting."

I've successfully been able to improve my Korean writing abilities drastically and been able to form many meaningful connections with those in the class. I truly believe that both the relationships I've formed and the things I've learned in the class will carry along with me for a long time and I am incredibly grateful to have been able to have had such a wonderful experience.",

My Korean class is very close and we have developed a Korean community from taking this course, and we are also extremely close to our instructor and very much adore her.",
