                "The course as it stands is the natural successor in both course number and topics to 440-441, and yet it draws on quantum mechanics or advanced physics generally almost none at all. I figured we'd get maybe a minimal overview of Feynman diagrams beyond \"this is what one looks like\" or a touch of group theory as it relates to the standard model, and none of that was covered at a level anywhere near what the students in that class are prepared for. There were scattering problems which required classical mechanics, a bunch of formulas related to nuclear physics that a high schooler could've understood, and a bunch of reactions that either conserved baryon number or didn't. It was a disappointing lack of breadth or depth."
