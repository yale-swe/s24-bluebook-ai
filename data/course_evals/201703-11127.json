    "I did learn a fair amount of French but the class is a lot of work.",
    "I think I learned more basic French skills than I couldn't have learned in any other program.",
    "I learned a foundation in french.",
    "I learned how to speak, read, and understand basic French and I alos learned a little bit about French culture.",
    "I learned the basics and even a little bit beyond the french language. I've always struggled to learn languages but I can honestly say that I have never learned more and actually retained a language as well as I did this past semester.",
    "Basic understanding of the French language at the speaking, writing and listening level. Not much emphasis on reading.",
    "You can learn a surprising amount of French in thirteen weeks! Lots of vocabulary, verbs (in past and present tenses), and idiomatic speech.",
    "I learned the introductory components of French, including basic grammar, a modest amount of vocabulary, and a surprising level of conversational sophistication."

   "comments": [
    "I liked the videos every week because it forced us to engage with the material. The workbook activities just seemed like too much work and often would just get through it to get it done and not actually absorb the content. The compositions were graded a little harshly and the weekly tests were somewhat difficult.",
    "I think that we could have spent some more time on the more difficult grammar -- the ones people tended to struggle with.",
    "French in Action videos aren't always very useful but the classes themselves were great.",
    "Strengths include lots of materials and resources to help. Weakness include the weekly test time could have been like during class time.",
    "At the beginning the amount of work was high and there wasn't much guidance on how best to study with the new method, which made it difficult. But after the course was readjusted I thought it much easier to follow. I found myself learning and compared to the other language class I've taken at Yale, the progress has been faster.  I would have liked more of was reading, as that is something I need for my career. I also think we should get out exams back, so that I could more easily zero in on the problem areas. I would forget things that would reappear on the next test.",
    "At times we sped through topics before we could really learn them, but the teaching staff were actively addressing that issue, so it will hopefully improve!",
    "Having a language class every day really helps cement the skills into  your mind, but I really don't think it should require that much work. It drones on and on with no breaks for respite."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it's intense French study so take it if that's what you want.",
    "Yes, but I would warn them about the level of engagement and workload necessary in order to succeed in the class.",
    "French 110 is a very well run class. And it's also a ton of work and easy to fall behind. If you stay on top of things, then you will learn the language really well.",
    "Yes! Try to take it with Professor Hugonny. She is awesome.",
    "Yes because I loved my prof and I learned so much about the french language!",
    "I really liked Professor Hugonny! Her teaching style was great and it seemed like she really cared about her students.",
    "I would recommend French 110! The course is well organized and well taught, and after just a semester you can hold a (simple) conversation in French!",
    "The class is truly a crash course in the sense that you are engaged from the beginning of class and expected to adopt French shortly thereafter. However, the difficulty was definitely manageable, and the payoff was immense.",
    "If you are interested in taking french, this really is a great class! Supplement it with some outside work, like duolingo, before you take it."
