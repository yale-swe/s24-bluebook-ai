By the end of the course, you will have an adept understanding of Philosophy and its roots, as well as some skill in outlying your own philosophically sound arguments.",
                "Through this class, I learned an incredible breadth of philosophy by studying the writings of philosophers (pre and post-Christianity) that I would not have otherwise read. Reading and deconstructing philosophical writing from Plato and Aristotle to the Stoics and Skeptics, encouraged me to think critically and notice moves in argumentative writing."

Instead of being able to explore any single writing in-depth, we were only able to cover the fundamentals and get exposure to the writing. Either way, I was impressed with the level of specificity and depth that we were able to reach in the seminar although it did require lots of time spent outside of class to read, annotate, and understand the writing."

                "I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in philosophy or generally the humanities, but wanted to sample various schools of thought to discover what they might be most interested in. If you already know what you are passionate about, then it would be more rewarding to take a class that is geared towards that subject you can study thoroughly. However, this was a fun class, and rewarding to walk away with a general understanding of the philosophy schools and how they interact and understand the world."
