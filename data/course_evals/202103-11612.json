                "Further understanding of acting technique, specifically with Shakespearean text.   Also a better understanding of Shakespearean text analysis (including scansion), and familiarity with new parts of the Shakespearean cannon.",
                "This was the best course Ive ever taken at Yale and the most incredible acting experience Ive ever had. I learned how to employ strategies to best perform the shakespearean canon and I know for a fact my performance improved immensely this semester.",
                "This course...\r\n1. Gave me a better understanding of analyzing verse and Shakespeare acting at large.\r\n2. Gave me invaluable insight into Shakespeare directing by watching Bundy work.\r\n3. Encouraged me to trust in the language.\r\n4. Allowed me to cultivate my own spontaneity as an actor.\r\n5. Gave me more confidence as an actor.\r\n6. Forced me to be more vulnerable on stage and deliver better performances.",
                "Learned so much about how to read and perform Shakespeare texts. Gained so many acting skills that are usable throughout all realms of performance.",
                "This course gave me a clear understanding of what the craft of acting is, specifically when applied to Shakespearean texts. I learned exercises, theories, and perspectives that made me more effective at the academic and embodied practice of acting Shakespeare."

                "Strengths: EVERYTHING! Bundy is incredible and the assignments are well-suited for student learning.",
                "I like the structure of the course, starting with sonnets and working up to monologues and scenes.  I also really appreciate how much time is spent developing the character workshop, and the final public presentations are a fantastic way to end.  If I had to change something, I would devote more time to scene work or perhaps incorporate some group exercises to practice engaging with other people onstage.  That said, I think there's a lot of value in the masterclass format, and I feel I learned a lot from watching other people work and incorporate techniques.",
                "Strengths: AMAZING feedback. a great structure to the class and increasingly challenging projects\r\n\r\nthe ONLY weakness is that I wish we had the opportunity to give student feedback to each other.",
                "Bundy's direction is unbelievably helpful. Presenting work every week is hard but good for you. The character workshop project was one of the hardest things I've done as an actor, but I grew so much in the process. \r\n\r\nThe hardest part of the course is when you are not on stage. The course is four hours long each week and for most of the class you are quietly watching your classmates perform and be directed. This can feel boring, but if you pay attention to Bundy's direction and your classmate's performances, this can be the most revelatory part of the course.",
                "So many strengths. Exposed me to many Shakespeare texts that I had never heard of, let alone read before. Small class size allows you to have a nice supportive community. TA sessions once a week are really helpful for play and exploration. Bundy is very supportive and pushes you to grow. His lessons and feedback made me think about acting in a totally new way. Only weakness would be stress levels. It's hard not to feel that there is high pressure to be great, especially in the beginning since we go straight into working sessions after our audition. Had to keep reminding myself that this class is a rehearsal space and its okay to make mistakes, which Bundy and our TA did as well.",
                "Class is structured as a workshop where each student has one-on-one time to rehearse with the instructor. I learned a lot from this format because it allowed me to observe other students' work. Weekly tutorials with the TF enhanced my individual rehearsals and the homework was always directly relevant to our in-class work. The final project for the course tied together everything we learned and was academically, personally, and theatrically challenging and rewarding."

                "Absolutely.  This course was helpful to me as an actor in terms of pushing me out of my comfort zone and helping me grow, and was also very fun.",
                "TAKE THIS COURSE. BUNDY IS INCREDIBLE AND WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE. He showed me that O am worthy and brave and ready to take on the acting world. Every time we fell, he picked us back up and reminded us of our value as performers.",
                "Yes. This course is life changing.",
                "Yes, yes, yes. This course changed my life. I grew as an actor, as a theater practitioner, and as a scholar of Shakespeare. You must take this course!",
                "YES. If you want to be an actor, this course is a MUST TAKE. This was one of the most challenging and most rewarding experiences of my life. I grew so much as an actor and a person. The skills I learned in this class completely changed the way I approach a text. Bundy's support made me realize that I am capable of more than I think I am. If you want to take this class, be ready to put the work in. You get as much out of it as you put in, and the assignments (especially the final project), are a challenge, but also a lot of fun. The best class I have taken (and probably will take) at Yale. Cannot recommend this class enough.",
                "I cannot recommend this course enoughI grew as an actor, thinker, and person. James is a wonderful teacher and human and I always looked forward to class time, despite it being four hours on a Friday afternoon. I will really miss being in this class, it was one of the best I have taken at Yale."
