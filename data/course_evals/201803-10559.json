I got to hear their complaints about the art major. I got the chance to figure out my fit inside the school of art."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "the course could be improved by having someone else teach it",
    "While the workshops in critiquing each other's work was great, I believe the lectures lacked energy and would often drag on for too long (often resulting in class ending 10 to 15 minutes late). I feel that the class would benefit from class trips to museums or the art galleries, rather than having these lengthy discussions. I did enjoy the emulation project though at the end of the semester, because you get to immerse yourself in an established artist's practice, which can be rewarding and have implications on how you view your own art. The readings were well-selected and offered a large array of art theory.",
    "The course is well-paced and feels personal enough. The content is very interesting, although as a mandatory course it isn't perhaps the most engaging.",
    "The class had pretty poor discussion since unless you were a painter or on some occasions a photographer, it was hard to contribute anything.  The class was advertised for graphic design and computing and the arts students especially but we barely talked about anything design related.  Professor Weinberg would spend the first hour talking about painters that you could only add something meaningful to the discussion if you were familiar with the artists, which I often was not.  The class should become a lot more accessible to those who don't have a huge background in painting history especially since not everyone in that room is concentrating in it!  We spent only half of the two hour class actually talking about the readings, and even then I thought I understood the readings but often left the discussion with more questions then I had to begin with.",
    "The strengths are that we go through the readings in class and that the professor is very knowledgeable and interesting. You learn so much about different genres of art and how to develop as an art major yourself.",
    "great assignments and content. discussions were lackluster and mostly turned into lectures.",
    "I think the flow of the class could be improved. At times it felt like people weren't  paying attention or contributing at all. Sometimes the class felt more like a lecture than a seminar.",
    "I think classes were very one-sided, and moved very slowly. People in the class did not seem very engaged. There were some people who would frequently answer most questions, but I doubt that the rest of the class found the course engaging\/relevant enough (?)"

    "no this class blows",
    "If you are an art major you have to take this class or the one offered in the spring but I imagine the one in the spring will be more of the same.  I guess I would say take it in the fall so you can get it over with.",
    "I would recommend this course to another art major who wants to learn about how to express their artistic inspirations and intentions as well as how to be critiqued and emulate other artists.",
    "yes. the assignments were all super well crafted and interesting! jonathan is super smart and fun.  but sometimes the discussions kind of drag on and it just ends up being a lecture style class.  the energy of the class wasnt always high.",
    "I would encourage anyone who is considering the art major to take this class FIRST. There you will hear from classmates, hear their complaints: the lack of studio space, the extra fees, the little-to-no financial help, (especially for low-income students), etc. \r\n\r\nI would also recommend that someone considering the art major take the course first because if you don't like the class and what it teaches, it is likely you won't like anything from the school of art. The class is fairly representative of the ideological background of the department (it has to be as a survey course.)\r\n\r\nOne can do anything at Yale, or elsewhere for that matter. To do the major and the requirements you have to jump through all the hoops. If those hoops are not for you (and I believe the art major's hoops are not for most aspiring creative visual thinkers), then don't stick with it. Escape."
