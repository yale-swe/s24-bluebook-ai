The weakness may be the amount of work; while entirely doable, it left some readings off the side. A strength is also Professor Andrews. She is an amazing professor!",

The discussions are also excellent. I would 100% recommend it. The readings and the class also introduce topics, terms, and ideas in Indigenous Studies in a very palatable manner.",

                "Yes! This ought to be a mandatory class for all Yale students. As a non-Indigenous person, this seminar has been one of the most generative and important classes I've taken. This class has such a broad range and deep focus on anticolonial theory and Indigenous feminisms. Indigeneity is excluded at all levels of academia and at Yale, and this seminar is urgently needed. This class implicates and challenges everything really, from psychology to biology to political science. It challenges the ways that we imagine academic fields (like the hard sciences) as apolitical and divorced from settler colonialism, empire, and racial capitalism. I also really appreciated this class because it talks about practice, too. Theory and practice. All of it is discussed, explored, and felt in this seminar."
