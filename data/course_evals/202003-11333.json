                "Thank you for shortening the problem sets towards the end that was VERY helpful",
                "I thought it was a great course overall, there was just a ton of work in the beginning. The professors did not originally realize how much work was being assigned with the virtual format. The problem was fixed in the second half of the course. I thought the material was all taught very well.",
                "Strengths: very well organized and clear\r\nWeaknesses: workload at the beginning was overwhelming, although this was adjusted later in the course",
                "Sometimes prerecorded lectures were a lot to watch and felt very long. Study groups worked somewhat well.",
                "The course felt rushed at times because a lot of material was being covered in a short timespan. Workload was excessive at certain points. Some weeks it was as if there were 4 class sessions a week because the pre-recorded lectures took up a lot of time and, even though the live class sessions were meant to be \"interactive\" and \"answer questions\", more often than not, they introduced new material. Finally, the bonus question - in addition to a long, demanding weekly problem set - felt unnecessary.",
                "It was a very long and intensive course with Three weekly meetings and 2 pre-recorded lectures.",
                "I thought the asynchronous videos were very informative and I enjoyed working with my study group on the p-sets. The workload was definitely way to heavy in the first half of the course, but I appreciated how receptive the professors were to our mid-semester feedback and adjusted everything (i.e. less videos per week, shifting around p-set due dates, etc.) to accommodate the circumstances in the second half of the semester.",
                "The course material was challenging but not too difficult. There was a lot of work at times, but the professors listened to our feedback and corrected it accordingly. The study halls were pretty helpful in allowing students to collaboratively work on PSETs.",
                "The first half of the semester was a lot of work but the instructors took student feedback into account and lessened the burden. The class is well taught but the material can get difficult. The derivations are often unclear in lecture yet the problem sets and exams require a solid understanding of them.",
                "Strength: very structured (both content and assignment), grading is pretty straight forward (can be good or bad I guess), \r\n\r\nWeakness: lots of work (so it's hard to enjoy unless you are actually invested in the content)",
                "Strengths: The professors adapted well to the midterm feedback survey which was very helpful. The class was adapted well for virtual learning with both in person and virtual lectures. Response time on piazza was quick.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of new material was covered in the in-person lectures when they were advertised as more of review sessions. More time could be spent on synthesis of the material rather than adding on material in the in person lectures.",
                "It was really confusing having one professor teach modules 1 and 3 and the other professor teaching module 2. I think it would have been much better if there was either one professor or if one professor taught the first half of the course and the other teaching the other half. Two professor switches is too many.",
                "Course was well versed, wished that there was not as much a workload as there was.",
                "The organization of ECON 122 with weekly pre-recorded lectures, Monday synchronous lectures and Wednesday study group sessions was an effective adjustment to the difficulties of online learning. The professor's communication and responsiveness to student concerns was excellent. After student concerns were raised about the length\/scope of the weekly pre-recorded lectures (2 lectures of 1-1.5 hours every week), the professors scaled this back and covered more material in our Monday synchronous lectures. Using Piazza, student questions about course material were answered daily. \r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by including more interactive polls, as when these were used they were very helpful to maintaining engagement.",
                "Strengths: Highly structured course. Multiple ways for students to learn the material - live lectures, watching recordings, simply reading slides, etc. Large support staff of TFs and peer tutors.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Problem set design felt quite weak - questions were frequently ambiguous, leaving students with no option but to simply copy down whatever the TF said was on the answer sheet. One or two instances of the answer sheet simply being wrong.",

The overall structure with pre-recorded lectures in addition to live lectures was an interesting combination. I did not gain much from my group work session that replaced a live lecture. I would have preferred two live lectures instead of a pre-recorded and one live with a group study day",
                "Strength: I really liked the fact that we could work on the pset with group members on certain days of the week\r\nWeakness: pre-recorded lectures to watch over the weekend was not the way to go and I wish we had psets due every other week rather than every week.",
                "Strengths - incredibly well run, great lectures, lots of engagement\r\nWeaknesses - was a bit overwhelming at points but became a lot more manageable post-midterm",
                "The workload of the first half of the course was too high and unmanageable but after the mid-semester feedback the instructors adjusted the class and it was much more manageable. \r\nIn general, they were very responsive to feedback and maintained a very high level class, even though it was online.",
                "Strengths: reasonable psets, productive sections + OH, and very fun bonus questions each week on extensions of topics we discussed in class. In class lectures often included in-class participation like polls, which I found engaging. I also found the course structure itself to be beneficial this semester; Monday lectures were very helpful reviews and practice of material in the previous week's pre-recorded lectures, and I got along very well with the study group I was paired with, so having time built in on Wednesdays to meet with them and also ask TFs and the instructors questions was awesome. Since the psets were relatively short, I felt that this modified course structure did not significantly impact the courseload negatively. Additionally, the Professors and TFs were very responsive and open to feedback.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not many practice materials since this was the Professors' first time teaching this class, which made studying for the midterm and final a bit stressful. Some students claimed that having 2 full pre-recorded lectures made the workload too high, so the Professors reduced the length of psets and switched from 2 to just 1 prerecorded lecture each week (which involved cutting some material). Some probably see this as an upside, but I was really enjoying the class, and also enjoyed having longer psets as good practice for assessments - tbh I felt that the original workload was comparable to that of similar level econ classes. Of course, I do still appreciate how receptive both Professors were. And, fortunately both exams were very reasonable.",
                "Strengths: very organized, built in a way where I was able to take the information previously learned and use it to understand the new concepts\r\nWeakness: switching between two professors was a bit rough, not many weaknesses about the course itself, the course load was way too heavy initially (it  helped solidify my understanding of the concepts but it was a bit too much material. However, this was corrected after the midterm feedback which I really appreciated), wish there were more practice problems to help prepare for the exams",
                "The psets were very hard at the beginning of the course. This was improved later on but definitely would have been better if they were not as hard from the start. There were also no practice tests! This made it extremely hard to prepare for the exam, as anything could take you by surprise. The grading in the tests was also very punitive (no partial credit) but that's expected when they need to meet the Econ department curve. The exams were also very long and hard.",
                "The course changed dramatically for the better after the instructors received the midterm feedback. Initially, the ~two hours of asyncrhoneos video instruction, bonus question, and PSET, were simply too much work to have outside of class. The bonus questions grew on me, they were a great way to further understanding of the material in a real world context. Frankly, I would consider them a strength. The psets were pretty much your basic econ class psets, nothing special some challenging problems, but there were plenty of office hours and the like. The Monday lectures were quite effective at distilling the material, and this class was the first one to use Zoom polls effectively, so credit to the instructor. The biggest weakness of the course were the Wednesday study groups. In short, each Wednesday students were put into groups to go over the PSET and bonus question w the same students all semester, and the instructors received positive feedback. Few notes here, first the attendance, even in the beginning, hovered around half and dropped. This was because different students had done different amounts of the PSET etc which made group work less effective. Next, the positive feedback is correlated with a small vocal minority of the students who enjoyed the study groups, and had selection bias. If the majority of the class doesn't go, there response speaks louder than the mid semester feedback which was filled out by a minority of students who did enjoy it. It just wound up being a dead 1:15 that could have been used for further instruction or clarification of the material. The actual teaching in the course was phenomenal, I just wish there had been more of it live.",
                "Strengths: Ilse and Marnix were fantastic lecturers. The slides were very good.  The first half the course there was an absurd amount fo work, but when students expressed this in mid-semester feedback, they reduced it greatly which I really appreciated.  They talked about COVID and modern-day issues which made it more interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the first half of the class, there was so much work.  Also, they didn't give out any practice midterm\/final questions or from previous years which made studying difficult.",
                "No big weaknesses. Class is conducive to student learning.",
                "I didnt like that most students had their cameras off and did not engage much during the live lectures it made me do the same and sometimes made me distracted but this was the case for many Zoom courses, not necessarily this one alone... could be improved by making students turn on cameras. Marnix and Ilse also seemed to have some tension in the way each wanted to teach the course, which wasnt ideal at times.",
                "The pre-recorded lecture we had to watch before in-person lecture was an organized structure for learning. However, often times, the pre-recorded lectures would take hours and hours to get through because of the density of the material. I think this can be improved if new information and its application were explained thoroughly in the pre-recorded videos, specifically, WHY we want to model it or why we even care. That was the most difficult aspect about learning the new models for me because I often times did not know what aspects about a model were important or why we even cared to learn about it in application to real world data and trends. I also though in the first part of the semester, the Psets and bonus questions were a ridiculous amount of work. I appreciate that the Professors were receptive to this feedback and adjusted their syllabus.",
                "I think that this course was a lot of work. I think that it was difficult to prepare for exams because there were no practice questions or any guidance for what to expect",
                "The course does all it can to help you understand what's being taught. Between pre-recorded lectures, in-class lectures, and office hours, there are a bunch of learning opportunities. With that being said, prior to the changes halfway through the course, the workload was a bit much. The recorded lectures and problem sets and bonus questions were a lot to handle in addition to the class.",
                "S - I have to praise the fact that the Profs and TFs clearly put in a lot of effort to organise the course in the more effective manner, with lots of support provided and well structure classes and sections. If things were unclear, you only had to look back at the lectures notes or ask a question over piazza.\r\nW - The only criticism I can really make is that there were no practice exams for the midterm and final, but I understand nothing could be done about that.",
                "Lots of work before midterm, but tried to adjust well after. Could keep a single professor--the switch in teaching styles was confusing. Prof. Ilse was great at quantitative approaches and explaining the logic of it but Prof. Marnix preferred a looser approach and consistency would have helped learning.",
                "Strengths: Instructors were extremely accessible and the Teaching Fellows were extremely knowledgeable about the subject. Syllabus clearly outlined expectations. Difficulty of exams was reasonable and problem set when reduced were also informative and helpful. \r\nWeaknesses: Some teaching fellows were hesitant to help, feeling that they would give too much information on solving the problem, when actually there wasn't. Secondly, Instructors could have improved technical difficulties to facilitate learning.",
                "Lots of support and ways to get help! Psets being shorter later in the semester were much better to facilitate learning yet not being so crushing time-wise. Material was interesting and instructors found ways to make them applicable to the pandemic which was cool to see.",
                "Strengths: knowledgeable TAs, well organized sections\r\nWeaknesses: pre-recorded lectures+two live sessions far exceeded standard class hours. the length of pre-recorded lectures was absolutely ridiculous. pacing was awful in pre-recorded videos. while it's evident that the professors cared about the course and students, the lack of experience teaching a general undergraduate economic course was evident. bonus questions + psets combo was unreasonable pre-midterm.",
                "I think the setup of the course with the live and recorded lectures and group work was effective given the circumstances. More resources for help with the math throughout the semester would have been helpful",
                "Strengths: both professors were very accomodating and took in feedback from the midsemester. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish sections were also recorded",
                "I believe that this course was taught well",
                "Way too much work. Most work of any class",
                "The strengths was the professor, Marnix Armand. He did a very good job explaining his material and the means to get to answers. He also explains things economically in comparison to the real world. I loved learning from him and his slides were always very effective. The weaknesses of this course was the set up of the class itself. I felt like I was learning an absurd amount of material, but we were always moving so quickly that some of it got lost in the middle. The jumping around from professors and their different teaching styles, as long with the pre-recorded lectures that were just re-explained in the live lectures almost carbon copy. I took another class that just did live lectures and moved at a slower pace, and that felt much more comfortable. This subject matter is just extremely difficult to teach through zoom, and I felt I greatly struggled from not being able to go to office hours in person to find people to aid me with my work.",
                "The Wednesday lecture was transformed into a group study session during which we could ask questions about the pset and collaborate on a bonus question assigned for each week. This was very helpful as it provided a space for us to clarify any issues we had with the material and expand our understanding of the material.",
                "The class tended to give way may more than was necessary. Pre recoded lectures, bonus questions that were not really bonus but were required, etc. I liked how the professors incorporated changes throughout the semester, but it was still quite tough doing this course virtually.",
                "A weakness was that expectations of students were not always clearly communicated. A strength was that professors were very knowledgeable.",
                "Marnix and Ilse! Very responsive of feedback!",
                "I liked the test formats, however the problem sets got to be tedious over the course of the year. Wouldve like some more variation in the homework assignments.",
                "The course emphasized understanding over memorization. There was, however, a pretty heavy workload.",
                "It was very well structured and it was very clear where the course and material was headed. The problem sets were reasonable and the exams were fair. The support outside of lecture hours for problem sets and other concerns was excellent. The \"in the news\" section of class, though not too organized, were useful to see how concepts fitted to real world issues.",
                "I would have liked to have more practice available before a final or midterm, so I would know what I needed to study.",
                "Sometimes the workload was a lot to tackle and could make things hard. Otherwise really liked the class. Recording lectures is a must going forward I think. If there's one thing that needs to stay for this class going forward it's recorded lectures. They also arranged study groups that worked out really well.",
                "Strengths: the instructors were adaptable to student feedback, having prerecorded lectures actually worked really well to introduce material in a way that could be slowed down or sped up as needed. Having quizzes in class on the lectures then provided a great way to recall the material and apply it in new and often challenging ways. Study groups were also very helpful for understanding and working through the problem sets.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes it felt that in person class went over the exact same ground as the pre-recorded lectures without extending the material too much (or adding new stuff).",
                "Strengths: lectures were clear, I really liked the study groups on Wednesdays and the professors were very receptive to feedback",
                "Strength: professors willing to listen to students. Weakness: material can be very overwhelming, as some weeks would be relatively easy to understand, while others would cover many new concepts and topics within a lecture."

                "The study groups were wonderful",
                "I liked the asynchronous mixed with synchronous, except for the fact that it led to the class having a significantly larger amount of work in terms of the necessary videos to watch for class. I think the format should stay the same, but make it more manageable.",
                "Succeeded: Lots of office hours and TA sessions that were virtual\r\nCould be improved: the Q&A sessions were hard to miss because of the polling",
                "Appreciated combination of pre-recorded and live lectures. Also really appreciated weekly study group sessions. These strategies all served to maximize engagement, or create as much engagement as possible in a large virtual Zoom lecture class.",
                "I thought helping us create study groups enhanced my learning experience in the class. I enjoyed working in my group and hearing how my peers approached certain problems was interesting. One thing to be wary of is that when we have asynchronous videos to watch, they take up a substantial amount of time outside of class time, so I think they could have been shorter.",
                "I really liked having both pre-recorded and live lectures to watch! Being able to take my time learning the material with pre-recorded content was terrific, and then the live lectures helped review the concepts. I also really appreciated the weekly group work-time, during which we could work on psets with groups - it was a nice way to interact with fellow students in the virtual world.",
                "Prerecorded lectures: some of these got really long and the in class material then got fairly repetitive. There are indeed some concepts that need to be gone over twice, but if the prerecorded lectures were cut down, the in-class lectures would be less repetitive.\r\n\r\nStudy halls: these were helpful and I enjoyed working with my fellow classmates.",
                "Having live lectures in addition to prerecorded lectures helped for engagement and allowed opportunity for questions to be asked. There were, however four lectures\/class sessions a week not including section which was overwhelming at times and more class time than a usual semester of macroeconomics.",
                "This class does an amazing job of using the pandemic to strengthen an active-learning classroom by integrating weekly study groups to answer any problem set questions and bonus questions.",
                "ECON 122 met Mondays and Wednesdays. The class effectively adjusted to the COVID-19 pandemic and online learning by using Mondays as synchronous lectures and Wednesdays as study group sessions. In the first half of the semester the length and detail of the weekly pre-recorded lectures resulted in the class being significantly more work than the previous economics courses I had taken at Yale. After student concerns were raised, however, this workload was reduced to better reflect the workload of pre-COVID 19 economics classes.\r\n\r\nThe Wednesday study group sessions were very helpful for me, but from what I understand different groups had different levels of student participation.\r\n\r\nInteractive polls were infrequently used, but good for maintaining engagement.",
                "Really liked this flipped classroom. Would prefer if the in-person component was less pure repetition of the lecture because it felt pointless going to in-person sometimes",
                "To me, the assigned study groups and reviews on Mondays w\/ extra exercises were very engaging.",
                "Given the circumstances, I really enjoyed the variety\/mix of different activities for the class. I liked having meetings with the groups to discuss problem sets  once a week instead of having two virtual lectures a week. Given the circumstances, I really enjoyed the variety\/mix of different activities for the class. I liked how the bonus questions were less calculation based (compared to the psets) and how well they related to real-life issues and gave room for discussion. I enjoyed having poll questions in lecture and having Piazza available for asking questions.",
                "I loved having Wednesday class be for study groups. Being virtual means that there's virtually no chance to make friends and work on psets with other people, so the study groups helped me immensely in that aspect. It also meant that I could get some work done a few days prior to the pset's due date.",
                "Asynchroneous lectures were good, section was good, Monday interaction lecture was good, Wednesday groupwork was bad",
                "The lectures succeeded.  The study groups were a miss for me but some other students may have liked them.",

This was extremely hard to keep up with during online semester, and a global pandemic. The professors' flexibility and accommodations to student feedback was very appreciated.",

                "I enjoyed the Wednesday breakout room session because it gave us a chance to work on homework and collaborate, but once again it was hard to focus with such a large group of people.",
                "I thought the pre-recorded lectures paired with the live lectures was a good system, as well as sections at the end of the week to make sure everything was crystal clear. The Wednesday lectures to work on psets was also a good idea and was very helpful. \r\n\r\nWell done to the course instructors!",
                "The pre-recorded lecture then discussion during class was good. It would have helped to keep the pre-recorded lectures short though as they were added scheduled hours we had to dedicate to the class without any changes to all other scheduled times. Maybe keep them to 1hr(which they said they would do but literally never did). This class was super stressful for COVID times, and the profs weren't that considerate.",

                "The professors did a very good job when it came to virtual learning. They also lowered the workload halfway through the semester in response to student concerns, which was necessary and appreciated. Breakout rooms were great. Also the polls were super helpful for learning!",
                "Strengths: recording of live sessions and variety of OH\/Sections offered\r\nWeaknesses: unreasonable pre-recorded lecture length, only one midterm (way too much dependent on this exam), overall course design not conducive to online learning, strict adherence to standard econ curve",
                "The virtual study groups every Wednesday were especially helpful.",
                "Considering the circumstances of this semester I thought the setup of the course was effective. If you watched the prerecorded lectures beforehand, the Monday live lecture was helpful for clarifications of concepts and the Wednesday group work for getting to work on the problem set and discussing confusing concepts. It was especially nice to be able to call in instructors to the small groups and ask clarifying questions in a smaller setting.",
                "Professors were very very accomodating and serious about implementing student feedback, which was much appreciated! The pre-recorded lectures and psets became shorter after the midterm, and the professors got more realistic expectations about students level of participation considering COVID-19 pandemic.",

The recordings were useful and the slides posted on Canvas were of great help as well. The use of polls and other zoom tools helped to make online lecture more engaging. Sometimes however, the videos posted to replace Wednesday lectures exceeded normal lecture time, which could prove to be tedious at times. Otherwise, this course was probably one of the better adapted courses at Yale.",

Economics is not my strong suit, but the professors did a very good job of keeping the workload and the difficulty of the material manageable. Their communication with students was also excellent, which saved me a lot of unnecessary stress.",

                "Yes, great class",
                "Absolutely, macro is so cool! Especially if you took AP Macro but not Econ 116, you'll definitely learn a ton of cool new models (Solow-Romer was new to me) and get a slightly more rigorous perspective on models you've likely seen before (like building up AS-AD). The course this semester was well-structured for learning, and there weren't any curveballs in terms of some weeks having much higher workloads than others. I loved the material, the course structure, Ilse and Marnix, and all of the TFs!\r\nAlso, I remember reading previous course reviews of Econ 122 and seeing complaints about there being \"too much math\" or something, but that was not the case at all. If you come into the class with an open mindset, you'll find that the math you do in this class can be incredibly rewarding and provide a lot of additional insights into the models we discussed (ex. comparative statics!). If you come into the class instead with the mindset that you have to repeat intro macro with \"extra pointless math,\" then you'll probably get out of the course what you expect. So come in with a growth mindset!",

                "Yes.  I actually didn't need to take this class for my major and just did because I like econ and I would do that again if could go back in time.  If you are interested in economics, this class gives you such a better understanding of monetary policy, labor markets, and what supply and demand shocks do to the economy.  Would recommend. Probably should like\/not completely loath math tho.",

                "It's a core for Economics, therefore, you have to take it. I enjoyed the course overall. It was very interesting learning about different data trends and the applicable models. I liked how real world news and trends were implemented into the course.",

                "Yes! Economics influences just about everything and this course gives you the skills to understand the core concepts in economics, to then be able to apply them to the real world.",
                "Yes",
                "Not unless you have to take it",
                "In a normal year yes, but with covid it was extremely difficult. I felt myself always on my back foot.",
                "Yes, but only if they are trying to major in an economics related major.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, if you want to be an economic major this class is obviously required, however it also provides students with a solid stepping stone toward becoming more advanced economists.",
                "Yes, if one is interested in applying economic principles to the real world.",
                "This is a very good course and the professors do a good job of making online lectures engaging. I would recommend this course to any student who wishes to learn more about macroeconomic models and how to solve them mathematically. This course also helps to develop good intuition about the economic effects of specific events.",
                "This course is an excellent follow-up to Intro to Macroeconomics as it expands upon ideas and subjects discussed in that class. This class is definitely more numbers-oriented, so if you have trouble with calculus it might be a bit more challenging. However, the TFs were helpful whenever any of us struggled with the math.",
                "Yes. Great course that focuses on developing economic intuition which made it interesting",
                "If you want to dig more into macro and have an interest in theory take this class! If youre an Econ major and have to take it, it is one of my favorite of the required sequence so far.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student because you get a better understand of macroeconomics and the forces that affect macroeconomics",
                "The workload can be a lot and overwhelming, but this is a requirement - and overall a fine course, so would recommend taking."
