The course concluded with a framework for understanding intermediate goods trade through input-output linkages and a discussion about how the COVID-19 pandemic affect international trade in the past year.",

                "Yes, I highly recommend this course. International Trade is fundamental to the field of economics; it was humans' first economic activity millennia before we had the discipline of Economics! The course is very manageable, and you learn a lot about General Equilibrium trade models. The course helps you get comfortable with fixed-effects estimation which is one of the most important techniques in econometric panel data analysis. The exams are fair, and the three problem sets are very well planned-out by Prof. Noguera.",
