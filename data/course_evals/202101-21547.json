These topics included hausdorf dimension, general measure theory/sigma-algebras, as well as some ergodic systems and the heat equation. Throughout the course I rarely felt that I fully understood a topic after lecture, this is no fault of Minsky, he is wonderfully clear, but rather just that this material is difficult but very fundamental and necessary if you want to truly start to understand the importance of analysis.

            "comments": [
                "The lectures are clear, and the office hours (both from Minsky and the TAs) are helpful.  It seems like they all really care about the class and want the students to understand the math.  My only suggestion would be to switch from two days a week to three, as absorbing 75 minutes of new math in one sitting can be difficult, and it's often easier over more shorter periods.",
                "Strengths: this is an absolutely incredible class. It starts with Professor Minsky. He is so dedicated in teaching his students. He always responds on the Ed very quickly, and he is always seeking feedback. Furthermore, he held two office hours every week where he answered all of our questions. In class, he blends the perfect amount of rigor in the beautiful subject of measure theory, while also giving us a fair amount of intuition, problem-solving strategies, and examples. He is an extremely clear lecturer and has great handwriting on the iPad. Furthermore, his problem sets will challenge you to the brink. However, every problem reinforces learning and feels great to solve. Weaknesses: Not many. Maybe a minor tweak is to spend more time on general measure theory because it felt a little rushed. Another thing is the textbook Beals. I understand that the course follows chapters 10, 11, 12, and 13 pretty closely before going off to do other things. However, it might be worth looking for another textbook. Beals has a lot of errors. Also, many of the proofs in Beals aren't actually all written out, so it was a little annoying if I was confused by something in class. Furthermore, a textbook for Caratheodory/Hahn-Kolmogorov would be extremely useful.",
                "Strengths: Professor Minsky! Professor Minsky is an amazing lecturer who explains everything clearly (and with lots of pictures). He is also very approachable and helpful in office hours. The class was also extremely well-organized, so it was easy to follow the progression of topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The homework grading was a bit...pedantic at the beginning of the class, but got better towards the end.",
                "Strengths: excellent lecturer\r\nWeaknesses: harsh problem set grading",
                "The biggest weakness of this course was the combination of grading and psets. Psets were very tricky and required you to \"get in the weeds\" very often, i.e. work out small details and edge cases for pages on end. Grading was insanely anal  graders would take off 1/3-1/2 of the points for a question if you missed even one of those details/edge cases (e.g. if you forgot to check that certain functions are measurable, a fairly easy task, you might get 3/5 points for that question). The instructor also failed to fix this until around 3/4 of the way through the course, which is disappointing since the students were giving him overwhelming feedback about their experience with grading pretty early on. However, lectures were well done and the exams were doable.",
                "This course strengthened my mathematical thinking immeasurably. The material was beautiful and useful. Everything was explained with clarity and vision. I truly can't think of any weaknesses (it was a fair bit of work at times, but this wasn't a weakness, it was a strength; we had all the support we needed, and every single pset/exam problem was valuable). Towards the end of the course I struggled to maintain my attention span during long proofs in live Zoom lectures, but this was just Zoom fatigue, and not the course's fault.",
                "Good psets, difficult but engaging",
                "Strengths: Minsky is a great lecturer and, lest the importance of this be forgotten, has very clear handwriting. His office hours are also incredibly helpful, and I definitely recommend going to them.  The course hews pretty tightly to the textbook (Analysis, by Beals), which made reviewing the material much easier as compared to other courses. The material is difficult, but you get some pretty cool results out of it, too. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: at least one proof per pset was super tedious, and the class in general takes up a lot of time. If you're willing to dedicate a good chunk of your attention this semester to the class, it's not bad, but it's not a class you can just skim.",
                "This class was awesome. Lectures were great, and very engaging. Problem sets were *hard*. Very heard and very time consuming. But, after each problem set, I felt like I really, truly understood the material well. I really don't have much to say here. The class was fantastic in almost every way.\r\n\r\nThe one thing to say is that the graders were real pricks sometimes. They really seemed to enjoy taking off points.",
                "One of the strengths of the course was Professor Minsky. He is really good at teaching, is super organized and passionate, and also dedicates a lot of time to office hours to ensure that we can get any questions we need answered, both about the homework and about the material. The homework is a very central part of this class, although this may be a weakness; the homework often took 2-3 full days each week to complete, and without dedicating that much time to homework I found it impossible to actually absorb the material at all. The material is challenging and a lot of the proofs are hard to wrap your head around - I had a lot of times where I felt completely overwhelmed and lost, and the only way to do something about it was to dedicate many many many hours to wrestle with the problems on the homework and come to terms with the material.",
                "strengths: \r\n- Minsky is amazing and deeply knowledgeable. He loves math and it really shows in his teaching. I found his lectures to be at a good pace, although it did seem like a couple of the students were asking questions way ahead of the material that made it a bit harder to follow. Minsky also hosted a generous amount of OH to help discuss the weekly homework assignments. I learned a ton in this course and really appreciated how engaged Minsky was in the course\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- the workload is very high. There are weekly problem sets and each one would take me 15-20 hours, and only because I was able to greatly speed up the process by going to 4 hours of OH a week. I also felt very intimidated by how naturally everyone could understand the material. Relatedly, both the lectures and OH are dominated by the people who already have a deep understanding of the material, which honestly makes it pretty difficult for those of us for whom the material doesn't immediately click",
                "Strengths: Professor Minsky is amazing, I highly recommend any math student to make room for his class in their schedule. The material was presented in a very organized, cumulative way, and the expectations for proof writing followed. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not really a weakness, but I'd say if you take the class, be prepared for it to be one of/your highest workload class. The psets and material take a while to wrap your head around.",
                "Strengths: Professor Minsky's engaging and well-organized lectures contributed to my excitement about the course material [he added polls to assess student understanding, short videos to provide an introduction to course concepts, and answered questions throughout class]. However, the real star of this course was our Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) Richard. Although it is easy to feel inadequate or overwhelmed in an upper-level math course, Richard went out of his way to clarify concepts in a way that was welcoming rather than belittling [unlike some of the other office hours]. I do not know how I would have made it through this course had it not been for Richard's patience and willingness to talk through concepts in a way that solidified my understanding. :)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Minsky assigns too much work for a class that has weekly problem sets. I do not mind 20+ hour homework assignments when students are given adequate time to complete them, but expecting us to finish a **20/30+ hour problem set** in a week's time is simply inconsiderate. I have taken other difficult courses at Yale (MATH 350, CPSC 223), but none of them hit me as hard as this one. My mental health was greatly affected [as what that of many of my classmates to whom I spoke] and Professor Minsky made little effort to adjust his course in response to student concerns. Professor Minsky moves *so* fast that there is never any chancebesides the homeworkto review what you have learned or internalize the material. I have never suffered to this degree mentally due to a course. Whatever you think the workload of this course may be, double that. I am not sure if it is worth the semester-long mental suffering.",
                "Prof. Minsky is great. He teaches the material very well. He always makes sure to interact with the students despite it being a large class which is nice. In terms of material, I wish we spent less time on measure theory and more time on fourier series. I wish we had stuck with things related to fourier series until the end as opposed to switching back to measure theory. As it is now it is still a wonderful class.",
                "There was way too much content crammed into each lecture, with little time left for me to digest before doing the psets. Office hours are relatively unstructured, though both TFs were well-qualified and friendly. I stopped attending live lectures because it was too difficult to keep up with. The graders were incredibly harsh, especially towards the beginning of the semester.",
                "I think the lectures were good and informative, and in general very helpful for understanding the topics. I found the most frustrating aspect of the course to be the grading. Often times myself and other people in the class I spoke to would fully understand the topics but be marked off considerable points on problem sets and exams for minute details when the understanding of proofs were fully there.",
                "Strengths: very linear in terms if how the content build upon itself, lots of support systems and office hours, good at teaching math skills as opposed to just content, etc. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes a bit nit picky, the details of all the proofs were nice to see, but might be omitted for clarity.",
                "Professor Minsky is excellent and really cares about the success of his students. The material is really interesting,  Minsky's lectures are (for the most part) clear, and exams are fair. However, the course is a LOT of work. The problem sets easily took me 20 hours per week.",
                "Professor Minsky is fantastic, teaches really well and clearly cares a lot. Workload was reasonable and grading was really fair.",
                "Strength - Professor Minsky, he is easily one of the clearest and insight math lectures in the department. He really works hard before diving into a proof to make sure people understand the idea in order that the dont get lost in the technical details and can actually see what the math is saying. Also the ULAs are goated for this course, specifically Richard. Richards office hours from 7-9 on Fridays were the only place to be on a Friday night. Weaknesses - after the first 1-2 weeks I dont think there are any weaknesses with this course, the only initial one was getting used to the background knowledge needed for this course/the rigor of psets. Coming from 230 this course was a good leap in rigor and in the first few weeks there was a bit of extra material I had to catch up on. However Minsky really made this transition as nice as possible be providing readings and extra pre-lecture videos on topics people might not know! Also sometimes the psets could take 20+ hours of work and one problem could be 5 pages typed. This isnt a weakness per se but some weekends it was annoying and the motivation to finish a 5 page problem became extremely low.",
                "Strengths: good lectures and helpful office hours\r\nWeaknesses: challenging homework with nitpicky grading and strict deadlines made the course very overwhelming at times",
                "The psets were a ton of work. Lectures moved a little too fast for me at times. Office hours were all very helpful.",
                "The difficulty of the course was a shock at first but proved to make it extremely engaging and worthwhile.",
                "I mean I spent 90% of my time doing this class super confused and the other 10% wondering why I'm still not confused yet. The office hours were elite. Thank you professor and TAs for those.",
                "The material was very well taught. Everything was clearly structured.",
                "I would be hard-pressed to discuss the strengths of the course without mentioning Prof. Minsky and the efforts he undertook to make this course as great as it was. The course certainly is thorough in discussing the material and covers foundational concepts in real analysis, but I think that's really where the strengths of the course itself stops and the strength that is Prof. Minsky begins. Prof. Minsky is fantastic at explaining the material. His lectures are clear and concise. He makes an effort to address each student's questions and concerns, whether that about the material or the course itself. But most importantly, he fosters an environment that is conducive toward learning. He really places an emphasis on learning the material and works so that students's learning isn't impeded. As a result, students were willing to participate in class and in discussion during office hours by sharing ideas and asking questions. \r\n\r\nThe only \"weakness\" that I can think of is that in the beginning, the grading was somewhat strict. As a result, I, and from what I've heard and seen, other students, were spending a considerable amount of time writing up our problem sets (with actually solving the problem sets taking up only a smaller portion of that time)."

                "I really appreciated the recorded lectures and towards the end of the semester, recorded office hours with Prof Minsky. I think office hours often felt like a waste of time because they were unstructured. I think TFs could have offered a review of each week's lectures before addressing questions about the psets. I think the short videos posted by Professor Minsky were helpful at first to freshen up our memories of background information or get a sampler for the coming content, but they soon became too long and turned into mini-lectures themselves.",
                "Some office hours were recorded and this was helpful.",
                "This course was great over zoom. An iPad was used as a white board and lectures were recorded and posted with notes. This was great because it gave students the option to rewatch lectures as well as reference the class notes. I believe I watched every lecture twice, this was a huge advantage and I hope Yale records courses in the future.",

                "I would, but be prepared for the workload.  It's a great course with a great prof and very cool material, and of course it's a must for math majors.  The psets do take a very long time, however, so be prepared to spend several days writing them and then to reread and revise them also (yes, I really do mean you should be combing through your psets revising them for little things and readability before turning them in each week).  If you put in the work, you will come out with a very solid understanding of the material.",
                "I would recommend to those who might need some relevant knowledge in the future, e.g. PhD in math or some other subjects.",
                "Sometimes, I think this semester has gone by super quickly; then, I just look at all of my psets and recall the long weekends spent on every single one. Nevertheless, this class is absolutely incredible. You learn so much from a fantastic instructor, and your real analysis skills will most certainly improve. Best class I have taken at Yale so far. However, be warned: this class is a lot of work. I'm lucky I was at my house so that I didn't have a social life to give up. I think I went to bed most of the week thinking about a problem on the pset, or just in general thinking about something from this class. Every class is jam-packed, so you really need to take time after to digest everything. Also, start early on the psets; they are usually long, and there are always one or two problems that you will need to use every ounce of brain strength to understand and tackle. If you want to take this class, make sure you actually enjoy analysis and have the time to let it take over your brain for a semester.",
                "If you're interested in the material and are willing to put in a lot of work, yes. Prof Minsky is one of the best math professors I've ever had at Yale in terms of lecturing. His notes are always clear, his lectures are pretty organized, and he explains concepts clearly. However, the weekly problem sets took so much time to complete, partially because the level of rigor expected in our proofs was so that I was having to prove every single minute detail in fear of having lots of points taken off for minor errors. The problems quickly stopped being intellectually interesting and started being an exercise in proving out as many steps as possible in excruciating detail. This class, this year, with these graders, felt like a much higher workload than either Math 230 or 231. The ULAs and office hours were extremely helpful for problem sets and for some of the problems I'm not sure what I would have done without them. I'm glad that I took this class because the material (Lebesgue integration and its applications/extensions) is essential for my field of study, but I can say without much hesitation that this class was the most stressful class that I've ever taken at Yale, and caused me immense loss of sleep.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend taking this course with Professor Minsky if possible! He clearly went out of his way to try and make this course the best experience possible, especially given the circumstances. He took time to film extra \"mini topic videos\" which he posted to canvas, *in addition* to preparing lecture and posting the annotated notes. The structure of this course was conducive to really improving your proof skills and receiving constructive feedback. I hope I'm able to take another class with Professor Minsky in the future; he genuinely cares about students' experience and well-being.",
                "Absolutely, especially if Professor Minsky is teaching.",
                "Definitely the toughest course I've taken at Yale, but also I feel like I've learned a lot.  Make sure to attend Prof. Minsky's OH.",
                "Yes, if you're a masochist. The psets might cause you physical pain  they are always long and often terrible. However, you get to learn some measure theory!",
                "This was the best math course I've taken so far (rivaled only by 350 with Miki), and maybe the best course I've taken at Yale. Who knows if Minsky will teach it again (as with most math courses, a lot comes down to the professor), but if he does, it's a no-brainer. I would even take it again;I'm sure I'd get as much out of it the second time as I did the first. Everything was presented very carefully, with a strong emphasis on getting the details correct, and Minsky was excellent at explaining and using the necessary tricks of the trade. At the same time, he was wonderful at distilling things to the fundamental principles at play. The result was a serious improvement in my technical skills, as well as a vision of the far-off land of (for lack of a better word) professional mathematics, where intuition seems to transcend technicalities.",
                "Yes, Minsky is a good profesor",
                "Yes. I only took 230/231 before this, and 305 expanded my math knowledge and proof-writing skills so much. It's quite a bit of work, but it's not nearly the hardest class I've ever taken (except for the final :( ) because office hours are so helpful. It's also cool! Measure theory is really powerful, and getting a justification for why you can use Fourier series in applications so flippantly is nice.",
                "Definitely, 100%. Interesting material, Prof. Minsky is amazing. Do it.",
                "I would recommend this course only if you have patience and enthusiasm for math. The material his very cool but takes so so so long to work through and the problem sets are brutal, as was the take home final exam (the midterm was not bad at all). only take this class if you can dedicate a solid 2 days full each week to it - it will definitely be the class that gives you the most work, and will be very painful if you do not have enough time t set apart for it.",
                "Extremely well taught, great OH availability (each TA/ULA/Minsky had 4 hours of OH per week, which was GREAT), pretty interesting material too. My main reservations are the workload",
                "Yes. This course is fundamental for any math major.",
                "On the one hand, Lebesgue measure theory is incredibly interesting and will likely be relevant to your future coursework in the department. However, the sheer mental anguish imposed by this course is unmeasurable. If you have a challenging semester or care about your mental well-being, I may shy away from MATH 305.",
                "Yes. Best math class I have taken thus far. The material is amazing and the teaching is great. Prof. Minsky cares a lot and it shows.",
                "Only if you intend to study higher-level math.",
                "I would not recommend this course to a friend and have actively warned friends against taking it. I found the content itself interesting and found the lectures engaging, but I ended up spending all of my time on this class and still being marked off for not proving details that were obvious or small. The majority of the time I spent on this class was not in actually solving problems or being creative about the math, but rather stressing about how the graders would find ways to take off points, and as such, I was spending absurd amounts of time tightening down small details in my proof rather than engaging with the course materials. I can say that this is the first math class I have ever had that I genuinely did not enjoy. Typically problem solving is fun and engaging, but the grading focus put all the concern in the details not actually pertinent to the content. Perhaps this was intentional or perhaps the instructor and graders would see this as an irrelevant complaint, but I cannot seem to figure out why this has not been an issue in any of my other math courses at Yale. In no course have I spent as much time on problem sets just to get torn apart on the little things.",
                "Yes! I felt like this class really started to open my mind up to how higher level math works. Professor Minsky is a great professor, and makes the class very enjoyable.",
                "Yes, especially if taught by Minsky",
                "I would 100% recommend this course if you like math and want to learn more analysis. This course really gives you a solid understand of analysis as a subject and how to think while approaching problems. Also it introduces topics like measure and Fourier series which are fundamental for tons of upper level math as well as applied math",
                "This is a good foundational course in real analysis, and Minsky is a great lecturer, but be prepared to spend a LOT of time working out nitpicky details on your homework",
                "If you are set in the pure math major do it. I went straight from 231 and struggled a bit as a result. This course is much more work than 230/231.",
                "Yes - Yair is an excellent professor and this content was extremely interesting. Hadnt learned about measure theory but there are some really cool topics here.",
                "Most people who take this don't have a choice. If you have a choice, you might want to look elsewhere because the people who don't have a choice are full sending in this class.",
                "If you want to study math, you have to take this class. If you are unsure about doing Math, I would think twice. Despite the course being very well taught and Prof. Minsky being a great teacher, I found the material to be quite dry and very technical for the most part, especially compared to the classes from algebra/combinatorics group.\r\nThat said, I think this is the class you just have to experience if you want to study anything math-related at a serious level because you just learn a lot of fundamental things in analysis.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in math and has some prior proof-based analysis experience. The course assumes prior knowledge of many foundational analytic concepts and techniques (taking limits, epsilon-delta, continuity, series, supremum/infimum, etc.) and uses them extensively, hence, the recommendation that students have worked and written proofs with them. Moreover, I think anyone interested in math will appreciate the course. Developing a theory of integration from the Lebesgue measure certainly provides greater insight into how integration works (and it's interesting!).",
                "Yes - Prof. Minsky is an amazing lecturer. I would say the workload is comparable to MATH 230 from previous years. The proofs were more rigorous, but if you already have a good amount of experience with proof writing, they are manageable.  This semester, Prof. Minsky made a great effort this year to help people form study groups online. The graders were fair and provided great feedback."
