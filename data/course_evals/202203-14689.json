Writing consistently really helped me make sure I understood the readings and I became more and more comfortable participating in class.",

                "Throughout this course, I have considerably developed my analytical and writing skills. I enjoyed gaining insight on western ancient history through a literary lense, and being able to use text as departing part for both in depth and broad topic discussions. As an international student, this course was thereby an ideal opportunity to practice my oral skills, as I was encouraged to engage with ideas, and interact with students in a more intimate circle,  which increased my confidence. The nicest part was probably being able to connect books and understand how foundational these texts were. Not only comprehending the influence authors had on each other, and I look forward seeing how this heritage maintains its meaning in more contemporary works. The professor, despite her more historical background, provided us with very helpful context, and strongly directed our attention towards specific passages which we could dedicate a whole 10 minutes to, analyzing the significance of some imagery, and their relevance in a larger narrative and historical frame. Indeed, the diversity of writing prompts, also introduced me to multiple ways of writing on literature (focusing on an object through multiple works, or a close passage, or comparing different instances), which enhanced both my creative and critical thinking.",
                "Before taking this class, I thought I knew what it meant to do a close reading; today, thanks to Professor Lamont and my classmates, my ability to close read has skyrocketed, and I am able to look at and analyze literature at a higher level.",
                "Familiarity with highly influential texts from the Western cannon. I saw how the earlier texts influenced themes, genres, plotlines and even specific images that recurred in later texts.\r\nSkills - reading a lot on short timelines; writing regularly both essays and discussion-posts for the class; balancing analysis of grand themes with close-reading of specific passages; discussing texts in an intimate seminar setting; comparative analysis across works and DS sections.",

                "DS lit gave me an understanding of the evolution of classical literature, stylistically and thematically. It is valuable in it of itself to have read the classic works, it is even more so as they are referenced time and again in modern works and reflect the values and zeitgeist of their time. The characters, plot, allegory, and language are in constant dialogue with all literature that comes after, and explanatory to the way we write and think."

                "The strengths are the syllabus and the instruction. What we learn and how we learn it is done really well. I think there could be some improvements made in making sure students understand the crucial passages in each text so we know what seminal moments to reference when studying for the final.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lamont was a really amazing, caring professor. Her enthusiasm for the course content was obvious; she'd frequently go to the map or whiteboard to explain something about the linguistics or historical context of each text. Some of her insights were remarkably illuminating. A tough but fair grader. The reading list was really great. Only Confessions and perhaps Matthew felt out of place. I learned a lot for sure. The DS lectures are really great; combined with the seminars, you should get a good sense of why these books have been so meaningful to so many people.\r\nWeaknesses: Directed Studies is a lot of work. Sometimes the class felt like a never-ending test; as though every week, I was being tested to see how much I could read, how fast I could write, whether I could show up to class every day ready to say something interesting about the hundred pages I'd just finished last night. And for all of that work, DS doesn't always feel equivalently intellectually rewarding. You might spend half of your weekend reading one book --- you might be the only one in your class to actually read the book --- and end up only speaking once or twice in the seminar, before the class moves on to a new text the next day. I think a lot of the ways in which the program is valuable won't be obvious until years after you (or I) have taken it; they certainly don't feel obvious when you've spent the whole week reading or worked yourself to the bone writing a paper. But there are books you'll read that are breathtaking and beautiful and if you don't take this class, there are probably some really special texts that you'll miss out on.",
                "The strength of this course definitely reside in the breadth, and compelling nature of the material studied. Being surrounded by very engaged students, eager and curious certainly complements in a considerable way the professor's insights. The rigor achieved by regularly having papers to write, not only obliges us to become an avid reader, but also pushes us to think outside the box, in going beyond general lines of interpretation and understanding.\r\n\r\nA weakness, like any DS course, is the deceiving rapidity by which we have to read and study books which deserve more dialogue and questioning. Sometimes, I also wish we had more time at the end of a seminar to conclude, and tie up on some initiated thoughts that were spurred at the beginning and let the professor give her opinion, or some broader questions to think about. I also regret the fact that the writing and question posts were not shared between peers. I feel it as a lost opportunity to learn and elevate our thinking outside the classroom, as all the content can not be exhaustively discussed in class.",
                "DS covers broad swaths of material - that's both its strength (scope) and weakness (depth). The format of both lectures and seminar discussions helps compensate for this.\r\nIn my literature section, in particular, Prof. Lamont balanced well between discussions of themes and plotlines outside the text and close-reading of particular passages. The weekly discussion posts helped center discussions around what the students found interesting. Given Prof. Lamonts expertise in Classics, she often also addressed the cultural and historical context of works, which strengthened our understanding of the texts and ability to put them in conversation with each other.",
                "There are many moments where you can see the past informing the present in the syllabus; however, the jump to Andalusian poetry felt sudden",
                "The strengths of DS are evident. Perhaps while the purpose and role of philosophy and h&p are also self explanatory, I wish we discussed briefly the hazy question of literature's purpose. What do we gain from reading say, Virgil. How do the authors and concept that communicate with each other apply outside the fictional universe? Also, with regard to poetry, I would much rather we focus on 2 or 3 outstanding poets, read and understand all of their works in depth than briefly skim the poems of 30 poets whose names won't register."

                "Yes! I found Professor Lamont's historical knowledge surrounding the texts to helpfully contextualize what we were learning. And I love literature itself, and this class really lets the texts be the star.",
                "I think so. It really depends on the student. No matter how good you are, it's not going to be easy, and there are points at which it's not going to be fun. I wouldn't recommend it if you're going to half-ass the course. If you're not going to do all of the readings, don't take DS. You're just inviting extra pain on yourself. You won't have a lot of free time outside of class either. And you might not get an A. But DS seems to me like an infinitely rare opportunity; there are just not other classes at Yale that cover the same amount of content and push you to read the same amount of stuff. It's a survey course and prioritizes breadth over depth, so you might not get much more than a cursory understanding of each book. But that's about as much of an understanding as anyone else has, bar your professors. And the value of all of the essays and late nights and hard work and books might not seem super obvious immediately. It certainly doesn't to me. But so many people across so many centuries have found these books moving and beautiful; if there's anyone to trust, it's them. \r\n\r\nI also absolutely recommend Professor Lamont. I recommend using Fall and Thanksgiving breaks to work on your papers too. The extra weeks come in very handy.",
                "I would recommend this course for students curious about founding texts of the literary western tradition. You read books you will never otherwise read, and not only closely and thoroughly study them, but also think of them as representative of our western tradition and culture. Now, in all contexts of my daily life, these texts reemerge as referential and explain many contemporary patterns of thought. I nonetheless think it is important to remember it is only one geographic departing point to learn about our origins.\r\nOn a practical level, your writing will indisputably improve, but I strongly advise to use all available resources Yale has in that regard. Your thinking also will become more nuanced and complex. When reading a book your capacity to interrogate, to discern the layers of meaning, and the differing directions your analysis can take. Understanding the plurality of perspective one can have and being able to compute and convey them orally and through argumentative writing will help you construct an opinion, in a knowledgeable capacity.",
                "Yes ! Directed Studies, despite its notorious workload, is a blessing.",
                "DS is very enjoyable and rewarding for those who are genuinely passionate about it and willing to handle a significant (but manageable) workload. You'll hopefully get exposed to fascinating, key ideas and thinkers, find a community of peers, participate in fun seminars and develop your reading, writing and analysis skills.\r\nProf. Lamont is a great instructor. She specializes in Classics, is passionate about the material and her warmth and kindness create a positive class atmosphere.",
