Honestly, having to get up to speed quickly and spitting something out at the end of the semester is a good way to figure out if you like consulting a lot. You'll also learn how to always have the best slide decks."

The workload was lighter this semester because of COVID, so not sure how that will change in the future. It'll be challenging work at times, but enjoyable, and you'll learn a lot. If that appeals to you, go for it."
