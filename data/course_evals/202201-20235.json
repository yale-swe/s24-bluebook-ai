This lab is really such a delightful survey of different organisms and ecological concepts, and so I learned about and experienced everything from squid anatomy (and dissection), to the biology of flowering plants, to measuring the velocity of a stream. Every week, we learned something new and exciting, and this was probably the most hands-on class I've takenbeyond the various biological concepts I learned, there were many practical skills that I developed, too. On the whole, it felt a bit like the sheer wonder, curiosity, and exploration of an elementary or middle school science class, but at a much higher intellectual/scientific level that made it all the more interesting.",
                "I gained a better understanding of biological organisms and systems, and how to better analyze the world around me",

                "The professor is so committed to having her students succeed and learn all about bugs, plants and trees!",
                "This course really is wonderful! Its strengths include the wide range of topics covered in each lab and the way that they progress each week, the substantive but manageable amount of work, the enjoyable final project, and really just everything about it. Sometimes it can feel a bit chaotic, but never in a way that is stressful or worrisomeI just trusted that I would go to lab, do what Marta said, and it would turn out well.",
                "It was a really amazing and practical course, where I gained a lot.",
                "Strengths - this course was very fun. Each lab day in class was one of the academic highlights of my week. We got to work with life specimens, dissect different organisms, wade and collect data in rivers, eat a whole bunch of types of fruits, and interact with beautiful preserved specimens from the Peabody. There was a wide range of different exciting lab activities. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the class is a very big time commitment, especially for a half-credit course. While the assignments are do-able, they take a really long time. For every class we needed to complete a long lab and study for a difficult quiz. The class would benefit from someone going through the lab handouts and streamlining the questions students need to answer on each lab. Also, we didn't get grades/comments back from class assignments until the very last week.",
                "Honestly one of the best classes I took at Yale! When else can you go on a field trip to a river in waders to release tangerine to measure the velocity of the river? Or, try twenty new fruits such as durian, starfruit, and tamarind? Prof Wells is amazing and so was my TA!",
                "This course was amazing -- the professor and TAs were approachable and understanding, and the labs were engaging and really fun. I appreciated how much effort was taken to help students understand the material, and classes were generally well-organized for learning. Honestly can't think of any weaknesses for this class!",
                "We didn't get much feedback on the lab reports and sometimes the rubric for the reports didn't line up perfectly with what we were told in class, for example in class we may have only had time to look at 3 organisms, but the report asks us to discuss 4. I never knew how much detail to give and if I should just do some independent research to fill in any gaps (such as finding info on a 4th organism when I only got to look at 3), which made lab reports take much longer than they should have. More regular feedback and more detailed rubrics/instructions in the lab handout would be helpful (i did notice this improved over the course of the semester though!)",
                "Strengths is all of the fun experiments we did and the creative fun project! <3 No weaknesses besides the many long parts of a lab made us leave class really late."

                "Yes! This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and without a doubt the best lab (after 8 semesters)! Truly every week's lab is so fun, and Marta is wonderful. She is so enthusiastic and knowledgeable; she is incredibly warm, excited about everything we're studying, and eager to teach and share her fascination with her students. In what other class could you dissect a squid one week, a fish another, befriend some caterpillars, get to bring home flowers (left over after the angiosperm lab), or wear waders for an afternoon? This is truly a special class, and I can't recommend it highly enough if you have any interest at all in the biological sciences (or even if you were just a kid who loved natural history museums!).",
                "Yes, I loved it! Very stimulating intellectually, yet enjoyable.",
                "I would! It's a great biology lab and a lot of fun. The professor and the TAs are nice. My main critique is the extremely heavy workload for a half-credit class, so be ready.",
                "Yes - 100 percent!",
                "Yes this is my favorite course that I've taken at Yale, do take it!! It's a wonderful environment to work in and I left every class feeling happier than when I entered. The labs were a lot of fun (involving food and off campus trips sometimes!!) and I learned a lot as well. Would definitely recommend",
                "Absolutely! It was very hands on and the professor and TA were both very kind and a lot of fun. You get to take a few field trips and go outside for a few classes (and we got ice cream once)! If you're looking for a relatively low stress class and like hands on work, this is a class for you. If you can credit/D it, I think it would be even more fun to not have to worry as much about the weekly lab reports, but even with the lab reports it was super interesting and definitely opened my eyes to how incredible the diversity of life is!",
                "Yes! If you want to dissect some fun things and experience a whole different type of \"typical lab\", please do! But be warned, the quizzes require a lot of prep and this is a large writing workload! But at least prepping for the upcoming lab is a breeze and Marta is super fun!"
