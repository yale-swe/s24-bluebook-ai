            "comments": [
                "Strengths: cool idea, fun classroom, interesting lectures\r\nWeaknesses: would've loved more skills workshops to have more concrete skills to take away from the class; some of the semester projects seemed like they weren't really engineering projects, which was hard to navigate; getting the semester projects and having deadlines before the midterm would've meant we could do much more substantial engineering work throughout the semester; we got very little feedback and it came very late, which was extremely frustrating.",
                "I enjoyed it, no changes needed.",
                "I think this course needs a rubric for all assignments. When my group for the midterm and final project asked for guidance, we sometimes received unclear and even contradictory instructions from the teaching team. In addition, I think working with a real world client is a very cool experience, but our client's specific issue that they wanted us to work on did not fit into the spirit of the course at all, and we spent several weeks being confused about how we were supposed to proceed before eventually being told to work on a different but related problem that we came up with ourselves. In the future, I hope the clients are given clear expectations of the deliverables for the class to get the most out of both their time and students' time.",
                "The final project working with companies was cool, but it was definitely difficult to navigate the business side of this and the particular client my group worked with was not very helpful or easy to work with. There were challenges with the alignment between what the professors expected and what the clients expected, at least for my group, and it made it difficult to come up with a project that would make everyone happy.",
                "The timing of this course was a bit strange to me.  Both the midterm and the final projects felt extremely rushed I don't see a reason why they both weren't introduced earlier, especially with the midterm.  That was really stressful.  Also, we should have had our personal meetings with the professors regarding our final project at least two weeks earlier than we did it was a really helpful meeting and should have come earlier in the design process.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is the month-long design project at the end. Biggest weakness is that there is a lull, for about two weeks in the beginning of the semester, where the lectures are a little unfocused.",
                "Strengths: Great opportunity to get hands-on experience in the CEID. Highly engaging with in-class exercises and design challenges. Learned more about whats it like to engineer actual prototypes and practice sustainability in real time. Both the midterm and final projects were great opportunities to learn. Extremely low time commitment (for better or for worse). Professors and TFs are extremely kind and understanding; candy and toys at classes for fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures, though concentrated in the first half of the semester, felt redundant and didnt have much value add to the course (e.g., executive leadership talk was irrelevant); it was often a lot of buzzwords being thrown around, and wouldve benefited from a greater focus on letting students ideate for themselves. In-class exercises could've benefited from greater instruction and guidance. Problem sets were short and had interesting content but were a waste of time. Feedback was scarce and delayed when given. There was plenty of collaboration, so it wouldve been nice for the Professors/TFs to make an effort to at least learn each of the students names.",
                "It would be nice to know and meet with our clients earlier in the semester!",
                "Strengths: The professors and teaching team are great. The final projects are cool because our clients are real companies. The course is paradigm-shifting for how you view sustainability and green engineering. The collaborative nature of the class was great and it did not feel difficult to talk with the teaching team or professors. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: our grades on some assignments were not clear / took a while to get back, though overall it wasn't a huge worry because we were always getting feedback in class and were in touch with the TAs and Profs every class.",
                "Strengths: Very hands work which is rare for environmental engineering classes. \r\nWeaknesses: The workload in the class is very backloaded, so most of the assignments are due in the second half of the semester, which is already very busy.",
                "Strengths: The course has very good intentions (giving students practice working with \"real world\" clients and hands-on engineering). The content that Paul and Julie teach in lectures in the first half of the class is also very important (although a lot of it seemed like common sense to me, I think it would be especially valuable for non-environmental engineering majors to see). \r\nWeaknesses: To be honest, I didn't really learn much. There is a lot of potential for students to learn how to use all the machines in the CEID to build their prototypes. But many of the final projects simply involved pointing out obvious flaws in a company's current operation, or building an extremely simplified model. Working with real companies was nice but I think the executives probably learned more from our solution (ie seeing that their status quo is deeply flawed) than we learned from doing the project. Also, none of the companies actually wanted to adopt any of the solutions because it would be too expensive or not fit their current operation. \r\nFor future years, PLEASE use a different software for LCA than Sustainable Minds. The software would crash at random times and there were some bugs with it making the LCAs take much longer than they could have. We probably spent 3-4 times longer figuring out the software than learning how to do LCAs.",
                "I had no idea how I was doing in the class the whole time. They were incredibly slow with the grades and not at all transparent.",
                "The course was well suited to student learning and collaboration, but some of the time felt like it could have been used more efficiently. The group activities and challenges as well as the final project were really fun!",
                "midterm group project should differ a little as well in order to have some variety. it was a little hard doing the same project - sort of felt like we were competing with each other.",
                "The homeworks were a bit long and sustainable minds was very difficult to work with.",
                "strengths: super interesting, interactive, fun environment. They bring candy to class. Learning from Paul Anastas, the literal founder of green chemistry, was amazing. They also lined up great companies to work with for our final projects.  \r\nweaknesses: basically no grades were shown until the very end, it was a bit unorganized, and the LCA class was very dry"

Prepare to be actively moving around the CEID, working with new people, pitching, and building things each classno sitting down. But, there are a number of structural issues that the course team would benefit from fixing, for ENVE 360 to really live up to its hype in the syllabus and first few classes.",
                "Yes; GESD is really interesting and Professors Zimmerman and Anastasia are great professors who care a lot about green engineering. The TAs are also very invested in the class and helped us in the projects. I found the final project itself to be not that interesting, since all of the projects were packaging-based. Other than that, the class is a lot of fun.",
                "Yes! It's a great course. The course is foundational for learning about sustainability and green engineering -- and workload is reasonable and the assignments are project-based! The professors are engaging, extremely knowledgeable, and create a fun atmosphere in the class.",

                "If you are considering working in industry, either as an engineer or some type of manager/executive/consultant, this class is definitely important for you to take. You will learn that the metrics we currently use to assess good design are flawed, and you will learn how to design sustainably and think holistically about problems. Please take this class so you don't go into the world and create more problems than you solve.",
