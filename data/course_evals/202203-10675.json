By taking this course, I have learned a lot about how to effectively memorize new vocabulary words and grammar rules. The course is very well designed to allow for multiple channels of practicing the same material which is very helpful when studying a foreign language.",

                "I can speak some spanish now",

            "comments": [
                "The strength of the course is that it is very immersive. From a very early point, you are speaking almost all Spanish in the classroom. Although this is very difficult to begin with, eventually it really helps to teach you the language and you eventually feel comfortable conversing regularly.",
                "It is great that the course allows for practicing the same topics over and over again, because that makes memorizing them easier. However, the homework assignments can sometimes be too spread out in the sense that it is hard to keep track of what the assignments for the next class exactly are and it is easy to miss deadlines, because there are different platforms on which you need to look for the homework. Something I was very confused by in the beginning, for example, was that we were distributed the printed syllabus, but the syllabus got updated on the canvas page and new homework was added. Usually, with other courses, the syllabus does not change and new homework that has been added to it is announced in class.",
                "It can be a bit confusing to navigate the canvas site as it is such a large class with so many small assignments, and the everyday meetings can be a bit tedious but I was able to identify how helpful the everyday practice was for my learning.",
                "Strengths- Professor Sab was super sweet and very accessible. A great teacher.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the workload was pretty variable, and the course moved pretty fast.",
                "some more focus on grammar",
                "it could be improved if we had to read more books, reading that one book made me feel a lot more confident with my Spanish language skills.",
                "I think the times when we had conversations in Spanish in class were very helpful, and there should have been more of them",
                "The strengths are that the Professors put a lot of time and effort into this course, and they really do a great job teaching the students. The weaknesses of this course is its workload and pace. It is extremely fast paced and hard to keep up with."

This is not an easy class with a low workload, but if you apply yourself and do the work it is very rewarding and you end up gaining a high level of understanding of the language.",
                "I would definitely recommend it. It is a very fun course to take and it is a good break from assignments for other classes.",
