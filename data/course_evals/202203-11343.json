                "I like that this class is geared towards actually learning the language through conversation and practice rather than penalizing students with strict grading. The coursework is very engaging and Prof Lee's energy just made the learning process so much more fun. I only wish I can take her classes again.",
                "Strengths: Lee-ssn is amazing. She has been super considerate and supportive of my personal exploration into the Korean language. She's super patient and willing to answer questions and offer help even on material outside of what's being taught in class, and I think she's a wonderful professor even for people who are interested and motivated to study beyond the curriculum. In terms of the curriculum - I think units are all reasonably paced, and grammar patterns/rules are introduced in a pretty gentle and engaging way. The classroom atmosphere is great too - I think people generally feel comfortable participating in class.",
                "The course heavily emphasizes speaking practice and makes it stress-free to do so. The environment is extremely supportive, the students hang out, and there are good teaching resources (slides, handouts, etc.) that are available for additional review.",
                "Definitely would appreciate some more structure to grammar. We learned via practice / repetition which made things very applicable but it wouldve been nice to have ended the semester with a nice chronological history of the grammar we learned",
                "Strengths: Extremely fair grade breakdowns, engaging projects, \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times the daily quizzes would",
                "I liked the daily vocabulary quizzes--they served as an extra incentive to memorize new words. I also liked that we did a lot of speaking practice. I would have liked to maybe do a bit more writing practice to solidify the new grammar we learned. Otherwise it was a very enjoyable and well-structured course!",
                "Strengths: This course moves at a fast pace, so you will never be bored. The professor encourages a lot of conversation practice in classes so expect to study outside of class. It helps that it's every day. The class may seem unorganized, but it's not. The professor adjusts the pace of the class to the students.  Don't get behind in classes and study and you'll do great! If you do get behind, talk to the professor and set up extra study times with the tutor and professor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There aren't any weaknesses. I would definitely encourage anyone wanting to take this class to familiarize themselves with how to do recordings and videos. Start your projects immediately so you have time to deal with tech issues and the video editing learning curve. It's really a lot easier than you think, but can seem overwhelming at first.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lee is very understanding and enthusiastic, she doesnt penalize you for struggling, covers a wide variety of material, includes fun games and videos in class\r\nWeakness: Sometimes the almost daily quizzes could be a bit hard to keep up with, the course lost some of its structure towards the end, other than that no complaints !!!",
                "Is an incredible teacher, and her positivity and warmth was the classs strongest point. I also really appreciated that the very expensive textbooks were not necessary for the course, and that all assignments/class materials/audio files were posted online. I thought meeting with the TA was helpful (with the exception of the first two weeks when we didnt really know enough to practice anything, so all we could do was go ahead). The language tables held every week were also a strong point, although it would be helpful if there was maybe a makeup language table every month or so because although I really enjoyed the one language table I went to, I had to skip class to go, so I could not go every week. The only weakness was that the Canvas site was a bit disorganized and it wasnt always clear which sheets were homework at the end of class, so I sometimes struggled with doing the right assignments for class the following day.",
                "The course was paced extremely well, and covered a wide range of topics that are helpful for everyday speaking.\r\n\r\nOne thing that could improve this course would be to be more flexible with the curriculum and vocabulary. I think the progression of grammar structures was good, but would be nice to have more say in the vocab for things like verbs, places, objects, etc.",
                "I think that the professor made this course very fun and enjoyable. However, the curriculum seemed different depending on the professor, so I would be learning different vocabulary or conjugation than other students taking L1 Korean. I think that this class could be improved by providing more consistency. One thing that I liked about this course is that the book was not required. My professor provided all of the class materials, so that was really nice. I also liked how the professor gave lots of homework, but was also gracious and understanding in terms of deadlines.",
                "I have no complaints about this class. I loved this class so much. Professor Lee did a fantastic job. She came with the biggest smile, she was warm, welcoming, funny, had the greatest stories and engaged with us so much more than our other classes. I looked forward coming to this class everyday."

The Korean language is very fun to learn and there are so many ways that people can be interacting with the Korean language due to more widespread Korean media with K-pop and Korean dramas. The classroom setting is also very engaging and I loved be able to get to know my classmates and professor.",
                "I would. It's a great introduction to the Korean language. I'm writing this course evaluation 2 weeks into winter break, and I still remember much of the Korean I learned because it's engrained into my head so well."
