For a lack of a better phrase, I learned how to read, and in particular,  that curiosity and confusion can and should be an element of a first reading. While I was unable to gain a deep understanding of all elements of the texts, the discussion posts for each text pushed me to spend some time with one particular idea. Additionally, the essays allowed me to work through the texts, and the commentary from Professor Markovits provided helpful guidance in order to improve my arguments.",

I knew going into this course that there would be a lot of reading, but I took for granted the difficulty of the readings as well. In particular, Ulysses was dense and hard to work through. In the end, the word we did in the classroom helped me understand the novel, but while reading alone, there were times I felt quite lost.",
                "Obviously, so much reading. It was difficult to stay on top of it and then also since we had to move so quickly we didn't cover any work with very much depth. But since it's supposed to be a survey course, that is to be expected.",
                "It was a lot of reading. I don't think it was enough time for all the works, but it was still great to get some exposure to all of them.",
                "Strengths: Professor Markovits is an excellent discussion leader, which is important because there is a lot of material to get through in this course. She makes sure to cover all the overarching ideas, while still leaving room for questions and student interests. There is plenty of opportunity to receive feedback on essays during and after the drafting process. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I understand why this isn't possible, but I wish we were able to spend more time on each text!",
                "I would have preferred to spend more time on the books I liked and less time on the books I didnt like but others in the class seemed to like the ones I liked less, so thats neither here nor there."

                "I would recommend this course to any student at Yale. While I believe it is designed for students who love to read, as I mentioned earlier, it also teaches you how to read. The texts of this course are foundational in many subjects, and I believe that the order in which we read and learned these epics and novels demonstrated the importance of one work influencing the other. Additionally, I was unable to take Directed Studies last year, and this course provided me with a 'mini DS,' which I believe many other students can benefit from.",
                "I would!! Professor Markovits is so clear and warm and leads discussions really well.",
                "Yes. This was my favorite class I've taken so far at Yale. If you have the time and are interested in keeping up with the readings, this is a great class. Prof Markovits is an amazing professor who will make you love these epics.",
                "Yes! Though the class has a heavy reading load, it is absolutely worth it. You can also make the reading more manageable by reading ahead over the summer or during breaks."
