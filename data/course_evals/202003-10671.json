                "I thought this course did a great job of mixing in contemporary Russian texts with some cultural touchstones that allow you to understand the Russian point of view, like My Perestroika or Onegin. Although the workload was very high and it is harder to be engaged in class virtually as compared to in person, I enjoyed how the classes were run and really appreciated the thought put into texts and movies we engaged with. I also appreciated the fine-tuning we did on grammar topics.",
                "We had a lot of time to improve our speaking, writing, and listening skills. Irina explains concepts well and is always willing to help. However, the class size did make participation difficult at times.",
                "I feel the course was very strong and can think of no way in which it could be improved.",
                "Language is very hard to conduct remote.  The assignments didn't help me practice grammar and were very, very time consuming.",
                "My instructor was Liana Battsaligova.  I really loved this course and it's strength was the level of engagement it requires through different mediums.  I feel like I will retain the vocabulary I learned and that I learned a lot about Russian\/Soviet culture, film, lit, ect.  I think it would have been neat to have more presentations utilizing vocabulary in the place of tests.",
                "This class is very strong although could perhaps benefit from including a more cohesive narrative arc. One thing that I appreciated about third year russian was that it was structured around a specific chunk of Russian history. Each of our lessoned was based around reading and discussing a period of time or a topic within 19th century Russian history.",
                "Pros: Fun movies to watch, engaging oral exams, Irina is amazing, grammar is fun, and fun discussions in class,\r\nCons: None, take this this class",
                "The strengths of this class are that we learned a lot of new vocabulary and practiced it often in discussions. The discussions were very applicable to the topic that we were studying and I really enjoyed them. We also watched a lot of interesting Russian movies and read a few short stories. I really liked the discussions that we had and how we were able to connect some of the themes among these movies and short stories. The discussions were really helpful to me. We also received a lot of feedback on our homework and essays, which is extremely helpful. The professor took a lot of time to give us detailed personalized feedback about the mistakes that we made, which really helped me improve my skills in the language. The instructor was attentive to everyone. Even though I really enjoyed the class, I think that there are a few weaknesses and ways that the course can be improved. First, we studied only three topics during the entire semester - education, work, and hobbies. I think that we spent too long on each topic and some of the materials were not engaging, specifically the articles. The movies and short stories that we watched were really interesting, but I think that the actual information we studied about the topic through the articles could have been improved and I think it would have been more interesting to study the topics through more literature and to study more about the culture and traditions of Russia. We read an article about the cultural code of Russia, but I did not feel as though it gave me an actual understanding of Russian culture and traditions. In addition to this, I also think the amount of homework was sometimes a little too much to handle (especially during a pandemic). A lot of times, the homework was given to us a day before it was due and there were a lot of parts to the it and questions that had to be answered in paragraph format. I think that it would have been really helpful to be given the homework right after class so we could get started on it right away and could manage our time better.",
                "(My instructor was Liana Battsaligova)\r\nStrength: The small class format; class was super engaging and I had a lot of opportunity to speak in class.\r\nStrength: Feedback was speedy and super detailed; I learned a lot from the homework corrections Ms. Liana sent us after every class.\r\nStrength: Super entertaining! We had the chance to watch amazing films and chic videos; I was introduced to a couple of amazing directors!\r\nStrength: Class was very well organized; we had a clear format and topic for each class and had time for both grammar instruction and discussion.",
                "This course offered students an insight into Russian contemporary culture through the readings and discussions. We read current articles about the Russian education system, the job market, and broader culture. We also watched movies that explored life in Soviet and contemporary Russian. These readings not only taught us about Russian life but also helped us discuss these important issues fluently with sophisticated vocabulary and grammar. \r\n\r\nObviously, learning a language over Zoom is really challenging, but the instructors, Irina Dolgova and Liana, helped with their positivity and enthusiasm. The size of the class allowed us to have more opportunities to practice speaking. The only weakness of the course was a bit of confusion over the syllabi and homework due to the two different sections. This problem was mostly solved by the end of the course though.",
                "The professor for the course (Irina Dolgova) is very kind and approachable, and humorous in class.  You learn a decent amount of Russian in the course, and are exposed to a variety of contemporary materials, including some great films.\r\n\r\nI found it very difficult, especially in the beginning, to figure out where things were located on canvas, what we were supposed to do, and how to turn in homework.  These things changed multiple times throughout the semester and were a source of some anxiety.  It would be better to have a consistent use of the technology throughout the course.  Of course, this was in the midst of the pandemic, so we were all navigating new technologies and this is understandable.  Hopefully those kinks have been worked out and it will be better next semester.\r\n\r\nI think that while it was great to read articles in real time, and the professor did so much work to provide us with articles and lexicons and other material, we didn't use the textbook all that much (and when we did, it was hard to engage with, as it requires a complicated login to the UCLA server).  I think the course would be better served by either using the textbook more, or switching to a different textbook that is more accessible.  For me, a little bit more structure in that way would have been better.  \r\n\r\nThe homework load was a little too intense in the course.  \r\n\r\nAnother strength of the class is that the instructor really does a good job and takes a lot of time correcting your homework and exams so that you can improve.",
                "We do readings for homework every day, and it has really helped my reading skills. Due to the virtual format, there was less opportunity to speak, so I was not able to work on speaking as much as I usually do during in-person classes.",
                "Strengths: Irina Andreevna is a great teacher -- super caring and supportive! Also, I liked that the course included a blend of readings, grammar exercises, and films\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the homework assignments seemed unnecessarily long and tedious"

Assignments (films, short stories) could all be located online and were easily accessible.",
                "The instructors themselves were singlehandedly the reason this course succeeded over Zoom. Every class they brought positivity and excitement that was infectious. They made the class feel like a safe environment to practice the language without fear of judgment. Splitting the course into two smaller sections was definitely a good idea, because we were able to have more opportunities to practice speaking, and it really encouraged us to participate more. The use of Canvas was also really helpful, because all of our assignments and resources were in one spot.",

                "Dividing the large 20-people class into two classes definitely helped with overall quality. It would have been better if there were more opportunities for students and teachers to speak more, but I'm guessing that's just a limitation of the online format. Using the Chat box for questions and answers is actually really useful."
