    "Genetic experiments",
    "good if taking concurrently with genetics lecture. Learn about recombination mapping and how to conduct chi-square tests, both of which are heavily tested on the genetics lecture final exam.",
    "I learned really crucial lab skills, as well as how to carry out important genetics calculations",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: TAs, content of the labs, background material provided to understand the labs \r\nWeaknesses: how the professor treats students",
    "You learn a lot in this class, but it's difficult at times to understand what on earth is going on. Part of it has to do with the way the class is structured. You usually work on different units at the same time (once we did part of a yeast then fly then plant lab all in one session). I understand that it takes a long time for plants to grow and flies to have babies, but doing multiple things at once and breaking up units was more confusing than instructive. Then, there's the lab reports. They take A LOT of time, which would be fine if they felt worthwhile, but in all honesty they were more menial than anything else.",
    "The workload was very high and I feel like we could have been given more guidance with the tests and data analyses we were instructed to perform. Otherwise, the course was organized in a comprehensive manner.",
    "The course is well organized and well planned out to help guide you through the process of doing genetic experimentation and writing accompanying lab reports. I liked how each week built upon the previous week and that we worked with a variety of model organisms. I think there could be more feedback when writing the lab reports.",
    "Learn how to actually apply the genetics you learn in lecture",
    "I think the course was very enriching and a great complement to the lecture course. It was, however, so much work outside of lab hours. It was one of the most interesting lab courses Ive taken. I wouldve appreciated a bit more guidance in the prelab lectures regarding how to conduct specific analyses. The instructions in the manual were also difficult to read. I would consider changing the format to make it easier to follow."

   "comments": [
    "With another instructor, yes but with the current one, absolutely no. While the TAs graded everything on time and gave clear feedback, no such thing was received from the instructor. An assignment that we turned in to him at the beginning of October, has not been graded and probably will never be graded until the release of final grades. If you spend more than 20 hours writing an assignment, it would be nice to get feedback. While the course content is good and you learn how to do a lot of experiments that are explained in the Genetics lecture, I solely would not recommend this class because of how the professor treats certain groups of students. To such students, he feels free to send aggressive emails at hours after midnight and feels free to ask them for song recommendation solely in the category of ethnicity he perceives they belong to. Only take this class if you need to, are interested in genetics, and will not be afraid to speak up if you need do.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone who has a busy schedule and does not want to invest that much time. There are easier lab courses. Having said that, if you are looking to learn and work with all kinds of organisms ranging from plants to flies to yeast, then this lab might be for you. Go into it expecting to have a lot of work once every two weeks (when lab reports are due, 5 in total), and for the grading to be arbitrary.",
    "Yes! It made me realize that I want to work in a lab in the future",
    "Yes, it is a challenging biology lab but if you have any interest in genetics and want a solid lab credit this is a great course. The grading is very TA dependent but overall fair.",
    "It is a good lab, though it is a lot of work. Spread it out and manage your time well and you should be fine."
