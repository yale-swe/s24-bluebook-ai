                "Everything is harder in light of the pandemic! Professor Merriman did a wonderful job maintaining vibrant and colorful lecturing through zoom, especially when he could not see any of his students. He was very personable even through camera, and given the circumstances, this course was certainly the best it could have been in terms of relaying information. The only weakness is there could have been more assignments throughout the semester or something to encourage information retainment and not have the entirety of the grade come down to a final exam and paper only.",
                "I was excited about this class because I'm much more familiar with British history and was eager to learn. Unfortunately, lectures were chaotic and nearly impossible to follow. The professor struggled with technology, he provided only random lists of terms, and there was no clear path for his narrative. He needs to retire. Readings were not well chosen and frankly his own textbook is overpriced. The only strength was that our TA worked hard to pull valuable information together for section.",
                "Strength- interesting subject, Merriman is very knowledgable, not a lot of work or reading\r\n\r\nWeakness- class is super disorganized, impossible to follow, limited feedback.",
                "Strenghts: Merriman has a lot of knowledge about France and tis great to hear his anecdotes. He's super nice and a great guy. The TA staff was great, everyone was super understanding during the pandemic. \r\nWeaknesses: The course was a little unorganized during lectures.",
                "Strengths: Merriman is incredibly knowledgeable and a great person, first of all. Second, the course is pretty easy to follow insofar as the themes are consistent through the time period we studied (e.g., class, religion, gender, region), and it's just a matter of thinking of how they change and influence French society and politics over time. Weaknesses: Probably just that sometimes the information from lecture wasn't too related to the assignments in the class.",
                "Professor Merriman is phenomenal! His passion for and knowledge of the subject is inspiring. Sometimes it was difficult to follow the lectures because he doesn't use many slides, but I was always engaged even without the visual aids.",
                "Strengths: \r\nbroad, sizable, manageable list of primary and secondary sources\r\npersonal insights on Parisian culture and current political and social developments\r\nstructured syllabus with clear expectations\r\nresponsive to student input on courseload, content, and teaching style\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nmoves quickly with little time to discuss personal interests \r\nlectures can be meandering and sometimes irrelevant to course readings",
                "Professor Merriman shares a wealth of stories and anecdotes that add color and detail to the lecture material and I enjoyed hearing them. I also appreciated the quick lecture notes he would send before each class with the key terms although they could still be more organized.",
                "Merrimans lectures are interesting and he is very passionate about the subject. He gets into slightly off topic rants quite a bit which can be a strength or weakness depending on which way you look at it."

                "I would recommend it because of Professor Merriman! Very cool person to listen to, a very vibrant storyteller.",
                "No. It makes no sense to backload course assignments so that both a final research paper and a final exam are required. Weekly discussion question requirements on top of section are a waste of time. And, the class is poorly organized and poorly taught.",
                "Eh- if you are self-motivated and can study the history on your own, then yes. Do not expect to have a good grasp of the material by going to lecture. That being said, Merriman is funny and an interesting lecturer, he just goes off on tangents that aren't part of the course.",
                "If you want to learn about France from 1789-1871, this is obviously the course to do it.  Merriman is also a great lecturer, and his knowledge of the period is unparalleled.  You'll talk a lot about social history and class conflict, so don't be surprised when you skim over Napoleon and the countless wars of this period.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend it to someone who's interested in French history and\/or politics (this is a really turbulent and interesting period in French history), or someone who's just looking for a cool history course to take (I'm a history major but the last time I studied European history was in high school). The course content progresses in a way that's easy to understand, it's interesting content, and Merriman is a nice person and knows what he's talking about.",
                "Absolutely! This course is great for students who study history as well as those who have not taken a single course in the discipline. Professor Merriman is wonderful, so definitely try to take a class with him if you can.",
                "Would highly recommend this course for any student interested in learning the basics of French history, especially in its most influential period relevant for today \r\nIt provides a working general understanding of French history and the origins of current political and social state for students of many backgrounds, although a deep interest in French history and language is helpful",
                "Yes, if you are interested in learning more about French or European history and how the country developed its political and social identity in this time period.",
                "Definitely. Great way of learning this history with an incredibly interesting professor."
