            "comments": [
                "This course would be improved by allowing for more time to work on the final experiments. If materials lists and initial proposals were required earlier, it would have allowed for more than one week to fit all 8 groups experiments in. The TAs were incredibly helpful all throughout this course. They were very responsive and did a lot to facilitate reports and learning.",
                "Mobin, Haoyu, and Professor Pahlavan are very easy to reach over email, and they are also receptive to feedback. The course was heavy in the beginning, and major adjustments were made immediately to address the lab times which helped ease the load but I did not feel that it compromised the learning. Mobin and Haoyu were very patient and helpful during the labs, and they made lab fun. There was a lot of feedback given on lab reports which is appreciated. The MATLAB codes were very helpful.\r\n\r\nSome of the earlier lectures on the whiteboard were difficult to follow, and the connection to that week's lab wasn't clear. I liked the PPTs that had the background but also introduced some pictures and observations from the lab. The final project worked out alright, but I wish there was another week or two built in at the end for the final project, because the timeline was very tight. It also was difficult to come up with a project that made sense and understand it, because I don't have very much experience with fluid mechanics. I think that it would have been more effective to have a list of projects (research questions with a schematic of the setup and some literature references), and then have students come up with hypotheses and go from there.",
                "The lectures weren't very helpful - it was difficult to make the connection between what was covered in lecture and what's in that week's lab. The final project was useful in some ways but was done in a disorganized manner, making it stressful. Mobin and Haoyu were great.",
                "The lab was very engaging and more focused on the hands-on experience than correct results, which was very helpful for learning and applying the material. Due to some complications, the final lab was pushed back a week, which left less time for the final project, which was a bit more stressful.",
                "Strengths: this is by far the best overhaul of a course that was previously notorious for being one of the nightmare courses of the MENG department. The labs have been restructured to take far less time while still effectively demonstrating and teaching the concepts, and the lab reports are much more manageable. Professor Amir is understanding, a great lecturer, and is very supportive with help as well. It's a bit difficult to parse his handwriting at times during lecture, however. The final project's timeframe was also pretty rushed.",
                "The course was run very well. A big strength was the focus on the experiment rather than the data analysis.",
                "This course was GREATLY improved from what I have heard about it from past students. The labs were interesting, well run and organized, and office hours were frequent and helpful. The main strength of this class were the TA's Mobin and Haoyu, who helped immensely with doing lab analysis, were always available for questions, and who provided so much help during our final projects. The one weakness was that the final projects had a very fast turnover. This was not an issue for me personally, but having eight lab groups come in throughout one week was presumably very tough on the TA's who were always present and helping out. Besides this, there were really no weaknesses, I thoroughly enjoyed the class and feel like I learned a lot, and also think the teaching team did an amazing job restructuring this course!",
                "The course was taught well, I liked the structure of the lecture once a week to discuss the theory behind the experiment that we were doing that week. The course could have included more thermo labs, there were more fluids labs than thermo labs.",
                "I think this course is strong. The assignments were interesting and I found the workload to be reasonable, even coming in with roughly no lab experience. My only comment is that occasionally, the instructions on the lab handout included things we didn't need to do, or alternatively did not include something that was expected in the lab report (more discussion on a certain topic, an instruction to analyze errors). It would be nice if these small inconsistencies were resolved.",
                "This course has improved so much since the new teaching team took over. The biggest strength was the reimagined course structure and purpose. Focusing on just learning how to do the experiments and analyze the data with real-world tools was a MUCH better use of time than trying to write full papers each week while crunching data on Excel.",
                "The biggest strength of the course was Mobin Alipour. He is one of the most accessible instructors I have ever had at Yale, being very friendly and welcoming of questions, encouraging of curiosity, and never expecting us to know more than we do. He was very responsive to emails and could be reached in person at many hours every day. His explanations of fluids concepts were very understandable and he was always happy to talk about whatever was most interesting to us. \r\n\r\nAnother strength was that the lab handouts gave very useful and concise background on the lab, and lab reports didn't take away from the learning with unnecessary busywork. I learned a lot from using the MATLAB templates provided, and I like that most of the focus on the lab reports was understanding the experiment and the significance of the results. \r\n\r\nI think the lectures in this course could be improved to either give us more time to understand the math behind the experiments, or to better highlight the important parts of the math because I was often a little confused during the lectures. However, doing the actual experiments and analysis made a lot more sense and I was able to learn the material in that way.",
                "Would have benefitted from a solid rubric and more direct/planned out classes. I think this will come with time considering this was the professor's first time teaching the class. Also, the work load could be increased earlier to ensure that the last two weeks aren't as packed with a seventh lab and a final experiment, presentation, and report."

                "Yes, if it's taught by Professor Amir. The labs are actually really cool and excellent at demonstrating concepts previously covered in fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. It's sometimes hard to follow Professor Amir during lecture; it's recommended to sit near the front to clearly hear him and see his writing. The TAs were also awesome and very appreciated when help was needed.",

I learned a lot through reading papers, building the setup, and conducting the experiment for the final project which was a cool way to learn.",
                "I think this course had reasonable expectations, exposed me to new techniques, and was well supported. It isn't an area of personal interest for me, but if it were for a prospective student, I would recommend it.",
