                "Strengths of the course are in the very fair workload and Zhou Laoshi is an excellent teacher and mentor. The weaknesses are that the course is not structured like a usual language course at Yale, so you are not held accountable in your learning. If you want a more challenging course that forces you to maintain your Chinese level, this is not it. But if you want a chill course where you discuss interesting topics, then this course is great.",
                "I think that this course is designed well to facilitate student learning. It is a very flexible course, and I think it is great for students who want to learn with Professor Zhou or who have an interest in Current Affairs.",
                "The course is taught more as a lecture than seminar. It was difficult because our section had majority fluent Chinese speakers which made it hard for non-native speakers to participate in discussions. I feel that the lack of conversational practice was a real weakness of the course for non-native speakers who had already spent a year on Zoom. As a result, my vocabulary and writing skills improved over the semester while my speaking and listening comprehension declined.",
                "Strengths: Zhou Laoshi  he is a gem! Classes are always engaging, he makes the content fun to work with and is a great teacher!",
                "Very organized class!",
                "It is very good in that it teaches you a ton of relevant vocab, but it can feel very unstructured at time.",
                "The best part about this class is that it is self-guided - zhou lao shi allows you to do as much or as little work as you want and focus on whatever subject you want. This is also the weakness of the class because some will take it as an opportunity to slack off"

                "If you are a native speaker and you can understand the gist of Chinese news articles, this course would not do much for you. The course focuses a lot more on understanding news than writing one of your own. That said, this is a pretty chill course and if you just want to clear a language requirement, this won't be a bad choice.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Zhou is a super understanding, flexible, and kind professor and I think taking any course with him will be a blast.",
                "I would recommend this course, specifically taught by Zhou laoshi, as a fun way to continue learning Chinese past the L5 level. However, I would caution that if the class is mostly native speakers, as ours was, that conversational practice will be at a minimum.",
                "Yes. It is very useful and Zhou Laoshi is the best, but the workload is seriously high.",
                "Yes! Zhou lao shi is one of the greatest teachers I've ever had. He really cares about his students and if you are eager to learn, he will do everything he can to help you"
