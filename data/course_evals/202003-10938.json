I also developed a better sense of how to edit my pieces--what sorts of words and phrases should be cut, how to organize sections in a reported essay, and how to structure the piece around a broader, public point. \r\n\r\nIt was also wonderful to have two guest lecturers, Brooke Jarvis and Charles Siebert, come in to talk about their work as journalists. It was valuable to hear the honest perspectives of these journalists--one young and one older--and consider how journalism might fit into our own lives someday. These guest lecturers were certainly a highlight of the course.",
                "I learned to widen my thinking about what constituted \"writing about the environment\"; I learned a lot from the reading, from more casual discussions with Prof. Burdick in class, and from workshopping work with classmates. Concretely, I really enjoyed the opportunity to strengthen skills in terms of writing about the outdoors, which was something I didn't feel particularly comfortable with going in. The expectation to attend office hours frequently was also helpfulI think I gained a lot from just being able to talk things out with Professor Burdick, and I think that if this had not been a requirement, I would've felt a little bad going to office hours so much.",
                "In the first part of the semester, I learned about writing short stories. We thought about it as a microcosm and read many different pieces that were related to this style of writing. The majority of the semester focused on writing longer pieces. We looked at a lot nature pieces\/article in the NYT and The New Yorker. This gave me insight into how the article-writing process worked. It made me really appreciate the work put into articles like these. This classes taught me to get out of comfort zone of academic writing and explore different (admittedly, way more fun) styles of writing.",

                "I particularly enjoyed in-class writing assignments, such as interviewing classmates about memories or interests, and then writing a few paragraphs about them. I thought that these were excellent ways of forming friendships during a remote semester. \r\n\r\nProfessor Burdick mentioned that his wife is also a very accomplished journalist. I wonder if she might be able to talk to students in future classes about her work. I'm not sure if it's exactly related to science journalism, but I thought that it could be enriching for students if she was willing to talk to the class.",
                "I think the class discussions and exercises were very engaging. We were given very interesting readings. None of it required extensive analysis into the meaning behind the text which I enjoyed. Rather, we focuses on analyzing syntax, story structure, voice, tense, narrative tension, and other elements that help to shape an engaging piece. I really liked the guests that Professor Burdick brought to class because it was insightful to learn about not only their writing process but also their journey to get to where they are now. The small writing exercises that we had in class were very fun too.\r\n\r\nA weakness of this course was communication outside of class. Although Professor Burdick was responsive with messages and flexible with office hour appointments, we were sometimes given readings a day before class. Sometimes, my peers and I were confused on what our assignment was before class. It was also hard to get an understanding of where we stood in the class, grades-wise. However, I understand that this may have been done to allow us to focus on improving as a writer rather than quantifying how we were doing. These weaknesses were minor and there were definitely way more strengths."

                "Professor Burdick was always kind and flexible with deadlines and reading workload. I found that this flexibility was immensely helpful in performing well this semester. I think that at times, our discussions could have been richer had students read more of the readings. Perhaps it could be useful to establish dates by which students must read certain pieces, but while trimming down the total amount of reading for the course.\r\n\r\nProfessor Burdick also scheduled one of our meeting times for the evening to accommodate a student in a different time zone.",
                "I think the fact that this course was so small this semester (I'm not sure if this was purposeful or not) really ended up working to its advantage. I felt like I was able to develop relationships with my classmates that I wouldn't have been able to otherwise online, because Zoom is so tough in that way. I also really appreciated breaking the seminar into two meeting timesover an hour is just so hard on Zoom, and I think that the class was much more manageable, and that we had much better discussions, because of the shorter meeting times. I didn't feel like I had trouble focusing\/being present in class like I did in longer seminars. As a small note, I do wish that we hadn't had the second meeting in the evening (from 8-9pm). I felt like I couldn't say I was unavailable during this time, because I was available, and I didn't want to prevent the class from finding a meeting time that worked! But I do feel that evenings, especially late evenings, should be protected time, and I would have really rather had the time slots on the table for the second meeting be time slots in Yale's typically class times (weekdays, 9-5ish?).",

                "don't be fooled by the 3 assignments for this course. it is a LOT of work. one week i spent 10-15 hours just interviewing people and gathering interview notes. please don't take this class if we're still in a pandemic next year",
                "Yes--without a doubt. This class was one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Yale, and inspired me to continue writing and journalism. Professor Burdick defines \"environment\" in a very loose way--you can write about both natural phenomena and human-made spaces. This broad definition of \"environment\" allowed me to think more deeply about the spaces that we create for ourselves, and how those spaces interact with broader social systems. \r\n\r\nProfessor Burdick also structures the course in a way that students have plenty of time to do a good job on their reporting pieces. Since there aren't very many assignments, you should be ready to hold yourself accountable to conducting interviews and revising your writing without strict deadlines. If you do push yourself to stay on schedule with your work in the class, you can explore different topics at great depth. \r\n\r\nProfessor Burdick is also connected with journalists at The New York Times and other major newspapers and magazines. We had several guest lecturers in the class, and their comments were very rewarding for a young journalist (or just young writers in general).",
                "Yesthis is a great course. Professor Burdick is fantastiche will spend a lot of time on you and your work, and shares a lot about his own work and experiences. I felt a community in this class, probably both because it was so small and because Prof. Burdick requires you to attend office hours frequently, so we all formed working relationships with him in addition to each other. I also appreciated how much time we spent on revisionI feel like I left the class with two fairly polished pieces of writing that I'm proud of. Finally, I really appreciated and enjoyed the writer visits!",
                "Yes! It is definitely in the top 5 courses I've taken at Yale. If you are remotely interested in writing about environmental topics (very broad!) in the style of what you see in popular journals, magazine, and newspapers then this is definitely the course for you. We also read select pieces from nature books and short stories. It introduced me to a whole side of writing that I knew little to nothing about. The guest speakers were amazing because they are super passionate about what they do. Professor Burdick is very knowledgeable, kind, and caring! The content he brought to us through this class made me realize that this will be be field that I will involve myself in.",
