                "Strength: Professor was very engaging and the material was very interesting. I really liked how we went over a topic in broader terms at the beginning and then dug into the math and the details once we had established a basic understanding. \r\n\r\nWeakness: We only met once a week. I wish we could have met more! I loved coming to class. If you had to miss a week, you fell behind pretty easily.",
                "Strength: Prof Chalioti is extremely organized and kind; the content is very interesting; workload is manageable \r\nWeakness: could be difficult if you aren't good at intermediate micro because the course only meets once a week and the content moves fast.",
                "No weakness, just strengths. Eva is such a great professor and wants you to succeed.",
                "Strengths: very well-structured lectures with interesting examples. Psets and exams are very manageble.\r\nWeakness: basically none, except that I would like to see more AI-related materials.",
                "Good",
                "Professor Chalioti is an incredible professor and her lectures are so well organized. She is so passionate about the topics she teaches and is awesome at explaining difficult topics. There is also a lot of help with the problem sets, which is great. The content can be quite challenging at times, but she takes care to explain topics in detail and makes really fair exams. The assignments are also really fun!",
                "Strengths: a good introduction to pricing under more complicated circumstances that what is taught in intermediate microeconomics. The class is straightforward and has a fairly low weekly time requirement. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: does not have a substantial focus on AI innovation beyond the weekly student presentations.",
                "Strengths: Really interesting and engaging topics. Problem sets facilitated learning, and class was well-taught/organized. Industry analysis project was great, and final exam was very fair.\r\nWeaknesses: None. (Though would've been nice to get more feedback on our industry analyses.)"

                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in innovation and AI (in any industry). It's two hour, once a week seminar in which we spend about 2/3 of the class listening to Prof Chalioti lecturing, and the rest is student presentation. Workload is definitely manageable and the content is super interesting. Prof Chalioti designed the course extremely well, so we cover different topic almost every week (which means things move fast). If you can get a spot in this course, please take it!!",

                "Yes.",
                "Good",
                "Yes! This is a great class if you want to get both pre-professional exposure about things like patents, prizes, and industry analyses, but it also gives you very good mathematical backing of advanced microeconomic theory. It can be quite challenging at times, but if you do the psets and take time to understand the concepts for each week, it should be alright. It's a cool class and it feels more hands-on than any other class I've taken at Yale. Professor Chalioti also makes sure to include a lot of real-life examples and we got great insights into innovation and AI in many different sectors.",
                "Yes if youre looking for a easy 400 level course and want to learn some new topics at a comfortable pace.",
