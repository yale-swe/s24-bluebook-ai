   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about 17th century France, especially French literature.",
    "I knew nothing about the history of Versailles or Louis XIV before this class. I learned so much about the architecture, the grand parties, and politics of the time. Now I feel that I can visit Versailles and have a greater appreciation for its complexity.",
    "This was the first specialized course I had taken in the French department. It allowed me to learn about the 17th Century in France in great depth. It gave a very complete picture, by including both canonical and less-studied authors. It represented many different literary forms, including novels, poems and plays.",
    "I definitely improved my French speaking and writing, as well as learning about the ways to think about 17th century literature through a critical lens.",
    "I read a lot of important literature from the time of the building of Versailles. I also got a sense of the mass propaganda regarding Versailles and France's image in its early days of nationhood.",
    "In this course I developed by spoken French, my vocabulary, and my ability to read difficult and old texts. With every text, I learned how to think more critically about its language, consider its author and context, and to question its intentions. I really struggled in the beginning of the semester to read the old texts, but it became noticeably easier with practice over the semester. Throughout the semester, I also began to develop a more critical eye for how texts served subtly as critiques or as propaganda. I also think that writing an informal page about each text really helped me develop my writing throughout the semester.",
    "My reading comprehension and writing skills increased dramatically in this course.",
    "This course was an extremely valuable opportunity to engage with primary source material and think critically about received narratives about the Early Modern period. That it was taught in French meant that, in addition to rigorous historical study, anglophone students were able to practice using their French in an academic environment and to read challenging French texts that would not be taught in a typical language class, something useful for anybody looking to improve language skills or thinking about doing archival work in their second language.",
    "This class helped me develop my reading and writing skills as well as my French conversational skills. Prof. Schuwey really helped show me how to think twice about texts I am reading and to engage more deeply with them. I really do see the world, and Versailles, slightly differently after taking this course.",
    "I learned how to read 17th century French texts and analyze how propaganda works, from the grammatical level to the contextual history surrounding the documents. I also learned about drawing comparisons between the Versailles of Louis XIV and the current Versailles as it stands as a tourist attraction."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this course overall. Some of the reading was a little dense. I do wish there had been a bit more focus on art history or architecture, but maybe my expectations of the class just weren't correct.\r\nIf you want to dive deep into a niche subject, then this is a good class for you. A lot of courses at Yale are surveys of big subjects, so it was exciting to feel like an expert on one topic.",
    "I found the some of the readings very hard to understand and painfully long in length. I often felt that if I read slowly to actually understand the material I would never finish the reading in full.",
    "The detail is wonderful. The instructor led very lively class discussions.",
    "strength: great conversations\r\nweakness: homework length fluctuated a lot.",
    "The readings in this class were really engaging and interacted well with the themes of the course. I thought the reading responses, while helpful, were a bit too long and frequent. Also, the papers (in particular, the final paper) were a LOT of work and research, probably more writing than the average writing credit, and this is in French!",
    "One major weakness was the lack of plain historical background knowledge. Perhaps a way to improve the course would be to introduce each piece of reading or each unit with a 15 minute, multimedia lecture on the relevant historical background needed to understand the piece. The state of the Catholic Church in France is a perfect example of background that might have helped students understand Tartuffe more clearly.",
    "I think that Professor Schuwey designed this course extremely well, and I really appreciated all of the texts that he chose for us to read. Even when I struggled to understand the relevance of a text on my own, class discussion always revealed really interesting take aways. I also really appreciated how much the themes of this course extend far beyond 17th century French history. Professor Schuwey helped us understand how we can take these approaches to study nearly any piece of writing from any period of history. He also made each discussion feel really relevant to our lives today by connecting each theme with modern society. \r\n\r\nI did feel that the workload wasn't consistent throughout the semester. I sometimes felt overwhelmed by the quantity of reading for each class, especially when the reading between Monday and Wednesday was long and required a written page for discussion. These assignments could be pretty hard to balance with my other courses, and I know that students are typically much busier in the beginning of the week. That being said, I do think that the written page about each text really helped me to think more deeply about the material.",
    "Strengths: different mediums of learning (videos, paintings, readings, etc.)\r\nWeaknesses: differing levels of capacity of French understanding and levels of speech.",
    "- fascinating discussion of important historical and historiographical themes\r\n- excellent selection of challenging primary source material that facilitated strong thematic discussion\r\n- an interesting opportunity to learn more about Early Modern Europe. But, more importantly, the course will encourage students to rethink things that they already thought they knew.",
    "Strengths: the seminars are mostly engaging and many of the texts are super interesting. I particularly liked La Promenade de Versailles and Le Favori. I enjoyed how we would start off with one text, and then slowly read more until we realized that the first one is complete propaganda. The structure of the class is great. I also think the reading the responses were good, but it might be nice to make them later than 8 pm, as I often found I didn't have enough time to write something good in that timeframe. My only real criticism is about the papers. Although we didn't get much guidance, it didn't really bother me as I felt the papers were so open-ended that it didn't really matter. However, it might have been nice to submit drafts, at least for the final. Also, the final was too long, and I felt like I had a hard time finding enough sources and arguments to write around 4000 words.",
    "Strengths: Seminar conversations were quite interesting, and Professor Schuwey was always enthusiastic. He is a great discussion leader, and encourages you to think critically and to work through your ideas (as inarticulate as they might be, in my case) in French. \r\nWeaknesses: The reading load was sometimes unbalancedsome weeks were really light while others were pretty heavy and a bit unreasonable. Also, I think the central point about how writers managed to spread the propaganda of Louis XIV was a bit overplayedit seemed to be the concluding note on the majority of seminar meetings. So, I think some more diversity in themes could be helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! Professor Schuwey is wonderful. He's very passionate about the topic and it shows. He's very sweet and really cares about his students a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other french students but I would warn them of the workload. It is definitely a jump from the 100-level courses.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student of French literature and culture. The 17th Century was a time of extraordinary creative output in France and this course offers a very good overview of this, while the longer written assignments allow students to further explore a particular text or object that interests them.",
    "yes! but the student should be very comfortable with French prior to taking the course.",
    "This class is a lot of work, but the material is really interesting and Christophe definitely has a unique perspective on the readings. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Schuwey chose really interesting texts, and it was a great experience to be able to use materials from the Beinecke a couple times throughout the semester. It pushed me to develop my French, as well as taught me to think much more critically about readings. The reading and writing skills I took from this class are relevant far beyond studying French history and can really be applied to any field. Professor Schuwey also made every discussion really engaging and fun, and I always enjoyed being in class. This has been one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would but only if you are willing to put in the work. This is not an easy french credit, and is meant for students with a deep history in French language and history.",
    "I would recommend this course to anybody:\r\n- looking to exercise their French language skills\r\n- wanting to challenge preconceived notions about an oft-discussed historical epoch\r\n- interested in Early Modern society, culture, and literature; monarchies; book history; the way that certain histories must be excavated from the archive; women in Early Modern France",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to someone who wants to take a seminar that is genuinely just really interesting but also really challenges them to think in a very deep way. This is the first seminar I have taken at Yale that I have really enjoyed and I am very grateful for it. It is what a seminar should be.",
    "Yes! It is a great course to learn about the history behind a famous tourist destination, as well as to strengthen your skills in French (especially with reading old texts and conducting historical research). Professor Schuwey is a very charismatic and informative teacher, and he makes 17th century France really interesting to learn and talk about. The workload is rather heavy and constant, with 1-page responses due each week for reading that is often long and difficult. The final paper is also kind of a behemoth, but you learn a lot in the process and really get to dive deep into a topic that you're interested in."
