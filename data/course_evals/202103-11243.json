There were moments when this class felt like it was going so fast, however, that it was difficult to truly internalize all its content.",
                "Great instructor and engagement in class. Learning by talking in class and applying the concepts. Could be improved by laying out the grammar concepts a little clearer in class.",
                "this was an amazing course and i really like the way it was taught, very organized and efficient but also fun",
                "This class is very strong in the range of material covered and the speed with which we learned it. The everyday quizzes are tough in workload but very conducive to fast learning. Also, because you meet every day, you get very close with your classmates and there are very low stakes in terms of making errors or not knowing how to say something. One weakness of class is that you move on from material very quickly, which makes it hard to remember vocab a few weeks down the line.",
                "Daily lessons are really good for constant learning of vocab.\r\nWhere I stood on grading was unclear until very late in the semester.",
                "This course has daily quizzes which I thought were helpful but were sometimes unpredictable. The class had great energy though sometimes doing the same thing every say got a bit monotonous. Also Michael does not hand anything back in a reasonable amount of time.",
                "This course is very hands-on, practicing the language daily. Only speaking in Italian helps immensely in practicing understanding the language. A way to improve this course for me personally would be to focus more on sentence structure: things like where to place modifiers, etc."

We cover a lot of material but in a way that feels very manageable. Tests are spaced out nicely in a way that helps you remember the material but don't add too much pressure. I love this class!! Definitely take it!",
