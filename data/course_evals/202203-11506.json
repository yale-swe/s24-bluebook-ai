                "I improved my academic writing significantly. I strengthened my foundation and learned a lot from the basics all the way to specific details. I learned a lot about the course topic awe, which positively shaped me as a person and broadened my view of life.",
                "We covered a vast array of writers and writing while exploring the topic of Awe from journals, research papers, poetic writing, etc. We also explored various ways of experiencing and perceiving awe to help inform and encourage us to include experiential aspects to our papers. We started the class with some personal ideas of awe, but going out on field trips and experiencing different forms of awe served to greatly enrich our writing. We also did a lot of workshopping of each others' work. The great thing about this course is that unlike other writing courses where professors spend a lot of time workshopping students' writing in front of everyone, we were encouraged to share and build each other up. It was also a really great environment to experiment and push ourselves with our topics and styles.",
                "This course not only taught me about appreciating the little things in my first semester at Yale, but it gave me valuable lessons for me to carry throughout the rest of my life. I learned how to go from argumentative writing, to critical analysis, to research papers, to journals. This course made me realize that the awe experience is not just a beautiful nature scene, but it is fear, overwhelming joy, the people you experience it with, and the journey to get to the experience. I learned writing is like this too. A journey of delving deeper into the author's writing and going farther than just the surface. I learned how to approach life in listening to my peers and respecting all different perspectives on an individual topic.",
                "Writing more effectively, efficiently, and creatively; translating research into formally written papers and presentations; digesting difficult texts; becoming aware of writing resources in the university setting",
                "Lots of little tips and tricks on writing and the psychological features and effects of awe, but also how to find joy in the little things in life, how to appreciate the everyday beauty all around us, and rethinking what academic learning looks like.",
                "Incredible course exploring the mysteries that make us human, with a huge focus on the writing process. Tons of freedom with essays and low pressure environment to ideate and collaborate."

                "Strenghts: Great selected readings. The reading load was luckily not bad at all. I think the assignments were designed very well to teach students valuable skills on academic writing, close reading, using sources, doing research etc. \r\nWeakness: Overall workload is high because there is a lot of writing and you have to be super engaged with the course to stay on top of it, but all of this doesn't matter if your schedule allows you to do so.",
                "The course is extremely well organized. The amount of work you do and the effort you put in directly correlates to the grade you'll get. You also really have to \"show up\" in class to participate and to support your classmates. This builds a better bond between classmates and the professor. \r\n\r\nWe were fortunate to have really incredible students in this class so when they had their turns leading classes, it was always a great experience. I could see this not being the case if there were students who were just taking the class to check a box.",
                "The strengths of this course included the fact that the seminar style of the course allowed for there to be inclusive discussion and in depth peer review. I also think the course had wonderfully planned field trips that gave for many different learning opportunities while also giving me a chance to explore the rest that the campus has to offer. This course also followed a grading contract based system, which was less stressful and extremely immersive way to engage in the content and assignment given to us. The assignments of this class were each exciting to do in their own ways as well.",
                "Strengths: very well taught; professor was very passionate about the subject; professor was fair with grading and implemented a spectacular contract grading system that alleviated stress for all students; best writing class I have ever taken \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Super wholesome class that often didnt even feel like a class, a supportive environment if you want to be a little more confident in your writing. My only piece of feedback is that I was a bit disappointed our Beinecke field trip didnt actually include a tour of the Beineckethat would have been so perfect for a class on awe! Also, the They Say\/I Say book on writing had good advice and was not too dry, but with limited time I didnt always have the motivation to read it thoroughly.",
                "strengths: Professor Coleman is compassionate and intentional in her teaching. Everyone got a chance to lead class and practice both leadership and creativity."

                "I'd absolutely recommend this course unless the student is trying just to check a box. Then no, I would not recommend it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. You do not need to be a STEM major or humanities major to fully enjoy this course. I would say that this course is not just an english class. It is a fully immersive experience in reveling in the present and writing to enjoy the journey and not writing for chore or for simply a grade. Overall, this class teaches valuable lessons about life and the open discussions that are encouraged are truly engaging. There are even instances where students are allowed to lead a class and these are especially inspirational days.",
                "Absolutely - it is a great introduction to writing at the undergraduate level.",
                "Yes!!! I came away feeling much more confident about my college-level writing. But this class was about SO much more than writing. We read psychological research and personal research about what awe is, what its features are, some ways it can be invoked, what its effects are, and the optimal way to experience it. But really, I felt this class was an exploration of what living and learning can be as a person. We went on a number of fun and wholesome field trips to the Yale Farm, Yale University Art Gallery, Silliman courtyard (with the Yale landscaping manager), etc. One of our classes was just a guided meditation led by a fellow student. We practiced how to live in the moment, to take joy in the everyday, to appreciate all the hidden beauty of nature and the world. We each also got an opportunity to organize one of these field trips or be the teacher for the day, which was a valuable skill to learn. Most people who have taken an English 114 class will rave about it, but I would especially recommend one with Professor Coleman if you want a wholesome and relaxing time on top of improving your writing.",
