                "Strengths: great lecture format, many resources for studying for exams, super nice professor and TAs\r\nWeaknesses: the quizzes. I'm the type of learner who needs reinforcement and practice problems, so the quizzes really stressed me out rather than facilitate learning. I would have rather had quizzes that you had to retake until you got 100%, so that way I was really learning but less stressed about the grade.",
                "Strengths: Professor Humphries does an admirable job of trying to make the class engaging. And the material you learn is important if you want to go further in economics research. \r\nWeaknesses: It's partially because of Zoom, and partially because of the material, but engagement was quite low. The class also asks too much time of its students. 2 1.15 hour lectures, a 50 min discussion section, and an additional 30 min-1.15 min R lecture every week is not necessary.",
                "The midterm and final were open note, but not exactly sure if exams are the best way to test students knowledge when there are more pressing matters (i.e. a pandemic)",
                "Strengths: Great lectures and a lot of help available if needed. Very reasonable problem sets that still make you think. And usually one every two weeks which was really nice. I thought this class was organized really well so props to Prof Humphries and the TFs\r\nWeaknesses: I don't know a solution for this but people are coming in with very varied experience levels. I already am really familiar with R as well as statistics\/regression so most of the class was review and not super engaging",
                "sometimes difficult to follow along during in-person lectures, so I would always watch the recorded lectures- I could rewind or speed up that way. I think the pace could get too fast sometimes and I would lose track of what the prof was explaining during class. I liked doing the psets bc I really got to apply what I was learning. It always made more sense when doing the examples.",
                "I think overall this is a great course. The only problem was that, at the time of each lecture, I felt that a ton of material was being thrown at me all at once and then I had to digest it on my own.",
                "Really really good course. Everything was neatly presented, slides and section notes were excellent. Easily the best course infrastructure of any class I took this semester.",
                "The lectures are very long and I found that this forced the lecturer to rush through the slides, without giving me time to really digest the content.",
                "Strengths: we talk about some really fascinating concepts\r\nWeaknesses: it's a lot to process, especially over remote learning",
                "Strengths: the class is well organized and there were multiple different resources of help (i.e. lots of office hours, online R lectures, etc.)",
                "I thought all of the material for the course was more than necessary for myself and too much at points. Some of the live lectures meandered and discussion sections were just not very helpful. The material was great and once you got the understanding of concepts it was really cool stuff, but the amount of necessary hoops you had to go through were sometimes too much. The psets were good, you had one due every two weeks and that was fine and well with some interesting things on the psets, and the lectures were overall fine with the added benefit that you could go through them at your own speed with the recorded lectures plus notes.",
                "This course is outstanding, even though it is difficult and fast-paced. The material is interesting, but most of all, the resources available to students are incredible. Professor Humphries and the TAs, especially those who answer Piazza questions, were tremendously helpful in this course. The quality of answers on Piazza--some that looked like they took 20 minutes+ to write out--were very helpful in piecing together some of the more challenging topics of this course. The course is difficult, but students have plenty of resources to do well.\r\n\r\nI think that it might have been helpful to have a little bit more time on instrumental variables, or at least a longer problem set to practice. I understand that the instructors may have been giving us a shorter problem set due to Thanksgiving break (thank you, if so!), but I did have to look up some additional examples and explanations of IVs on the internet prior to the final exam. \r\n\r\nI also would have loved to do a final research project, but it kind of crept up on me. I also felt like I didn't quite know where to get data and things like that. Maybe the instructors could record a video for students interested in research projects and explain how to go about writing a proposal or finding datasets on the internet.",
                "I personally think this course has more weaknesses than strengths. The strengths hands-down would be the TFs and the overwhelming amount of out-of-class resources available to students. The many many hours of office hours were literally essential to honing concepts and completing problem sets. In terms of weaknesses, this course definitely was one where the professor read off the slides. The lectures were synchronous but I didn't see why they had to be because I didn't view the professor as really teaching the material, more guiding us through connected topics, but those aren't the same thing. Less about the professor, I personally think this course would benefit a lot from being flippedthat is, watching a pre-recorded lecture before class, then coming in and working on problems in breakout rooms or just further breaking down concepts in the big lecture format, similar to section, which is the one \"in-class\" time during this course that I really enjoyed and looked forward to because that's where I got most of my conceptual understanding. I think that a flipped course would also help students prepare more for quizzes. I felt I underperformed on quizzes because it was always the first time I received test-like problems after weeks of just going through equations. (In contrast, we received a lot of past exams for the midterm and final, so I felt a lot more prepared.) Additionally, I understand that the course itself is very in flux, but I found it really disorienting the jumps from theory to R. R seemed to be emphasized a lot only for us not to be tested on it, and again, I felt like we didn't spend enough class time actually going over how to apply the theory we were learning (so bridging the gap between the equation and applying that equation on a problem). The gap between R and theory definitely improved after the mid-term. This may be because I had a better grip on the course itself, but also it made more sense what we were doing in R since you quite literally can't do, say multivariate OLS regression, by hand. (Side note: I really liked the R lectures by themselves. They were clear, and I find R quite fun.)",
                "The topics are closely related to real-life applications and there are always sufficient empirical examples used for consolidating the knowledge.",
                "Strengths Very organized, made studying very easy, Due dates were always made clear (and flexibility on psets and quizzes were very nice)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Included a lot of material in each lecture (sometimes too many examples)",
                "Didn't work well over COVID. Lectures weren't very clear. Not a lot of resources to learn outside of that.",
                "Tests were fair",
                "Pretty well structured and continuously adapted to student feedback. Lecture slides and general notation could probably have been clearer.",
                "The discussion sections and office hours were very helpful in summarizing and applying the information from class. Sometimes the lecture was a little dry but Professor Humphries was very eager to answer any questions from students during the lecture. Sometime that would create 10 second silences while Professor Humphries was reading the questions, but overall really rewarding and well-taught class.",
                "strengths: organization, clarity\r\nweaknesses: pace",
                "The course was very fast paced. I felt as if I learned a lot but at the same time it was difficult to retain all of the information provided.",
                "This was an ordinary lecture course and I feel like the teacher taught it very well. There were many office hours and many teaching fellows available to help whenever.",
                "On top of two lectures per week, we also had to watch 1 recorded R lecture per week, which was a lot.",
                "I thought the course was really well run! Actually one of the stronger economics courses I've taken at Yale. The slides are really good, and Professor Humphries is a great instructor.",
                "This course is very organized and facilities learning",
                "Strengths: The lectures and psets offer a good mix of theoretical concepts and empirical examples. Professor Humphries tried to include numerous real-world research and examples in the lectures, which were helpful for us to see statistics at work. The slides were also super clear so it was easy to go back and review key concepts. The course materials are organized nicely on Canvas and it's always easy to locate files for any given lecture\/section.\r\nWeaknesses: This isn't a major weakness, but I really wished the course had pushed me to learn more R skills. The psets could've been more challenging with regard to R, instead of just asking us to plug variables into given R formulas.",
                "It was great to be able to watch the lectures recorded and stop them to take notes or rewatch later.\r\n\r\nHowever, the professor occasionally overcomplicated topics. I understand if some students require more clarity, but sometimes the excessive explanations in lecture meant I learnt much more in section.",
                "I felt that this course was very fast-paced and hard to follow. I think that it was hard to keep up with the material during lectures. I had to rewatch the lectures a lot.",
                "Strengths: Prof Humphries is a great teacher and the slides reinforce previously learned material. Heavy empirical emphasis rather than theoretical work. Exams were also fair with an appropriate mix of questions at the right difficulty. Piazza questions answered quickly and with detail.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "Strengths: Instructor explains concepts in great detail and clearly.\r\nWeaknesses: Assignments insufficient for reviewing concepts learned in class.",
                "Professor Humphries is a great professor, he is super accommodating, and he made the class very engaging. The problem sets are due every other week which, if you're a major procrastinator, can make a lot of work pile up very quickly. You need to have a lot of time management skills to be on top of all the work.",
                "I really wish this could have been an in-person class, because I struggled a lot studying by myself. I found the course rather difficult, and even though having a section every Friday was helpful, the TFs were not the best at teaching, so there was a bit of a struggle there as well. I think it would be helpful to go over some more problems in class, since most of what we do in live lecture is very conceptual.",
                "Prof. Humphries really cares about his students and wants to make sure that they all have lots of opportunities to get support and to understand the material, whether it's through additional R lectures, sections, office hours, Piazza, and\/or email. The course itself is quite well organized and goes through a ton of material (which is both super difficult and super rewarding once it's over). However, I'd say a weakness of this course is that it doesn't translate well over a Zoom lecture. For me and a lot of my classmates, it's inexplicably and inexorably more difficult to pay attention during Zoom lectures; I experienced this unexplained and never before experienced phenomenon of being so completely confused during class but also ridiculously bored and unable to pay attention to be less confused. This I'd say would be my fault, but I came across a lot of my friends who felt the same way. Maybe there could be more breaks, examples (especially drawn on a whiteboard), and in-class discussion. Another weakness was the quizzes, which I personally really struggled on because there weren't enough examples in class and enough comprehension questions\/discussion to truly understand the concepts just yet, and here I was being tested with pretty tough questions (where I couldn't even go backwards!) that were only one try and for a grade. I think the experience would be much less stressful and provide for much greater improvement on the student level for hard-working students (not just students who understand the concepts immediately or have had prior exposure) if the quizzes were unlimited attempts, like I've experienced in a couple other classes over the remote semester.",
                "Sometimes the content moved very slow and others very fast, although its hard to get this right for everyone given the class size.\r\nWished there was more example questions in the lectures themselves.",
                "The course could drag at times. I found it very hard to pay attention during class. Granted the content is kind of dense, but overall I found myself needing to go back a lot.",
                "Recorded lectures were great. psets every two weeks gave the students some flexibility which was nice. Not a huge fan of the 4 quizzes - not that helpful and easy to screw up.",
                "strength: prof Humphries is very helpful and lectures are generally understandable. \r\nweakness: stressful at times. midterms and finals are hard. feel like we didn't have enough practice.",
                "The course was interesting because of the analysis and application of paper. The additional R lectures were helpful for the coding aspects of Psets, however, I think there should be more worked out examples similar to pset questions in lecture.",
                "I think the slides could feature more \"concrete\" examples that demonstrate how to calculate and solve certain problems; sometimes, the slides\/lectures left that a bit ambiguous, which made the P-Sets unnecessarily time-consuming.",
                "I think the lectures are a little unclear, particularly in terms of emphasizing really key concepts, because they rely too much on mathematical jargon and formal mathematical definitions. While we learn the math behind things, we sometimes are missing the underlying greater overall concept that needs to be grasped.",
                "I don't think I learned much R, I was able to complete the assignments but besides that I'm not confident in my R abilities.",
                "Overall, this course is not the best. The material for anyone with no statistics background or programming is difficult, especially when the lecture slides are barely helpful to learn from.",
                "The course is very well organized, with each part of the course leading into the next. The was course did cover a lot, considering that there was also a coding aspect, so it did feel like the pace of the course was very fast.",
                "The class offered a lot of resources, but the method of testing (live over zoom) was definitely not ideal. In this environment, projects\/other assessments should be considered.",
                "No weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: course material and lecture slides were made accessible throughout the semester, good pacing of the content in lectures. Weaknesses: long final exam.",
                "I found the lectures dry and not very engaging. This may have been due the nature of zoom though.",
                "Its a hard subject matter.",
                "Strenghts were the availability and number of resources for students - especially the great teaching team. It was very easy to get in touch with the instructor or tutors to ask questions(Email, piazza, office hours, etc). Also, the homeworks were a great way to further digest what we had learned in class by applying method we had learned, though they were a bit long at times or included many steps (points of possible failure). So, I strongly reccomend getting a small study group to check over answers! The classes themselves were pretty drawn out since the material we were learning was pretty convoluted\/involved many steps to get to a general idea. This made focusing a bit difficult, but the material itself wasn't crazy hard. I enjoyoed the asynchronous lectuers that exclusively were for teaching R as I could try and follow along in Rstudio on my computer. The homeworks were all fair, but the tests seemed a little too long for the given time period.",
                "Strengths: covers a lot of material, energetic & engaged professor (John Eric Humphries is awesome)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: hard, it's an econ lecture so the TAs range from good to eh depending.",
                "JEH's organization of lecture and the syllabus was exceptionally logical, building on concepts from the beginning to take them to new places. The slides outlined what would be covered. Lectures would begin with an overview of the last lecture's relevance before previewing the next one. The course was strong in terms of continuity.\r\n\r\nThis is barely a criticism, but I wish the TA's were more prepared for questions that go into the nitty-gritty. This course does not cover that so much, which is definitely a plus as I get bogged down. But it would have been nice to have a resource to succinctly explain the extended concepts."

                "Theres an onslaught of dense course material (it feels like two classes in one between the programming and stats). If it was a normal semester, then it would just be a class with a heavier workload. But having difficult concepts to understand + heavy workload + pandemic is a lotit truly feels like a 2 credit class instead of a 1 credit class. It was ultimately in my best interest to credit d this class; a lot of people I originally took the class with decided to drop. Because I credit dd this class, and the econ department does not allow you to take any courses for credit\/not a letter grade, I had to switch from being an Econ major.\r\n\r\nEven before COVID I heard how challenging it was to understand the course material, even if you went to lecture, office hours, etc. The pandemic worsened these conditions. If the econ department truly wants to improve, they also need to consider who is dropping the classes. Intro econ classes are diverse, but many women and POC switch from Econ to other majors. By the time I got to intermediate courses, it was just a bunch of white guys.",

I thought Vladimir's R lectures were quite helpful for problem sets, and that recorded lectures were also helpful for my review and studying. There were also office hours on basically every day of the week, which made studying less stressful, since I could always get help when I needed it. I also did like Prof Humphries' \"weatherman\" effect on Zoom!\r\n\r\nOne very minor thing is that the Zoom toolbar sometimes covers the bottom line of the slides during lecture. I can sometimes make the toolbar go away, but sometimes it stays on my screen and I can't see the bottom line of the slides. I wonder if it would be possible to leave some white space at the bottom of the slides such that this doesn't happen.",

I am sure that the difficulty of having to watch the hour and fifteen minute lecture (maybe consider making this a 3x weekly 50 minute class just for student engagement) was exacerbated by being on Zoom, but I'm also not sure if this is strictly an over-Zoom problem or general problem. Also as stated above, the true successes in this course were the ample office hours offered in addition to section. I think there could be a tangible benefit from an in-person section over an over-Zoom section, but I really do think that the online office hours would be beneficial in any learning environment. Being able to switch in an instant from the 6-8 PM office hours to the 8-10 PM office hours was so helpful.

The R lectures were also pretty successful for me to synthesize some information in the R context. Sections were also pretty solidly managed. I also appreciated that all lectures were recorded, in case I had Internet issues or couldn't make it to the lecture. I think that in-class engagement could've been improved (though I know it's an issue that a lot of professors are struggling with this semester due to the camera-off feature). P-sets worked well in my opinion, but I would've preferred more office hours opportunities immediately before the p-set deadline. AS I mentioned before, quizzes (though I'm not sure if they were for remote semester or just commonly used) would more greatly benefit hard-working students and those who are trying really hard to understand the material if they were multiple attempts; I personally tried really hard to understand the material, but since there were very few examples (both technical and conceptual) in lecture, I struggled on the quizzes and ended up getting less than ideal grades. I found that for a lot of the content on the quizzes once I reviewed them, I could only see a student with prior exposure to stats or econometrics or data analysis to have successfully gotten a perfect score on the quizzes, which I think is hardly fair. The fact that you couldn't go backwards only added to the stress and confusion of the quiz content.",

The final and the midterm were also a bit difficult especially for students such as myself that had to take it from home (loud household, difficult to concentrate especially when there is a time restraint, internet\/computer issues). I think a take-home final is the best option during a pandemic.",

Workload isn't bad; psets every 2 weeks take anywhere between 3-8 hours. There are 4 quizzes throughout the semester administered through canvas that take maybe an hour each. And then there's the midterm and the final.",

This class and other econ classes have not adjusted their classes well enough for a virtual setting. Their current solution is to assign more work (psets, quizzes, attendance grades) so there are more opportunities to have other grades, but it quickly leads to burnout (again, in this class and other econ classes). The whole Econ department needs to adjust their expectations of students and focus on how are we going to teach differently during a pandemic instead of how are we going to give assignments during a pandemic",
                "I would recommend it with Professor Humphries. I actually took Econ 135 and Econ 117 (long story) so if you're deciding between them: 117 is definitely easier and is more applied in nature. You kinda just plug things into formulas without having to learn the math behind it if you don't want to. Uses a lot more R if that's what you want to learn, and feels more like an economics class. If you've already taken S&DS 230 and know statistics it might feel a bit repetitive. I would choose between them based on who is teaching and what you want to get out of the class.",

At least personally, I felt like throughout the semester I had a bit of a love-hate relationship with the material because there was just so much, but what you learn about is really cool and has a lot of real-world applications. Like all econ classes there are probably a ton of people who are going to say \"only take this if you need it for you major,\" but I honestly think you should take this if you are interested in statistics, experimental design for social sciences, or anything economics related.",

I would definitely recommend this course but warn that if you are not great at stem \/ math \/ stats it may be challenging. For me this course was very rewarding and very interesting tho.",

                "Yes--even for non-econ majors! There are lots of negative reviews for this course, but I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of instruction at all levels, from Prof. Humphries to the numerous TAs who record supplementary videos for class, host office hours, or who answer questions on Piazza. The course material is quite difficult, especially for students who have not taken a statistics class before (such as AP Stats). But, if you take advantage of office hours and keep up with recorded lectures and sections, you'll be perfectly prepared for quizzes and exams. There are so many resources in this course that I never felt too stressed about doing well on problem sets or quizzes.\r\n\r\nThe material is also great. I learned R and LaTeX in this course, and I feel encouraged to learn more statistics, math, and econometrics in the future. I especially enjoyed reading about real-world applications of econometrics, and replicating some calculations from research papers at a basic level in problem sets.",
                "I wouldn't recommend. The biggest reason is the professor teaching off the slides. The second reason is that I found the course itself, regardless of the professor, to be disorganized content-wise. As I said before, that aspect of the course improved as weeks went on, but as currently designed the course is straddling probability theory and R in the most awkward fashion that hinders the student's ability to firmly grasp the most important concepts.",

Of all my classes, I feel like it would have been the easiest to slack off in Econ 117 due to remote learning, but Professor Humphries gave it his 100% to keep the class engaging and interesting. I really learned and retained a lot of useful information about probability, statistics, regression, prediction, and causation. The slides are incredibly well-organized and the key to your success in this course. I think the workload (quizzes and problem sets due on alternating weeks) was on the higher side but necessary to reinforce concepts. My go-to was Professor Humphries' office hours -- he is very approachable and helpful.",

                "Yes, the course does an excellent job of explaining econometrics and statistics with little need for background knowledge. I would, however, recommend the student to have at least some experience coding. Not necessarily R, but having some experience is very helpful.",
                "Very demanding with work and tough grading. I would say yes for the skills that are learned but definitely not a chill class.",
                "Not if its not a pre-req",
                "Yes if Econ major",
                "If you are interested in learning either R or learning probability theory specifically, this may not be the best course for you. But if you are interested in economics and feel you need an intro to both of those concepts, then this will be a relatively rigorous introduction to them.",
                "I think this class will teach you a lot if you are willing to put in the work.",
                "Yes. I think this course is a more empirical and hands-on approach to economics, which makes it different from intro macro or micro courses. This course is a major requirement and it is definitely helpful in building a foundation for learning how to manipulate and interpret economic data.",
                "Yes. It really does teach valuable skills necessary for economics research.",
                "Great course, one of the reasons why the econ major is great",
                "Yes. The concepts learned in this course are very applicable in econ\/polisci, or just for becoming more informed consumers of data. Professor Humphries is a great lecturer even though the subject matter by itself is somewhat dry.",
                "Yes, I feel much more comfortable with learning coding in the future. I don't know very much, but I am much less scared of coding.",
                "This is a difficult course. I already took stats 100, but this was still very difficult for me. I would not recommend this course unless you need to take it. I've heard better things about Stats 232.",
                "if you have to take it for major",
                "Yes. I like that it places a heavy emphasis on empirical work, and reading many current or important work in the field.",
                "Yes, if you are an economics or an econ + CS major. You learn about data science-related concepts and a little bit of R.",
                "yes.",
                "If you're in the econ major, you have to take it. If you're not in the major, I would take it. You will learn a lot of skills that are super important to know.",
                "If you're looking for problem solving skills and analytical skills, this course is 100% helpful. However, I would say that non-economics majors should and do stray away from this class because of its difficulty.",
                "Mmm, maybe. It's a tough one. I didn't take it for my major; I wanted to learn about econometrics and data analysis and the content definitely covers that all. The journey sucks but at the end you've learned a ton (at least in my experience). There are a bunch of really long p-sets, confusing quizzes, and stressful exams. The prof really cares, but it's easy to zone out and not pay attention and be hopelessly lost on the content, especially in a Zoom lecture. I'd only recommend taking this if you need it for the major; though I'll reiterate that if you really want to learn the content on the syllabus, this class definitively teaches you it. Just know what you're getting into.",
                "Yes and no; its the most painless econometrics class but its still hard",
                "Lol no. This is the hardest class I have taken at Yale.",
                "Yes. All of the concepts that are covered are essential for any economist and is even good to know just in general. Fundamental statistics concepts and understanding how different experiments can be designed and their results interpreted are very relevant and useful skills.",
                "Yes! Everyone should know how to interpret data in this data-heavy age.",
                "take it if you have to. or if you really want to learn useful R skills.",
                "Ive never taken an R or stats course at Yale. I think this was a good course to learn R and data analysis, although at times it was a little fast paced or concepts\/laws werent exactly explained thoroughly so I had to spend a lot of my own time figuring things out. I think supplemental videos or slides\/explanations should be provided for challenging concepts, like the video for CDF\/PDF (that was very helpful) to help students who may not have a statistics background like myself. That being said, I think I learned a lot in this course. It was challenging, but I think rewarding because of its application to research and data analysis.",
                "Yes, especially with this teaching staff.",
                "Yes, but conditional on what their desired learning method was and what they hoped to gain: I think the psets had very little in common with exams, which was a little disconcerting.",
                "Yes",
                "No, not unless it is required. The professor is very nice, but the lecture slides were terrible and it was hard to learn anything because the slides were so dense but nothing was well explained.",
                "I would recommend this course, just because it's interesting and it seems like a lot of the topics are widely applicable.",
                "Yes, well taught and confusing topics thoroughly explained. However, section experience\/clarity is dependent on the TAs.",
                "I would not recommend. You definitely learn a lot, but the testing isn't fair since the psets and the quizzes do not prepare you for it. If you are auditing the course, then definitely, there's a lot of concepts covered and you wouldn't risk your grade, but otherwise, don't (or maybe with a different prof). Office hours with peer tutors were sometimes helpful sometimes not. There have been times when I went to office hours for help on a pset, but the answer to my question that I got ended up being incorrect or I got absolutely different answers from different tutors.",
                "Only if you have to",
                "Absolutely. It is a must take for any Econ major, or anyone interested in learining about data analysis, both in theory and practice. I would suggest learning same R coding in advance.",
                "Yes",
                "Only if you need it for your major",
                "If you have to take it",
                "Yes, I learned a lot about statistics and the course made what we learned relevant to economics in the real world.",
                "I would not make any hesitation to take this course if your workload is 4-4.5 credits, but maybe if you had 5 credits this semester and have never done coding before. It would help to take S&DS 123 (teaches basic stats using python) to S&DS 230(teaches basic stats\/analytical methods using R) beforehand. Even though 123 is taught in python, both helped me get a good foundation of general coding syntax\/logic needed for statistical programming. It isn't necessary but it would let you skip some of the R-focused lectures, especially near the beginning. All-in-all, not a class you should be overly scared about, especially if you've had statistics before at Yale or even HS.",
                "Yes, but if you have some economics background and are not trash at it. This class is hard, but if you can get past that, it is really useful.",
                "I would recommend this course to students looking to gain a quantitative understanding of making truth claims. So I would recommend it for PHIL majors in addition to PLSC, ECON, SOCY, EP&E, etc. \r\n\r\nThis course is more important than Micro in my opinion and can be learned without it. \r\n\r\nThis was harder but a lot better than GLBL 121. Sometimes a challenge will cause you to learn something much more deeply."
