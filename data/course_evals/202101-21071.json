                "Strengths: Professor Reiche is very good at her job. She was very very dedicated e.g. setting up additional office hours on a Friday night and a Saturday night. If that's not dedication then I don't know what is. Weaknesses: I can't think of any. The class should be kept as it is.",
                "The Professor is amazing and the lectures very interesting. I really enjoyed the way that she constructed the lectures (topics, way of teaching etc). The problem sets were very challenging, but a perfect way of understanding the topics - so when its time to take exams, you are perfectly prepared. I do not think about any point that could be improved.",
                "Soenje is definitely a strength of this class. She brings her lively teaching and passion to a very structured lecture, which leads to the class being all the greater. The slides are clear, the psets and exams are fair and help cement understanding. The weaknesses involve perhaps the leap in logic that sometimes happen from lectures to pset but Soenje does a good job of explaining what happens in the problem set in her office hours.",
                "The course was well taught, especially given the remote format and difficult subject matter. Sometimes it is quite difficult to follow the math on slide presentations, but this is common of economics courses. It is also sometimes difficult to jump into the more challenging problem set questions from the baseline models from class. A possible solution is to have a course packet that has the key theories written down and explained with some more simple (ungraded?) questions to help familiarise us with the theory and warm us up for the problem sets."

                "This is an excellent senior seminar. If you enjoyed Intermediate Micro then you would really enjoy this class. The problem with intermediate micro is that it didn't feel too applicable to real life. In this class, you're going to learn so much about how individuals make choices under uncertainty and you will also go through several real-life studies. That being said, I would only recommend taking the class if Soenje Reiche is still teaching it because it's one of those classes that needs a good instructor otherwise things could be disastrous. Okay, maybe not disastrous but I do think that sometimes a class is only enjoyable if the instructor is great.",
