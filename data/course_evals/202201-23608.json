                "Strengths: compelling, relevant topic; professor with field experience\r\nWeaknesses: course structure was a bit all over the place (psets, group presentations, midterm but no final). I assume the Professor was trying to implement a variety of learning styles but it felt discontinuous.",
                "strengths: the material was interesting and it was a great approach to the course. the assignment structure was varied and it was nice to have a paper, psets, presentation, and a midterm. Course was well-intentioned and well-structured \r\nweaknesses: the participation/ tardiness/ attendance policy was pretty strict and confusing because it was such a large lecture",
                "I came into the course with a genuine interest in international development, but found that its structure and lecture style wasn't particularly conducive to learning. Lecture mostly just consisted of slides that were often copied directly from the readings and then simply reread to the class without any additional insights. The material itself felt random at times and limited in scope (mostly just discussing an assortment of theories and case studies related to different tenets of development). Assignments were often unrelated to the course material. Making slides more interactive, presenting additional perspectives or forms of media on each of the topics being discussed, and relating them better to each other or the theories discussed at the beginning of the course would have it much more interesting and engaging. I think the course has a lot of potential, but is unproductive in its current format.",
                "Strengths: well-organized for learning, detailed PowerPoints, accessible TFs, lots of group work\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Baysan read a lot from her slides which lowered engagement, the problem sets always didn't connect well to class material and assumed knowledge of STATA that I was never taught",
                "Strengths: we discussed interesting papers relevant to development, the course was well-organized and easy to follow, the presentations were fun. No major weaknesses.",
                "I think there are a number of areas where this course could be improved. The heavy reliance on group projects was extremely challenging because so much of our grade was determined by how much other students pulled their weight. I think this part of the course should be cut back on. I also dont think it was necessary to have student presentations take up a month of the course that we could have spent learning from the professor.",
                "I felt that 30% of the material in this course was not tailored to the class' level. I think the global affairs major should mandate the completion of certain courses before Development, so everyone is starting in a similar place. The discussions of the solow model were redundant because I had just learned them in intro macro. I found the Harrod Domar model to be unnecessarily confusing, poorly explained, and didn't know why we were learning it if it's not relevant in development economics anymore. \r\n\r\nI liked our discussions of papers in class toward the end of the semester, but we just summarized the papers that we had been assigned, so it wasn't a very good use of time (going over things we had already read). Would be more interesting to talk about implications, what we can learn from this study, any critiques, ethical considerations... etc so that we can become more savvy researchers ourselves. \r\n\r\nI would love to learn more about international aid as a part of this course. The Acemoglu paper was super interesting and I loved learning about the role of institutions.\r\n\r\nMy biggest critique of the class was the lecture style, which I will discuss more below.",
                "Strengths: Syllabus included interesting case studies, great Professor, comprehensive homework and projects with liberty of topics.",
                "Ceren was not a flexible professor at all, yelling at students for being late to class even amidst a COVID breakout on campus and placing her class in the farthest building on campus from most residential colleges at the earliest possible morning time.",
                "Strength: engaging readings\r\nWeakness: expected background knowledge of Econ",
                "Strengths: class topics, presentations\r\nWeaknesses: Not super well explained at times, final project",
                "Considering that this is one of the core courses of the Global major and we had a new instructor, I was surprised that no one from the department bothered to sit in on a class. I appreciated the range of topics covered in this course and the opportunities to dive into areas of our own interest, but overall it felt very disjointed--heavy on econ and we used Stata on problem sets, but didn't feel like we actually learned much coding. In the future, rather than have a separate final \"paper\" which felt like a problem set, I would've had students write reflection papers on the group presentations. This would've ensured more student engagement with the topics covered.",
                "The topic should be interesting; this is where most global majors' interests lie in comparison to security.\r\n\r\nI strongly disliked the course format. Both the final presentation and project (45% of your grade) being group projects felt very high school and hurt my learning significantly. The problem sets added no value either as they were either too straightforward or harshly graded with no reasonable feedback.\r\n\r\nThe presentations were okay, though the professor got visibly frustrated if we didn't understand, came late, or many other things. The class presentations were not how I would have wanted to end the semester.",
                "It is an interesting subject, but can feel a little disjointed in how it all connects. In addition, the exam didnt really feel like it tested any worthwhile knowledge, but rather a collection of random facts from the material we covered.",
                "Strengths: none. Weaknesses: was really excited about the course initially, but its review of many topics led the class to feel really disjointed, and the lectures were quite boring and unengaging. She would assign lengthy papers to read and analyze without addressing them in lecture. Grading was relatively vague and got a lot more strict towards the end of the semester without justification, and when students talked about and raised concerns about the course's structure, the professor's solution was to institute a harsh attendance policy to penalize anyone (and their final group project group members) who showed up more than 2 minutes late to lecture. Overall, it turned me off from learning more about developmental economics and left me feeling disappointed.",
                "I thought the workload was manageable and fair.",
                "The strengths are that Prof. Baysan is a very responsible professor and that the materials were not hard. Weaknesses are that the homework assignments do not 100% correspond with what was taught in class. The group projects are assigned in very large groups (5+ people) and some groups had very little time.",
                "Better as a seminar. Interesting course material, not engaging in lecture form",
                "Strengths: Interesting course material a great opportunity to develop presentation skills\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A long time was spent on studies during class time and a significantly lower amount of class time was spend on concepts that were applicable to assignments and presentations. Grading on the problem sets was harsh.",
                "Professor Baysan's feedback tended to be unhelpful and brief. It could be improved by move extensive comments and justifications on graded assignments."

That being said, in its current format, this course didn't do a very good job of introducing students to the topic. Maybe if it's taught by a different instructor or in a different manner/with a different structure I would recommend it, but not in its current state (though there probably won't be a way around it if you're in the major anyway).",
                "If you are a GLBL major, yes. The problem sets are very manageable as long as you did AQA, and the presentation was fun. This is not a particularly chill course if you are looking for one, and can be quite time-consuming around the time of the presentation, but the material is interesting and I felt that I learned a lot.",

                "Yes, it's a good foundational course for learning about issues in development and you can delve into what you are interested in later in the major.\r\n\r\nThe class assumes regression knowledge for the psets in stata or R, and you will be totally lost if you haven't taken AQA 1 or equivalent.",

                "No, but it is a requirement for the major.",
                "This course has been an issue for the Global Affairs department for years, constantly shifting professors and out, each bringing their own perspective and talent but usually leaving students somewhat disappointed. I can't recommend this course unless you have to take it for the Global Affairs program, but I hope that the department begins to take notice of the consistent issues in this class and dedicates more consistent resources to what is supposed to be a core major lecture for the major.",
                "yes! even apart from being a requirement, for those who are looking to dip their toe into the world of economic development, this class is great!",
                "No. Professor Baysan is a good person, but I wouldn't recommend this course with her. The global affairs department needs to monitor and improve what is taught in the core classes -- many of the development concepts are taught in required intro economic classes already. My biggest problem with this class is the homework assignments. The problem sets do not perfectly correspond to class materials, and sometimes it is unclear what the professor is looking for in the answer. For example, people would lose points on a question because they didn't include certain things in their answers that the question didn't actually explicitly ask for.",
                "The most enjoyable and interactive part of the course was the group project. I would recommend this course if it were more project-based",
                "This was one of the most disorganized courses I've taken at Yale. The grading structure was changed multiple times throughout the course without letting students know. The attendance policy was changed regularly at the expense of the students and without transparency. The lectures barely correspond to any of the assignments past the midterm. The psets, class presentation, and final group project all could be completed without the lectures - there is negligible relation between class content and graded assignments, which is unfortunate because the lecture content is interesting (but presented boringly)."
