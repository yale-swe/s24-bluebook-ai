                "A lot about exoplanets! A survey of exoplanet history, evolution of orbital parameters, tidal interactions, and basic physics of climate. More importantly, though, what Professor Laughlin demonstrates so expertly is how much we do not know about exoplanets. This is an evolving field in its infancy. It was very exciting to realize all of the opportunities that exist to push the field forward.",
                "I learned about the history of exoplanet discovery, including experimental techniques and theoretical models, as well as the mathematical basis (namely orbital mechanics) needed to understand the material. I learned to be more critical of both experimental data and data analysis, even for cases of large/expensive experiments and seemingly thorough models."

                "Strengths: Professor Laughlin is an absolute joy to learn from. He takes a very, very difficult material and expertly teaches it accessibly to both graduate and undergraduate students. The problem sets are amazing and are closer to open ended research questions than any other course I have had in physics or astronomy. (Obviously they are still manicured and highly guided, but closer than solving a question specifically designed for you to be able to solve like a harmonic oscillator or a circuit.) Weaknesses: Honestly, not very many. This course was close to perfect. I would note that it is easier to complete the course with a non-Windows computer for the undergraduate version as there is a standard program for astrophysics which will *not* run on Windows (believe me I tried).",
                "The lectures were highly entertaining and engaging. The instructor clearly cares a lot about teaching. \r\n\r\nThe course was advanced, and therefore not very accessible to students without a background in exoplanets. However, this was offset by generous grading and a separate undergraduate coursework scheme."

                "I recommend Exoplanets to anyone who is even remotely interested in Exoplanets and/or is looking for an intellectually very challenging and at the same time entertaining class.\r\nI think in order to do well in this course, lots of time and effort is required. While the problem sets are few, they are probably the most difficult homework in the program. They not only often require a lot thought to even get started, but also contain many layers of challenges that are very time consuming to understand and solve. This, and the fact that the problems are well thought out and feel meaningful, makes the homework for this course very rewarding, but also very frustrating at times, especially if other commitments put time constraints on how much effort can be put into the problem set. In addition, I think it's crucial to keep up with the assigned reading, in order to get the most out of the course. For these reasons, I think a student considering taking Exoplanets (who actually wants to learn a lot)  should plan to allocate significantly more time for this class than for other classes.",
                "Yes! You will learn in a manner unlike that of any other course you have taken. It is very accessible and has an extremely reasonable workload. I was unsure about this class at the beginning of the semester, but it turned out to be one of the best choices I have made since at Yale.",
                "My recommendation would be to take this course *IF* you have a *strong* interest in exoplanets or want to research exoplanets."
