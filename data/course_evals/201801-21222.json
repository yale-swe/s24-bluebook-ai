    "Strengths: \r\nKennedy\r\ninteresting subject matter\r\nmunich primary source assignment\r\nfinal paper\r\nworkload\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nlittle classroom discussion\r\nlittle focus on Pacific theater\r\nI have not received any of my grades in the class so far, so I have no clue what my final grade will be\r\nmaybe if there were fewer readings per week, people would more consistently do the readings?  just a thought",
    "This seminar is an excellent overview of the scholarly debates surrounding the origins and causes of the Second World War. The secondary sources were all excellent, but the real strength of this course is the sequence of discussions of documents related to the Munich Crisis. I think Professor Kennedy's approach, which involves looking at these crucial events from multiple points of view, using various primary sources, is very original and really effective.",
    "I thought this class was wonderful. The material and books were fascinating and I always walked away from the class meetings having learned an immense amount. My only thought is that sometimes class was a little disorganized in the sense that we didnt always get through all the material for a particular meeting. But that is a very small qualm compared to the overall effectiveness\/flow of the class.",
    "Weaknesses are maybe the lack of discussion between students, but Kennedy's knowledge makes up for that and there's little essential information that is left on the table.",
    "Kennedy is a great professor and knows everything about the subject. Sometimes he goes on long tangents but they're usually very interesting.",
    "Strengths: the material\r\nWeakness: not a lot of opportunity to discuss, but I didnt mind that"

    "I strongly recommend this course to anyone, UNLESS:\r\n-you want to know where you stand grade-wise at all times. We will have received zero grades back before we receive our final grade. I think I'll be okay? I don't really have any clue how harshly he grades. If you're super concerned about grades, I guess avoid this class. \r\n-you like to talk in seminar. Kennedy will do 95% of the talking, unless you're giving a presentation. \r\n\r\n\r\nPro's:\r\n\r\nYou basically only have to do the readings before giving one of your two presentations for the class. \r\n\r\nIt's Paul freakin' Kennedy. Kennedy treats a small group of students to lunch at Yorkside before seminar, has office hours, and even invited us to an end of year celebration at his house. He is a very kind and brilliant professor. \r\n\r\nOnly assignments are two easy in class presentations, and a 25 page final paper. \r\n\r\nThe subject matter is basically the history of the 7 great powers from 1919-1939. This is NOT a WWII class- it is an international relations class.",
    "Yes, definitely, one of the best seminars offered by the department. The material is really interesting, and Professor Kennedy is so knowledgeable about the subject-it's a treat to listen to him.",
    "Would definitely recommend!",
    "Absolutely. The chance to study with Paul Kennedy is one that no student should pass up. He has so much to share, and truly seems to enjoy teaching us. The workload is perfectly doable if you manage your time. Professor Kennedy even had us over to his house during reading period for a pizza party. Take it if you can!",
    "Yes, any class with Kennedy is worth taking.",
    "YES! Great class",
    "YES !!! Prof Kennedy is awesome"
