                "I thought the curriculum was very interesting, as were some of the discussions surrounding it. There were some points where I think the conversations got stuck on more surface level points or geared themselves towards binary debates (e.g. is she good/bad) rather than immediately diving into the text.",
                "Strengths: well prompted discussion\r\nWeaknesses: too much reading which leads to surface-level discussion due to inability to truly engage with the texts",
                "Strengths were the discussions, the reading list, the professor. I loved the class discussions, I always enjoyed them and was very engaged. I enjoyed the reading list, though I think a little less time could've been spent on Dickinson and Whitman. I loved the professor, she is amazing. She was very helpful and led the class very well.",

                "Absolutely! Professor Homans is wonderful-- she thoughtfully led class discussions, crafted a syllabus that told a diverse story of American Lit, and always gave incredibly helpful feedback on essays.",
                "Its an introductory course needed for the English major, so Id say its very useful for that and anyone interested in an overview of American Literature. For people who are already well acquainted and interested in the genre, however, Id say a more advanced class might be useful.",
                "Not particularly. I very much viewed this course as necessary to the English major, and still do only view it as that. I found the material overwhelming and cannot truly think of something I took away because I was simply so focused on getting through the readings.",
                "Yes I would, though only if they are interested in being an English major. I am an MBB major and I enjoyed this class but I don't know that other non English majors would enjoy it.",
