                "The actual engineering part of this course is limited in scope. We learned some very basic engineering analysis like Trusses, but the rest of the class was solely focused on the design process. For example, we learned how to fill out various spreadsheets and diagrams like House of Quality, Failure Modes, and Functional Decomposition. As a non-MechE major, I didn't learn anything that I would use in my job or other classes, but the class was very engaging nevertheless.",
                "Learning to work as a team. I also learned how to use certain machinery that is necessary for mechanical engineering, and I think these skills will be beneficial for me in the future.",
                "I learned all about the process of bringing a mechanical design project to fruition. We learned about functional decompositions, morphological charts, DFA's and more. Along with these processes we also learn fabrication and electrical skills.",
                "Learned how to machine, CAD and design",
                "I learned quite a few hands on skills and how to delegate tasks in a team\/attack goals in the most efficient way.",
                "I think this course is a good way to get practice working through the engineering process in a team environment. It also teaches about machining and goes into CAD, although minimally.",
                "I developed an understanding for the resources available to me as an engineering student at Yale, particularly the machine shop. I also developed a basic knowledge of CAD, programming, and electronics.",
                "Very hands-on class that made me enjoy the learning process.",

            "comments": [
                "Great opportunity for students to develop themselves as engineers.  although, the short time frame for some of the assignments made completing them a little difficult.",
                "This class was essentially an excuse to build something with your team. While we were assigned frequent Engineering Design paper\/spreadsheet work, these assignments were trivial to complete, and the real challenge came from actually fabricating the project.\r\n\r\nNot much guidance was provided on how to fabricate your projectafter all, this is not an analysis-based class. I think that more basic engineering principles (basic electronics, basic coding, basic mechanisms) could have been taught before we were to design the projectswith that being said, every team in the class came out with a coherent project, mostly because everyone had prior experience with mechanisms, electronics, and code.\r\n\r\nI don't think the mechanical design processes we were taught helped in any way with our projects. I felt like the task was to build a project, and the \"side-task\" was to fill out the various mechanical design worksheets. I don't think the worksheets actually influenced the design of my final project.",
                "I think this course is awesome. I think there should be more a design check point where you have to have your fabrication complete halfway through the course. This does not include the wiring just the machining. The course tends to load itself super heavily for the end and this would help alleviate that problem.\r\n\r\nI also wouldn't do cubesats. The class is a mechanical design class not a EE class. It felt a bit like an EE class. I'm not exactly sure what other classes have done as project themes but the cubesat project made it so there wasn't as much specifically mechanical design in the class.",
                "Strengths: Cool project, wonderful TAs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is essentially no teaching in this course relating to mechanical design. We are supposed to find out how to design on our own with our teams, which is not awesome for an intro course where no background is assumed. Doing that was stressful. Also, teams of 3 are hard to navigate, groups of 4 and above should be assigned. The idealization phase was very long, and building was concentrated to the end of the course. It felt like we only had one try to get everything working.",
                "This course is great for learning how real engineering projects work, but the workload goes from nothing to super heavy, all-nighters quickly if you arent super intentional about spreading out your work.",
                "The strengths of the course can mostly be found in the project and the experience it provides. Some of the lessons are also very helpful, as well as the introduction to the machine shop. Weakness-wise, I think some of the lessons are hindered by having to cover too much material in too little time, which can make the deliverables\/HW assignments connected to them feel disconnected from the actual learning and engineering process.",
                "The project assignment we were given, making a Cubesat, was very cool. I also thought that the feedback we received on our design from the Nasa engineers was interesting.  The schedule for class assignments was put together very well and all 3 of the design reviews and evaluations were helpful in improving the cubesats functionality from a 3d printed prototype to a working prototype with various motors and actuators. I thought that the Failure mode analysis was particularly helpful for choosing parts as well\r\n\r\nI thought that the students could have been given more of a chance to learn how the motors and actuators work\/ experiment with them using arduino as well as spend more time with 3d printing before incorporating those motors in the final design project.",
                "I thought that this course was a good introduction to the skills necessary of a successful mechanical engineer. I think that this course could be improved by more effectively using the lecture class periods at the end of the semester to help with the project process more specifically. A class period or two spent on electronics or programming would have been very helpful.",
                "It could be more helpful to have help with time management because our semester long project had a rush at the end to finish.",
                "The course is pretty streamline and the syllabus stated the flow of the course. I would say though that the time during lecture can be used for teams to brainstorm and work, possibly as an additional lab time.",
                "This class provided a great chance to work hands-on, but its weaknesses lie in its lack of structure and instruction. You are kind of thrown into the deep-end with design, and if you don't have any experience with CAD, parts-coding, or soldering, it is very difficult and time-consuming to learn. However, the machining was a great introduction in this class.",
                "The strenghts are the professor - Rebecca is very committed to her students' learning and was very approachable and helpful. The weakness was maybe the course itself - it introduced a lot of broad basic engineering \"things\", but I maybe rather woud have skipped this as an intro class and taken Statics or something instead. The main component of the class is definitely the project - which granted was very fun and we did learn a lot from it. The class did also involve getting trained in the machine shop which is a great strength!"

If you want an introduction to how to use machines in the machine shop, or if you want to work on a cool project for a semester, take this class. Do not expect to do a lot of math, learn about mechanisms, or otherwise learn how to do analysis.\r\n\r\nAlso, I wish I had pushed myself outside of my comfort zone a little moreif you have experience with electronics, try doing CAD for once, or vice versa. This is definitely a \"learn by doing\" class, so try learning a new skill through your group project.",
