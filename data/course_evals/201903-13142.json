    "I learned how to critically read ancient sources and compare them to modern texts. I grew substantially as a writer, and I discovered how to be a better participant in a smaller seminar setting. I also learned the importance of context when reading ancient works and gained some knowledge about the history of Ancient Greece and Rome.",
    "A critical eye onto the lens of classical satirists! An incredibly thought provoking class that i hope is taught in the future. Taught me how to go through an entire process of writing a paper in stages instead of the night before, teachers willing to work with you and spend time cultivating your ideas",
    "In this course, we studied free and frank speech in Ancient Rome and Greece and how those topics can relate to our own discussions on free speech in the modern world. I learned how to think about classical writings in both relation to their own setting but also how to connect the themes of those works to modern culture and how simply reading them from our perspective is not wholly true to the work.",
    "A lot of critical thinking. I had little to none subject matter experience (classics) so it was really cool to see how something everyone's kind of familiar with (comedy, satire, parody) was applied to these old works.",
    "I learned how to analyze and compare texts from Ancient Greece and Rome despite relatively little knowledge of their cultures. We focused on drawing universal themes about how free speech, satire, and humor operate from particular works and cultures which are distant from modern sensibilities. This class was helpful in that regard, especially as we read a great number of classical works in translation which would not be typically read in a classics department, and so got to experience plenty of eclectic forms of literature. The professors were also very helpful towards improving skills in clear writing and academically interesting analysis.",
    "I learned to recognize satire in texts from ancient Greece and Rome  something I didn't know existed, much less how to understand, before this class.",
    "ancient greek and roman comedy in all forms, and parallels with modern comedy"

   "comments": [
    "This course was extremely well-organized. Professor Janssen did an excellent job of guiding discussions every class, ensuring that we had the time to get to every reading without rushing us when we found a topic particularly interesting. The content was very interesting and funny, and it was incredibly interesting to see where modern comedy has its roots. I thoroughly enjoyed every class discussion. We also had occasional lecture-style classes where Professor Freudenburg would give some more historical context to our readings. I appreciated having these classes interspersed throughout the discussion classes, as it provided some variety. One thing that could have been improved was providing a bit more historical background material, even just in the form of additional optional readings, for those students who do not have a Classics background. Professor Janssen was excellent about providing feedback, meeting with students about every paper and making himself readily available for additional meetings. The feedback was great and amazingly helpful.",
    "Strength: engaging discussions, fun readings, AWESOME teaching from Niek and Professor Freudenberg, cool papers and some cool field trips\r\nWeaknesses: class always goes over time but not the end of the world!",
    "I think this is one of the best courses I've taken in my time at Yale. I thoroughly enjoyed the discussions the class had and the source material we covered. I think sometimes we may have tried to bite off more than we could chew and were not always able to discuss everything we've read in class, but other than that it was an incredible experience.",
    "Strengths: Diverse array of readings that are super cool and interesting. The supplemental reading is really cool too.\r\n\r\nWeakness: If this class was longer (like a seminar style maybe?) I would recommend delving into a bit more of comedic theory, not just the formal structures of parody\/satire\/invective.",
    "This course was at its strongest when our class could engage in a spirited a discussion about how a work like Juvenal's Satires operates by comparing its problems with debates about contemporary political problems. One highlight of the course was having students present modern examples of satire and free speech that they find interesting to counterpose against the ancient works. There could have been better communication about the expectations for the final presentation, but all of the writing assignments were clear with pages of thorough and helpful feedback.",
    "Strengths of this class included the very interesting selection of readings that the professors chose and how well they knew and presented them. It was also very valuable to have professors who could provide the context around the politics and society that the satires were written in. Also, it was super interesting to see the similarities in the ancient satires and modern ones, both in terms of technique and content. \r\n\r\nA weakness would be that it was hard to jump into the readings and discussions without a background in ancient Greece and Rome. It would have been nice to have a quick intro to Greek and Roman history.",
    "I thought the readings were fascinating and helped me understand not only ancient comedy, but techniques in modern comedy as well. I wish that each seminar had more of a balance between lecture and discussion - some days would be either entirely one or the other so we didnt get to discuss some works as much as I would have liked."

    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student! One does not need to be a Classics major to really enjoy and get a lot out of this class. The readings were diverse and genuinely funny, and discussions were great. Easily one of my favorite seminars thus far at Yale.",
    "Yes!! Interesting material and a fun class to take for a WR",
    "I would wholeheartedly. Dr. Freudenburg and Prof. Janssen were great and the discussions the class had were always interesting. Definitely a class where you are excited to read the material and go talk about it with others. The writing assignments were relatively free in the student's choice of scope and were graded very fairly. Heavily recommend to anyone interested in a course to fulfill any distributional requirement, or just for fun honestly.",
    "Other students should totally take this class! The dynamic duo of Niek and Kirk was something to look forward to every week. They offer fresh perspectives on classic works and their passion shines through everything they do. This class is a really cool way to tackle important questions regarding free speech in our day, and the environment never felt confrontational, rather it was inquisitive. I'm of a certain political leaning and it never felt like I was the odd-man-out. Student contribution is really strong if y'all do the readings, so do them! My favorite readings were Phaedrus and some plays by Aristophanes.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in reading many interesting excerpts from assorted and less-commonly-discussed works of literature. Many students in our class had little experience with the Classics and even literary analysis, and nonetheless thrived because of the unique perspectives that they were able to bring to the table in the mode of discussion that the class facilitated. One does not need to know much about Ancient Greece or Rome to take this class, but an interest in how questions of satire and free speech (and not just first amendment issues, but free speech as a social issue and satire as a mode of critique) play into our lives will inspire much more interesting discussions and readings of these old texts.",
    "Yes. It was really interesting to see ancient Greece and Rome through a satirical and comedic perspective and to know how dysfunctional parts of their societies were. (And that modern society is still dysfunctional in many of the same ways). Also, many of the readings are very funny so you'll enjoy those too.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in comedy and how it functions - even if you have no experience with ancient civilizations."
