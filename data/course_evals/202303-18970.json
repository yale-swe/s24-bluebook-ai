I also learned a ton about research project management in R, how to use Quarto, LaTeX, and GitHub to produce a high-quality research paper that is accessible to others to replicate.

I learned how to read a quantitative political science paper properly, got to understand the strengths and weaknesses of approaches to causal inference ranging from difference in difference to regression discontinuity, learned about research designs such as RCTs and predictive modeling. Fantastic course and a solid statistics education to boot.",

                "I think the array of topics covered were interesting. You'll learn a lot of useful techniques and packages and have a nice project to show for it at the end. A weak point is that the explanation of some of these concepts were often unclear. I remember many people struggling to understand fixed effects, noncompliance and instrumental variables, in particular.",
                "i liked most of it, especially the discussion sections and the TFs. However, the lectures were sometimes a bit hard to follow (felt like transitions were missing between topics) and going back to read the annotated handout was not helpful at all. All I could do was rewatch",
                "This course covered an incredible amount of content and it was a bit overwhelming at times. It was sometimes difficult to follow the progression of lectures as we jumped between topics quite a bit. It might be helpful to provide more of a roadmap of the course and check in with the roadmap throughout the semester so it is easier to see the progression of topics. On the flip side, we covered a huge amount of material and I learned a ton. The professor and TFs were very helpful during office hours and section and very responsive to Ed discussion and email.",
                "Very excellent instructors and great teaching team, weekly problemsets kept me engaged, learnt a lot of hands-on knowledge about coding",
                "Strengths: Shiro! He's undoubtedly one of the best lecturers I have ever had, and he explained statistics so well (he's also so wholesome and has a great personality). The teaching team was also highlighted; their response time, helpfulness, and availability were outstanding.  The content is also interesting and applicable. The regrade policy was fantastic - you get honest grading to learn but with zero risk to your overall grade on problem sets! Overall, great professor, teaching pedagogy and content. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I'm confused about who this class is for and for what purpose. It's labeled as a core class of the Undergraduate Political Science Major, but ~65% of the class are grad students (most not in PLSC), and to be honest, the lecture feels geared at them - undergraduates feel like an afterthought. The final essay reflects this - many undergrads had more stats experience but less publication-style writing experience, which didn't matter until the final project. The final project felt disjointed, and its requirements (Quarto, Latex, GitHub) appeared out of left field.",
                "This course is run like a well-oiled machine by Shiro and the teaching team. Strengths: the problem sets are highly relevant and give you practical skills; being able to get points back on problem sets takes a lot of the pressure off and really privileges learning over just getting points. Weaknesses: some of the classes felt excessive (like the review sessions, multiple classes on survey weighting), and I don't think the quiz did much for my learning",
                "Good coverage of a range of methods. Applied approach very well put together.",
                "The course covered a lot of ground, and I do feel better prepared to consume research having taken it. I thought the short quiz at the end of the class was a good learning tool because an exam would not be appropriate for the class but the quiz made me spend time reviewing the conceptual details that we didn't spend much time on throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nThe course would benefit from a more clear structure that differentiates when we move from one topic to another. It would also be useful to learn more about the thought process or theory related to each experimental design and why you might choose one over the other. Overall, there was a large emphasis on notation and administrative details (like style of R code and using specific software for the final) which took away from my ability to engage with the concepts.",
                "It effectively covered many very important areas, although I felt a bit lost when the instructor dove into the underlying theoretical calculations in some cases. It became hard to relate it to the key concepts and research methods at play. The problem sets were also a lot of work for being assigned nearly every week (sometimes took 15-20 hours).",
                "Exposure to a lot of quantitative research method, but workload is substantive",
                "I greatly appreciated the course's emphasis on organization and workflow, both in terms of keeping one's RStudio tidy, and producing visualizations that are accessible and easy to read. This is something that many Yale stats courses gloss over, but it made all the difference in my experience with the psets and project. Perhaps the best part of the course is that it is built around a set of excellent social science papers that model each concept. Once again, in another course these concepts could be presented in a slideshow each week with only a quick consideration of applications, but the \"applied\" in the course title is serious -- just as much attention is paid to how a particular research design works in practice as is paid to the research design itself. I would have maybe preferred slightly more time during lecture working through some code, as most of the code demonstration is confined to the weekly sections (which are helpful, but only 50 minutes). But overall, the course is designed exceptionally well. The psets aren't overwhelming but are challenging; we got to do pset revisions for each assignment; the project is manageable but a rewarding experience; the TFs are great; etc etc etc.",
                "This course was extraordinarily valuable for its breadth and depth of topics covered in applied quantitative research. Lectures introduced material that is fundamental to quantitative research design in a logical manner. I also appreciated the greater emphasis on causal inference during the first two-thirds of the class. In-class coding helped facilitate my understanding of R. One way this course could be improved is to slow the pace of lectures slightly as sometimes I found it difficult to follow along.",
                "Strengths enthusiastic prof and very hardworking TFs. I think that the lectures need to come before the tasks as I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out how to do things by myself.",
                "Strengths: Teaches you a lot of R and exposure to impact evaluation methods. Weaknesses: Difficult to become proficient in both of those things at the same time, unless you already have expertise in one of them.",
                "The PSETs really put you through your paces, and being able to resubmit them was also helpful and took some of the pressure off when you're faced with a really tough PSET. The course also covers a lot of ground within the semester.",
                "Because the course gives a lot of exposure, it is a lot of work to get through the semester and can at times be overwhelming, however, the exposure is very useful and worthwhile",
                "Well-organized, well-taught, great for the real world. No weaknesses.",
                "The topics are very interesting and the final project was a rewarding experience, I do think the actual lectures could be a bit more organized though. They were sometimes hard to follow."

                "For S&DS majors that needs an applications-based class, it's not a gut, but it wasn't unfeasibly difficult. I would recommend, especially if you want a project-based class. For PLSC majors, you should have some coding experience under your belt (like a semester in R), otherwise I could see it being pretty hard to get started.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student really interested in quantitative social science research and coding in R. If you are not interested in conducting this type of research, do not take the class. I think I learned the most in the class out of all of my classes this semester, but it took a lot of hard work and determination. This class is definitely not easy, but worth it if you are really interested and committed to learning the material.",
                "yes",
                "I would recommend the course! Shiro is fantastic, and the teaching team he assembles is likewise fantastic. The content applies to a wide range of fields in the social sciences, and the regrade options take away the stress and incentivize learning. If you're a PLSC major, I would definitely take it! Just watch out for the quiz that appears at the end and the project -- the extra requirements and formatting are annoying.",
                "Definitely, especially if you're a polisci/EP&E undergrad looking to get some more hard skills",
                "Yes, especially if they are looking for a third semester stats course that covers applied research methods.",
                "I would recommend it, but with the caveats that the problem sets are very time consuming because we have to teach R to ourselves.",
                "Yes, but make sure you are prepared for the level of workload and the concepts it will cover.",
                "To someone with previous experience in R and little experience in quantitative research design",
                "Yes. Even if you feel like you've learned some of these models/concepts in previous coursework, it puts them into a new perspective and reinforces them in a really helpful way. It's clearly a must-take for someone who wants to spend their life writing social science papers, but I'd argue it's also a must-take for someone who wants to spent (moments in) their life reading them, as what you learn in the class helps you carry both a newfound interest and healthy skepticism to how research is presented in papers and in the news media.",
                "If you are interested in social science research or want to complete a rigorous quantitative thesis in econ/poli sci, then this course is definitely worth taking.  I took it the semester before writing my thesis and will now be able to employ much more advanced techniques (and a lot more quickly) than if I hadn't taken it.",
                "I would highly recommend this course! Coming into it, my main goal was to expand my coding skills and understanding of quantitative/econometric methods, and I can wholeheartedly attest to my achieving this goal (and more!). Problem sets are fair but challenging enough that students need to put in the work on their own to learn coding, which (at least for me) proved to be the best way to learn. The teaching team is always available and happy to answer any questions, making for a welcoming environment where everyone feels supported, no matter what skills they had at the outset.",
                "Yes if you already have some basic knowledge of R or quasi-experimental methods and want to get more proficiency in either of those, but you probably need to complement it with additional R or stats courses.",
                "Yes.",
                "I would take this class if I already had some knowledge of the core concepts of the class. The class and the assignments are great practice in building some R skills but the concepts weren't taught as well as they could be and if you're struggling with the concepts in the class, the combined weight of having to learn R while also figuring out the concepts on your own can be a massive difficulty.",
                "Yes, I would, if you want more exposure to quant research methods or have had and need a refresher, this is a good course to take, especially for those in Economics or political science",
                "no -- i believe the course in its current form has unrealistic objectives (mastery of R as well as mastery of complex statistical concepts)",
                "Absolutely. Take this to understand how to write a paper, conduct a study, and do research.",
                "I would, it is a great introduction to a lot of new research and data science concepts that most other courses do not offer."
