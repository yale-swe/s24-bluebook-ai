                "I developed a comprehensive understanding of why and how the world must transition to clean energy. I developed critical thinking skills for geopolitical and business analysis, as well as presentational skills.",
                "This course gave a broad overview of clean energy in terms of technologies, policies, net zero scenarios, finance and how they all are connected to each other.",
                "I learned so much about global energy projections, networks, and actors. From analyzing charts and big projection reports to reading energy theory\/policy or op-eds, this course really took a comprehensive, multimedia approach to studying every aspect of energy policy. The fireside chat guests help illuminate the course material, and Professor Simons brings an incredible energy to every class and assignment as well as a depth in experience that shines through.",
                "It has been great learning experience by someone of the stature of Ambassador Paul Simons.\r\n\r\nThere has been a 360 degree understanding of Climate change and practicalities associated with it to reach the Net Zero Emissions targets.\r\n\r\nSo the policy framework,  financing, technology and the science pertaining to clean energy transition.",
                "I learned how to assess the clean energy transition and was provided a framework to look at the energy news from a new lens.",
                "I learned about different type of technologies and the nuances or converting our current system away from fossil fuels.",
                "I gained extensive insight and a renewed perspective on the global clean energy transition, and its many facets, from corporate investment, to government role, to real-life analyses on the Russia-Ukraine crisis and its impact on energy.",
                "I learned a lot about the state of energy security across the globe and the Russian-Ukraine crisis's impact on it as a result of this course. I also became somewhat more optimistic about the prospects of the path to net zero, as it seems somewhat achievable, but I became less optimistic about those going into this field as many people in the class only focused on the economics surrounding the clean energy transition, rather than acknowledging the most crucial element of the issue, climate science."

            "comments": [
                "A little too lecture-like to feel like a seminar. Prof. Simons is very controlling in the direction of the conversation, sometimes to the detriment of the joy of learning and egaging.",
                "Incredibly well connected Professor, thoroughly organized, prompt feedback. Readings could be toned down through editing.",
                "I enjoyed the diversity of topics that were presented each week, as well as the guest speakers who were experts in their respective fields. Prof. Simons brings so much of his knowledge and experience to the table. Simulating the G20 negotiations during the final class was also engaging. I do think spending more time discussing specific readings during class time (since the readings were generally quite interesting) would make the class even better.",
                "Strengths: Professor Simons is a gem of a professor and a mentor, and his enthusiasm for teaching and the subject matter shines through everything you learn in the class. The Fireside Chat guests help bring the course material to life and are very interesting. The assignments are super cool and really engage you with the class material. Very well-organized, and great feedback on the assignments (especially at the midterm). Good office hours accessibility. I liked the group work in class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish some of the Fireside Chat guests could visit in person, and I also wish there was more diversity\/representation among them (especially more women!). I would also argue that energy justice and equity are key themes that should be through-lines of the entire course; sometimes it felt like we glossed over those important lenses when evaluating approaches to the clean energy transition. More emphasis on that (or a few more readings) would be great if an entire class can't be dedicated to it. Lastly, I think the discussion questions were hard to answer sometimes--I often felt like I had to answer \"THIS\" or \"THAT\" as the most promising solution for the future, and so many times I was confused why it couldn't be both this AND that. So opening the questions more broadly would be helpful.",
                "The strengths are the literature shared by the Professor.  The fireside chats from practitioners and recognized figures in respective fields always provided great insight. The Professor himself was always well prepared and forthcoming. \r\n\r\nI think that may be the course could have touched on the developing and emerging countries perspective and how their reservations and constraints can be addressed as the developed countries the question is primarily political whereas in emerging countries it is social, political and economic as well.",
                "The course was amazing. Very well structured I learned so much.",
                "The course material was quite interesting and Ambassador Simons gave a ton of personal insight and expertise into the matter. The chats we had with different experts almost every week were a huge highlight. I think it would have been nice to get some more guidance on the assignments, especially the final. We were given examples of previous submissions of all of the other assignments, and it was very difficult to work on the final without that same baseline and not very much guidance."

                "Absolutely for a deeper insight on energy through business and geopolitics.",
                "Yes, the course covers a different energy theme every week, and the guest speakers make the class all the more engaging. It's a great opportunity to learn from Professor Simons and his experience!",
                "Absolutely! I thought I knew a lot about energy before this class (and also just wasn't too interested in that as a topic), but it totally recentered the importance of the clean energy transition for me and brought it to life. I loved Professor Simons' energy and support throughout the class, and I learned so much about clean energy, technologies, policy mechanisms, finance mechanisms, and more. There are a few shortcomings in terms of energy justice content, but you can work to bring that lens in. Not too heavy a workload and very interesting--also so topical!!!!! We need climate action outside of just the environmental sector, so a diversity of backgrounds\/academic studies in this class is super important!",
                "Definitely Yes. As this gives an entire overview of the climate regime and clean energy transition as energy is biggest contributor to GHG emissions.",
                "100%. I think all student, regardless of background should look at taking this course",
                "Yes I would recommend this class to everyone. Professor Simons is amazing.",
                "Absolutely - you learn so much in this course, and most importantly the ability to assess news and updates in energy markets and its potential implication on the transition. I learned what the necessary steps are to succeed in this clean energy transition and the major barriers to such. You complete assignments that are real-life job oriented, such as writing a speech, or creating powerpoint slides, which was refreshing in comparison to classes that lack this practical perspective.",
                "Yes, it's an interesting course, but just know that just because the workload isn't very heavy, doesn't mean that the grading is a breeze."
