    "Strengths: Clear feedback from the instructor, supportive classroom environment that encourages all students to participate, frequent and meaningful discussions about the selected readings, great use of university libraries as resources\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes there was not enough time to fully discuss each assigned reading.",
    "Strengths- interesting readings, very engaged professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- too many readings to discuss per class period",
    "Excellent response to student concern\r\nThe professor was clearly engaged in students work",
    "This course is great, but it would be awesome to spend more time discussing each reading (which is unrealistic given the small amlunt of class time allowed)"

    "Professor Reider is one of the sweetest professors I have met in my couple years at Yale. She's very enthusiastic about teaching her class and ultimately makes it something to look forward to each day. She's more than willing to meet outside of class just to help you improve your writing skills and\/or talk about pieces of reading that have been covered in class. Take this class if possible!!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student who is looking to improve their writing skills as the classroom environment really promotes personal growth.",
    "I would recommend this course because it offered many different types of reading and truly allowed for growth in my writing.",
    "YES ABSOLUTELY, BEST CLASS AT YALE"
