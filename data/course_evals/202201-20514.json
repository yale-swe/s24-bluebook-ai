                "I really enjoyed how we chose one data set at the start of the semester and got they chance to work with it the rest of the semester, it made me feel like I wasn't just doing useless psets but actually learning and growing as a student.",
                "Topics cover lots of interesting methods, helpful for my own project.",
                "Strengths: Wide array of statistical tools you can learn. The professor is  quite amicable and not too difficult to follow in lecture.\r\nWeaknesses: THIS IS NOT a course you can take if you don't have a  background in R of if you haven't taken at least 2 statistical classes prior at a graduate level. I thought one class in graduate school and one from undergrad was sufficient but there was a STEEP learning curve. I had to go to office hours very often. While I was able to complete homework assignments I still lack some of the foundational knwoledge needed to understand things intuitively.",
                "Really clear example code, lots of options for watching lecture. Also cool to get to do all of the homeworks with your own dataset that interests you. Weakness is probably that since all OHs are on Zoom and lectures are recorded, it is very easy to be completely disengaged from the course (especially if you are doing psets in a group). Also, the peer grading system on the final projects (ranking other people's projects and assigning the 2nd and 3rd ranks a 6\/10 and 2\/10 respectively) was unnecessarily stressful, not well communicated, and a poor pedagogical decision",
                "This course covers a lot very quickly while still keeping it manageable. I think it does a fantastic job at teaching great breadth and giving an intro to lots of different techniques and multivariate statistics generally. It doesn't go into a ton of depth with each topic or the underlying mathematics but I think that is for the best, as it allows the course to cover much more for people interested in applications. The assignments are manageable and engaging. The only real weakness for me was that I didn't enjoy the Ordination topic, although it is only one of 7 or 8 and that may just have been me. The ability to take the class completely asynchronously or in-person is also very cool and was very nice for my semester.",
                "The strength in this course was its flexibility. Having a fully recorded class where synchronous attendance wasn't mandatory was nice. It's also nice that it's project-based. The course could be more useful if it was more math based, but I'm sure there's another course in the catalog for that. Maybe S&DS 262?",
                "What's great about this course is that on top of the live lectures, there are pre-recorded lectures, homework assignments and quizzes that we can work at our own pace throughout the course. The Ed discussion platform is great to ask questions and get help. There are many teaching assistants available to help solve our problems. But some of the teaching assistants weren't as helpful.",
                "More in-person opportunities to engage that are not lecture.",
                "Lectures were very clear, the flexible nature of the course (entirely asynchronous option, etc.) was great, p-sets and project were low-stress. No weaknesses that I can think of.",
                "Most classes use grades to incentivize learning--getting a good grade requires learning the material and students want good grades. However, S&DS 363 expected so little from students that it was entirely up to you what you got out of the class. Since problem sets could be done in groups and mostly involved copying and modifying the R scripts from lecture, you didn't have to know what was going on to do well. the problem sets were also graded so easily that this was amplified (there were two psets for which the mean score was literally over 100). I definitely think I should have been more engaged and more motivated to learn the material, but I think it is a problem that many other students shared this experience where they didn't really know what was going on and were still doing well.\r\nthere was also a fiasco with final project grading. I think JDRS and the tf's realized that everyone's grades were too high, so they changed the rubric after the due date so that grading would be more harsh.",
                "Really well organized to facilitate student learning  lots of office hours, lots of materials posted online for review or to take at your own speed asynchronously. Pretty boring if not applicable to research you are interested in.",
                "The final project employs a peer grading system that forces you to rank three other projects. This method seems arbitrary and slightly unfair, given that most projects submitted are of good quality- ranking them results in the third place project receiving a letter grade below the first place one, even when the difference in quality is small",
                "The course was pretty casual and not particularly rigorous although looking back I learned quite a lot and became much more confident analyzing data on my own.",
                "This course is already wonderful and no weakness exists",
                "It is very useful.",
                "Hmm I love JDRS and I would consider myself to be pretty driven and on top of most of the things that we learned, but honestly wont recommend this class. First, most people do everything remote and some dont even watch the pre-recorded lectures, so I feel like there isnt a learning community though the class size is pretty big. Second, the assessments are too easy (no midterms, final project which is basically a compilation of your psets) which contribute to peoples lack of motivation. Third, I think the concepts explored in the course is pretty hard to retain if one doesnt understand the math behind. That said, JDRS did a fantastic job to explain everything in a simple manner, so if you are doing a project\/in a field in which you would use any of the methods discussed, then this class is worth taking since it teaches you the intuition as well as coding skills (though the vast majority, if not all, of us copied his codes when it comes to psets)",
                "i like that its organized well",
                "since all course material + assignments are posted at the start of the year, allows for a lot of flexibility (I'd say this is a strength)\r\n\r\nfinal project rubric was misleading since it was changed after projects were due",
                "Very well taught",
                "modules and office hours",
                "This is generally a good course, and JDRS, as many Yale students know, is a fantastic professor. The problem sets actually teach you a great deal about the techniques we learn and how to use them in practice, and you are able to use data of your choosing in each. They are engaging and don't just feel like \"busy work.\" However, the grading system of this class, and the curve that is involved, should be made much more clear from the outset. I would even argue that the way this course is graded should be changed entirely. The majority of the course grade is problem sets (60%), but they are graded with so much extra credit that your actual grade and progress in the class becomes very obscured (for instance, you can get a 103% on a problem set and then realize that this is the \"average\" grade in the class .... it is then very unclear whether you are doing well or poorly). I also have critiques of how our final projects were graded, as the rubric we were given initially to work from ended up being different from the rubric the project was graded against, as the final rubric incorporated \"extra credit\" and a \"ranking system\" to effectively impose a curve that many of us were not aware of. In all, the strange grading schemes used in this class make it extremely difficult to tell how you're actually doing, as a \"perfect score\" on homework\/projects effectively becomes meaningless, and that is frustrating.",
                "A strength is that its asynchronous",
                "Very well designed, easy to follow.",
                "A strength is that JDRS makes the class in such a way that it is not too difficult to understand very difficult topics. Conceptually, the ideas in this class are hard but he makes them easy to understand because he is a strong lecturer.",
                "Strength was the professor and the flexibility of the class schedule",
                "Very well structured, clear learning objectives.",
                "The course is great. The only problem is the letter grading policies should be informed at the beginning of the course",
                "Content is presented well.",
                "It was very TA focused",
                "Strengths: Best organized and best lectures I have ever had in my entire life. No weaknesses, in my opinion.",
                "I do like that I could watch the lectures whenever I wanted but I wish I had gone into class instead. That's fully on me though",
                "Strengths: Unlimited office hours by JDRS and also other TFs, materials was very accessible\r\n\r\nWeakness: I can't think of any.",
                "I definitely appreciated how there was the choice of asynchronous, in-person, or recorded learning to facilitate every learning style and schedule possible. I left the course feeling confident that I could implement the techniques covered in the class to answer any questions of interest down the line, which speaks to the excellent method of instruction in this course. I feel as though I would need some more time brushing up on my linear algebra and reviewing the lecture powerpoints to fully understand the ins and outs of the theory behind each technique, but I also feel as though this is unnecessary to get the most out of what I learned. Also, the accessibility offered to us with plentiful office hours was definitely a huge help. I appreciated the emphasis on searching for our own datasets throughout the semester and especially during the final project. It really allowed me to focus on what I was actually interested in which made the assignments infinitely more enjoyable.",
                "This course is great because it makes all of these techniques extremely accessible in a format where you can learn at your own pace and apply all of the topics that we learn to see how they work when actually coded. It is a great course with a great professor and the only improvement I would suggest is to change the peer grading system of the final paper. It was not actually anonymous and ranking different students against each other does not seem like a fair thing to do.",
                "This course has pre-recorded videos which are really helpful. The quizzes are helpful for understanding the materials in class.",
                "I like the the course was asynchronous but this also meant that it was easy to be behind on the material. Sometimes the material was too dense and I was unable to really understand what was going on. Additionally, the quizzes were too conceptual and they made me feel like I did not understand the material but when it got to the homeworks I felt it was much more manageable (especially with the help of TAs). Also, most of the TAs only know R and I was only taught SAS so it was hard to navigate coding errors.",
                "Strengths - pretty chill class. Weaknesses - Grading for the final project was in no way fair.",
                "End of the course was confusing",
                "I wish the course was less asynchronous because it decreased the level of engagement in the class.",
                "very oranized",
                "Amazing course I really developed my knowledge on the subject. No weaknesses!",
                "This class was perfect!",
                "strengths: hands-on, practical approach; flexibility (asynchronous, synchronous online, synchronous in-person)",
                "The course does a great job of flexibly covering a wide range of material. \r\nI think that the key addition I would like is an emphasise on being able to critique other researchers' work. Many students taking the subject do not actually intend to become researchers or analysts themselves, but instead want to be able to consume analysis conducted by others. It would be great to add further emphasis on this to the subject, as well as a richer understanding of the limitations of each method. \r\nI would also appreciate if the example data sets used in class were more distinct - sometimes very similar data sets were used for each method, which reduced their value add. Another weakness is in the design of the assignments. The assignments help you to apply a particular method in a particular context, but they are much less useful in understanding why the method works or when is a good time to apply it. As a result, it is harder to be confident about using these methods in future situations."

                "Yes -- for anyone who enjoys statistics, it's practically a gut.",
                "Only if you need to take it for the major. I would take 230 instead if you are a students curious to learn R and practice your statistical skills. However, JDRS is great and fun to learn from.",
                "what else is there to say? if you see JDRS, it's a must take.",
                "Yes, for the data science certificate",
                "It's a solid course if you want a low workload, but I don't think you'll absorb or retain much information. It works well as a survey course for introducing you to a slew of existing methods, but I wouldn't say you learn much about the applications of them or the technicalities behind them.",
                "Yes, if you want a chill environment to learn a lot of cool statistical methods that you can practically use",
                "definitely! it's a great course, professor's lecture was very engaging and interesting",
                "Definitely!",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, this course was great and will be a resource I continue to use throughout my training.",
                "Super Nice Teacher",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, great technical skills if you like coding in R",
                "Yeah I guess. Like such a gut and counts for S&DS \/ the data science certificate. Don't expect to learn stuff unless you work alone and really pay attention.\r\n\r\nI understand none of the theory behind these techniques and I have over a 100 in the class.",
                "Yes, it was a great overview of multivariate statistics",
                "Yes!! Great S&DS credit and very, very chill. If you're in a group project it can very easily be a 5th credit",
                "yes to anyone interested in stats",
                "Yes! Youll learn a lot and grading is very generous!",
                "Yes!! Great stats elective!! The format made it easy to follow and approachable.",
                "Yes, the hands-on example and homework are great for practice. The workload is comparatively smaller when work in a team to finish one project.",
                "I would recommend the course but of course with the caveat of taking the necessary prerequisites and ensuring that you have some friends with you. Because it is such a big class and you can take it asynchronously it is only enjoyable if you can lean on others.",
                "Yes, if you want an extension of SDS 230 or a low-stress class towards the stats major",
                "Absolutely, you will learn a lot about statistical applications and numerous techniques, and it's not too much work or too hard. If you are interested in applications of statistics, particularly to social sciences, and haven't taken classes with the techniques or multivariate statistics I would highly recommend it. You will learn a lot, not struggle too much with the workload, and watch engaging lectures.",
                "Yes, especially if you've already taken S&DS 230. It's a natural continuation for those who actually enjoyed the content of 230 but maybe haven't taken 241\/242 or MATH 222 yet. You get to learn about techniques based on linear algebra without having to do that much math. He also provides links to the proofs if you're interested in it, but you're not graded on your comprehension of that stuff.",
                "Yes! Easy course for the Stats major or certificate.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to all graduate students. Quantitative skill is essential in most research studies. This course provides flexibility in choosing which software to develop statistical skills.",
                "Yes -- if you're looking for a low-stress stats class, this is great. JDRS is a very good (and funny) lecturer.",
                "If you truly want to learn about multivariate statistical methods and have an ongoing project that you would want to apply the methods to, then you should take this course because it has tons of amazing resources (JDRS, his lecture notes, his recorded lectures, etc.) and you will learn a lot when you do the problem sets. If you are an undergrad looking for a gut, this can be a workload class while still doing quite well, but I'm not sure how much you'll get out of it.",
                "A good way to get exposure to more statistical methods, helpful if applicable to research you are doing already because you can use your own data set. Lots of help with coding and different softwares.",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely. The course is pretty lightweight but we learned a lot. JDRS is easily the best part of the course. He filled his lectures with comic bits and really tried to break concepts down in an intuitive way. Half the reason I took the course was to take another one with him.",
                "Yes. Fun group work.",
                "This class is definitely a gut if you have a good group to do problem sets with. It is also a class were you take away as much as you put in. You could not know the concepts very well and still do well on the assignments, or you could fully engage with all the resources provided to you and actually learn the material. I feel like I did more of the former than the latter due to a busy semester, but I also feel like I have a pretty foundational knowledge set in multivariate statistics where, if I ever needed to revisit any of this material, I would know where to look. JDRS is also a great guy, and any class taught by him is always a joy to take.",
                "Yes as this course is really useful and intersting.",
                "Yes.\r\nIt is useful.",
                "Hmm I love JDRS and I would consider myself to be pretty driven and on top of most of the things that we learned, but honestly wont recommend this class. First, most people do everything remote and some dont even watch the pre-recorded lectures, so I feel like there isnt a learning community though the class size is pretty big. Second, the assessments are too easy (no midterms, final project which is basically a compilation of your psets) which contribute to peoples lack of motivation. Third, I think the concepts explored in the course is pretty hard to retain if one doesnt understand the math behind. That said, JDRS did a fantastic job to explain everything in a simple manner, so if you are doing a project\/in a field in which you would use any of the methods discussed, then this class is worth taking since it teaches you the intuition as well as coding skills (though the vast majority, if not all, of us copied his codes when it comes to psets)",
                "Yes, this is a great class!! It's a great way to learn some multivariate statistics techniques and to get to work with classmates collaboratively.",
                "maybe, pros and cons. Good if you want a low stress class without learning that much.",
                "Yes. The workload is in control. You can learn as much as you want as long as you input you time and energy.",
                "Yes, really well designed class",
                "I would, but only if you have some prior\/existing interest or background in statistics or coding. For students doing the S&DS certificate (as I am), this is a really great course to take as part of your requirements and I'd recommend choosing it! However, think carefully about whether or not you want to work in a group. I did choose to work in a group (JDRS also encourages it), but the problem sets are not all that difficult\/time consuming and I do think this class may be less stressful if done alone, so that you are not worried about the work your group members may or may not be putting in (and how that would impact your grade). JDRS also offers the option of attending in person or watching pre-recorded lectures, and I chose the latter and highly recommend it -- not because the in-person lectures aren't engaging (they are!) but just because in STEM courses (especially if you're a non-STEM major) I find it really helpful to be able to pause the lecture to take notes or make sure I understand.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to students who have experience with data analysis & would like to gain more knowledge in this field",

                "Yes! easy to follow, learned a lot.",

                "Yes",

                "Get in a group!",
                "yes",
                "Yes! It provides you some hard skills to run data analysis and forces you to learn by doing",
                "Highly recommend this course to students of all levels. The professor is excellent at explaining the material. I've had multiple courses at Yale and online about multivariate stats but this professor made it so intuitive that it finally clicked for me.",
                "Yes definitely!  JDRS is awesome and you will learn a lot!",
                "Oh yeah",
                "Yes I would especially learning multiple statistical softwares like SAS, R, SPSS, Minitab etc.",
                "Please take this course if you are doing anything remotely research related. I would say this course is a must if you are considering anything ecology related (which I know isn't many people but for those of you who are). This course was such a great way to dramatically increase one's capability to answer many types of data-driven questions. Assignments were very reasonable and help was always offered when you asked for it. Choose your partners wisely!",
                "I would recommend this course to any student that is interested in learning multivariate techniques and wants hands-on applications instead of a lot of heavy theory.",
                "Yes, would recommend!",
                "Yes, I think the course is taught in a way that is applicable to multiple disciplines and coding languages. Also the asynchronous aspect of the class makes the material more approachable and flexible for students.",
                "Yes Very hands on",
                "I would recommend it for people who are interested in stats.",
                "yes",
                "Yes. This will take your stats game to the next level!",
                "Highly recommend you to take this course!",
                "yes, if they are interested in the material",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but I think that it would come with caveats. Firstly, I think they need a rich and quite intuitive understanding of statistics to begin with - the explanations in the course rely heavily on pre-existing stats knowledge, and it is difficult to address gaps given how content is delivered. Secondly, I would also say that you have to be willing to lead a lot of your own learning. The course helps you understand how to apply methods, but is less strong on understanding the background of methods, and you really have to take this into your own hands."
