                "strengths: nice prof, lovely man, arindam is a good TA\r\nweaknesses: classes often repetitive, psets do not reflect the material covered in class, the other TA was quite awful",
                "Strengths: This is a fairly chill class especially compared to some others in the mechanical engineering department. Prof Schroers is extremely nice and most of the exams and problem sets aren't too challenging. Weaknesses: The course probably could've moved a little bit faster at times, but this wasn't always a negative for the course.",
                "The Professor is very kind and I think he has good intentions with his teaching philosophy and the lab tour that he gave at the end of the semester. Lectures, however, were repetitive and difficult to follow, so I think the lecture slides may need to be edited to make them easier to follow and less repetitive.",
                "Strength: Jan is pretty great and does very cool research\r\nWeakness: Jan just kind of talks at you and it is difficult to absorb the information.  There is a big difference between content covered in class vs on psets.",
                "Dr. Schroers' lectures were repetitive. I didn't get much out of them. The textbook was helpful and the workload wasn't bad.",
                "The slides were not very well correlated with the psets; while the slides were very conceptual, the psets were generally more heavy on computational questions. I and most of the my classmates, particularly in the latter half of the semester, completed the psets by consulting the textbook. The midterm exam was quite fair and reasonable to our psets so far, but the final exam was not a good all-around test of what we had learned. It was too conceptual, seemed to ask the same question multiple times, and completely neglected all of the skills we had been practicing for a month on psets.",
                "Prof. Schroers does a good job at clearly explaining every concept he covers from the most basic level all the way to the complex. E.g., beginning with what covalent and ionic bonds are before getting to ceramics, etc. \r\n\r\nI do wish that he would move more quickly through material and cover a few more topics, including steel manufacturing and processing and more connections between metal properties and manufacturing processes (aluminum and brass for machining, ductile and gray iron in casting, why certain metals can be ground, the mechanics of chip formation) that a mechanical engineer might find useful later in their career.",
                "this class was very straightforward. lectures went over the material and we had weekly psets(though the problems on the psets weren't necessarily gone over in class). Exams were very fair. If you went to lectures and did the homework assignments (and make sure to read the textbook), you are set up for success.",
                "Good",
                "This course presents a good introduction to materials science, touching on many topics while also going in depth on the basics. Each class is connected to the next which makes it easy to understand new concepts learned in class by building upon previous concepts. One very minor weakness of the course is that in class, there are not many examples of written problems which appear in the homework. This could be improved by doing a few more problems in class."

                "Yes! Material was very interesting and the professor was sweet.",
                "Yeah - it's a pretty easy MENG class that is kinda interesting. Jan tries to apply what you talk about in class to the real world and show how concepts show up. Only thing is his lectures can be quite repetitive (he will often spend the first 20-30 minutes reviewing what you talked about the last class), but he won't cover all the material as if he doesn't get to the end of the slides he just doesn't talk about those concepts. The psets often don't reflect the more abstract conceptual stuff he goes over in class as they focus on calculations that derive from the concepts. They aren't super hard if you just go through the textbook and look at the example problems or bug the TA during section, but it's a little annoying that the homework isn't super relevant to what you cover in class. They do only take about an hour total a week though. Also annoying that he doesn't curve at all. Overall, Jan is a very chill guy though, many fun life stories, and I genuinely enjoyed the class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. While materials science isn't always the most interesting to me personally, I think it is largely an accessible topic and Prof Schroers does a good job of making the course a welcoming space.",
                "If you don't need it to fulfill a degree requirement, probably not. It's just very specific course material and probably not interesting to non-majors.",
                "eh its fine if you like the content, but its not the most engaging class",
                "Only if required. The workload is fine and the material isn't all that difficult, but the lectures felt like a waste of time. The material is interesting, especially if you like chemistry, but is presented poorly.",
                "Jan is a very likeable guy, and though the classes, psets, and exams are often disjointed, it is also easy enough that it doesnt really matter. This class is fine- I wouldnt exactly recommend it, but if you are taking materials science, it is almost certainly required for your major anyhow. It would certainly benefit from a revamp of the lecture slides.",
                "Yes, it is great for out-of-major stem class since it will explain more about how the world works than other science classes might. But for those without a grounding in mechanical engineering (esp. basic chemistry and stress-strain graphs) it will take some further engagement.",
                "as a non-mechanical engineering/engineering major, this class was slightly more difficult as my peers were used to a lot of the concepts covered from other classes, though this class was not impossible and very interesting. therefore definitely recommend!",
                "maybe",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in learning about materials science. A lot of topics are covered, and the fundamentals of the field are explained very well."
