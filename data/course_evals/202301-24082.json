                "I gained an appreciation for the construction of nationalism and its effect on our everyday lives. I learned how to summarize and apply arguments from readings to real-life examples, and how to think critically in class. It is a great course for any aspiring political science major, and provides a strong overview of much of the literature surrounding ethnic conflicts and comparative politics.",
                "Learned a lot about nationalism from a non-lay, political science standpoint.",
                "Most interesting thing I learned was knowledge of the historical and sociological underpinnings of national identity and nation-building",
                "The class really gave me a better understanding of what ethnic politics really is, and how nationalism and ethnicity deeply affect politics. Prior to taking this class I had a very vague idea that ethnic conflicts caused divisions, and that was about it. This class dove deeply into WHY and HOW these divisions arise in the first place, and then talks about how these divisions are manifested in political behavior. I think that nationalism and ethnic politics are a topic that many people have a vague idea about but not an actual solid understanding of. This class helped me better my understanding of the topic.",
                "As a bio major, I learned a lot about political science in general. How nations are created, what politicians use to influence. I learned how to read and write well and analyze.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths -- organization and tasks to help students engage with the material. The class itself was more of a leminar style, which meant that class participation was required, although often this was talking in small groups rather than to the group. The participation points were mini assignments based on the readings, which I found was a good way to stay on top of readings and accountable for my work. The two graded assignments were fun problem-set style questions, rather than traditional essays which I thought were a great way to stay engaged. Professor Hierro is a really strong aspect of this class. She is very engaged with the work, and really listens to students in the class to try and help them engage best with the classwork.\r\n\r\nWeakness -- I think this class focuses more on readings than other classes that are similar to this at Yale, which requires a strong engagement with material outside of the classroom in order to engage with the lecture. This works really well in many ways, but sometimes if you have had a really heavy workload week and can't get round to the readings it limits class engagement.",
                "Course bounces around a lot, but does a good job at covering all the foundational knowledge that other courses sometimes assume.",
                "Strengths: a lot of the sociology reading is really cool. Also, Professor Hierro mixes up the in-class activities to make things interesting. The two assignments throughout the term are much more interesting than a standard paper. The professor also provides regular feedback on the participation assignments, which is helpful to make sense of the readings\r\nWeaknesses: mixed level of engagement from a lot of the class. Also, most of the political science papers that were assigned were just summarized in lecture. We didn't spend a lot of time on critiquing them in a nuanced way",
                "The content of the course was very interesting and especially applicable to our current time. Prof. Hierro is a fantastic and caring professor who really put a lot of effort into teaching the class and making herself available to students. Assignments and exams were very fair and applicable to what we discussed in class. Readings were interesting, and I really appreciated that Prof. Hierro often assigned less reading but urged students to read it closely and carefully, rather than skim-read more reading. The only weakness of the course, maybe, is that lectures sometimes felt long\/very dense which made them hard to follow at times.",
                "Professor is a strength.",
                "strenghts: Prof Maria Jose is an expert on this topic. We continuously referenced Spain, her country of origin, of which she is extremely knowledgeable of.\r\nweaknesses: while an extremely important course, it could get dry at times with the tremendous amount of theory we had to read and digest. Hard to note everything down from the powerpoints",
                "Strengths: incredibly passionate professor and teaching fellows; content about sociology, psychology, and nationalism in the modern age was fascinating \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think that having learning objectives for lectures stated in sentences could be useful. Sometimes it was difficult to tell how all the ideas fit in with one another.",
                "A strength was the instructor and the reading responses. I found that I could engage with the readings better when I knew the main idea I should take away. Although I appreciated having the case studies, I thought sometimes it felt a little disconnected from the content.",
                "Overall great class. No changes",
                "Strengths: topics can be interesting. Professor is very understanding.\r\nWeaknesses: theirs is a lot of content that is being covered, almost too much, and it can be hard to keep track and understand. Also grading can be harsh for exams and assignments."

It is an engaging course, but does require more work than other overview courses I have taken, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It has definitely set me up well to continue with this material in the future.",
                "Yes, but be aware it touches on a lot of different disciplines.",
                "Sure! I think the historical parts of the class were the most interesting. We're all tied to nations and ethnicity in some way or another, and it's pretty cool to think about those identities on a deeper level",
                "I would 100% recommend this course if you have any interest in learning more about nationalism and ethnic politics, both from a current-events political standpoint and a sociological standpoint. Prof. Hierro is a fantastic professor that anyone would be lucky to have. While the course content could at times get dense and challenging, it was always fairly manageable. Assignments and exams were fair and Prof. Hierro really cares about all of her students and wants them to learn and do well in the class. I learned a lot in this class and enjoyed showing up to lecture. For political science majors I think this is a great comparative government credit.",
