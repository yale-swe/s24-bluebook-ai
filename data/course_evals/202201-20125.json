                "This course moves quickly -- it is essential to stay on top of work and ask questions as they arise. There is little opportunity to go back over material in detail that may not have been abundantly clear the first time around.",
                "I loved this course. However, I wish we had been able to practice conversation more. It felt like much of the in-class discussion consisted of the instructor speaking a lot and students giving one or two-word answers. Also, the quality of the audio exercises was often poor and\/or didn't match the worksheets.",
                "Strengths is that if you want to improve in the language, it definitely allows you to do that. Weaknesses would be that I wish there was a little less emphasis on grammar rules and structure and more on improving the workability of the course.",
                "I think this course really is brilliant. Sure, you have to do mountains of work, but the end result of confidence and flexibility with French is a huge benefit. The only weakness I would say is the fact that some texts are a bit rushed. I think we could have done without a couple of the diversity stories and instead spent much longer digesting and learning about sac de billes. Overall a great class; it's a shame that future L4 students won't get to learn from Mme Koizim, who has been a splendid professor over the last two semesters.",
                "It might be an unpopular opinion, but I really enjoyed the intense reading of this course. On the other hand, recorded oral production questions felt extremely frustrating and an unnatural way to communicate. The syllabi were also all over the place, and it was difficult to know what was due.",
                "At times the workload with the reading (especially having assigned readings after tests) is a bit much",
                "Very organized course"

                "yes",
                "I absolutely would. If you want to become more handy with your French skills while absorbing more about literature, this is the class for you.",

                "Absolutely the teachers are amazing and the material is taught very well",
