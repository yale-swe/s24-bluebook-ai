   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very slow pace making it easy to do well with very little outside work on your own",
    "The rigor of this course is high, but despite its rapid pace, it does introduce students to a vast array of important statistical tests that are necessary for understanding psychological testing.",
    "Strengths: accessible to anyone, well-explained, lots of support structure, recording (invaluable for review) and attendance policy, great TAs\r\nWeaknesses: slow, limited exposure to underlying math, superficial explanations\r\nImprovements: incorporate more theory into labs, ask students to take more initiative in what to report, etc.",
    "Professor Johnston cares a lot about the class and tries to incorporate mid-semester feedback as much as she can. The weakness will be that in order to accommodate everyone, the class can be too slow at times.",
    "I really enjoyed this class a lot! Section was helpful and lecture was engaging enough",
    "It's intro stats for psychology, so it's about what you'd expect from a big lecture course about statistics as applied to the social sciences. It wasn't by any means a bad course, and Dr. Johnston makes it as fun and relevant as possible. Her presentations are well-organized, she does a good job responding to student feedback, and she gives a lot of examples that make stats more concrete. It's also a very easy course, provided that you put at least some effort into attending class and doing the psets. If you're serious about stats, however, and not just taking it as a requirement of psych\/cog sci\/neuro, you'd probably be better off taking an S&DS course. This class is weirdly math-averse (like, on the midterms, you don't even calculate anything, just plug numbers into a formula and leave it at that), so make of that what you will. It's also focused on SPSS, but SPSS is apparently becoming decreasingly useful compared to R or various other programs.",
    "Strengths - comprehensive, well structured\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - very rudimentary",
    "Strengths: interesting and very useful material\r\nWeaknesses: professor",
    "It was a great course, very approachable and accessible, and I learned a lot\r\nThe labs moved very quickly, it would be nice to cover less material\/work on pacing",
    "Strengths is that it is good for statistics beginners (like me). I was able to excel in the course even with people who had already taken AP Statistics. However, sometimes the material got quite repetitive.",
    "It's just really easy. Lots of support from TAs and the professor. At times it felt like it was too easy to do well in this class.",
    "Strengths: Professor Johnston is great. Her lectures cover material that I find extremely dry, but she does so in a way that does not feel boring. She succeeded with getting me interested in the course material in spite of my reservations.",
    "I liked the pace and the weekly homeworks (forced you to keep up w material), and the section guides that we could refer to if we ever got stuck. The only complaint I have is that, especially at the beginning of the semester, instructors didn't really respond on Piazza all that much (it was mostly students helping each other out).",
    "The lectures were well organized and easy to understand but the exams were pretty hard",
    "The course is taught at a very slow pace, which can be helpful, but it also meant that my level of engagement was not as high for this class than for others.",
    "I thought this course was fantastic. It was the first course I have taken in two years at Yale that felt like it was really geared towards making sure the students understood the information presented, and the professor and teaching staff emphasized this. There were many resources available for anyone who had questions throughout the semester.",
    "the slides were poorly done, very convoluted and i always had to redo notes on my own to understand things. bad organization.",
    "Lectures were sometimes redundant at the beginning and too fast near the end because of time shortage. But other than that it was a good course.",
    "Good intro to basic stats at a SLOW speed. Perhaps not in depth enough.",
    "It's just kinda boring stuff, they teach it pretty well though.",
    "The homeworks and labs were very helpful and relevant",
    "I think the lab sections could be less involved, because sometimes there wasn't enough time. But a strength was how the TAs and Prof. Johnston responded to feedback! Alyssa, my TA, was excellent and extremely helpful and responsive.",
    "I think this course could be more fun.",
    "Stop repeatedly reviewing older topics in subsequent lectures",
    "It went through a lot of material in a short amount of time which is good and bad. I liked that we covered a lot of important material but sometimes it went too fast and I couldn't understand. That's where the section was helpful.",
    "Professor Johnston did a very good job at presenting the information in a way that was not overwhelming and was concise. At the beginning of the course the lecture style was too fast, but she adjusted per student recommendations. Professor Johnston also did a good job at repeating throughout the lectures the main points that were most important.",
    "Strengths: organization of class made all concepts clear, lab sections were very helpful in understanding concepts\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were very slow and if you have any math\/stat background this class was definitely moving too slow for you",
    "Strengths: teaching staff has many office hours to help students, lectures were accessible with many examples\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would be helpful to slow down through the lectures and use PollEverywhere to gauge how well students understand the concepts",
    "Strengths: this is by far the easiest course offered in Yale College. It only meets 2x\/week and only for 50 minutes and ends early every single time. There is hardly any content covered and what is covered is very simple. Despite being a statistics course, you are not expected to do any math and don't even get a calculator on the exams (which are multiple choice\/true-false and don't require any mathematical knowledge whatsoever). Grading is very generous and questions are very simple. This class is very middle-school-esque in its scope, requirements, and rigor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: limited content, useless software, professor. By far the biggest weakness of this course is that you don't learn anything useful. I was hoping to learn about how to calculate some statistics tests and maybe get into some multivariate stats, but we didn't do either of those things. We spent a long time on z-tests, which are by far the most useless of all the tests that we learned. The remaining tests (t, ANOVA) did not get a mathematical treatment, only conceptual (I don't know how to calculate them after this class). We didn't even get to repeated measures ANOVA or chi-squared tests. This class uses SPSS, which is by far the least helpful statistic software out there (its a glorified excel for those unaware). This class would benefit from learning something actually used in the field, like R or even python. Dr. Johnston was also not a very engaging professor. You could tell she cared about us but I don't think she did a great job of explaining the content (Google is your friend).",
    "This class is a great option for students who did not take AP Statistics in high school or have any statistics background. It is very well paced and devoted to the actual learning of students.",
    "Strengths: material is explained well, professor is engaging, there are many opportunities to get help",
    "Good lectures, sometimes repetitive, great prof",
    "Strengths: Very clearly explained. Lecture slides were detailed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the course was a bit more challenging and went into other statistical tests that are commonly used (ex. chi-squared) instead of just concentrating on the small subset (z-tests, t-tests, ANOVAs)",
    "I think we could learn more about how to actually do the homework in lecture as opposed to learning everything about the problem sets in section. I thin lecture could be a little more focused on actually solving problems and less conceptual things.",
    "Psets were very helpful, lectures were engaging",
    "Moves a little slowly -- good if you have never had a stats class though",
    "First half of the semester was very slow, second half was much quicker. Not necessarily something that needs to be fixed, just my own observation.",
    "I liked that classes included student interaction.",
    "Lectures, notes, and sections made the information easy to understand. The lecture attendance policy was silly and sometimes lecture slides weren't always clear, as the redundancy made some of the information a bit convoluted.",
    "Although I appreciated not having to do too much intense math, the amount of math was so low that I didn't actually get much useful stats ability out of the course",
    "I thought this course was taught very fairly and was sttuctured in a way that facilitated my learning.",
    "It was really helpful that the lecture slides were posted on canvas",
    "alyssa\/ TA in the class was the best",
    "Easy overall as I did not have background in statistics but still managed to do well in the exercises\r\nMaybe include more methods to learn as sometimes the lecture was slow paced and ideas kept being repeated",
    "Attendance should NOT have been mandatory. You didnt not have to go to class at all to get an A.",
    "I liked how the course was grounded in real-world applications.",
    "The course is not the most interesting, and the problem sets can seem a bit confusing, especially at the beginning, but all in all it is a good QR for those of us who are less mathematically inclined, as it is highly applicable to social science\/humanities.",
    "Strengths: Everything is very standardized and organized, which makes the class easy to navigate and fair (lectures are recorded, slides are uploaded, section worksheets and uploaded and answer keys are updated, etc.); the class is very easy as well \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class isnt very rigorous (though this isnt necessarily a bad thing bc most people are looking for a gut), so if you want a more fundamental basis in the math of stats or coding, this isnt the class for you.",
    "The course I think was well facilitated for learning. The problem sets and exams were straightforward and the way the semester was set up for learning had good flow. I think the final project could be taken away because I feel like the course is a good amount of work already with the two exams and ten problem sets.",
    "Strengths: I learned how to choose statistical tests very well. Weaknesses: it was a very repetitive, redundant course.",
    "I think the problem sets help students solidify a working knowledge of statistics and allow us to see them in practice. Lectures were generally easy to follow, and the assignments could be interesting. We also got a lot of feedback on our work, which I appreciated. However, I felt that discussion section could have been managed better - they were often either too slowly paced or too quickly paced, and classmates were often unengaged. I also didn't think the final project should have been a group project, as needing to collaborate didn't really improve our project at all and often slowed us down.",
    "A weakness was not receiving grades for a pset until after you submitted the one for the next week. It didn't make sense to me at all because it made it hard to build upon concepts and know what errors to look for in the next pset. By not being able to see how you were doing and the ta feedback, the learning process was made more difficult.",
    "Very good course, set up well, facilitates learning and success.",
    "Great touch of stats for beginners but could go a little deeper.",
    "super easy. great fifth class, easy qr, and definitely good skills to build",
    "The lectures were incredibly boring and went so slow. Watching the lectures on 2x speed was more effective than the actual lectures because it was so easy to get bored by the slow pace and tune out. Two actual things that Professor Johnston said were \"when you multiply a negative by a negative you get a positive\" and \"any number times 0 is 0\" which feel like concepts that are not apt for a college-level statistics course. The TAs were amazing though!!",
    "Strengths: well-explained concepts, good timing\r\nWeaknesses: kind of slow\/elementary knowledge at times, but i understand that's the type of course it is",
    "This course is good as an introductory course for STEM majors, who will eventually need to do statistical measures for labs and fellowships. This course is also good in the way that it does not assume prior knowledge of the subject and builds up skills that even help when taking Intro Psyc simultaneously.",
    "I thought that lectures often moved too quickly and it was at times really hard to follow. Slowing down and being more clear may have been beneficial to the students' understanding.",
    "This was one of the most straightforward math-related courses I have ever taken at Yale and I appreciate that so much. Everything was easy to follow and this made me more engaged with the material and actually made me enjoy studying\/learning. I didn't like that we had to pay to use SPSS, and how that was a major focus of section but we didn't really use it elsewhere. I wonder if this is the best way to facilitate the learning of statistics and if perhaps there is another way that doesn't involve learning a program I may never use again. Also, I think questions on Piazza could have been answered a lot quicker and it would have been more helpful as we worked through assignments.",
    "I think it engages students very well.",
    "Weakness was the crossover between lectures and sections. Lectures were so general and the p sets were so specific it was difficult to do them.",
    "Strengths: Doesn't move too fast, does a good job of getting into some detail without boring us though. Teaches good fundamentals, fair grading, fair exams, good sections.\r\nWeaknesses:  maybe a bit rushed with material towards the end, but also otherwise this didn't feel that interesting because I feel like there's way more we can do with stats that's super interesting that we didn't really get into at all.",
    "The course is very well structured (the weights of the assignments, the time taken to get grades back, the reminders of deadlines) \r\nHowever, more feedback could be given back from homework",
    "Loved it, was so well taught, loved the prof, wouldnt change a thing\r\nLoved the slower pace, repettition, and the spread out work load\r\nLoved the in class help session on projects and appreciated having to submit parts if projects for hw so it was all spread out",
    "Very well organized, good lecturers, and good notes, such good slides that many people would not come to class because they knew the slides were that good.",
    "Prof. Johnston went way too fast over slides; wouldve been great if even after she was done talking she could have lingered a bit on slides to give us time to write stuff down and process info. Section was extremely boring but helpful with SPSS.",
    "Prof Johnston and the TF team were very approachable and eager to help in any way. The content of the course itself wasnt so interesting, but they did the best they could with the information they needed to communicate.",
    "The class often felt monotonous. Perhaps adding more real-world statistics and examples would help with this.",
    "Its very clear about breaking down the math to make it accessible to and to make its real world relevance clear with each new concept",
    "This course is very doable for someone who has never taken statistics before. The lectures were clear and gave good examples. The assessments were fair.",
    "beeeeep",
    "Strengths:\r\n-Prof. Johnston is good at breaking down complex concepts into smaller understandable chunks\r\n-TAs were very helpful and the section worksheets were clear and easy to follow",
    "Strengths - well-taught\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - PollEv attendance checks (people would just show up to the last 10 min of class to hear the code of the day so they didn't really do their job anyways)",
    "Every lecture is recorded, which makes it really easy to go back, listen and review and allow you to just pay attention while in class and not worry about catching everything she says. I took this class just to get a QR credit, and it was very very doable.",
    "super organized, well explained concepts",
    "Professor Johnston was not the greatest lecturer, in that there were a lot of examples, but not enough explanation or application in the lectures.",
    "The course is very disorganized and difficult to follow. The exams do not at all mirror what is taught in section or lecture."

    "I would recommend this to someone who wants an extremely basic level of statistics",

    "It's a great introductory statistics course, provides good foundation in SPSS, and has a lot of support.",
    "YES!!! such a good class. not too much work, and you learn a ton about stats.",
    "I would recommend this course, because it gives you a basic foundation of statistics.",
    "Yes if they have no prior experience.",
    "If you're taking it as a requirement or you're looking for an easy stats course, yes. If you want to major in stats or you're looking for a more comprehensive, more math-heavy intro course, look elsewhere.",
    "Recommended if you're interested in basic stats \/ how to apply stats to real world settings",
    "Yes! The material is interesting and the professor is leaving Yale this semester, so it should be much better in the future!",
    "Yes, absolutely. I think that it gives you a very good grasp of statistical concepts without being stressful for the sake of being stressful and teaches you a lot in a healthy, low-pressure environment.",
    "I would recommend only if you haven't taken statistics or if you want a QR gut.",
    "It's an amazing QR credit for anyone who's not very good at math. For psych majors, it's not super necessary if you're looking to take more advanced classes. I'm sure it wouldn't be that difficult to test out of it. It's a very chill 5th credit, but not especially interesting or exciting just by the nature of the class.",
    "I would recommend this class to any psych major who wants\/needs to learn about statistical analyses of data. Non-psych majors looking for an interesting statistics or math class should look elsewhere.",
    "Yup, fun and easy way to learn stats",
    "Yes! The instruction was very clear and the material was super interesting",
    "This is a great class to take if you want to just skim the surface of the world of statistics.",
    "Absolutely. It is a fantastic course and teaches you information that is useful for life, regardless of what career path you are on.",
    "I definitely would. It was easy to understand and keep up with and the material was relevant and practical. Though I would say that it is meant for students with NO background in statistics at all.",
    "Sure, if you need stats or an easy QR. Don't expect anything groundbreaking though",
    "It's a pretty easy quantitative reasoning credit.",
    "Yes. It is a great intro",
    "Yes! It isn't a gut, but it also isn't hard. Like, yes, you have to study (well, I did at least), but no, you aren't about to get a D. It's also actually interesting and isn't all about numbers and the final project is really cool. P-sets vary in difficulty, but if you actually take the time to do them, then you'll easily get 100.",
    "I would recommend this course if you would like to learn about statistical tests. This course will be useful if you are thinking of studying psychology or cognitive science; you should understand basic concepts of statistics when reading papers and looking for significant results. This class is fair, meaning that if you put in the work, you will get the grade you deserve. However this year, you had to put in a fair bit of work. But you are directly rewarded for it.",
    "Yes, for a good background in statistics.",
    "I would recommend it to another student looking to major in psych and who needs a QR. It was very helpful for both. It was interesting and not too hard of a class.",
    "Yes, the class was informative and clear, and as an English major, the class was a perfect challenge for me.",
    "I would recommend this class to any humanities major that need a QR credit. It's not extremely easy but the coursework is interesting and Professor Johnston and her TAs were extremely helpful. There is no strenuous math involved but it is necessary to show up to every lecture and section or you might quickly fall behind.",
    "If you have any stat\/math background, this class is not for you. I'd recommend taking a higher level stats class if this applies to you.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student at Yale. I found it to be very useful and applicable to everyday life -- statistics is used everywhere.",
    "This is a really strong introduction to statistics, particularly in their application to social sciences (especially psychology). I think this class facilitates a good conceptual understanding of the tests you're performing on your data, but doesn't go deep into theory (which is good for some people, and less desirable for others). Take it for a basic mastery of a commonly-used battery of statistical tests!",
    "No. Don't take this class. It will be a huge waste of your time. Nobody takes statistics for fun: you take it because you want to learn a useful skill. I was hoping to take a stats class that would do that, but in a fun and easy way. The course was definitely easy, but I learned nothing. You hardly cover any actual stats tests, and the ones you do are very simple and you don't even learn the math behind them. I don't feel any better about doing stats after this class than I did before. The software used in this class is SPSS. Not only is SPSS extremely outdated and used by literally nobody in 2019, it also is one of the only options that is not free and not offered by Yale ITS for a temporary free license. This means you have to pay, or walk to a computer lab, to learn a useless and outdated software. Don't waste you time, take one of the S&DS 10X courses or maybe even 123 or 220 or something, just not this.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I took it because every pre-med is recommended to take an introductory stats course. I took a little bit of S&DS 101 before dropping it due to a scheduling conflict, and I would definitely recommend PSYC200 over S&DS101 if you just need to take any intro stats course. It's straightforward and very doable - a good 5th credit if you need stats or a QR!",
    "Yes. It is an easy QR and I think the material is applicable. Professor Johnston is good, as well.",
    "Yes! It was an easy class that teaches you a bit about SPSS with a great professor!",
    "YES! Wonderful stats class that is a good introductory to anyone who has never taken stats.",
    "Take the course if you want to take it easy. If you already took a statistics course in high school though, I would definitely aim for a higher level stats course.",
    "Yes I would because I learned a lot and the course was well organized and had different sorts of assignments.",
    "Yes, a great introduction to statistics which was very useful for other courses",
    "Yes -- good base",
    "Yes, because it equips Psychology majors with essential skills and knowledge.",
    "Yes, definitely a good QR for those who need it.",
    "It's a gut, but take something else if you actually want to learn stats",
    "Yes! It was informative and enjoyable!",
    "Yes, a great QR credit where you actually learn something too!",
    "Yes. Easy QR",
    "Yes! It's a great way to fulfill your QR\/Premed stats requirement!",
    "YES, it is definitely an easy QR and a good way to learn statistics without worrying about those details. Also, will teach you how to evaluate statistical findings in researches centered around Psychology.",
    "Not unless they need it for a requirement",
    "Yes, I would. The class is useful, but not overly stressful.",
    "Yes, if you are a humanities\/social science student looking for a low-math QR that doesn't require a ton of work or engagement. But don't take it if your goal is to learn lots and feel very involved with the material.",
    "Yes, if you want a simple, easy, and non-rigorous introduction to stats. You will learn tests like t-tests and one-way ANOVA in the context of psychology.",
    "No. There is little practical application beyond psych.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students if they are interested in learning more about statistics and how to use it in the world.",
    "I would not recommend this course if you have any stats or psych research background.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend taking this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who doesn't know much about statistics and wants a basic overview. However, for students who have taken statistics before, the pace of the course is a little slow.",
    "If all they want is a easy QR relative to other courses at Yale, then I would recommend it. But overall, this course frustrated me with its grading and structure.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes -- it's a good foundation in statistics with applications in psychology.",
    "Yes. Easy class and felt like you got something out of it.",
    "easy, great fifth class, good way to learn basic stats in a low stakes environment",
    "Yes! If you're looking for a good intro level stats class",
    "Yes. It's a good intro course.",
    "No, I don't think I would recommend this course. It is not terribly difficult but I don't feel like I got a lot out of it. The lectures were not very engaging and I did not get very much helpful or even constructive feedback from my TF on any of my work.",
    "Yes, the class was very well structured.",
    "Its so much more workload than you would think. Psych majors should take it but this is NOT A GUT work wise.",
    "Good, low work, good professor, you learn a lot if youve never done statistics",
    "Yeah, but you're only taking this unless your a psych major I would assume? Otherwise just take normal stats? Idk, this is a good class.",
    "Yes it is helpful in providing a good knowledge of statistics",
    "Yes, good class, some workload but even out and really good structure, also I had a great TA.",
    "Highly recommend as an easy QR. Psets take very little time usually.",
    "Yes! It was a great introduction to statistics and was very easy to do well!",
    "Yes, if they need a relatively easy QR or are interested in Statistics.",
    "Unfortunately, no. I took this course as a psychology major to fulfill a requirement. While the class did enhance my understanding of statistics, I did not find the material riveting.",
    "Yes! A great intro QR and interesting",
    "Yes. This is a great QR to take if QRs are not your thing. It was a good survey of statistics and was not too complex.",
    "blooop",
    "Yes. Well organized and planned.",
    "If you need a QR credit or are interested in gaining a basic understanding of statistics this is a fairly simple, not too difficult, intro statistics course. Analyses are done in SPSS (easy software to learn).",
    "If you have to take a stats class as a pre-med or QR credit, I highly, highly recommend this course. The concepts presented in class were easy to understand, and the lab sections helped reinforce those concepts. Anything mentioned in lecture was always reviewed so people could understand, and Prof Johston was amazing at explaining concepts in a way that made it easy to understand. The final project, albeit a group project, was actually not that bad, and there was enough support from TFs so that the project went smoothly. I was scared to take a stats course at Yale because I had no background, but I'm happy I took this course because I loved this.",
    "PSYC 200 is a very accessible and interesting class! Best QR credit for sure!",
    "Yes!",
    "Completely recommend for a QR credit.",
    "No."
