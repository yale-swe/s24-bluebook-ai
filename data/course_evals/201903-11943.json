    "I learned to trust the body and its instincts-- through exercises inspired by Grotowski, Stanislavski, Chekhov, etc, I really began to understand what it means to follow the true impulse and to free the body from the restraints of the mind and the inner critic.",
    "Got more confidence in my own ability to create material to be performed.",
    "Theater of Desire! If you write your own work, you will never have to audition for anything. You will always have work.",
    "I subliminally learned about many different basic acting and performance techniques and styles. I also gained a much better sense of my own artistic voice and style.",
    "I learned to be present in a classroom and use my vulnerabilities to empower myself, my writing, and my performance.",
    "As a theatre studies major concentrating in directing, I learned a lot from this course about shaping the actors instinct and doing what you want in the theatre. Building a theatre of desire."

    "Taking this course with Deb, I really saw no weaknesses but the course's brevity-- only one semester. The class was physically, intellectually, and emotionally demanding and rewarding. One of its great strengths was in the trust we all developed for one another as an ensemble because of our instructor's leadership and care for us.",
    "More chances to do scenes? Not sure.",
    "Strengths: Deb. Deb is an incredible, hilarious human and teacher. If you have the chance to take 210 with Deb, do it! THST210 didn't really feel like an acting class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's a pre-req for Theater Studies, so if you have to take it even if you don't want to.",
    "Deb was fantastic and an incredibly loving and caring teacher. I wish there was more focus on scene work and actually looking at the text of scenes, rather than just the emotion behind.",
    "Strengths: Everything. Take Deb's section!",
    "I do wish this courses final project had the option to do something other than a performance. Given that its a requirement for the THST major and not all THST majors are actors, I found that to be the one aspect of the course that wasnt conducive to non-actors."

    "I would recommend this course to any student who is willing to take risks. This material is not easy-- it takes grit, honesty, vulnerability, and willingness to trust others. However, the rewards are plentiful and so fulfilling.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "If you are a Theater Studies major or interested in acting, take 210 with Deb.",
    "Its required for the theater studies major so yeah lol. I thinks its also a prerequisite for every acting class so like.... if youre interested in performance I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes! Take it with Deb! She is so understanding and funny and allows you to learn acting, writing, and presence of kind!",
    "YES! Of all the 210 section options, Id argue that Debs is by far the most fun and student-driven. We got to choose all the texts we got to work with, so there was never a moment we werent excited about what we were doing. And Deb is simply the best Professor Ive ever had."
