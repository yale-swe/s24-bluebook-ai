                "I gained so much from this course! I was able to improve my skills in video production and criticism in many aspects. I'm leaving the course empowered to continue working with video and pushing my boundaries, and I'm excited to apply all of the ideas generated from class conversation into new creative endeavors. I particularly appreciated the formal skills and insights learned from this course, which are harder to get in undergraduate art courses at Yale, which are usually more theory heavy.",
                "I came in not knowing much about video art (as a graphic design undergrad) and left with a good understanding of the history and zeitgeist of video in the art world -- but most importantly, I learned to film and edit video into art."

                "very open and accepting (safe space for experimentation), crits could be slightly more critical",
                "I think the main strength of this class is making digital video accessible and interesting to people who don't have a background in it. The main weakness is that the class covers such much ground that we can't really dive into any one of the techniques  such as framing, audio, lighting, etc  in too much detail.",
                "This course is extremely well structured! Its priorities are refreshingly in order compared to other art classes I've taken at Yale that are thick on theory without allowing space to apply it to creative projects. The course gives students the practical and theoretical tools, practice, and time necessary to create substantial work they are proud of. Class conversations were always exciting and enlightening. The wide breadth of video work that we discussed inspired formal and conceptual considerations that we could apply to our own creative projects. This is one of the rare classes I've taken where I never dreaded a single assignment. Neil was extremely invested in all of the students' work, and one on one conversations with him (and our awesome TA Jessica) about the progression of our projects were helpful and motivating. I really appreciated the space given to workshopping our in-progress work, and the progressive buildup from shorter to more long-form projects. My only complaint about the course is that its over! I'm gonna miss this class a lot.",
                "Strengths: Neil listened to what we wanted from the class in terms of instruction re: editing and sound, and lined up Zoom visits with professionals who talked to us about their specialties. I don't know that I have had another class that was so tailored to the students' interests."

He creates a wonderful environment for learning and also you get to learn a very useful technical skills. However, there is a lot of space to take agency over your learning and direct your own learning\/practice, which I really appreciate.",
                "Absolutely!! This is a really fun and engaging class; the community of the classroom feels very supportive and safe, and you get to watch a lot of really amazing works of art!",
                "Yes! Would definitely recommend to someone interested in video\/image work. Received a lot of clear feedback and felt like I had improved by the end of the course",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in video art, or honestly anything to do with moving image media. The class environment is non-intimidating and fun, and I felt the freedom to take risks without fear of judgement or failure. I came out of the course with a substantially increased understanding of the power of video and an excitement to engage with it more thoughtfully in the future.",
                "If you're at all curious about video art, this class is a delightful intro. You don't have to be a videographer or an artist. Just make sure you can schedule time to film projects!"
