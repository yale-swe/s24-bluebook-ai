                "We had different speakers from organizations such as the UN, World Bank, CT Greek Bank, etc who come to every class and share insights on their roles. It is a great opportunity not only to learn more about ongoing efforts in addressing climate change but also ask them career-related questions.",
                "Only strengths. I absolutely LOVED this course. By far my favourite during my time at Yale. It has been incredible and I definitely recommend it for all EVST and non-EVST majors alike! It is incredibly engaging and you can lead your own project in whatever direction you like.",
                "Strengths of this class included a wide variety of interesting speakers, very helpful and involved TAs, and mostly clear expectations & speedy feedback on work submitted.\r\n\r\nNo major weaknesses to speak of. This was a great class! One small thing was that it was a little challenging to approach the main project of the class- it was a great project and I learned a lot ultimately, but starting it was confusing and a little overwhelming. I felt as though I had much less of a basis in what this type of class asked for compared to other students. Many of these other students were graduate students as well, which was a little bit intimidating. Probably 90% a me thing and not a \"this class\" thing, but it might be helpful to explicitly set up appts with undergraduates or directly address them in the first class to ensure that we are on the right page regarding the asks of the central project.",

It was a great experience and I learned a lot about different sustainability-minded projects happening around the world. The opportunity to listen to so many speakers, both local and international, was an opportunity I'm really glad to have had. The professor was also very aware of the challenges that students were facing due to local events and COVID, and the TA was always available, enthusiastic, encouraging, and helpful.
