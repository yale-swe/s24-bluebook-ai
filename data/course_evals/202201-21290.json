                "We explored a lot of topics at the intersection of identity, society, and STEM, but I think the main takeaway was exploring the responsibility that people have in the scientific community to practice science in an ethical manner.",
                "I improved my pedagogical skills through this course. I led an entire class period on my research topic, assigned a class reading, and facilitated discussion on my subject. I also improved in scientific research methodology with the research project and popular press piece."

                "The strength was the student-focused discussions and the respect for sensitive topics. A weakness was the time frame, would be better as a full semester course, even if only meeting every other week.",
                "Strengths were definitely the student-led discussions. We got to cover a wide range of topics in a relatively short time period. A weakness would be probably that it's a lot of work to do for only half a credit and in half a semester but I think that's already in talks to be resolved so I'm not too worried about that.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kabeche facilitated discussions very well, and allowed us the flexibility to pivot towards topics we wanted to talk about as well.\r\nWeaknesses: The course felt a bit rushed, but I think this was mostly due to the fact that it met only during the second half of the semester. I also think it would be helpful to have a little more guidance on what is expected for assignments, but overall this was a fantastic course!",
                "The strength of this course is the freedom students have in choosing a topic for the course. Also, the class is only half a semester long! The weakness is the distribution of work throughout the half-semester. Before the course starts, you need an idea in mind to focus your research and portion of the popular press piece on, but this can change later on in the course.  A part of the final paper is due each week. Some of the more intensive labor for the projects, such as the paper's main project description, is due at the end of the semester, at the same time as many other assignments."

                "I would recommend this course to anyone willing to learn more about how STEM affects people and the world in a non-scientific way.",
                "Yes, I think a lot of students in the major need to sit down and have a hard think about how science and it's impact spreads beyond findings that impact medicine.  It's hard to grapple with the moral implications of something that is just assumed to be a benevolent discipline but it will make for a generation of more ethical and empathetic researchers and health professionals.",
                "Yes, absolutely yes! Professor Kabeche and Professor Miranker are great! I also think this is a very relevant class to explore the responsibilities you have as a member of the scientific community.",
                "I highly recommend taking this class. It's now required for the MB&B major, but I took it even though it wasn't a requirement for me. I loved that you can pair it with a humanities course because it leads to really cool interdisciplinary work. Each person's topic in class was fascinating, and we still engaged in scientific inquiry and methodology. Plus, it's a really cool experience getting to lead the class on a topic of your choice for an entire session. I also really enjoyed the graduate student panel. Another plus was that Professor Kabeche brought snacks to every class!"
