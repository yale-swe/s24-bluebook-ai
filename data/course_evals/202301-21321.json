                "The asynchronous day in this course is definitely a strength in that we were able to engage with Greek students from Greece and challenge our conversational skills. The pace at which the class progressed with content was very beneficial in that no one was left behind and that we could cover a lot of material.",
                "This is a very strong course overall.",
                "I think that the biggest strength of this course is its near-immersive environment. I thought that one of the most unique and helpful aspects of the course this semester was its pilot asynchronous program, in which class on Fridays was asynchronous, and every other Friday we would have a tele-collaboration with students in Thessaloniki. This gave me the opportunity to practice my spoken Greek with native speakers, and to present on some of the material we were learning during the course this semester. I think that one of the weaknesses of this course is that not all of the students took the work seriously, and as a result we had to slow down the pace of the course because their level of proficiency had fallen behind."

                "Absolutely.  Maria (course instructor) is so passionate about the Greek language and culture, but is also incredibly invested in the success and well being of her students.  Truly an outstanding learning opportunity in more ways than one could imagine.",
                "ABSOLUTELY. Its an incredible learning experience.",
                "I would recommend this course (both L1 and L2) to another student if they are interested in learning a new language or if they are a heritage speaker but their Greek has gotten a lot worse since they were younger. I think this course is an amazing opportunity to learn and practice the modern Greek language, an opportunity which cannot be found at all colleges. I would not recommend this course to another student if they are only taking the course because they think it will be a gut. You will fall behind if you do not take the workload seriously, and it is unfair to the other students who are serious about improving their Greek, and it is especially unfair to the professor."
