I thoroughly enjoyed the work I did in this course, especially, reading, discussing, and writing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Prof. Sorkin teaches this like a graduate course, which is part of what makes it so great, but that can prove challenging, especially with regards to 1. assumed prior knowledge and 2. the number and length of texts we were expected to read each week. It was acknowledged and understood that we weren't supposed to actually get every word from every text, but I think it could have been better if Prof. Sorkin notified us in advance of what texts or sources or chapters were most crucial to read and understand."

                "What an amazing class. Professor Sorkin is one of the best professors I've ever had at Yale. The class was leminar-style, and my favorite part was always getting to hear him lecture - he is so knowledgeable and patient and breaks down complicated histories in such an easy-to-understand way. More than any class I've taken, the course was truly well-organized in terms of thematics, and we looked at a few things at the beginning of the course that we continued to evaluate in every subsequent unit - it was great, and surely made me a better history student. You get to write and then re-write each paper after feedback which is such a great way to become a better writer, and also makes everything a lot less stressful. Amazing class, highly recommend.",
                "lots and lots of reading, take it if you're very interested in the topics covered",
                "Absolutely. Even if you have no connection to Judaism, this course is such a fantastic history course that is easy to fall in love with.",
                "YES -- good amount of reading and writing, but it's manageable and enjoyable. If you're at all curious about the topic and want to read the stories of those involved in different Jewish political movements and changes in Jewish life during the 20th century, please take this class.",
                "Definitely. Both Prof and TF are incredible and deserve teaching awards. If you like Jewish history or political science this is a course for you."
