This class did a great job balancing some pretty horrific histories alongside also showcasing work that is being done to address the harm these researchers tried to do \r\nSkills: Learning how to navigate through the archives and also how to analyze disciplines through an Anti-Eugenic lens",

                "The discussion in seminar each week was by far the highlight of this class. I felt that we were truly getting so much out of it and learning from each other beyond just what was in the weekly readings. I also really liked that we started each class with the chance to learn about an anti-eugenic project that our classmates were working on and insights from the class before. Both Professor HoSang and Minali were excellent teachers who created a welcoming environment that really created community amongst our class. The guest speakers and the mini-fieldtrips were also amazing additions to the class. I can think of no weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Exploring different sites of knowledge (the museum, the archives), one of those seminars where you truly learn from your peers, the guest speakers, the readings, and the way Professor HoSang and Minali would facilitate class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times the readings were a bit long and at times not fully discussed in class, would have enjoyed more time with the archives, and addressing the final capstone project sooner would have been more helpful",
                "No weaknesses",
                "The course was excellent, its strengths were in the breadth and depth of the material. Class conversations were very enlightening and hearing from guest speakers was very valuable. Weaknesses were straying from assigned readings, the course tried to cover so much towards the end of the semester that we were not able to discuss readings."

                "Absolutely. Super interesting and engaging class, left feeling very close to my classmates and grateful for experiences like visits to the archive and Peabody museum.",
                "Absolutely!!! Please take this course. As you will learn if you do, so many fields are implicated in the eugenic project and our institution even more so. Getting the chance to reckon with these histories that directly impact work you are probably doing today is so important and will help you make better choices moving forward. It is also a great learning environment and community and you will sincerely enjoy going to class every week.",
                "Yes 100%, it is one of those classes that changed your outlook for the rest of the. Since uncovering a lot of Yale's ties to the Eugenics movement has only recently started, it is great to be in a class environment where you feel as if your research and the work you are doing is something that other students can build on and sincerely feel collaborative. There are also ample chances to interact with guest speakers, archival research, and visits to the museum! Professor HoSang also does a great job inviting guest speakers or planning trips to visit other places on campus that are doing Anti-Eugenics work in several different fields-- environmental studies, psychology, pedagogy, etc.-- that help provide hope despite learning about a difficult subject.",
                "Yes! I think its important for people to understand Yale' s role in the Eugenics movement",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I think students from any major could gain a lot from this course, but I would probably recommend some background in humanities so you are prepared to read and do archival research.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to other students because it teaches information relevant to everyone. The history of Eugenics, and the way it exists today, is important to be aware of."
