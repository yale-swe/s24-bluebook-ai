                "The course draws on a lot of concepts from linear algebra and machine learning, but neither of these are listed as prerequisites. Additionally, at times I felt that lecture content didn't adequately prepare me for the problem sets. I'd often have to spend hours searching the Internet to gain the insights I needed, or otherwise go to lots of office hours.",
                "It is a good introduction to NLP and the various topics although it sometimes lacks cohesion. The office hours however were not well aligned with homework due dates (being at latest on Thursday with the TAs and Friday with Drago for a Monday submission). Moreover, I thought office hours were really quite necessary for beginners. The psets were an interesting way of using what we learned practically but did not particularly build off of each other (there was a Python assignment, a Jupyter notebook, a pen-and-paper assignment, several Pytorch ones, and a short response paper).",
                "The course covers a huge amount of area in NLP, so it is quite difficult to always keep up with lectures as they go so fast.",
                "Strengths: This course covers natural language processing with a lot of great breadth. We covered chapters 2-15, 18, and 20 (and all 3 appendices) of the Jurafsky and Martin textbook, chapters 1-5 and 7 of the Eisenstein textbook, and covered additional topics in the slides. The problem sets were solid; all but one of them involved coding the models we were learning about in class, and they got me much more comfortable with writing neural nets in PyTorch for NLP tasks. The pen-and-paper problem set was also really useful because it got me comfortable with the mathematical side of deep learning. Drago is incredibly knowledgeable about NLP. The teaching staff, although only a few, were really helpful for problem sets both at office hours and over email; grading was very fair for the psets as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were not recorded, which made it tough in the latter half of the semester; Drago tends to fly through topics during lecture because he aims to cover a wide breadth of NLP topics, but since I couldn't always keep up I watched a lot of other videos online and went through the Jurafsky-Martin and Eisenstein textbooks to learn it. The slides can also be somewhat overwhelming; there were about 14 slide decks of 100+ slides, but again, since Drago is covering a wide breadth of topics, it is what it is. You also have to be somewhat self-driven in this class to get the most out of it; there are only five assignments (including a take-home midterm) and the final, so keeping up with the lecture topics is largely in your hands. (The textbooks are great for this.) However, if you're interested in deep learning and NLP and push yourself to keep up with all the material, I think this class does a great job of covering NLP.",
                "The professor and the staff were very nice and helpful, the lectures overall were interesting. One of the biggest weaknesses was that the lectures were posted online even though they were RECORDED. It might have been done to encourage attendance, however, was a big downside. Besides that, we covered too much material every lecture and the slides were very confused and ill-structured on Canvas. So it was very hard to go back to some topics and review the material before exams. Homeworks were also a bit confusing since we barely talked about actual code in class. Additionally, it would be much better to have more office hours, especially before the homework was due. For example, if the home work was due on Monday, the last office hours were on Friday in the afternoon, which means that you pretty much had to be done by Thursday night since there was barely any help during the weekend.",
                "The lectures were clear but the problem sets were sometimes a bit confusing - office hours are good though if you need any help or clarification",
                "Each lecture was very informative and full of content, which was a strength of the course. The psets were also well constructed and helped us learn more about language models and neural networks in depth. One weakness was that sometimes we jumped from one set of lecture slides to the next, and then back, which could be a little confusing at times."
