I studied yes, but I really couldn't find time to \"cherish\" what I was learning because I would fall behind."

                "This course could be improved by having more unanimity across the different sections, through the posting of class slides and example problems on the umbrella canvas site. Otherwise, I strongly liked the use of Ximera for learning the material, and the problem sets, while challenging, well prepared me for the exams. Additionally, the peer tutoring sessions were extremely helpful each week. I attended at least 1-2 sessions each week and felt very well prepared for each exam by doing so, and was able to consistently attain high grades on the problem sets.",
                "Very solid course.",
                "I think that this course does a good job of cementing the material through the Ximera.",
                "Give peer tutors the correct answers for homeworks; I was led to incorrect answers by them several times which ultimately hindered my understanding of class material. Additionally, make homework more relevant to material taught in class and on Ximera.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Good textbook\r\n- clarity of assignments\r\n- great TA hours\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Not really \"student\" friendly? I feel like as a person who asks a lot of questions to full comprehend the class pace was so rapid, I couldn't spend enough time to interrupt when I'm confused\r\n- The PSets are hard. Yes, challenge is necessary but i don't know if 8-10 hours of work (outside of class) is a fair expectation for full time students. Note, this is only Math 112 so I don't think simply shortening the PSets (not lessen the difficulty) will hurt the course, but instead make it more of a class than a part time job."

If you took introductory calculus in high school such as possibly AP Calculus AB, most of the material will be review, but taught in a much more thorough amber than in high school.This class is attainable, but by going to office hours, studying for the exams, and creating through cheat sheets for the exam, good scores are very much attainable.",
