    "The structure of the course is, in my opinion, incredibly well designed to promote student learning.  The questions assigned to be answered before each class demanded careful thought, and were far from just simple reading checks.  By ensuring that all students had engaged thoughtfully with the readings before coming to class, the class discussions we were able to have were at a much deeper level than is typical in a Yale course.  The group we built always felt very collaborative and collegial, and I loved coming to class each day.",
