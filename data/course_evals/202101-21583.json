                "The only way to improve this course is to cancel it forever and never run it again. By far the worst class I've taken at Yale. The readings were fine sometimes, and I've engaged with a lot of them in previous courses, but there was a lot of assumed knowledge and references to things that made things difficult to keep up with sometimes because there are no prerequisites for this class and there was such a wide breadth of stuff going on in this class and it's just overwhelming to deal with not knowing everything about everything and having that stuff come up all the time. Seriously, we had a lesson on speech acts and linguistics (for what reason, I cannot tell you) and I actually took a linguistics class on Pragmatics and I still didn't understand what was going on.",
                "The guest lectures were amazing! The readings were also generally interesting, though some of the readings could be very dense, and the terminology can also be difficult to follow.",
                "I think that Critical Theory is important because people need to be more aware about their society. But does it necessarily need to take on a Marxist/anticapitalist/socialist theme? (This is more an issue with the direction the field itself is heading) Maybe some of the issues that we face in our time like poverty etc are not necessarily the result of capitalism itself but could be the result of a capitalist system being degraded with extra loopholes and features? Once we were just chatting in the zoom room and high insurance premiums were brought up. I think this was a good example of what I am trying to describe. Some things were introduced to the capitalist system later on to make it more oppressive. Acts of corruption, but not inherently capitalist. Real critical analysis of a society could bring in multiple viewpoints. And there are also times we can be more critical of things that are commonly accepted. I keep on hearing about the exalted status of Black Lives Matter. Yes the statement itself is very true. But some believe that the organization is merely another front by the wealthy to 'fleece' African Americans of their money. This would be an interesting take."

                "Yes! This is one of my favorite classes that I've taken here. I'm an art major, and I learned a lot in this class! Steiner is fantastic, the readings are well-chosen and eclectic (topics range from images and surveillance, to archives of Chicano vernacular photography, to the memory of plants, to poetry as a necessity and photography as death, to gift economies). I found myself looking forward to the readings every week, and annotated mine extensively.",
                "Absolutely not, unless you like stringing together meaningless sequences of abstract nouns and esoteric terms and pretending like they have meaning, because then maybe you'll be one of the favorites. Otherwise this class is horrible and a waste of time. If you need to take it for a requirement, take Junior Seminar and not this class. If you're interested in the readings, just do them on your own. It's not worth the effort.",
