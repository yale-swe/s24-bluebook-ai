    "Strength: the key ideas are clear and the course is well structured\r\nWeakness: hope more cases, especially those Corporate Finance flavored, rather than just provide some background knowledge like the financial crisis, could be provided to apply knowledge and skills acquired in class",
    "No weaknesses! Strengths include very detailed powerpoint slides for further study, also great structure of the course, I like how we start off with a quiz.",
    "Concepts could be explained better.",
    "The class and the professor is good, but it is lack of specific explanations because the professor assumes that the students already learned finance before at least once."

    "Yes.",
    "Yes, I will. It is a good review and advanced class of Corporate Finance if you have some background knowledge."
