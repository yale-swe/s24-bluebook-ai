                "This course is designed for students who can speak and understand Hindi, but may not be able to read nor write. This course taught me how to do just that -- I now have a much greater ability to read and write in Hindi while also knowing proper grammar.",
                "I learned about Hindi grammar rules, cultural information, and speaking rules.",
                "I learned how to read and write Hindi within a very short time period!",

                "I will say that by the end of the semester, I do feel like I have a much better grasp on Hindi. My speaking has a LONG way to go. However, I can read and write the script, albeit slowly, which is pretty amazing for one semester.",
                "Reading and writing hindi script",
                "I came in understanding and speaking Hindi. My speaking was not perfect, but I was able to communicate my thoughts across to the person I was speaking with. In this class, I learned how to read and write Hindi. I also learned grammar more formally. Before, it was just instinct, but now I understand why I have to put certain phrases or words in a sentence to make sure objects are connected or verbs are conjugated in the right form. There is also some common slang used in Hindi, that I didn't know wasn't the correct way of actually saying anything.",

                "The culture of the class is really wonderful because we all come from the same background and there's a lot of collaboration. Savitaji is incredibly sweet so I always looked forward to class.\r\n\r\nOne weakness is that I didn't feel my speaking ability improved as much as my writing.\r\n\r\nSometimes the teacher asks questions and the same fluent speakers answer and, if you're not as good, you don't participate as much. \r\n\r\nAnother thing is that, while you're planning on having class only on Tuesday and Thursday, the conversation sections and Friday quizzes make the time commitment more than on paper.",
                "Strengths: Good coverage of Hindi Grammar concepts\r\nWeakness: A little bit strengthening of speaking ability, to ensure I wasn't loosing concepts or correctly applying them through speaking",
                "Strength: Small class so great interaction and conversation. Weakness: There wasn't necessarily a pre-determined structure for each class, nor notes to look at after class if you wanted to review. You could certainly read the textbook, but the seminar style offered more flexibility.",
                "This class was phenomenal! I learned a lot and improved my Hindi writing and speaking skills. The activities, homework, and quizzes keep you engaged and help you learn Hindi. One area for improvement is with the discussion sections and having more conversation based speaking opportunities.",
                "The class taught me how to read and write and also made me more comfortable speaking.",
                "We had a lot of opportunities to practice our oral hindi which helped us become more comfortable with speaking. The teacher explained grammar concepts really well, and class pacing was great. However, the quizzes often covered content not covered in class and were quite challenging in general, especially since we were just learning to read and write.",
                "At first, I really, really struggled in this class, especially in the first quarter. I was spending considerably more time on this class than others, which was a problem. I felt I wasnt learning the language because my speaking wasnt improving, and it seemed everyone came into the class already knowing how to speak Hindi. The quizzes were asking us to write in full sentences that included perfect tense, present and past progressive tense, present and past habitual tense, but we had not learned any tenses. Once we learned our first tense (present habitual) after fall break, I felt a huge improvement. All of a sudden, I could remember more verbs and vocab and started gaining more confidence speaking in class. I think the class would work better if we learned the alphabet, then simple sentences (nouns, adjectives, and the verb to be) and maybe imperatives, then present habitual, and only THEN postpositions, possessives, the oblique case, and other grammatical concepts that add detail. It didnt make much sense to learn ingredients of more complex sentences when we didnt even know how to write in basic tenses. I think the class would also benefit from more instruction on sentence order and tense formation, (there was only a bit of that towards the end), rather than just going through the books exercises. All of that being said, Savita Ji is incredibly kind and understanding! So was Hiba Ji! The class wasnt a gotcha environment, and it was okay and accepted to make mistakes. For that reason, I think it was overall a good environment in which to learn.",
                "Strengths: focuses on literacy skills \r\nWeaknesses: too much book-reading, not enough engaging discussions or assignments. Homework felt tedious and lacked creativity except for final project.",
                "Strengths: In class went around doing the practice questions together, which forced me to practice each new concept that we were learning. The workload of the class was not too high and as long as you are doing what you are supposed to, you can end the class with a good grade. \r\nWeaknesses: While we learned the alphabet, we were forced to learn the spelling of most words by ourselves. The class worked under the assumption that because we could speak, we knew the small differences in spelling, which was not always accurate. Also, we had weekly quizzes at the end of the week to test the skill that we learned in the week. However, more of the students' focus went towards figuring out the other random words in the sentence, than actually testing the one skill that we learned.",
                "I felt as though the beginning of the course could have been organized a bit better since most students were not familiar with the Devanagari script and we were kinda thrown into the deep end. Also, the class environment was a bit stressful at the start since we were put on the spot and asked to do textbook exercises that were beyond our initial abilities. Apart from that, everything went smoothly and I felt like we were given a lot of practice to improve our reading and writing skills, which I really appreciate.",
                "I think there could be more emphasis on developing vocabulary and making sure old grammatical concepts are being practiced rather than moving through them as units. I appreciate how invested Savita Ji is in our learning. I felt very supported throughout the course."

                "Absolutely! If you want to learn Hindi and have a strong background with understanding Hindi (and possibly speaking it well) then this is a good course for you to build upon those skills and learn how to write in Hindi using primmer grammar.",
                "Yes because it is a great way to fulfill the language requirement while connecting with ones cultural roots!",
                "Yes!! The class was very collaborative and facilitated an open environment where everyone could share their perspective and opinions. Although the quizzes were often difficult, the amount you get out of the class is invaluable. Overall, it was a really enjoyable experience which cumulated in us making a hindi magazine which was really fun!!",
                "It was a hard first quarter for me personally (I dont think it was for most of my classmates), but I actually would! Its an L3 that meets twice a week (with an outside quiz). Theres a fair amount of homework, but its for completion. More importantly, if youre like me and understand conversational Hindi but cannot speak or write the language (and remember, I was on the bottom end of that spectrumI really couldnt speak at all while most of my classmates had some speaking ability), you will walk away from even a semester feeling more confident. Its great when I can show that to my parents here and there. Now, the class is not the most organized, and there is not a great deal of active instructionits a lot of going through book exercises. But Savita Ji is wonderfulvery kind and understandingand I did walk away from the class a lot more confident in the language and strongly considering taking the second semester course (even though for me, it is not required).",
                "I would recommend the class to another heritage student who is trying to learn how to read and write Hindi. Overall, it is not too high of a workload or difficult of a class.",
                "Yes, I felt as though initially there may be some struggle since it is quite hard to learn the script as a good pace. I had limited Hindi background (zero reading/writing and very limited vocab/grammar) , so it was a little hard to play catch up (all students came from varied backgrounds). However, by the end I felt very comfortable reading and writing full sentences at a respectable speed. We were given a lot of practice to improve our literary abilities.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Aside from the value of literacy, it gives you a community of other students that are heritage speakers which is very valuable, especially if you're new to Yale."
