                "Learned about some of the writings\/theories of Arendt, Benjamin, Fanon, Hemingway, Luxemburg, Orwell, Auden, and others. Exposure to a wide range of philosophers, novelists, and poets who wrote about WWII, the Spanish Civil War, totalitarianism, and decolonization. Became a better close reader\/writer of political texts; learned a lot about Marxist theory and Hannah Arendt.",
                "I developed my knowledge about important 20th-century political events and patterns. I gained the skills necessary to close read a text and to construct an argument for longer papers.",
                "Learned how to write.",
                "I learned how to write more sophisticated essays that synthesized a variety of ideas.",
                "By taking this course, I believe my writing, discussion, and reading skills all improved. It was a very good introduction to philosophical and political texts, and college-level writing and discussions. It is a very good class for anyone interested in English, philosophy, or politics. I learned a lot about political conflicts in the 20th century, as well as well known political theorists and writers. By centering the course around Hannah Arendt and her own writing, Peter provided a very accessible framework for beginning to understand not only the historical context of the work, but also the authors whose work we were reading.",
                "I learned how to write, and argue, in a less conclusory way  in a more convincing way, a way that allows us at me to anticipate criticism and preempt it.",
                "This course involves extensive reading of 20th century political writings. Through close reading and inspiring in-class discussions, I have greatly deepened my understanding of the different schools of political thoughts of the 20th century, which serves as a great basis for further examination of current political developments.\r\nThe course also involves extensive analytical writing. The instructor also offers detailed comments on each essay I wrote. I can confidently say that my writing is now better because of this course.",
                "This class was a great opportunity to learn about a multitude of political writings with great discussion."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Peter is a fantastic teacher; I sometimes wished it were a lecture course because his comments were so fascinating. Usually interesting readings and very manageable reading load. Great feedback on essays. Very discussion-based, which I enjoyed. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not that many female authors, and decolonization only comes up at the very end. I think that because the class covers both novels and philosophy\/theory, you don't get to delve deeply into any one subject; additionally, we read a lot of the lesser-known works of famous authors (e.g. Benjamin's \"The Storyteller\" instead of The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction). Felt like I could've used more help with the research essay\/learned more about the research process.",
                "The readings for this course were intriguing, supplemented each other well, and all were of a reasonable length. Prof. Conroy is always enthusiastic during in-class discussions and gives timely and detailed feedback on papers. The prompts are flexible enough that you inevitably write about topics that interest you.",
                "The course had many strengths; Peter Conroy is an incredible instructor, class discussions were thought-provoking and usually very engaging, and the readings were well-chosen and typically very interesting as well. The workload is very manageable, with just enough essay-writing to be helpful in developing critical thinking and writing skills. I cannot think of any specific weaknesses.",
                "Great readings, but would love more personal essays.",
                "The course syllabus was inspired by a similar course taught by Hannah Arendt, and includes a wide array of writings, such as novels, essays, memoirs and poems. Their literary as well as historical values cannot be overstated. It is comprehensive. Yet, it is also deep. By every Monday, we need to post questions or thoughts on weekly assigned readings and this helped us organise our thinkings. We also had very engaging and intellectually challenging discussions in class in which every one would share their opinions and insights. I have drawn a lot of inspirations from my classmates' enlightening comments. The instructor held office hours every Thursday and it was a fantastic opportunity to talk about unexplored analyses of both class readings and additional related readings. The writing assignments not only allowed us to use the materials we've read and discussed in our scholarly researches and analyses, but also motivated us to actively write in a clear, coherent, persuasive, and rigorous way. In short, this course is well designed for people who have an interest in politics and want to become better writers."

                "Yes, definitely! I enjoyed most of the readings, loved the in-class discussions, and Peter does a great job of responding to your comments in class\/in your essays so that you feel like you made an insightful point. If you are already interested in reading Arendt\/Fanon\/Hemingway\/Koestler, it's a great class, but be forewarned that you don't get to spend that much time with any one author because it's an overview of so many different conflicts.",
                "Yes. The readings are interesting and relevant to today's politics. This course is fitting for anyone looking to improve their writing.",
                "Yes - for anyone considering an English major.",
                "Yes definitely. While the course is technically a literature seminar, I also learned a lot about history, politics, and law in the early twentieth century.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I found it incredibly intellectually compelling and interesting. Peter is an incredible and very intelligent instructor who is remarkably articulate and patient. The course picked up a few weeks in and from thereon it claimed a spot as one of my favorites of the semester. There is a very manageable workload, with four essays throughout the semester and weekly Canvas posts for discussion. Most of the learning comes from class discussions, which were usually quite engaging and accessible. The readings, although sometimes difficult, I also often found very interesting due to the subject material.",
                "Yes. To anyone interested in writing, or political ideation.",
                "Absolutely. This is one of the best course I've ever had and it completely exceeds my expectations. I have leant a lot from this course and it both satisfied my interests in politics and literature as well as my desire to become better academic writers. I would recommend it to every student who shares similar wishes."
