                "Professor Kim was always very kind and accommodating, and she made learning Korean a very fun experience. She also made the class environment very comfortable, as I never felt insecure about participating or speaking out loud in front of the class.",
                "This class was very engaging, and the mixture of lecture and discussion among peers was very helpful in practicing pronunciation and speaking skills. \r\n\r\nHowever, I would not have minded if we had additional homework outside of class to practice concepts we had just learned. Most workbook assignments would only be due immediately before tests, so it felt like we were cramming in order to review.",
                "In terms of strengths, the class was very well-paced and had many chances to practice speaking in class. We would speak every class and repeat new words, which helped with memorization and pronunciation. We also had a good balance between speaking, reading, and listening activities. In terms of weaknesses, some times tests or assignments weren't announced in class which made it easy to miss them unless constantly checking the canvas page.",
                "A strength of the course was the formatting of the lessons, which progressed from simple grammar to more complex sentences.",
                "It's an extremely fun class because of the teacher and the students. The teacher makes the class very judge-free and really focuses on effort rather than perfection. Students laugh a lot and we learn a lot. Professor Kim makes the information easy to learn and understand, and I'd probably say this is one of the best classes at Yale. When you come to this 9am class, you know you will feel better by the end. It's a great way to start the day! Weakness is probably it's an every day 9am class, so that makes you better at time management.",
                "I absolutely loved this course. I found the workload to be manageable and that I obtained an incredible amount of new knowledge given the fact I only studied Korean for one semester. I genuinely looked forward to going to class because of the instructor's lively, warm presence, as well as the fascinating, well-structured content. I also appreciated the variety in learning and evaluation forms, such as textbook work, in-class repetition and note-taking, PowerPoints, Kahoots, tests, voice recordings, oral presentations, etc."

                "I would definitely recommend! Teacher Kim is awesome and makes the class really enjoyable. She's very understanding too and I loved being in her class and formally learning Korean for the first time. 11/10 recommend.",
                "I definitely recommend taking this course! In just one semester, I was able to write sentences on my own, understand spoken phrases, read and comprehend passages, and conduct basic conversations with others in Korean. Whether you're looking for a language class or want to learn Korean to get closer to your heritage (or for a different reason!), you'll definitely have a great learning experience in KREN 110."
