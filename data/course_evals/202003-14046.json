The best thing about this course is that, because it covers so much material, everyone is able to direct their focus to whichever area of German art was most interesting to them. This was a great combination of art, philosophy, history, and even some science.",

I also learned a lot not only about the German art and aesthetic traditions but also about the German history (literary, political, and economical) that contextualized them.",

                "This class seemed to be the most accessible for those students who already had some background in German, German history, or German artit was a little daunting for someone to just jump into it. Though, if you have a distinct interest in any aspect of German art from 1750-now it is a great course to take to focus on that interest while also learning about how it came to be. I would recommend working with the professor to make sure you get when you want out of the course and don't feel overwhelmed by all of the other material.",

Her passion for the material is infectious; she is a great teacher and discussion facilitator; and her feedback was much more in depth and helpful than I have often received in other seminars.",
