The lectures were often disorganized and required a high level of engagement to be able to understand what was going on. The lecture notes were done well and super helpful. The PSETs were short and covered relevant material.",
                "I found having Professor Zhong's posted on canvas was very helpful.",
                "Mingjiang is an amazing professor, he cares about students learning the material thoroughly over pushing through with what he planned for in the syllabus. He takes into account what is important to know and what is less important from the textbook material and also includes useful knowledge about what to expect in working at an industry setting.",
                "Strengths - lecture notes, recitation sessions, clear explanations from the professor \r\nWeaknesses - we deviated a lot from the syllabus in terms of timing and the final exam had problems of a type that we had never done before, nor were we told to watch out for",
                "Strengths: I felt that lectures were pretty comprehensible, given our background. The course was also educational, but not too strenuous, so I overall really enjoyed it.\r\nWeaknesses: The course was not very well structured. We were supposed to have six problem sets, but were only assigned four (one of which was due a week after the final!). I usually am all in favor of less homework, but we did close to no examples in class, so I felt pretty unprepared to solve problems on the exams. The midterm was pretty fair, but the choices of problems for the final were not representative of what we learned in class. Still, the grading was very generous, so that made up for it.",
                "This class is pretty well taught, but a deviation from the text book would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: Professor tries really hard to make sure everyone is accommodated for. It is also arguably the most applied class to date, which is actually refreshing for the major. Weaknesses: I think the content swings between being very hard and very easy."

                "I know you. You're a chemical engineering major and you're looking at the course reviews as if it makes a difference because you know that either way you have to take this course but you find some solace in knowing that others have suffered through this major and made it out so you can do it too. Let's face it, no one is looking to take this class because they are interested or because it's fun. Although it doesn't matter that much I'll still give you a little summary. The workload week to week is definitely not as bad as other engineering courses. We ended up having only 4 psets (although it's usually 6), but either way there was a recitation session for them which really helped to complete them properly. The exams were also not too bad and the psets were helpful in exam prep. As far as engineering courses go, this one is not too bad as long as you pay VERY close attention to everything that is said in this class.",
                "There are very few problem sets for this course taught by Prof. Zhong which makes it more difficult to be sufficiently prepared for the exams. The course could have used a little more guided preparation for the skills being tested on the exams.",
