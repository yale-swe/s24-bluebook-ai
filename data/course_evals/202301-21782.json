                "Great insight into African texts aimed at challenging at realism - learned a ton and expanded frame of reference",
                "My goal for the course was to really expose myself to a wider range of African literature. I hadn't really read many postcolonial writers from the continent before and this course gave me that and tenfold. I was able to gain insights and knowledge from the minds of writers from Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Nigeria and my home country Zimbabwe. I was able to see what the mindsets of African writers were  post independence from colonial rule and even more so learn what was up for imagination and debate at the time. It was some times jarring and anxiety inducing as an African myself, but it was also inspiring to learn from the past as it is not so distant from the reality African countries are facing today. Stephanie is so lovely and it was even more fulfilling to have the readings we went through grounded in history in some of the classes. I learned so much from all thoughts of my classmates as well.",
                "I learned so much about African literature and the questions of language, power, and narrative. From the get go we grappled with definitions, what does it mean for a text to be considered as realism? To be anti-realism or unrealism or to be outside of such binaries? Reading Gikandi's piece on the triad of romanticisim, realism, and modernism as one of the first texts allowed us to open by working through these questions (even if we weren't able to 100% nail them down). As the course continued another skill quickly emerged as making connections between texts and themes. I became more confident picking up on details shared between and differing from one another in the texts we read. You will become a stronger reader, writer, and if you are like me and did not enter with an extensive knowledge on African literature will leave having read thought provoking texts (I really recommend taking this if you've taken ENGL 128!). Furthermore, Steph's seminar environment makes for fruitful conversations where I could work on seminar participation.",
                "I read a wide variety of novels from 20th century Sub-Saharan Africa. It was my first senior seminar and I learned how to compare themes from different books, and working as a group to create theories of what the author was trying to do."

            "comments": [
                "Amazing all around",
                "STRENGTHS\r\n- Wide range of writers from the continent made us see varying forms of writing in post colonial writing\r\n- The genres were also across a very wide spectrum\r\n- The book club format of the class discussion was good for the most part because every one was so engaged and had amazing insights\r\n- The readings themselves were also so well written, really engaging and thought provoking. I have felt so much from each reading. Sometimes anger. Sometimes inquiry. Sometimes discomfort. Sometimes sadness and l love books that make me feel emotions viscerally. That means the writer really put in the work to challenge the reader or the people of the time to think from their vantage point of world. I was so inspired by all of the books in varying degrees. \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n- I do wish we would reference history a bit more in the readings. I think that is the hard tension with a literature class. You could leave room for imagination and interpretation but I think there is a beauty in understanding the politics and social dynamics of the period. I think there is potential to have 5 - 10 min of the class be led by Stephanie were she centers the class on where we are historically. She sometimes did this but not every class.\r\n- I liked the book club format of the class but sometimes we would go down inconsistent and random rabbit holes. I guess thats the magic of literature - interpreting and not really knowing the end point, but I think there is room to hone in everyone's thoughts when the class is a bit winding in terms of focus.",
                "No weaknesses at all. This was my favorite class I ever took at Yale.",
                "Steph is the best!!! She is the most wonderful, meticulous, brilliant professor. Her passion for the subject matter and ability to facilitate discussions is unparalleled. Our class was full of amazing, kind, and empathetic students who had such insightful things to say. Only weakness: I wish we could have spent more time on each novel just because there is so much to talk about!",
                "The discussions were always incredibly intellectually fulfilling, and so well moderated by Steph.",
                "Strengths: superb syllabus, absolutely incredible professor! Steph is phenomenal and I feel so lucky and grateful to have been in her classroom again. In addition to her extensive knowledge, Steph creates such a special seminar space where tough questions are posed and conversations can deepen and turn. The reading load is rigorous but manageable and the texts are so engaging (though I do recommend making and sticking to a reading schedule if possible). \r\nWeaknesses: I cannot think of any, the seminars go by so fast and I always left wanting to stay for another 2 hours to discuss!",
                "Strengths:\r\n1. The syllabus is wonderful. The books are funny and inspiring. They also span a lot of different contexts from Yoruba folklore to a novel about young drug addicts in Cape Town. I love reading but don't always explore on my own so this course was a great opportunity. I also liked how the focus was on fiction itself but there were some interviews and literary theory to supplement that.\r\n\r\n2. The conversational environment. Everyone did the reading and came to class excited to discuss it. Seminars were always high-level but never pretentious or argumentative. It genuinely felt like we all wanted to engage with each other's ideas and, by the end of every session, I felt like I wanted to write in my journal and reflect.\r\n\r\n3. Professor Newell. Her sense of humor, commitment to students and overall vibe are all impeccable. She really loves teaching and, rather than talking to us from above, always enters the conversation as a peer. She's also very warm and always willing to meet.\r\n\r\n4. Weekly Discussion Posts. It's a lot of work and I grumbled at first but I loved that people actually read other posts and it was motivation to keep reading.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\n1. It's very free flowing. There's no set agenda in terms of what you're supposed to take away. That's great, in a sense, but it also means that Professor Newell won't necessarily push back on ideas and that there's not that strong of a theoretical framework. When one of the authors visited our class, he grilled us on the canonical definitions of realism and modernism and I was a bit embarrassed that no one knew.\r\n\r\n2. Political/historical content without corresponding rigor or context. Some of the conversations inevitably turn to ideas like \"post-colonialism\" and race. I sometimes felt trapped by the setting of a literature class full of English majors because it was hard to really dig into these topics and scrutinize, \"what exactly does post-colonial mean here, what assumptions are we making, what does using this terminology imply, etc.\" I think it's good to tackle political topics but they can't necessarily be discussed with the same subjectivity as literary metaphors.\r\n\r\n3. Cultural atmosphere? This wasn't a huge deal but sometimes comments in class made it seem like some students had an exoticized view of Africa or treat the African content as a single place in a way that felt out of touch. I may have been guilty of this too and don't know what the solution is but I think there should be an emphasis on using terms like \"western\" and \"traditional,\" very carefully. For example, students often described references to British or classical literature as effects of colonialism; this may be true but it sometimes felt like they perceived Africa as somehow separate from the global market of culture and ideas."

You will grapple with a lot of texts and difficult questions but in doing so with Steph and with your seminar you will leave (perhaps not with a definitive answer) but with so many connections made. The seminars go by so quickly and themes emerge that guide the class (often based on discussion posts and what came up for people as they read) which means the class is guided by the students with Steph facilitating.",
                "Yes! This course isn't about close-reading or African history or, contrary to the title, realism. But, if you want to have a stimulating and enjoyable time reading novels you wouldn't otherwise find, then take this class! \r\n\r\nThe discussion and environment of this seminar were exactly what I was looking for; I wish more seminars were like this."
