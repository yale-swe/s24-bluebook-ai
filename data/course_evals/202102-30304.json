                "Policy Analysis, the Eightfold path, an insight into the life of a consultant",
                "I learned a lot about policy analysis and what academic and professional writing for this would look like. I developed abilities relating to research, proper writing, and even standard practices.",
                "I learned about the process behind assembling policy alternatives.",
                "I learned more about the process of designing policies, how to write and deliver them, as well as how to engage with policy-related economic topics.",
                "This class taught me so much in such a short time frame. I wrote my first-ever literature review, criteria alternatives matrix, and annotated bibliography. Before coming to the class I had never heard of the former two. I also further developed my policy writing skills. I will use Bardach's Practical Guide for years to come. I also took advantage of the seminar structure of the class and took the time to speak a lot. I also met many interesting classmates that I hope to continue learning and growing with.",
                "Comprehensive policy research, analysis, and creation process",
                "This class showed me a new way of exploring and communicating ideas. We gained insight on many theories and case studies about policy analysis, implementation, and program design, which we then applied to our work. We practiced valuable skills like writing an annotated bibliography, a literature review, and we worked through the steps of policy design from defining a policy problem to writing our policy report for a client. Research was a key part of the class and we developed effective approaches to researching and communicating information. Over the 5 weeks, we gained an incredible amount of knowledge about our chosen policy area.  Class discussion and collaboration was also an important part of the class experience.",
                "1. I learnt the basic 8 procedures of making a public policy. For each step, I learnt to search for appropriate sources for information. I also tried to evaluate policy by balancing its cost and effect, which is quite interesting and tricky for me since most of the time the cost or effect are not quantifiable. \r\n\r\n2. This course taught me to think critically. Public policy is to some extent balancing the interests of different interest groups, which is the most difficult part of policy making. I have also read lots of articles about the different aspects of policy making, which helped me a lot in my own report. \r\n\r\n3. This course taught me to write an academic report, including literature review, annotated bibliography, and short essays based on They Say I Say.",
                "I learned some really interesting approaches to analyzing policies in many different ways, and what the best policy analyses should look like. A lot of the course also focused on thinking and talking through the approach to policy analysis and policy design, and the philosophies and problem solving that go into it. It really helped me think about policy in a very different way!"

                "Strengths: \r\nProfessor was engaged, informed and very encouraging \r\n\r\nWeakness: \r\nVery high workload, perhaps some of the assignments could have been made more manageable or reduced",
                "Was a very driven class that promoted discussion and learning while building off peers. However, some of the readings were quite difficult to understand, and certain assignments' expectations were not always very clear.",
                "Strengths: Run like a true seminar, Prof. Fotos rarely lectured, so there was a lot of time for discussion. \r\nWeaknesses: Confusions brought up in class were not addressed to a satisfactory degree. Things discussed in class were often difficult to apply to term length projects.",
                "The course assignments were well designed to develop our ability to write policy & word in an academic setting. However, more content could have been covered on the justice and sustainability aspect of the course title.",
                "This course had to elaborate on a myriad of ideas within only about 5 weeks so the weaknesses really came from the condensed time frame. The long meeting times over zoom were really hard to focus during. The readings each night were long and dense and often times I was reading all of the words but not fully comprehending the material. We also had a lot of topics to cover ranging from economic theory to policy analysis and essays. The course was very intensive and I really, really enjoyed it.",
                "Readings were extreme and high level- good info but in such a short class overwhelming",
                "Strengths: Class discussions. The way in which we each had gone deep into our policy area and gained a lot of knowledge through our own research and from listening to our peers talk about their projects in class. The papers on policy theory were very interesting and something I didn't have exposure to before. The two 'practical' texts we used for Policy Analysis and Writing were very useful and have made a difference to my writing outside of this class as well. Prof. Fotos was very supportive and helpful throughout the class, providing constructive feedback and asking us critical questions to help guide our research. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: One thing is that the pre-class readings for me were quite substantial and I didn't manage to complete them every time, so would skim many instead of going deeper into a few. I think it would be better to have fewer mandatory readings which we can focus on, with more additional optional readings. For a summer class, being only 5 weeks, the class did move at a very fast pace so it was hard to keep up at times with the workload, however this is not so much a weakness as a something to keep in mind when taking the class.",
                "Strengths: This course is well equipped me with lots of theory knowledge about policy making and public policy and other philosophical theory which really broadened my horizon. By writing a report of my own, I can not only try to establish and evaluate public policy for the first time, but also relate my own thinking with those philosophical theories, which taught me to be more critical and gave me a completely different world view for politics from my own in China. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the readings are too difficult to understand. And they are unrelated to practical activities in this course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Fotos knows what he is talking about and has a ton of wisdom to impart. The format of the course, where all students choose an independent policy question at the beginning of the course and carry it through the semester, was also really interesting and allowed us to get very acquainted with ours and our classmates' topics. Weaknesses: Several of the assignments felt like busywork, the workload was hefty, and the assigned reading was often quite large."

I would have loved to take this course during the school year and had a full semester to research and learn. However, I am glad that I took the course. Overall, a really interesting and informative class.",

The kinds of assignments you do  like literature reviews and annotated bibliographies feel very helpful and applicable to many fields. Also, it's just so cool how you deep-dive into a specific research area and at the end of class have gained so much insight and expertise into your field of interest!"
