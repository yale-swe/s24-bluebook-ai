                "I learned very broad anatomical terms that we used when discussing movement. I realized during this course that taking a class in the performing arts was not my smartest idea. I think that if I ever wanted to do dance again, I would join a dance group, but I did not enjoy being graded for dance. It felt very subjective.",
                "I developed the ability to connect with my body in a niche way. I'd also like to think my ability to dance was developed by taking this class. Lastly, I gained some anatomical knowledge that will likely stay in my long term memory because of how involved they were in class activities.",

I was forced to credit/D/fail this class as professor never responded to my email asking about how I've been performing in the class (the grading system is very very vague and very likely influenced by her biases).",

                "Strengths: Professor Robinson is super motivated as a teacher; dancing every class - very relaxed\r\nWeaknesses: Grading seemed a bit arbitrary but not a big problem",
                "The in-class component to this course was perfect. Learning new choreography nearly every class was extremely rewarding; the course is strategically designed for everyone to strengthen their skills and showcase to the class by the end.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I'd say was that some of the assignments were a little unclear in what they wanted us to do, exactly. I think moving forward, clear rubrics for essays would be helpful!",
                "Strength of the course is that the workload is very low and that it is nice break in the middle of the day. The weaknesses is that the professor is EXTREMELY unorganized. She rarely responds to emails, sends announcements at the last minute, does not grade or give feedback on assignments so that students can improve. She also mispronounced and mixed up students' names very often.",
                "The strengths of this course were its ability to engage students and its ability to casually teach a few anatomical terms without high stress. The weakness was the general vagueness of the class description in the beginning, as I grew to learn the focus was more on \"motion\" and dance rather than \"anatomy\" and medical terms. Additionally, their was no rubric for this course and the professor's way of grading was arbitrary, making it rather difficult to gauge your success in the class at any point in time.",
                "The class is quite disorganized and assignments were assigned randomly.",
                "Strengths: This class gave such a deep perspective on viewing our bodies and movement. Not only do you become more comfortable in your body, but this class helps you think beyond the basics of movement. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Directions and expectations given on assignments (journals and papers) can be vague. Feedback and grades are not given on a timely manner. Material is repetitive. I felt like the same ideas were being said over and over again in different ways.",
                "I just wished that the professor actually responded to our emails on time AND published our final grades on time (it's the 4th of January and I still don't know my final grades for this course).",
                "It was very different than the typical seminar  for those who have experience in dance and would like to learn about how to critically think about dance, I would recommend.\r\n\r\nHowever, this course sometimes lacks structure; for example, sometimes the directions for assignments are unclear on what is wanted. There is no rubric for essays so you would not know exactly what is wanted and what is being graded on."

                "absolutely not. take any course to get a humanities credit. you do not learn a lot in this class, and the course is just too unorganized for an institution of this caliber.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are looking for something new and different to push them outside of their comfort zone. For me personally, this class was taken to alleviate my STEM course load and branch me out of my interests. So, if that is something the student is also interested in, I would highly recommend this course.",
