He was a guest speaker of ours and he was excellent!!! Had so many great things to say about writing about race, and also just in general he was lovely and very smart about journalism/life.",

That being said, Jane is a force to be reckoned with, and not necessarily in a good way. Sometimes, her playing devils advocate became insensitive and her criticism was flat out insulting. If you want to take this class, be aware that you might have to put up with some uncomfortable (and sometimes extremely ignorant) conversations."
