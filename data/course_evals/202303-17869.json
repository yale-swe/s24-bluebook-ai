                "Topics covered in this class include happiness, altruism, character and virtue, morality and motivation, and the belief in God. Developed close reading skills and analyzing experimental design.",

                "I learned a lot about philosophy, both generally and in the subsection of moral philosophy and psychology. I developed skills in writing both psychology and philosophy-centered papers. I also feel like I have a better grasp of the reasoning that goes on in our fascinating takes on morality.",
                "My main takeaway is learning how to read psychology papers, which I think is a useful skill to have. I feel like psychology papers are very well written and easy to understand, so I also think it helped me improve my writing indirectly. The questions pondered in the course are very relevant, and it was nice to see different perspectives on them. Thinking about philosophical questions through a psychological\/empirical lens was also something new for me, but now it seems like the most natural thing to do is to grow these two disciplines together.",
                "I developed an understanding of philosophy and psychology among a range of different topics. I learned how to read and write philosophy papers.",
                "I developed new perspectives about different questions related to life, happiness, and the existence of God. And I learnt to answer these questions from both a philosophical and scientific angle.",
                "Perspectives on human nature taught me how to think differently about humanity and the world around me. I learned a lot about the different perspectives and theories on belief in God, altruism, virtue, and development of character.",
                "I learned a great deal about the impact of human psychology on various social behaviors. I appreciated how historical philosophical theories on some of the most fundamental questions about human behavior were covered, but these theories were supplemented with more recent psychological studies. In this way, we were able to cross-reference the philosophers' hypotheses with our modern knowledge of human behavior.",
                "I learned a lot about psychology and philosophy and how those areas interact. We got to look at philosophers beliefs on certain topics and then look at psychological research on the same topic.",
                "Learned about many ancient philosophers and corresponding modern psychology studies, learned how to better structure philosophical arguments in papers",
                "This course provided me with a comprehensive overview of how we can take an interdisciplinary, philosophical-psychological approach to certain questions of human nature. I appreciated how certain readings were assigned to challenge other readings. Professor Knobe and the TFs encouraged us to engage with the provided materials to come to our own conclusions.",

Learned how to think about implications of theories and not just understand the theory itself.",
                "I learned about many different perspectives on certain things like altruism, belief in god or morality. This course made me more open-minded when it comes to many views on different things in life",

            "comments": [
                "Somewhat surface level",
                "Strengths: The content, readings, and topics that we end up learning and discussing are super interesting. Weakness: The low amount of resources was a weakness for me. For the midterms, you can't rely on any of the slides to help you study since it only shows 10% of what Professor Knobe discusses in the lectures. There was also no study guide or any clear indication of the topics that would have been given on the exam. Your notes could be helpful but that is the only thing you could rely on. The other issue is that the readings were not really discusses in lectures so you have to rely on your own understanding of the readings to help you on the exam (I and some of my other classmates struggled with this part because there are multiple ways of interpreting the philosophy papers).  There was also no feedback given or discussion had for the first midterm so there was nothing really to learn from for the purposes of the final. The other weakness would be the unclear feedback for writing the papers. The TA provided very interesting discussions and questions for discussion sections but not the most helpful when it came to writing the papers. There was simply a 15 minute meeting where you give an outline of what you will write about and very unclear feedback from the TA during that session. And it didn't help that the second paper and the final were really close to each other.",
                "Class was good, just very challenging as someone who has never taken an academic philosophy course before. I might have preferred writing 3 shorter papers instead of 2 7-9 pagers... I found it to be rather a struggle to stretch my thoughts to cover that much ground.",
                "Strengths: Professor Knobe did an excellent job of clearly explaining complex and often abstract philosophical and psychological material in lectures. The topics covered and the readings were always fascinating and well-connected between philosophical and psychological approaches to each question. Weakness: The shorter class time and heavy overlap\/review between classes made it feel like we got less out of each reading\/topic than was possible. Discussion sections also could have been organized better to promote discussion and generation of new ideas.",
                "Strengths: Content was interesting for the most part\r\nWeaknesses: Far too much work for a class like this (Why are there 2 tests and 2 papers?)",
                "Strengths: interesting content\r\nWeaknesses: both exams and papers -- would be helpful to stick to one or the other so students know what to expect",
                "weakness -- no need for second paper on the exact same thing",
                "Strengths: The content is fascinating. The lectures are engaging and aimed at breaking down some dense readings. The professor is fun and upbeat! \r\nWeaknesses: The grade of your class is concentrated entirely on two tests and two papers, and you don't even submit a paper until after midterm. It puts a lot of the heavy lifting on this course in the latter half, which feels high stress.",
                "This course just \"feels\" like a well established intro course. In my case, I took it in my first semester, after having done IB philosophy, and it felt like a good continuation to the content I already knew. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I enjoyed the pscyhological arguments and models that supplemented and sometimes structured the philosophical questions (as I had not previously had exposure to this discipline), and I think this interdisciplinary perspectives is one of the big merits of this course.\r\n\r\nI must say that, since the midterm is quite late (a month later than most) and so is the first paper, you will spend a lot of time without knowing how well you are doing in the course, which is kind of unsettling if this course is somewhat out of your comfort zone.",
                "Strengths: readings were great, TF were great, lecture helped to support this learning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think there could have been more support in helping students who have never taken a philosophy course before.",
                "I think the weaknesses of this course were that sometimes the microphone did not work and Professor Knobe has a quiet voice so sometimes it was hard to hear him and his lectures were not recorded and there was very little text on his slides so if you missed a point or wanted to remind yourself of what a lecture was about it was hard to do that. The strengths are that Professor Knobe is really interested in what he is teaching so it makes it more interesting to listen to him",
                "First midterm was difficult because I didnt realize that it would ask so many detailed questions about terms that were mentioned briefly during lectures. Because lectures were not recorded and powerpoints were mostly pictures, we needed to pay close attention and take good notes to be prepared for exam. I think our smaller discussion sections and office hours were helpful.",
                "Strengths: Incredibly well-organized from the syllabus to the lecture slides. I especially enjoyed how lectures were set up. You really won't get as much from skimming slides as you will from attending lecture, because Professor Knobe takes the time to clearly explain each concept. He is brilliant and makes the course material fascinating. I also loved how he would encourage lecture participation -- when we all got to participate in in-class versions of the studies, the material felt much more personal and engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: My only complaint is the timing of the assignments. The course has 2 papers, a midterm, and a final; however, the first assignment (paper #1) was due at the end of October. This meant the rest of the material was squashed into a month and a half. The midterm covered 4\/5 units and the final was cumulative, with the 5th unit being the only new material. I honestly think it would've been easier to master the material if the first paper had been due early on (late Sept\/early Oct) and the midterm had occurred right before or after fall break.",
                "The course overall was good, but I don't understand why a solid half\/third of the course focused on belief in God (i.e. a monotheistic Western God at that) rather than talking about other aspects of the class. I feel like the course started off phenomenally. We learned about happiness, virtues, etc. in 1-2 week units that taught a lot about human nature. But the latter half\/third of the class was focused only on religion. This might be great for people especially interested in religion, but I feel like it takes away from the overall theme of the class which is supposed to speak about human nature.\r\n\r\nOther than that, the course was taught well, and pretty engaging.",
                "All the material is very accessible and presented in an engaging way. Loved Knobe. No complaints.",
                "Lectures were fun to listen to and sections were well run. Course schedule was easy to follow. Main weakness was that lecture slides weren't super useful. I know this is the case by design but even if you did attend the lecture and take good notes the slides themselves were not very useful. I also think in general people like to attend class anyways so having limited info on slides probably doesn't serve as much of an incentive to attend class as was intended.",
                "I don't think I am qualified enough to answer this, but from my current perspective, I believe that everything was on a very professional level",
                "Strength: \r\n- The topics we examine and discuss are quite interesting\r\n- The reading material is well-selected and engaging\r\n- Professor Knobe is quite a good lecturer\r\n- Discussing these topics with fellow students often produce new insights\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Limited feedback and guidance from papers\r\n- Relatively fast and less than in-depth (because this is more like a survey course anyway)\r\nImprovement:\r\n- More emphasis on feedback for papers\r\n- More focused discussions",
                "strengths: engaging lectures, fairly short readings, pretty low workload, interesting content\r\n\r\nweaknesses: your grade was super dependent on your TF. it seemed like some TFs graded harder than others...I know that it might not be possible for prof knobe to grade all the papers and exams but if there was a way that the grading could be standardized that would improve the class",
                "I like the structure of the course a lot from the lectures, readings, and discussion sections. The exams can be challenging and somewhat unclear what they're grading.",
                "engaging lectures and interesting sections, great content, good pace. could be better at providing simple resources for students who are new to philosophy, altho the content was not that difficult. did not receive much feedback on essays or exams at all, think those need to be requested first.",
                "Strengths: LOVE the discussion sections. The papers are also fun to write because of the depth of creative freedom and the paper selections are interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: Luckily I never needed to miss a class, but if I did, or if I wasn't present during a lecture, it is very hard to make up due to the lack of recordings and substantial info on the slides.",
                "strengths - interesting content, my TA was great \r\nweakness- the way the class was structured made it difficult to stay engaged, no need for both papers and exams, professor's slides are not that helpful  and classes aren't recorded",
                "Class was interesting, but I think better readings couldve been chosen. Particularly about religiosity and belief in God, many of the arguments presented were underdeveloped and unconvincing (on both sides). For example, Aquinas Proofs for God wouldve been interesting to read and discuss. Otherwise not bad."

                "I would recommend this course to another student.",
                "Yes!! Wonderful course, and Professor Knobe is an excellent professor with wonderful, engaging lectures.",

                "yes good intro course to philosophy! great to take if cogsci major",
                "I would, on the caveat to be prepared to experience uncomfortable growth. At times, I felt like my head was spinning in this intro philosophy course because some students have quite a bit of knowledge coming in. Yes, it is an introductory course, but also, I had trouble understanding parts of it. There are resources to help you, of course, but sometimes, it took a lot of outside-of-class learning to understand what was going on.",
                "If you haven't done much philosophy or psychology, I think it is a great course to start thinking about some of the big questions in these disciplines. Have you heard of the dual process theory of cognition? Do you know why Spinoza thinks God exists, and how it is different to Descartes' arguments? If your answer to these questions is no, then the level of the course won't disappoint you. They grade quite fairly (I expected to do way worse on the first paper than I did), and the workload is overall very low (although close to the midterm and finals it can be stressful). Please do go to the lectures, Knobe is great at explaining (honestly, you don't really need to have done the readings at all to follow everything he is explaining). This course gave me exposure to pscyhology papers, and I am very thankful for that.",
                "Yes I would but I would say to maybe take a different type of introduction course before this as your first. I found it somewhat difficult to write the papers\/take the tests but overall it was very interesting.",
                "Yes I would. This is a very interesting course that mixes two different fields together in an exciting way.",
                "Yes, although I would warn that this class is only enjoyable if you have a genuine interest in the content.",
                "I would if they like philosophy but if that is not your thing then don't take this course",
                "Yes! Its very interesting and the workload is not too bad. But you need to attend all lectures, take good notes, and study a lot for the exams. Essay grading depends on TF. Definitely not a gut class thoughfirst midterm was hard because I didnt know how to study for it, but the final was better.",
                "Absolutely, especially if you're interested in topics in human nature (e.g., belief in God, altruism, happiness) and have little background in philosophy or psychology. I found the material to be quite accessible.",
                "Absolutely. It's a great first philosophy class or perfect for anyone interested in human nature. Loved the interdisciplinary aspect.",
                "Yes - really good intro to reading philosophical literature and the topics are very applicable to daily life.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone who is curious about the broad topics covered in this course but doesn't want to go too deeply and heavily in. This is quite a good and interesting survey course with a good instructor and nice discussions, but it isn't as in-depth as some higher-level courses. Nonetheless, it is a great introductory philosophy course!",

                "yes! this is one of my favorite classes at yale. I feel like the course material was super interesting, the discussions in section were also super interesting. pretty low workload. it's definitely not a gut though -- you'll have to work hard to do well in this class and the papers can be hard to write.",
                "yes, especially for an introductory philosophy course",
                "Yes. It teaches you to think critically about many of the things we have half-baked opinions about that we've never really examined. I have had many conversations and thoughts bouncing off the papers and lectures discussed in this course. Also gives a good overview of philosophical and pyschological perspectives on large-scale topics.",
