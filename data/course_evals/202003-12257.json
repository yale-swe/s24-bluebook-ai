The exposure to French literature definitely broadened my understanding of the language as well as French history and culture.",

                "In all of my classes at Yale, we begin by introducing ourselves and our pronouns. It seems the French department doesn't do that. And as a nonbinary student, I would have appreciated the vocabulary to identify myself and others using the appropriate pronouns. But the FREN 130 curriculum only teaches il and elle. I felt uncomfortable on the (luckily) few occasions that I was referred to by masculine pronouns, and think that the onus shouldn't have been on me (or anyone of non-normative gender identity\/expression) to ask for pronoun intros. It should just be the standard. Once that's accomplished, it'd be cool if there were a unit about the movement for gender inclusive French (and, more broadly, the rigidity of French language, its connection to national identity\/values, the absurd bureaucracy of the Acadmie Franaise), but this brings me to my next point: the rigidity of instruction (or the way that the course packet structured pretty much everything, including whether or not there's a brief lesson on French language\/culture). Does the CP ever change? And what if the audio programs don't support your learning style? As a visual learner, I sometimes found it difficult to follow the recordings, and would have appreciated to just see the rules on the page. Also, there seemed to be an excessive number of practice sentences in the CP that involved some variation of \"Il a tu un Arabe.\" What's up with that? I get that it's a central element of L'etranger's plot, but it appeared *that* many times that it began to feel weird and racialized on the Department's end.",
                "There is a lot of daily homework but it helps practice and not really need to study when we have evaluations.",
                "Strengths include a very open and welcoming class environment as well as a curriculum that taught things in many different ways. The weakness of this course was that the homework programs occasionally felt like busy work and confusing instead of teaching the content. It was annoying not to be able to skip forward or backward in the audio files, so things could take much longer than they needed to. Much of the confusion could be cleared up if we were given note sheets or something akin to what we received in the end-of-unit review packets while we were learning the content instead of at the end.",

                "n\/a",
                "One weakness was that at times there wasn't always ready answers for the grammar practice with did with the audio and the course-packet. This made it hard to know if one was answering the questions correctly. However, the course's strength was the books and movies chosen for viewing and reading as well as the prolonged discussions we had about the materials in class. Although it is difficult to conduct a language class online, I would have enjoyed doing more of a variety of activities in class rather than mostly grammar discussions. More activities would have been enjoyable along with the discussions on the material.",
                "It was great meeting daily and having a clear structure to things. I also liked that there was a variety of different learning modes. The homework load was difficult to manage at times, but the homework helped greatly with unit test preparation."

But, on the whole, this was insufficient to combat Zoom\/computer fatigue. As it is, it's draining to have all your classes via Zoomparticularly if one of your classes meets every single morning.

The daily Zoom classes worked well, the online resources were easy to navigate, and all of the asynchronous activities went smoothly.
