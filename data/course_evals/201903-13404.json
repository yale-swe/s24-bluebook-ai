    "My writing definitely improved, specifically making structured arguments with clear logical warrants and steps.",
    "I developed the skills needed to write well in college through work on developing compelling claims and using evidence and analysis to support arguments.",
    "learned to write better",
    "Developed a much stronger understanding of how to structure longer essays.",
    "I've definitely gained a better understanding of how to structure and write academic essays from this course. My writing has also improved from the course.",
    "I revisited and took a deeper look into my writing style and tendencies, and what areas I need to really focus in on to improve my writing's flow and comprehensiveness. It'll help me going forward to be very self-aware when writing and editing.",
    "None this class lacked clear progress and opportunity to lear and develop the writing skills for an introductory course.",
    "My writing skills have definitely improved as a result of taking this course. Taking an writing course in seminar style, wherein I had the chance to communicate with my professor often about my writing was very helpful. I've never really been a fan of English, but the subject of this ENGL114 section and the professor have changed my feelings towards the subject. I left this class with a greater appreciation for writing and literature."

   "comments": [
    "The course was well structured. I think sometimes the readings were a little overwhelming, mostly in times when we were also working on writing essays or doing lots of reading on our own for our research papers.  But other than that the readings were good. Having time in class to do peer feedback was also very helpful.",
    "A strength is that there were so many opportunities for feedback from in class writing workshops and from the professor. Also our instructor was really open to student ideas and interpretations of the texts we read which made it easy to engage in class. The only weakness in my opinion is that the readings half-way through the course started getting repetitive and weren't very diverse which got better during the research paper unit.",
    "By giving in more drafts to get feedback on.",
    "This was a really strong course and I really enjoyed everything overall. I think the class demanded a lot of students and I do wish that sometimes the workload was lessened, but it was a good class overall.",
    "+ great topic\r\n+ great tutor \r\n- readings could be slightly more focused",
    "I think the seminar style is great and the discussions are super helpful. The small partner discussions could be capitalized on even more, as well as the classmate-led presentations and discussions. Really good overall.",
    "Strengths are that you get to write different types of essays that you will encounter. Weakness, were the readings, she of them were longer than they needed to be especially because the class discussions rarely even covered half of the entire reading. Another weakness is the lack of examples of what was expected from the students there for the grading and revising were poor in being clear and smooth for students which was evident in that major essays due date kept being pushed back due to lack of understanding.",
    "I honestly thought this class was perfectly designed for the growth of students. The small seminar format is perfect for discussion and one-on-ones with the professor. The progression of the workload was also fair, not overwhelming but just challenging enough to allow us to grow and improve. The readings were long at times but understandably so, and I enjoyed doing them most of the time because of my interest in the topic. I was very content with the readings the professor picked out for the course. I particularly enjoyed the research paper, as it gave me the opportunity to learn more about something I've always personally been interested it."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, we got to read a wide variety of political, economic and social articles. The subject matter was very interesting and had a lot of room to focus on our individual interests within it. And all the while, my writing improved a lot.",
    "Yes! I had a lot of fun exploring ideas of freedom and choice through different perspectives philosophical, social, political, economical, international, etc.",
    "Yes, as I enjoyed the readings and found the assignments broad so as to be able to write about subjects that interested me.",
    "Yes, but I would also advise them that it is a demanding course and requires a lot of time.",
    "Yes definitely take this if you are planning to do future courses that require essay writing",
    "Not only did I enjoy the course timeline and structure, but the topic was super interesting. The literature we reviewed and the topics we covered were super relevant and thought-provoking. I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "I would recommend English 114 but not this specific one it doesn't do enough on Freedom and Choice and not enough practice in writing skills either.",
    "Yes! This is one of the only classes in English that I have truly enjoyed. It was engaging and conducive to student growth and learning."
