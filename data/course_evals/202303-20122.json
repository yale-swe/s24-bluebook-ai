                "Absolutely! Professor Kim is a wonderful instructor who leads intriguing discussions that challenge your approach and mentality to art.",

                "Yes, most definitely. Regardless of previous art experience I think it is a great insight into art, the world, the people around you as well as yourself. You'd be amazed the progress you make from week to week let alone throughout the entirety of the semester and it's a good exercise in fully committing to doing something outside of your comfort zone.",
                "Yes 100%! Justin is amazing. He has gotten every aspect of this course down to a science. The assignments (both group and individualized) were carefully crafted to develop a particular skill. We met weekly for individual feedback, which is soooo much better than most of my crappy STEM courses. Our in-class work and critiques were a lovely way to spend my Tuesday nights, and the other students helped to make it a warm, relaxing environment, even though we were all laser-focused and striving to improve. Justin's emphasis on observation and process, rather than particular techniques, could be frustrating if you are an experienced artist. (But if that's you -- you probably shouldn't be looking at this anyway!) I felt that Justin made such a strong effort to understand each of us as a person, and pushed us to engage with ourselves and the things we drew in a way that I want to take into the other aspects of my life. Take this course if you can!!",
                "Definitely! This course will meet you where you are at as an artist, and help me improve greatly, particularly in my way of thinking and approach. The main medium we used was charcoal, which I hadn't had much experience with partly because it seemed daunting, but I can now say that I feel confident in my approach and abilities when given charcoal, a blank paper, and a drawing prompt.",
                "yes! one of my favorite classes at yale and encouraged me to take more art classes",
                "Yes, you learn a lot about how to draw and how to interpret drawings"
