Subjects ranged from religious parties to religion and its relationship with democratization and welfare policy. In addition, for my term paper, I learned how to conduct data-driven research, and present it coherently in writing.",

                "I felt as if this was a great course. I really admired how Professor Baldwin was able to navigate a smooth transition to a virtual learning experience. Her students were kept well-engaged, as well, in having to lead discussion and in completing reading responses. There were many strengths of the course... one weakness, however, was that I felt as if some of the readings were too long or there were too many assigned-- such so that I couldn't dedicate the time required to get the most out of them.",
                "I think the course worked well in the seminar format but sometimes the tutorials were challenging because of all the simultaneous feedback to keep track of.",
                "I think a few of the readings were a bit dense at times, but overall this was a great course. Class discussions were interesting and one-on-one breakout rooms with our peers throughout the semester were really helpful in creating a sense of community. The tutorial format was also very helpful for better understanding the research process and engaging with our peers in collaborative work\/discussions.",
                "Professor Baldwin, for one, is a definite strength. She is incredibly smart, thoughtful, and approachable during class and in office hours. Professor Baldwin was a particularly helpful for my term paper, as I had never completed a true data-driven research paper. The term paper was super flexible and I liked the data requirement. Class discussions were great too, especially during tutorials. I'm not sure if Professor Baldwin intends to continue tutorials after the coronavirus, but I really liked them, as they allowed students to get direct feedback on their work, and also grow closer with classmates. No weaknesses.",
                "The material is engaging. Having to lead discussion some weeks and having to write a paper on others means that you end up understanding a lot of the material covered since you study much of it in detail. It also means that it can be a lot of work since you will likely have something due every week.  Professor Baldwin is very understanding and encouraging though, and she recognizes the work that you put into the class.  The class could benefit from more modern examples\/research.",
                "Professor Baldwin is genuinely the most thoughtful professor that I have ever had -- this course genuinely did not have weaknesses because she worked so hard to keep us engaged, to be fair, and to keep things interesting.",
                "Strengths: great instructor and facilitation; good overview of diverse political and religious environments, with emphasis on Christianity and Islam; good mix of technical and accessible readings\r\n\r\nCould be improved by including more in-country readings or analysis from within religious traditions."
