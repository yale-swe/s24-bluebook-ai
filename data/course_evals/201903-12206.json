   "comments": [
    "Content: I learned an extensive amount about prenatal multivitamins and other key challenges in public health engagements. I learned how to build models, read complicated papers, interview experts, and craft recommendations.\r\nFormat: I also learned extensively about public health consulting. This is effectively a full consulting case with a real client and goal. These are invaluable skills to learn, regardless of career paths. \r\nTeam: By working with a team of ten students, I was forced to learn how to work on a large team. These skills are essential for any job after graduation. We also learned how to make sure that our client and supervisor remained pleased with our work, which is also applicable to many professions.\r\nProfessional skills: I learned how to draft nice-looking and informative slides (fun fact: not an easy task) and how to contribute to long-form group reports. Like in an internship, I gained experience working with a supervisor to reach a specific outcome.",
    "We learned more about how the public health space works, developed a deep understanding of the prenatal health of women in developing countries, and refined our skills as consultants (oratory presentation skills, presentation making, problem solving, etc).",
    "I have never worked harder in my life. That being said, I have never learned so much in such a short period of time. Although I did learn about the complex world of prenatal vitamins, this course ultimately taught me how to be a better version of myself. I was pushed to my limit, but through this experience I grew more than I could have ever imagined.",
    "Various skills relating to communication, organizing ideas, researching, making slide decks, and giving presentations. On a deeper level, I learned to let hypotheses drive research and organization forward.",
    "learned useful project management skills, and the ability to work on a project with a fast paced schedule on a subject you know nothing about. Very pre-professional",
    "Improved my ability to work with a client, figure out what needs they have and find answers to those questions. Improved my ability to present information. Great experience working in a team"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: I learned so much. I cannot stress this enough. I feel much more prepared to enter the real world, and this is what a senior capstone should attempt to accomplish. Moreover, Shan is a wonderful instructor who cares about her students improvement and the clients satisfaction. Moreover, the project is incredibly meaningful and has a quantifiable impact on the lives of women across the developing world.\r\nWeakness: This course takes intensity to a new level. In workload, it felt like 2 or 3 credits. I think I would have enjoyed the project more if it had been less onerous. While I appreciate the importance of the work and the value of timely delivery for the client, there were several weeks where the workload became unfeasible.",
    "This course was a great opportunity to apply the skills we had learned in our major to a real life problem -- the goal of the capstone project. Professor Shan was a strength to the course as she was highly motivated and dedicated to the success of our team. The structure also worked quite well, between our client presentations, visit to the CPC factory, and final presentation to Jackson.\r\n\r\nA weakness might have been the flux of work of the project which probably started off a little too intensely at the beginning of the semester, which led to disagreements internally over the direction and scope of the project. However, we discussed this as a class with the professor and improvements were made to the workflow.",
    "Professor Shan Soe-Lin approaches this project through a consulting mindset. Although this comes with many benefits, it also does mean that there is an expectation to constantly produce output and be available to work. I would probably love this regiment if I were not also a full time student with other classes and responsibilities. I obviously believe that everything that was produced was relevant and important, but maybe less outputs in future years may reduce some of the time students have to spend on the capstone without sacrificing quality.",
    "Amazing opportunity and incredibly rewarding project. Another major strength is the emphasis on acquiring and developing skills that are so applicable in any future career. Its intensity was both a strength and weakness: we were all extremely engaged and got a lot out of it, but at times it was not quite manageable and led to some burn out. Perhaps one main focus\/deliverable instead of multiple would be more sustainable.",
    "Very useful knowledge\r\nToo much work at time and not evenly spaced. This class forced multiple people to drop other classes they were taking, so be prepared",
    "Very rewarding but very demanding.",
    "Shan was a great professor and team leader. Hardest part of the capstone was ramping up in the first month and meeting the high expectations with little training beforehand."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but be prepared to work. Out of all the capstones, we worked the most but we had the most impact. Knowing what I know now, I still would choose this capstone. I can graduate knowing that I have helped a humanitarian foundation increase its scope and double its reach of pregnant women across the developing world. From conversations with other Global Affairs majors, it is evident that not everyone feels similarly in their projects. This capstone requires a high workload, but it also has high payoffs.",
    "This is a very unique course given that it is a global affairs capstone, but a similar project-based course is probably a good experience for anyone to have before joining the work force, so yes - would recommend.",
    "Take this course, but be prepared to work more than you could ever imagine. Also be prepared, however, to produce content that truly matters. This isnt some fluffy class whose outcome will be a small addition to some random coffee table at a government office. What you produce with Professor Shan Soe-Lins class will be tangible, memorable and will have a great impact to your client and beyond. This class isnt for faint of heart. You will find yourself mid semester questioning why you didnt pick an easier capstone with a more absent minded professor. At the end, however, no other capstone will come close to creating useful output and ultimately helping you improve as a student.",
    "Absolutely recommend; it is by far the most rewarding and interesting capstone. It is such a unique opportunity for personal growth, but also to potentially make a concrete impact through the global health work that is done. I would recommend only doing 3 other classes or just easier classes alongside this capstone, however, because it is very intense and more can be gotten out of it the less overwhelmed you are.",
    "Yes, but know what you're getting yourself into. Shan is great, but demands a lot.",
    "If youre ready to put in a lot of consistent work but then come out feeling really proud of yourself then yes, definitely!!!",
    "I absolutely would recommend it, and especially with Shan. We were able to do original work to influence directly an organization that saves lives. I believe because of our project, more people will have access to essential health commodities and children's lives will be improved. This is the most important thing I've done in college and has been a highlight for me."
