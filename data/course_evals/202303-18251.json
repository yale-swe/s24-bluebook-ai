Learned how to solve ODEs that have constant coefficients, 1st order linear ODEs, exact and separable ODEs; solving nonhomogeneous ODEs via the Method of Undetermined Coefficients and Variation of Parameters; Euler equations and solving ODEs as power series via the Method of Frobenius. Also went into engineering topics: Fourier Series, Unit Step Functions and Impulse Functions, Heat Conduction and The Wave Equation.",

            "comments": [
                "The course was taught very well. It was very organized and I loved how detailed the lecture notes were. I think that maybe the course material could be redistributed throughout the semester; Exam 4 was much more dense than the previous three, so maybe the beginning of the semester could move a bit faster.",
                "amazing. very well structured. no improvements.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Notes were insanely detailed and well-put together\r\n-Professor (Dr. Bennett) was amazing\r\n- Psets helped you understand the material/ learn\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Towards the end, some of the notes examples could've been a little more helpful/ detailed/ there could've been more of them.  However, overall, this was an amazing course and I have minimal complaints",
                "It is a tough course and it starts out well taught and then unravels towards the end.",
                "I found that this course was very well-taught and there were ample materials provided to help students succeed. My one gripe is that there were exam review sessions during class before each exam that took up the time that would have been devoted to the lecture, which we then had to make up by watching a video. I would rather have that lecture during its designated time and forgo the exam review session or move it to office hours. Lecture videos are long and demanding to find a time to complete on one's own, and I found I never learned material as well from the video as I did in class.",
                "Beth Anne Bennett, herself, is the strength of the course. Never have I met a more organized, dedicated, and effective instructor. Beth's lecture notes are amazing and she uses resources outside of class effectively to answer student questions (EdDiscussion, office hours). Inside of lecture, she covers much ground at a very reasonable pace with effective practice problems. One can do very well in this course by attending lecture alone and reading Beth's lecture notes without the need for outside aids such as the textbook. Beth is extremely organized. While much information has been published on it, I think the grading in the course (letter grades) can be a bit ambiguous. I also think that the course could be made more collaborative within its core framework which would be helpful to students who may not have had as much background in the topic. I think that the use of pre-recorded lectures may have been an inconvenience to some students, but in my opinion, is well worth the cost of having an exam Q&A session. I only wish that more students used EdDiscussion as a platform for asking questions. On the TA's part, I think that more could have been done to help students who are struggling and I rarely saw the TAs actively instructing in drop-in sessions or office hours, other than Guillaume. I think undergrads could be used more effectively in the instruction of this course.\r\n\r\nAs far as the course itself, we covered a lot of ground over the semester but each topic seemed very separated from the previous one. We frequently said we would move on to the next section, but treating each of these topics as separate might prove challenging at the end when it comes time to put it all together, but that might just be the nature of differential equations. For example, we covered 3 chapters for exam 1, but after that exam, barely used the concepts in that topic again.",
                "This is the first Yale course that I've taken that is worth the sticker price from a teaching quality perspective. The class is very regular in the sense that everything is well-timed. The exams are clear and the prep directly relates to what will be on the exam. I really don't have anything negative to say.",
                "Strengths: A lot of office hours, helpful and interesting psets that were good study material for the exams",
                "Strengths: The professor is amazing, there are so many resources available outside of the lectures which are all extremely helpful. Ample office hours for problem sets and exam prep. Extra help available to students who need it. It was obvious that Professor Bennett wanted all of her students to succeed,\r\n\r\n No weaknesses",
                "Strengths: Very thorough and thought our course. Everything was intentional and structured.\r\nWeaknesses: Grading on exams was heavily affected by algebra errors. Even though this is a differential equations class, most of the points taken off the tests were because of careless errors in algebra that are not reflective of the understanding of the course material. When there is time pressure in the exam, careless errors are bound to happen, and at times it felt like I was being tested on how good a calculator I was rather than the depth to which I understood the material.",
                "Strengths: This course was taught very very well, with all topics thoroughly covered by lectures and PSets. I never felt lost or hopeless in this course, despite the fact that the material covered was difficult. The assessment schedule seemed fair as it actually valued the PSets for a decent part of the grade and there were four exams in total (inclusive of the final), which although individually stressful, gave the much-needed room for error often absent from Yale courses. \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the PSets felt needlessly long, and many questions boiled down to boring integrations or otherwise routine labour with no accompanying intellectual challenge. \r\nImprovements: Cover less material. Removing some of the end-of-semester topics, like systems of equations and the Euler equation may free up time elsewhere, allowing for a more thorough understanding of the course.",
                "Strengths: Beth Bennett. She explains clearly and thoroughly. There is rarely ever any confusion about how we are moving from one step to the next. There are four exams in total, which takes the pressure off any one. \r\nWeaknesses: The material is kind of dull and some weeks the PSets are excruciatingly long. \r\nImprovements: It would be great if some of the PSets could be shortened, especially the one with PDEs.",
                "Strengths: very well-organized lecture notes, exam review videos!!!, adaptable for when students are having a rough week, we can get the work done asynchronously. I enjoyed how the content lined up almost perfectly at the beginning of the semester with PHYS 410 content.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: perhaps too much of an emphasis on finding series solutions, but I am a physics major so perhaps it's more useful on the engineering side.",
                "This course, with Prof. Bennett, is absolutely excellent. It is absolutely directed towards student learning, and the course went at the right pace, as well as with a good amount of examples to support comprehension.",
                "A strength would be that Beth has the class very meticulously planned out. She knows exactly what needs to be accomplished by what date and that makes the class a lot easier to study for. In terms of weaknesses, the psets are extremely long and the due dates change from weak to weak, making planning your schedule difficult. They can definitely shortened to accommodate the rest of our grueling workloads.",
                "This is probably THE most organized course you will ever take in your life (thanks to Prof. Bennett).",
                "Strengths: It does give you many chances to practice and apply methods with differential equations. Lots of support and office hours (if with Prof. Bennet). Weaknesses: Exams can be a rough time, even with intensive studying.",
                "This was one of the most well organized courses I have ever taken at Yale. The lecture notes were absolutely phenomenal, and Professor Bennett's teaching style was one of the clearest I have ever had the fortune of studying under. The problem sets were not too difficult, albeit slightly time consuming, and all of the exams were exceptionally fair even if sometimes they posed a bit of a time crunch. Frankly, I see no weaknesses with the course: it was practically perfect.",
                "Strengths: Prof Beth Anne is amazing. Her lectures (and lecture notes) are thorough, clear, and organized. Her psets are clear, organized, and relevant. Her exams are difficult but good. You know a good teacher when they are able to make you think that what they're teaching isn't actually that hard and is pretty intuitive (and we're talking about differential equations here).\r\nWeaknesses: The exams got increasingly difficult (but maybe that's just my own weakness)",
                "Professor Bennetts's passion for the material and the easy-to-understand lectures made for a great course. \r\nIt was very well organized and the notes covered all of the content we went over in lectures.\r\nBoth lectures and problem-set solutions provided thorough explanations of every question on the problem sets\r\nThere was immense help from the TAs throughout the semester with office hours before every exam, and review sessions in class.\r\nThe exams were also fair and well-spaced throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nIf there was anything I would add, it would be a more in-depth explanation of the purpose of the PDEs/ Wave and Heat equations.",
                "Strengths: Beth is a very good prof.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Too much material. The exams are EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. Long assignments. Office hours are SO far from main campus, especially when they are at night.",
                "The biggest strengths of the course are the professor (Beth Anne Bennett) and the structure. The class has a strong structure and is very clear, which was very helpful in completing psets and studying for exams. It always seemed very fair.",
                "This course by Prof. Bennet is incredibly well-organized and mapped out and I felt very supported by the resources we were given. In person lectures are clear and concise, with recordings posted in a timely manner to look over if needed. There are also many peer tutoring and office hours throughout the week, and Prof. Bennet is very good about answering questions and keeping students up to date. Strongly appreciated the emphasis on applications of the problems brought up in class. No weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Lectures and content were very comprehensive. Professor Bennett articulated all concepts well, such that, if I was ever confused, I could find the answers in lecture notes/videos. Content also followed a logical progression. It did not feel as if we were jumping all over the place. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Grading was generally fair, but occasionally very particular. Sometimes it was unclear what specific theorems or work needed to be cited to get complete points.",
                "This course is very well taught. The lessons and materials given are very organized, which helps students gain a solid understanding of the material and know how to approach differential equations in real life. The problem sets are very helpful in providing students with the opportunity to practice what they learned and evaluate their understanding. One weakness is that the course is fast paced, though it is definitely still manageable and can be kept up with.",
                "This course's grading could have been a bit more structured in that it was possible to lose many points with simple algebraic mistakes despite a clear demonstration of understanding in the actual concepts.",
                "I thought this class had almost all strengths, you cover a variety of useful methods and the professor, professor Bennett is very attentive and an excellent teacher.",
                "This course does very well at providing different methods for solving differential equations and relating to how these apply to real life engineering problems.",
                "Strength: the professor (Dr. Bennett) is the best STEM professor at Yale.",
                "Strength: Professor Bennett and everything that her teaching and overseeing of the class entails. She is for sure the most organized and dedicated professor I have ever had, and it is a true joy to take her classes. This is a well oiled machine and it is thanks to her dedication as a professor. As a student, I have an utmost appreciation for her work (as well as the TAs and tutors, who were also, amazing)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Having taken this course, I don't think I have a grasp of what now I don't know about differential equations. Meaning, this course covers it's content flawlessly, but it does not give you a bit of a primer on the other things you don't know that are beyond the course. This is a minor thing but I still value it since it helps me put into context my learning as well as give me a better context of what I know and what there is to know in a field (which is important later on, whenever making technical decisions or simply deciding what to work on or learn)",
                "strengths: everything is made available to help you learn (lecture recordings, types lecture notes, several OHs a day, <3 hour responses to ed discussions, answers to HW, meetings after tests, scans of your test, answers to the test after the tests) \r\nweaknesses: topic itself very tedious which makes it hard to care about. problems seemed very contrived, im a physics major and after 410 only really encountered 3 of the many types of problems we did in this class. the rest seemed like doing every case of each problem for the sake of thoroughness",
                "great course, but greatest strength is the prof!!",
                "extremely well-organized",
                "The course was very organized and well taught. Many resources were available to in addition to lectures that supplemented learning."

The course itself is highly computational and one could succeed just by reading the lecture notes (if Beth is the instructor) or just following the steps outlined in the textbook for solving each problem. If you are math-minded, it would not prove to be challenging, but the material does add up and the rigor could increase because of that.",

I recommend ENAS 194 over any comparable math course and having spoken to some people who took PHYS 301, I would definitely recommend ENAS 194 instead of it too. There is no reason not to take ENAS 194 if you have any interest in STEM.",

If you attended/actually watched the content and did the shuffled practice problems, you could get along just fine in the course. Very helpful to know how to solve this type of problem, not as useful knowing the proofs.",

                "If you have to take it or want to learn methods for solving differential equations. Not exactly a fun class to take though.",
                "If Professor Bennett is teaching it, an emphatic 100% YES. It was highly organized, relatively straightforward, and not too time-consuming.",
                "Yes (but make sure it's with Prof Beth Anne)! Even if you don't have to take it for your major (which I kind of didn't because I just needed any math credit), it is a great thing to know for engineering (e.g. electrical, mechanical, etc).",
                "Yes, I would with Professor Bennett. She provides well-written and organized notes and gives easy-to-understand lectures for solving PDEs and ODEs.",
                "If needed for your major, then yes.",
                "No. If you are an engineering major, you'll need it. Beth teaches it in a mechanical engineering lense but other profs do it with more mathematical lense. Not all of us are mechanical engineers, which is annoying.",
                "I would highly recommend taking Diff Eq with Prof Bennett. She is the single most organized teacher I have ever seen, with clear and concise lecture notes, handouts, and exam preparation material. She lectures really really well and I never left one of her classes without a clear understanding of the topics. Diff Eqs themselves are a very monotonous subject, essentially a series of known steps you follow to solve a general equation. But Beth taught the class in such an engaging manner that the subject never felt boring. One downside I experienced is that the graders tended to grade psets and exams very harshly, and more often than not, some of the psets feel like endless busy work (but this is just the nature of the subject). If differential equations are required for your major, I highly highly recommend that you take it with Beth Bennett.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class! As long as you're able to get into a groove working on psets every week, it's not overwhelming and I definitely learned a lot of helpful material.",
                "Yes, absolutely, especially is taught by Prof. Bennet. For any students who think they will work with ODEs and PDEs, this class is great at starting from scratch and providing examples from real life. Highly rewarding and worth the weekly effort!",
                "If you need to take it, I would one hundred percent recommend taking it with Dr. Bennett. It will be a very difficult class, but she makes sure that content is being learned and not just \"spitted out\" on a PSET or exam. Her lectures are great for understanding and she answers all questions.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if it is taught by Dr. Bennett. Differential equations come up in many contexts across the STEM concentrations, so knowing how to handle them is a very helpful skill to have. Also, while the content can be challenging at times, Dr. Bennett is an excellent professor and organizes her lectures thoroughly to make the content as clear as possible for students.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in methods of integration. If you are more of a math theory person, this may not be the class for you since many of the methods come from rigorous derivations that aren't covered in class, and you kind of have to just accept the methods as fact. However, this was a well organized class and provided a great introduction to differential equations.",
                "Yes I would, especially if Beth Bennett is reaching it! The material is very practically useful, and taught very well. Furthermore, the pace of the class is excellent, going over many critical evaluation techniques while not losing students (while there is definitely more to each method that faster-paced individuals can look into).",
                "If you are studying in a field requiring solving differential equations, I do highly recommend. It's very well taught with Beth Anne Bennet and gives many examples of real life applications. This class will give you a tool box for solving equations.",
                "Yes, if Dr. Bennett is teaching. She is the best.",
                "Absolutely. This class was truly enjoyable. And again, it is not the most sexy content, but it is fundamental to engineering and to how to analyze the world really. And no other professor will teach it better than Bennet. She sets the bar incredibly high.",
                "If you're going to take this course, I specifically recommend that you take it with Beth",
                "yes, great overview of odes, pdes, fourier transforms, etc...",
                "yes, with dr. bennett",
                "I would recommend this course for those who need it as a requirement. However, the course was very challenging with a large time commitment."
