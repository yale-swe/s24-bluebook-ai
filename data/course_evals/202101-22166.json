            "comments": [
                "I have somewhat of a mixed view of this course. On one hand, the professor and TAs are extremely nice and excellent at engaging with and helping students during office hours. Class lecture sessions directly engage with the types of problems you recieve on the homework assignments, which is very helpful. I also very much want to congratulate the peer tutors for their excellent work. Their help on the homework assignments was invaluable. The course certainly accomplishes the goal of making you pretty strongly versed in calculus techniques in the biosciences, and does so in a way that fosters inclusivity rather than exclusive competition. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, I noticed a set of things I think could be improved upon. Perhaps it is because of the pandemic, but I often felt like examination preparation and homework assignments were made more difficult than necessary given the substance of the exams and homework themselves. For example, the integration gateway is only considered passed when only one or two (maximum) minor mistakes is made. Although I can understand why this mode of test would be favored, I feel like this actively contributes far more stress than needed given the nature of the assignment. As someone who feels comfortable with how they did on exams, I still studied for the gateway far more than any of the three midterm examinations. I was thinking this through and feel that a solution might be reached in the following way:\r\n-keeping the three-midterms organization of this semester (this allowed me to focus a ton more on the last few topics, which definitely improved my learning and also reduced stress in a subject I and I know many others get scared about taking)\r\n-reducing the pass threshold for the integration gateway and/or one or more of the following:\r\n increasing the time from 25  minutes to 30+ minutes\r\n asking students who do not pass after more than four tests to pass an online course module instead",
                "Strengths: midterm formats and flexibility",
                "Great strength with office hours and assistance available, though some problems were very challenging compared to in class examples.",
                "Perusall was a very good platform, helped me engage with the reading,ask questions, and discuss with others. Lecture was also very engaging and topics were explained well, however sometimes I found I wanted work on the p-set rather than paying attention to class. That's probably just a me problem though",
                "Strengths:\r\n- universal applications to the math material\r\n- clear lectures\r\n- lots of office hours\r\n- exams were resonable\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- very difficult and time-consuming psets",
                "Amazing course! Highly recommend. Professor is great and very organized. PSETS are difficult and take a lot of time but collaboration is encouraged.",
                "The teaching assistants and Dr. Hall were awesome!!",
                "I very much enjoyed working with Dr. Hall; he was able to take abstract math concepts with differential equations and linear systems and present them in a way that was easy to understand. The only issue I had was that the problem sets were very challenging and hard to translate from the class notes at times.",
                "A strength of this course is the breakout rooms in class as that allowed us to discuss the topics with our peers.",
                "The strengths of this class were the TA office hours, Professor Hall's reliability for questions, assistance, and any other concerns from the students, as well as the student led review sessions.\r\n\r\nThe only improvement that I would suggest is to be in person. Although the online notes and recorded lessons were very helpful, I learn best in person.",
                "Strengths: Interesting topics, Professor Hall was great, felt supported and lots of resources.\r\nWeakness: Some topics were a little hard to follow when learning them. Some more resources would be nice such as resource sheets for topics or anything beyond just the notes that are created in real time during class.",
                "Professor Hall is an amazing and caring professor. The ULA's were also very helpful. The PSETs were much more challenging than class material.",
                "One strength of the course was the organization of the canvas page that made it very easy to access the resources for the class.",
                "Strengths: Prof  John Hall is absolutely amazing and truly cares for his students. Take any class with him and you won't regret it! He even met up with me during the break day. Nataly, Luba, and Murilo were also awesome ULA's! The people in this class really made the material fun, engaging, and less daunting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it was hard to stay engaged sometimes, but given that it was through Zoom, we can't really complain.",
                "Strength: Professor Hall is great at always being open to questions and conversation with anyone passionate about math.",
                "I wished that I could have interacted more with the students but honestly I feel like that was not at the fault of the Professor. I also wish that we could have gone over more calc 1 topics that are applicable to the class before diving straight in. Strengths: incredible Professor, Dr. Hall is very nice and understanding even though the content could be quite difficult. Also the TAs/ULAs were some of the best Ive had",
                "The strength was the professor. The weakness was that we often did not spend a lot of time learning the ins and outs of each math concept in favor of learning the specifics of particular readings.",
                "The strength is the professor and the TAs. They love teaching, they were super supportive and caring. The amount of office hours is also a plus. If you need help, you will get it!\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses.",
                "This course was taught very well, and the course was nicely organized. No criticisms regarding the material or how it was taught, I think Professor Hall is doing a good job with the course and should keep doing what he's doing. As for improvement, I think the only thing that could be improved is the training of ULAs. All of the ULAs were good and capable, but often times there was a lot of confusion and discrepancies of the answers and questions on the problem sets. So I think it would be good to perhaps provide a bit more training/review for the ULAs and prepare a general answer key for the problem sets to avoid any misunderstandings of the problems.",
                "Professor Hall is a great teacher who is very interested in your acquisition of the material.  He sets you up for success with his different assignments and various review opportunities.  Additionally the Undergraduate Teaching Assistants were wonderful for this course!",
                "This course drew on models from many biological fields, which really helped us understand the value of the techniques we were learning. There was help available nearly every day if you wanted to ask questions about the weekly problem set, which was difficult but pushed our grasp of the concepts discussed in class. In terms of weaknesses, I would have liked to have tried to develop a model of my own (even just a small change to an existing model), using what I learned in the course. Reading about them and having terms explained is one thing, but I think attempting to actually develop one would have given me a deeper understanding of modeling.",
                "The strength is the interesting material and thought-out pace for instruction.  The weakness is the slightly limited amount of non-live resources to complete problem sets.",
                "I really liked the way this course was taught, Professor Hall and all of the teaching staff were extremely helpful and did so much to make sure that I understood the content.",
                "The strength is that the papers we read really connected well to the concepts in class and supplemented my understanding. However, I had difficulty with a lot of the math once we finished the calculus section (ie linear algebra) and had to supplement my learning with outside materials. Additionally, the ULAs were great!"

So if you're still deciding between Math 115 and Math 116, I would definitely go for Math 116 because the support you get from your peers, Professor Hall, and the ULAs is unparalleled.",
                "Yes.  I thought this course provided me with all the skills Math 115 would have + some.  I enjoyed the readings Professor Hall assigned and my eyes were opened to ways to apply mathematical models which I never saw before.  In showing us real-life applications, Professor Hall helped my understanding of the material ten-fold.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in biology and need differential calculus, this course combines the two extremely well. The techniques you learn will really help you think about processes in a new way.",
                "I only recommend if they need the course to satisfy a Calc II requirement and don't want to do straight math work all the time.  It is like the PHYS 170-171 of intro physics.",
                "Yes, Professor Hall is an outstanding professor.",
                "I would most certainly recommend this course to anybody who is interested in biological sciences and needs to take a math course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, though I think it would be most beneficial for people in the biosciences.",
                "I would heavily recommend this course to another student who is interested in the sciences, and specifically biology, and does not want to take a standard math class. This class provides a very interesting and refreshing way of approaching math that allowed me to learn math without feeling completely overwhelmed by purely mathematical concepts.",
                "This course was great! If you're premed/interested in science and choosing between this course and 115, I'd say take 116! Professor Hall is incredible, and it's really cool to see how these advanced mathematical concepts are deeply intertwined with science. A lot of the time I would learn retroactively by understanding the literature before the math, but that strengthened my overall comprehension in the end."
