                "Nature walk was an excellent project that I felt really satisfied with. Honestly most of the labs were pretty fun (which is impressive bc lab courses at Yale are rarely fun)",
                "I think that long lab reports and short lab reports should be more evenly spaced out rather than having consecutive weeks of long reports.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- lab time was fun and very hands on\r\n- mini lab reports were manageable to get done\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- did not get grades back. even at the end of the semester, there were many lab reports ungraded, so we had no feedback\r\n- workload was heavy and quizzes felt unreasonable at some points.",
                "Pretty fun and interactive but the formal reports were often tedious and overly long",
                "The strengths of the course are the professor and teaching team. They are very helpful and willing to explain course content to you if you are confused. One way to improve the course would be to make the laboratory handout instructions a little bit clearer and possibly shorter as it is difficult to complete the entire content in the allotted lab time period sometimes. However, this course was still excellent!",

                "Yes this was a really excellent class with a wonderful professor",
                "Yes!!! The course is very engaging. Although its a bit stressful to study for quizzes and time-consuming to do the lab reports, the lab itself of very fun. You get to go to the botanical gardens, wade in the river, and examine a lot of live organisms. Highly recommend, especially if you need a pre-med lab.",
                "I maybe would. It does have the workload of a regular 1 credit course, which is something to take into account with scheduling. You can succeed if you have the time to put in, but it is more work than I anticipated for a 0.5 credit class.",
                "Yes, a fun bio lab. Marta is so passionate and wonderful. I enjoyed the labs more often than not, but the formal reports were often overly tedious and long. I didnt receive much feedback throughout the semester for reports, so even evaluating this class, I am not sure what my grade is. But overall, enjoyable to take during my last semester at Yale",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as the professors and TAs are very kind and understanding. The content is very interesting and you can learn about a diverse set of information. Overall, the quizzes and assignments are fair, but the workload is a bit high. However, this course is still amazing and one of the least stressful lab courses I have been in, which really allowed me to enjoy the content we were learning.",
