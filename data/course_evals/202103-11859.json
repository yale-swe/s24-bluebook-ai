                "A comprehensive understanding of how to code in Python and introductory Machine Learning techniques. I also learned how to code projects in teams and got a refresher on introductory Physics. Furthermore, I learned how to do data cleaning on large, messy data sets and how to do binary regression and classification.",
                "The life cycle of knowledge mining.",
                "I also learned a lot about different ways to use python to understand things like random number generators, integral solvers, and error analysis. I also learned how to apply machine learning techniques and metrics to various topics in science, like the weather.",
                "I learned how to process and visualize data using Python, implement several mathematical techniques through programming, and the basics of machine learning.",
                "I improved my confidence coding in Python. I learned about some important numerical techniques that are used in scientific computation. Finally, I learned how to use the basics of Machine Learning and Neural Networks using Python.",
                "We received an overview of various machine learning techniques, the Python programming language, scientific computing, and visualization.",

                "I learned the basics of Python and scientific computing. After learning the background in Python, the emphasis of the course was definitely machine learning. We learned different machine learning algorithms, including neural networks, that I think are important for any prospective physics researcher.",
                "An overview of python, neural networks and machine learning and their application to real-world scenarios",
                "We learned scientific computing skills such as Monte Carlo simulations, as well as machine learning techniques such as regression and classification algorithms. I built a solid foundation of coding in python. Additionally, we learned how to apply machine learning to real-world issues."

                "Strengths: TAs and Prof are very accessible. The material is challenging but not necessarily difficult. Learning intro Python and ML techniques at a face pace\/ skills acquired are very useful for internships \/ portfolios. Weakness: Length of the class (3 hours) made it hard for me to focus sometimes.",
                "The main strength of this course is that each week is divided into a separate project that is very digestible and facilitates learning. We also get to work in groups which makes the challenge of projects much more appealing and the class just as fun as informative.",
                "The strength is that we do not dwell on the derivations of some numerical methods-they were presented but not included in psets. Strengths are that the assignments are purely practical. One thing that I would change is the structure of the course so that we have enough time to experiment more with machine learning and neural networks. I would allocate half of the course to that. I would also change some assignments because I felt like I was just plugging code instead of learning how to do it myself.",
                "Professor was great!",
                "Strengths: Well organized. It was the same thing every week - one three-hour lecture\/time to start the problem set, and one problem set each week. Earlier problem sets were easy, especially if you have coding experience, and they became more difficult over time. Office hours are a big help and are often available. The final project was a good way to exhibit understanding of the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of the course was spent learning how to implement things like integration and derivatives from scratch, when in reality, Python packages can do the same more quickly and efficiently. I think that more of the time should have been spent on machine learning algorithms rather than the nitty-gritty of these mathematical concepts.",
                "Overall this course was fantastic!!! This was an awesome introduction to coding and I would highly recommend it to any person",
                "This course had many strengthsthe lectures were clear and engaging, and the hands-on group work in the computing lab was a great way to understand and apply the knowledge from the lectures. Additionally, the support was amazingboth the professor and the TAs were very encouraging and proactive in providing help and asking for feedback as the course went along. The only weakness was that the course felt a bit rushed towards the end, as we were completing a problem set at the same time as the final project with some last-minute directions."

                "Yes. This is one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale and made me want to pursue Data Science and ML classes further. The Prof is super intellectually engaging and the TFs don't make you feel stupid when you don't know something nor do they just give you the answers - everyone teaching (TAs and Prof) make sure that you understand the material each week during office hours and engage with each student.",
                "Yes, the topics are very interesting and applicable to various topics in physics. I really recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about applying coding and computing to scientific topics. I also highly recommend this class to those who want a nice simple start to machine learning and how various machine learning algorithms work.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone that wants to experience coding from a different perspective than CS classes. I would also recommend it as an intro Python class, although it is a bit more challenging for those without previous coding experience. Overall, I learned a new side of programming and some great data science skills that I wouldn't have otherwise.",
                "I would! The workload is low (until the end of the semester) and you get a lot of useful skills to apply to future endeavors  in scientific computing with Python.",
                "Yes! This is a great project-based course (no exams) where you get to interact with your peers as you work on assignments and learn new concepts.",
                "Yes, I would! This was a great course",
                "Yes, take it! You will learn a lot and the problem sets are carefully crafted so that they are not overwhelming but are very instructive.",
                "I would probably recommend this course to another student who plans to do research in physics. I learned several valuable skills that I am sure will carry over to the lab.",
                "Yes. As someone who was new to coding, this course gave a very comprehensive, applicable, and gentle introduction to python and machine learning. Couldnt recommend it highly enough for another student",
                "Yes! This course is great for any level of experience, including those who had no prior coding experience. It's a great way to learn how to code well, and I came away with a lot of valuable skills as well as a new confidence for coding. The support was great, and the workload was very reasonable."
