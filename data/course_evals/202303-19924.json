At its heart, this course is about people and their relationships with other people.",

                "Yes! You read a lot of great books and more generally it's a really rewarding experience to immerse yourself in postcolonial literature and study the effects of Empire through the lens of literature (rather than a traditional history course). Professor Phillips is also a great profhe's funny and full of wisdom and is serious about making sure the conversations we have as a class are intentional."
