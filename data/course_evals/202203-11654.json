Honestly I felt super overwhelmed when thinking about how much we had learned when I had just started studying for the final... but the way this course works (which is quite wonderfully, props to Professor Geanakoplos) is that when you actually take the time to go back and review what you've learned, it builds your skills and economic reasoning in a very cumulative, natural way. Actually, wow. Writing this made me realize how much I appreciated the class. 10/10.",

Throughout the course, we keep taking each one of these assumptions away, getting closer and closer to a better model of the economy. Professor Geanakoplos is so so knowledgeable about these models and can describe why certain assumptions are the way that they are. We go over interesting models about the use of money, inflation due to credit cards and more. \r\n\r\nThe math in this course is not hard, it's primarily about developing good intuition.",

While many lectures used proofs to build understanding of course concepts, the core focus remained on successfully solving concrete, numerical problems through mathematical calculations.",

Prof G does an incredible job of taking relevant phenomena (like the 2021 inflation or the GFC) and giving simple mathematical models that give great color into them.

            "comments": [
                "Topic material of the class was excellent and the professor did a great job of tying it into his work and the real world.",
                "Great Professor and problem sets make you think and connect with the work, preparing you well for the exams.",
                "Class is very interesting. The way it is taught is pretty good already. One thing I might change is not as much time spent going into proofs of theorems, unless it's very important for understanding of the models, and for the ones that are crucial, spend more time explaining in layman's terms, as the notation can get quite overwhelming in some proofs.",
                "Strengths: Loved it when Professor Geanakoplos moved from teaching by sharing lecture notes to writing on the blackboard. Also, how he always encouraged student questions in the middle fo lecture and would actually ensure the student was satisfied before moving on. The storytelling interspersed in lecture really ensured engagement, and it made me laugh. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, lectures would run over, which would make it a little hard to get somewhere on time right after class. Also, I sometimes felt that the class didn't really teach you how to do the problem sets themselves, you'd have to sit down and go through the lecture notes to be able to do the homework. There is an expectation that you read the lecture notes beforehand though, which I didn't do--so that one's on me.",
                "This course is quite interesting, however, most of the practical matters of how to complete the assignments need to be learned in sections, whereas the lectures and lecture notes teach the concepts in a much more abstract manner. At its core, the course is very well organized; a slightly more concrete lecture/lecture note format would pay dividends.",
                "Very good professor. I would have liked psets to be more mathy than computations but they weren't very hard so it was good overall. Very good lectures.",
                "The course is taught well. Lectures are enjoyable, sections were immensely helpful, and the problem sets really solidified my understanding of the material. Exams were fair. The one thing that seemed it could be improved was the long length of the lecture notes: it was sometimes difficult to determine what material we should expect to be tested on, so maybe making that clearer would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: This course helps put models on many common economic concepts. With this class, we can better understand the impact of endowments, utility, money, the government, central banks, and more. \r\nWeaknesses: We dive right into it, so it takes a few weeks to get a better understanding on how to think about these models. At first it feels like memorizing the steps, before you actually develop the intuition",
                "The lectures moved a bit too quickly",
                "I might be in the minority, but I think this course lacks sufficient rigor. Proofs often help me understand why something is true, so focusing on computation was a bit demotivating. I generally enjoyed all of the topics covered, although I think it would have been worth trying to motivate models with more applications before diving into the details.",
                "The lectures are supplemented by heavily detailed notes, which could be helpful for understanding the materials in depth. The class is very mathematical and gives a new quantitative perspective on economics.",
                "The lectures towards the latter half using more exposition on the chalkboard were much easier to follow than the earlier lessons projecting the lecture notes on the screen. More in-person office hours for TA sessions during the weekdays would have been a great help if more manpower were available in future iterations.",
                "Great! I definitely felt like Daniel helped me learn a lot when I was struggling, but I appreciated how receptive they were to feedback (writing on the blackboard was so amazing!!) I also loved the history and stories of Prof G.",
                "I think the main strength of the course is the wide variety of interconnected topics that it covers. As the professor said, each new type of equilibrium was really the same general equilibrium theory but simply reinterpreting commodities. I think one area of improvement is better emphasizing these connections. I feel like there were a number of topics where it took me a while to see the connection to general equilibrium theory, but once it clicked, I found it surprisingly easy to apply my previous knowledge to the new types of problems.",
                "The course was very interesting but I believe we covered too much material for the given time.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting content, professor was extremely engaging. It was very clear what was expected of us on exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the lectures were a bit hard to follow, unless you had read the lecture notes beforehand.",
                "Great professor, interesting lecturer, well organized",
                "One suggestion  this course is half optimization and half general equilibrium with applications. Many of my friends and I loved the second half and felt more neutral about the first half. Maybe it would be nice to add more applications and spend less time on the optimization.",
                "Strengths: the professor is very engaging and it shows that he cares about students. The lecture notes are also helpful, though they can be disorganized and include unnecessary information. It would be helpful if the professor was clearer about which parts of the lecture notes are more and less important. The TA, Daniel, was also helpful throughout the course and his office hours were crucial to the class. \r\nWeakness: the first half of the course felt disorganized and it was hard to follow the class. This improved once the professor started writing on the board which slowed down the pace. However, I was often confused with the notation, so I think it would be helpful if he was more careful with notation."

                "Yes. Heavily. I feel like this course really made my semester. Professor Geanakoplos really grows on you, and I looked forward to my Mondays/Wednesday because of this course. Also, our TF Daniel--who I'm aware won't be TF-ing again--was incredible. The two of them worked really well as a team to make sure students understood big concepts and models (lectures) and how to apply those concepts in the problem sets (sections). Oftentimes during lecture, I'd be really confused but it would all come together in the last 5 minutes/in section. The course is made so that if you go in having read the lecture notes, you will understand it. Elsewise, you'll need a little more time to understand the content.",
                "For a student with a sufficient mathematical background (proofs-based linear algebra at an absolute minimum, preferably further proofs-based courses to understand the more rigorous aspects of the course) who is interested in learning the mathematical dynamics of the economy, yes; in general, the course is on the harder side but it can pay off if one has sufficient preparation.",
                "Very good mathematical economics course.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend the course. The material was interesting in and of itself, but it also vastly improved my understanding of microeconomic theory more generally (i.e. by introducing me to the proof of existence of equilibrium via Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem, etc.). The weekly p-sets were often long but were not very challenging.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student, it provides a great framework to think about economic through mathematical models.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes to anyone who is comfortable with quantitative analysis. Nearly all reasoning in the class is done with algebra, and it is enlightening to see how math plays out some common sense in economics.",
                "Yes. No other course like this is available elsewhere.",
                "It is worth taking a class with one of Yales most brilliant professors! Also, if Daniel is TAing he is incredible!",
                "Yes, its a basic skill every finance person should know.",
                "I think this course is a good step up from the introductory/intermediate micro/macro-economics courses (115, 116, 121, 122) in terms of combining economic theory with mathematical rigor. While the level of math required to understand concepts in the course is not particularly high, I felt like many concepts were definitely much easier to understand if you had a robust understanding of the underlying math behind the theory. It certainly made the problem sets a lot easier to solve. I think many of the economic theories are also extremely fascinating, and many concepts are approached from an angle that I had not considered before.",
                "I would recommend this to a student interested in advancing their econ knowledge.",
                "Highly recommend! The course merges mathematics with economics and uses theory to attempt to explain many different aspects of economics. You get to learn about why money has value, what happens when people use credit cards, the impact of leverage on asset prices, and much more. Professor Geanakoplos is one of the best professors I've had. Class is never boring, and you get to hear many interesting/funny anecdotes from professor's own experience in the financial industry.",
                "Prof. Geanakoplos is great, very interesting material",
                "Absolutely! Prof G is an incredible Professor. The class, particularly lecture, is difficult to follow early in the semester (especially if you havent taken Econ 125). However, as you read the lecture notes and go to office hours, things start to make more sense. Once youve started to catch up, it becomes easier to process material in lecture, and you start appreciating how intelligent Prof G is and how thoroughly he understands the models that he presents in class. The final few lectures in which he presents his research on the leverage cycle are the ultimate payoff.",
                "Only if they have the time and are willing to put in the effort. I think this class is very rewarding if you work hard, but can feel painful during the learning process when you're still trying to grasp the concepts/models."
