    "I learned an incredible amount about the South Asian diaspora, different ways to study migration, legal parameters around movement, and understanding the context that certain types of historical sources do\/do not convey.",
    "This was a great course with fantastic readings that really taught me how to think about migration from multiple disciplinary approaches.",
    "In terms of course content, Professor De's class covered a fascinating, relatively under-covered cross-section of South Asian history -- that of the complex interplay between legal systems and migration. \r\n\r\nThis course helped me develop my critical reading skills, understand approaches to historical analysis, familiarize myself with humanities research tools and techniques, and improve my academic writing.",
    "You learn a lot about how the South Asian diaspora, actively or passively, challenged norms of citizenship, immigration,  legality, labor, etc. around the world. As someone who didn't know much about South Asian history or the diaspora, this class illuminated many unexpected aspects of the British empire, law, and migration."

   "comments": [
    "Professor De is a fantastic seminar leader, prepping ahead of time from the reading responses and then engaging everyone in the class. He knows a ton about the material, which was incredibly diverse in and of itself.\r\n\r\nA suggestion is that the readings be posted earlier; I am a slow reader and I plan ahead so that I can finish all the reading. It is very tough for me when the readings are changed on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon for a Monday reading response, and more than once a reading was posted either Sunday night or Monday morning. Another suggestion is feedback on the papers when the draft is durned in during the midterm; once you get it though, Professor De's feedback is very good.",
    "Readings could be posted earlier but otherwise the course organization , creative assignments and of course Prof De were perfect.",
    "Strengths of this course include (first and foremost) the instructor -- Professor De is not only extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter, he also is highly personally motivated regarding the topic of this course. The discussion-based style of the seminar lent itself very well to fascinating conversations about the topics covered in the course, and Professor De did an outstanding job of moderating these discussions to explore interesting and non-trivial angles to the works studied.\r\n\r\nImprovements I would make to this course are few and far between -- I would make only one request that I think would materially enhance the course. Readings were usually posted on Course Reserves on Friday or Saturday before our Tuesday class section; I think many students would have benefitted if they had been posted just a day or two earlier."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, you will learn an incredible amount about South Asian diaspora and how that affects constructs of race, citizenship, identity etc. It will substantially build on your understanding on how the world works. Material has crossed Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, North America, etc. with a clear focus; thus it is not too broad, but still touches a lot of places and people. Professor De is really invested in his seminar and prepares from the reading responses and engages with everyone. His feedback, if and when you get it, is really good and will help you. \r\n\r\nKnow though that he assigned a ton of reading, which is subject to a complete change even the day before the reading response is due. For slow readers who care about finishing their reading, it was very hard to fully prepare to class when very long, dense, academic readings were entirely changed the day before.",
    "Absolutely. The subject matter is crucial for understanding contemporary world history, and any class taught by Professor De is always worth taking.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Learning from Professor De's incisive treatment of unique historical sources has been a pleasure."
