We also spent a lot of time looking at photographs and analyzing them. This was very helpful as an aspiring practitioner of film and photography.",
                "This course was a great introduction to the scholarship behind documentary work --  both visual and audio. We discussed history, practitioners, and had great lively discussions on the ethics of documentaries. I got hands-on experience with my final project. I also got great advice from class speakers.",

            "comments": [
                "While I wish it were in-person, I thought the unconventional shape/pedagogy of the syllabus made this course an amazing experience.",
                "I think a strength of this course was the assignments. There were four 500-700 word think pieces + one final paper or project (pretty open-ended). I think the short essays could've been better spaced -- for some reason, they were mostly due in the latter half of the semester and got to be a lot on top of other end-of-semester work, when many of the prompts could've just been assigned earlier and we still would've had the analytical tools to approach them. I also really liked hearing from practitioners in class -- including the two instructors themselves -- since we could ask them about the questions and issues in class that we'd contemplated more theoretically. In general, I think the course could have been better focused all around. The general organization of the syllabus was a strength since it offered a very wide view of documentary (including the very definition of that word), but I do believe I would've taken more away from the class if we'd been assigned a couple chapters from every book rather than a full book every week. (Also, making PDFs of those chapters available would be even better -- thankfully, the library had digital editions of most of the books, but buying all the books for the course is definitely on the expensive side for a typical Yale course, at least in my experience. The cost made me question my decision to take the class at all until I discovered the online library editions.) I definitely did not actually finish any of the readings, and it was difficult to figure out which parts would be the most relevant or enlightening. I also think that our class discussions could've been a bit more focused - I appreciate open discussion on people's general thoughts about course materials, but I think that mode of leading discussion paired with having to digest so many pages of reading and/or not knowing how to focus my reading made quality participation difficult for me.",
                "I would have preferred a course load that was less reading heavy. Instead of assigning a book a week, which felt like an unproductive way to study documentary filmmaking at times, I think it would have been more beneficial if we were assigned documentaries to watch or to read shorter excerpts. Many of the readings that we had were very dense and not engaging.",
                "This class is definitely one of a kind and an amazing experience for new or experienced students. Everybody's unique interests and experiences contributed immensely to our class discussions. The only downside I would say is that we had to experience this class over zoom. Our class came together a view times for a Yale Art Gallery museum visit and movie screenings, but this would have without a doubt been better if we all could have been together.",
                "Strengths: Given the class was on Zoom, I was so amazed (and surprised frankly) with the high level of engagement. Students really respected each other's comments and seemed so excited to discuss/debate/challenge ideas. Each class made me think for hours afterwards. Lasting impact. \r\nWeakness: Zoom was the primary \"weakness\" of the course. It was easy to check out sometimes.",

                "Yes, a near-perfect class that perfectly balances theory, practice, and good conversation.",
                "Yes and no. Yes because it was a fairly interesting examination of the philosophical/ pedagogical underpinnings of documentary as a craft and art form. With that said, the nature of this discussion was consistently more heady than I anticipated. Though, overall, this was a well-taught and enjoyable course, at times the discussion can be confusingly lofty. This seminar won't teach you the stuff of documentary practition--while that's not a bad thing (there's a lot of value in the kind of conversation that you will have), it's something you should know before enrolling. The expected workload is also a lot (a book a week), though you don't need to do every page of every reading and the assignments aren't difficult or cumbersome .",
                "I'd recommend this course if you're interested in studying documentary on a theoretical/analytical level, which is all wrapped up in the name of the course. It's intro to documentary *studies*, not intro to documentary, so I think the course can still be very interesting and enlightening even if you're not a documentarian of some sort or not looking to become one (even though a good number of people in the class seemed to have some documentary experience). The final project allows you the opportunity to dabble in practice if you're interested (photo, video, or audio), but you don't have to if you don't want to. (You can write a paper instead.)",
                "Maybe. Matt and Sylvia are amazing and have so much knowledge, insight, and experience, and I always enjoyed the guest lectures. However, since the class was on Zoom, I felt way less engaged with it than I could have been. I would definitely recommend this class if it were in person. Zoom, on the other hand, is a buzzkill.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course -- experienced or beginner. There's a lot of value in understanding the scholarship of the work you're curious about and this course is a great community to learn alongside.",
                "Absolutely -- regardless of whether you have any experience in documentary, the class discussions are so generative and raise really important ethical/cultural questions.",
                "Absolutely. The generous and generative intellectual environment fostered by Sylvia Ryerson and Matt Jacobson was remarkable. I looked forward to this class each week.",
                "Yes. You learn from the other students and the instructors. You get familiarized with the history of the genre, different kinds of documentaries, documentary theory, and a selection of contemporary and historical documentaries. And there is even a practical component at the end of the semester. A great overview over documentary studies."
