I can also utilize Matlab in a greater capacity from the problem sets.",
                "I learned a broad, basic intro to biomechanics. Continuum mechanics, some statistical mechanics, the impact of entropy at some scales, how fluids can behave, and how these things apply to biology. There were some beautiful connections between the math we employed and the conceptual ideas."

            "comments": [
                "Interesting content, but made more difficult and stressful to learn by unhelpful feedback on assignments",
                "I liked the project and the daily quizzes! I think it was a more engaging format than taking exams.",
                "Quizzes every single class was incredibly unnecessary and annoying, points were taken off homework without stating why and they were not given back even if one TF advised you incorrectly on a pset",
                "Strengths: the problem sets were generally fair, quizzes were usually relevant to material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: having quizzes at 9 am every day, we were told TAs are tracking participation however this seemed very poorly tracked and only the people in the front row really had chances to participate in class",
                "I believe that the daily quizzes felt a little arbitrary for me, and that they did not necessarily assess us on the most relevant information (a lot of the quizzes were on pure memorization). The PSETs also did not feel grounded in what we learned in lecture.",
                "The projects are super relevant and hands on/applicational! Professor murrell always encourages you to ask questions and is very encouraging when you have out of the box thinking",
                "There is no clarity in your grade for the class. TFs dont post.",
                "The course is so broad that it is hard to feel like any of the material has been completely mastered. The in class quizzes were also not conducive to learning because of their frequency and their tendency to cover material from any point in class. I think a better method would be weekly/biweekly quizzes that are slightly longer and focus on content from the past few lectures only. Non multiple choice questions could also allow students to better demonstrate their understanding of concepts more than questions that ask about specific formulas/equations.",
                "Definitely would help to add a peer tutor or at least have more office hours held! Having only 2 hours a week was frustrating considering how difficult and sometimes confusing the psets were.",
                "Weakness- the TAs. The PSETs were really hard to do just based on lectures because we dont do any practice problems in class. They also require knowledge of Matlab. The TAs were not helpful as they were never confident in how to respond to questions and would often leave you more confused, but also had OH at horrible times and refused to meet with you outside of them. \r\nStrengths- the class had daily quizzes instead of exams. I liked these because It was a good review, however, the answers were muted which made it hard to learn from them. The professor explains the material at a good pace and emphasizes important topics",
                "I liked the setup of the class. Having a quiz every single class was tough, but the quizzes helped make the lectures make sense.",
                "The class was well paced out - and material from previous classes were reviewed\r\n\r\nI wish there were more discussion on how this concepts applied to physiology. There was some discussion of applications but more would have helped me better appreciate the material.",
                "This class was changed since previous years and was not exam-based. Instead we had a large project and many PSETs. In addition, we had daily quizzes, which incentivized us to go to class. Some logistics still needed to be worked out, though. For people with COVID, who could not and was not allowed to come to class, they were penalized because they had to take zeroes on their quizzes. This put a lot of pressure to remember the big things in class, which was often times just up to the professor to choose focus concepts. The class was taught with pre-written notes, so it was easy to follow. Professor Murrell was always very thorough to review, which I appreciated, and helped solidify what we had learned thus far. The TAs were note very attentive and did not provide enough help. There should be more standardized review sessions because most times it was very chaotic and unprepared.  One huge weakness was that the special end-of-semester project and our biggest PSET was due on the same night. There was not reason that there could have been a day or two in between to focus on each one separately. Both products felt rushed and misguided towards the end as a result.",
                "Strengths of this course include the level of instruction and complexity of material. Weaknesses include the harshness of grading, difficult daily quizzes, and lack of exams.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Murrell is funny and engaging, and super knowledgeable of biomechanics and its history. He is happy to share and is a wonderful person to connect with on a personal level. He wants students to succeed.\r\nThe course content is fascinating and showed me how the mechanics of biological systems are important and the types of questions that can be asked.\r\nI really appreciated not having exams in this course. I think this was an amazing feature which should be kept.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course wasn't well-organized and the TAs and professor were not sinked up. I would recommend a few things to improve this course:\r\n1. give feedback on psets and quizzes much earlier\r\n2.  Make sure Prof. Murrell is monitoring TA's organization. The TAs were often unable to answer content related questions and wouldn't provided feedback in a reasonable timeline. \r\n3. Incorporate more cool videos and research. These were some of the best parts of the course, and there could be more.\r\n4. Ensure quizzes relate to recent course content and dont' repeat questions or leave ambiguities."

                "If you are BME major you have to take it. The PSETs are hard but you get 2 weeks to complete most of them. The final project if you start early isnt bad. It is really nice to not have exams to be able to focus on the material on the daily and the quizzes at the start of each class make sure you dont miss any lectures",

                "Yes, this course teaches you some of the foundational physical principles used in biomechanics.",
                "Yes! The content was interesting and learned the mechanical processes behind fluid dynamics, cell interactions, and application to real life projects.",
                "Only take this course if you have to, since it covers many difficult topics in a relatively hurried fashion. This is not the fault of the instructor but rather a flaw in the course design. Many topics could have and should have been covered in much greater depth than presented in a few lectures. Furthermore, the quizzes were difficult to study for, as they were cumulative. Finally, the homework often involved content beyond the lectures where several external resources were required.",
                "As it is currently organized, I would say probably don't take this course if you don't have to, though it does have many good qualities. If the course became more organized, it could be amazing, because the material is fascinating and prof. Murrell is an amazing scientist and is a very funny person."
