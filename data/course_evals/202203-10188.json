                "We learned a bit about each of the three formats (fiction, poetry, and drama). We ended the class having produced a high volume of work with enough samples to submit to enter future creative writing courses. We learned about story structure, and we workshopped our peers' pieces.",
                "I learned so much about how to analyze, write, and discuss creative writing in a way that I had never been taught before. This class really opened my eyes to the intricacies of fiction, poetry, and drama. It's made it easier for me to tackle creative writing as a logistic problem, and goes far beyond just plot and structure. The course provides great, brief definitions for all the buzzwords of fiction, and provides a warm, organized, and enjoyable environment to work in the craft. Great professors, great plenary lectures, great readings. I have never had so much fun while learning so much in a class.",
                "This was a great introduction to creative writing. I was exposed to fiction, poetry, and drama writing. Unlike the argumentative essays that I am used to writing for other courses, this course really helped hone in creativity to create stories. There was a lot of freedom to exercise a variety of ideas and was overall a great course for improving writing.",
                "Spark for creative writing! Learned some basic theory on crafting fiction, drama, and poetry and got to try out the genres in a stress free environment.",
                "I learned how to analyze and write poetry, fiction, and drama.",
                "A plethora of writing skills; how to write fiction, poetry, and drama",
                "how to structure a good script, poem, or short story; tips for getting started and defeating writers' block, key elements of drama, fiction, and poetry, got to hear from some amazing writers both affiliated and outside of the yale english department",
                "I learned a lot about narrative structure, dialogue, crafting poetry. I was able to fine tune my creative writing skills, from helping me actually sit down and write, to making the narratives I actually develop more captivating and interesting.",
                "I learned the foundations of poetry, fiction, and drama. I was taught tools and techniques that can be used to make a successful piece of creative writing."

            "comments": [
                "A big strength of this course is the way it breaks down and demystifies creative writing. They give us a concrete path to writing a story or poem. It doesn't feel so difficult to start writing something now. The writing exercises due weekly were very helpful in this - by the time we had to create a full story we had our exercises to work off of. A weakness of this course was the group lectures with all the creative writing students. Those were really not engaging or helpful. I would eliminate those entirely and have more workshop classes or spend more time reading other works.",
                "This class is a great introductory course that goes through fiction, drama, and poetry. I think the readings were great and the plenary lectures (where all sections met) were great. The organization was really well done and I loved that we were able to build off of exercises and constantly revise or restart new stories, poems, and plays. The professors are really kind and helpful. \r\n\r\nI can't really think of any weaknesses. This is probably the best class I've taken at Yale.",
                "This was an amazing English course. There was a lot of room for feedback, and I loved the freedom it gave me to write about whatever interested me. It really didn't feel like an academic course where I had to stress about grades, but rather a course where everyone was there to improve their writing and wanted to be there. I wish there was more time to discuss some of our readings in more depth though.",
                "Low stress but still learned a lot. Great organization, super fun assignments, and great classroom environment.",
                "The strength is the wide variety of texts we read. We go over many genres and learn the structure of all of them and learn how to write our own.",
                "I enjoyed the short introduction we had to each style of writing, but an inevitability with this kind of class is that you dont delve particularly deeply into any one type of writing",
                "strengths: plenary lectures and guest visits, small class sizes, generative exercises, kind feedback and ability to improve work, opportunity to create a final portfolio, weaknesses: possibly the pace of grading -- feedback could be returned a bit faster, maybe more detailed feedback on how to improve for the final portfolio",
                "The strength of this course is in the professor and the other students taking it; there are a few workshops and hearing feedback from your peers on your writing is super helpful. The only weakness off the top of my head was some scheduling issues and confusion with the syllabus, but they didn't affect the class much.",
                "I think the organization of going from fiction, to poetry, and then drama is really effective. I liked the talks where poets and writers came to discuss their work, but I thought at times it disrupted the planned class schedule and I that I learned more during class time itself. I think the selected readings are fantastic choices."

                "Absolutely. Anyone who consumes media would be interested in this class. It gives a great overview of all three forms of creative writing, the assignments are fun, and the professors are great.",
                "Absolutely! This was a great English course to learn a lot about creative writing. Especially for someone like me who barely had any exposure to this form of writing in high school or previous courses, it was a course that fostered an amazing environment for learning.",
                "YES!! Take creative writing, no matter your major! You will get to tap into your creative side in a stress free environment and it was my favorite part of my day - to get to talk about great fiction and poetry from a craft perspective.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone of any major. The skills you learn are helpful for all forms of writing.",

                "yes!",
                "yes! the workload is probably better than english classes where you have to write long papers, there's just consistent but not too much work over the weekends. the reading load isn't super overwhelming either and honestly enjoyable. I really liked the mix of seminars as well as larger lectures and guest visits. Professor Green is really kind and an amazing teacher but my advice would be to be proactive in reaching out to him and emailing him",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course!! Derek is a wonderful professor, he's funny, and he's very entertaining, teaching a lot of information to the class while keeping things very interesting. And English 123 itself is a very good course-- I took it mostly because I just wanted to write, and I accomplished exactly that.",
                "Yes, one hundred percent. No matter your major, I feel like you will love this course. This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. I feel like the expectations are fair and you learn so much."
