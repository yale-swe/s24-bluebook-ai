                "I learned how to more effectively communicate in Spanish in both written and spoken form. Learning different tenses and when to use them has helped me more fluently create sentences. Her emphasis on elaboration and expansion of Spanish vocabulary helped especially in speaking academic Spanish, a spoken and written form of the language I was not accustomed to using before this class. Overall, because of Prof. Alexandrovs on communication in Spanish versus ensuring perfect usage of the language, she fostered an environment that allowed for making mistakes and growing from them, making it easier to participate in class without being nervous about making mistakes.",
                "I really improved by ability to converse in the Spanish language. Rather than spending large sums of time relearning grammar I was already confident in, I just got to apply it to conversation and writing, skills I still need to improve upon."

                "It was incredibly organized and well taught with room for questions and any feedback at any point. The instructor was receptive and responsive.",
                "Strengths: emphasis on communication in Spanish, but also some usage of English to facilitate communications, which lessens the pressure when you dont know a word or phrase in Spanish; Prof. Alexandrov is super understanding and truly cares for her students, she will work with you so that you can succeed; \r\n\r\nWeakness: much work is assigned for this class, but it all correlates with course material so it does not feel like busy work, but it could be lessened some, but its doable",
                "The strengths of this course were the diario assignments. They were incredibly helpful and also allowed me to learn much more about Mexican culture. I would say a weakness, even though it was not much of a weakness, was having to do a final project with a medium I we not familiar with. However, it was still great to learn how to do."
