                "I learned about ceramic paste composition, formation techniques, decoration techniques, social structures surrounding ceramic making, and much more. All reading assignments were paired with hands-on activities which further clarified concepts. We had experience making ceramics (coiling and wheel throwing), analyzing sherds, and analyzing full pots. I appreciated how comprehensive the hands-on components were.",
                "I suppose I learned a lot about how archaeologists look at ceramics. I didn't learn exactly what they themselves learned about those ceramics. There were lots of inferences. I've never taken an archaeology class before so I think I was a bit lost throughout.",
                "I learned a lot in this course about archaeology, pottery, and analyzing ceramic sherds! I didn't expect to gain as much hands-on knowledge as I did, it was amazing.",
                "I learned about the production of ancient pottery and about how to analyze pots and sherds to learn about their cultural contexts and production methods. The research paper also allowed me to dive into a specific area and learn a lot about one corner of the study of archaeological ceramics.",
                "In this course, I learned about research methods in archaeology and anthropology, history, modern science techniques, how to analyze actual pottery sherds and vessels through hands-on labs, and about the history and significance of pottery making in a variety of cultures throughout time.",

                "The hands-on components of this course are phenomenal. I loved working with Maishe and working with collections from the Peabody Museum. It would have been cool to have done some pXRF as well, since the department has access to that. The readings selected were interesting, but conversations were a bit lacking. I wish my classmates had been more engaged in the group discussions, but I don't think that is directly an issue with the class itself.",
                "The first third of the class was great because we worked with a professional potter for a number of weeks, creating vessels that we had begun to study. That was really fun. Looking at ceramics that had already been found and already been studied, and being asked to measure them and other small observations about them was not interesting. Studying the sherds was difficult and felt like busy work.",
                "This course's best components were the hands-on work and analysis we did, along with the weekly class discussions and the time spent making our pot. All of these components interacted with the readings to make my learning better!",
                "Strengths: Anne Underhill is the nicest professor I've ever had. She is definitely one of the biggest strengths of the course. She always has a smile on her face and is supportive of and enthusiastic about the comments students make. The hands-on exercises are also an amazing aspect of the course--they are so engaging and I feel I learned so much through them. I learned a lot with the final research paper too. I liked that discussions were short and more time was spent on other aspects of the class. The readings were sometimes dense, but were ultimately manageable. Weaknesses: I felt the exercises would have been better as individual rather than group projects. Coordinating with someone else creates a lot of stress and sometimes workloads are not distributed evenly among two people.",
                "Professor Underhill is an amazing professor. She cares so deeply about her students and is incredibly knowledgeable. The readings are interesting and I always look forward to her lessons. She also gives helpful feedback on assignments and always makes herself available to students if they have any questions.",
                "The level engagement required for the course was its biggest strength. Whenever I came to class, I knew there was something to be done and something to be learned during the process."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Underhill is phenomenal, and the material is fascinating. I am a non-major who just happens to love archaeology, and this was the perfect class for me. I highly recommend taking both this and Analysis of Lithics Technology if you are interested in having hands-on introductions to very cool archaeology concepts.",
                "I would recommend this if you're going to Credit/D it. I didn't do much work for it, unfortunately. It was only interesting at the beginning and then I really lost the thread of what the class was trying to do. The in class conversations were very very boring because we were just answering questions that student seminar facilitators came up with every week. Just felt like we were taking an oral exam every class.",
                "I would! It is a great and accessible archaeology course that was very interesting and dynamic throughout.",
                "Yes, absolutely. The whole class is just a really fascinating experience. You get the chance to throw, coil and decorate pottery and to analyze ancient sherds through a microscope. Whether archaeology is related to your area of study or not, this class will be a great experience.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Underhill is wonderful and I was learning effortlessly throughout the semester. I would highly recommend this class- having Maishe come in and help us create our own vessels was a highlight and Im grateful to Professor Underhill for putting in the effort to coordinate that, since it definitely a lot of work on her part.",
