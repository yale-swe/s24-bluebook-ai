Only complaint is that the course was a little disorganized at times -- the instructions were never super clear and often it seemed like what was written on canvas was different than what was said in class and the deadlines for projects were unclear.",

If you like doing art during the day it is totally worth getting into one of these sections. Note, though, that drawing and art takes a lot of time and that despite this being my \"easiest\" class this semester, it definitely took up the most of my time.",

I was not really expecting to learn practical art techniques through remote class in the beginning of the semester, but I leaned so much from this class. The professor is very nice and flexible. I really appreciated her help throughout the semester."
