    "My Chinese fluency has definitely improved because of this class and I am so grateful for it. I learned a lot more about the Chinese culture, about Chinese lifestyles, and the Chinese language. I am more comfortable speaking Chinese now.",
    "I connected with myself, my family,, and my culture. This is the most impactful course of my time at Yale.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - Liu Laoshi was the best, class was so productive and fun\r\nWeakness - Sometimes homework took a very long time",
    "Strengths - comprehensive, in depth \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - a lot of course material, really need to dedicate time to grasp it all",
    "The structure of this course pretty good and definitely facilitated student feedback and learning. More discussions would have been great.",
    "Strengths\r\n- Wide variety of teaching techniques\r\n- Very speaking heavy\r\n- Forces you to apply concepts on challenging homework, essays, and tests",
    "Strengths: Liu Laoshi's teaching, classmates who were very willing to learn, Chinese conversations in class, being pushed by Liu Laoshi to do better\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't gain that much from watching those Chinese movies - I feel like I could have succeeded in this class without watching those movies, especially because I didn't understand half of what I was watching and didn't feel like it was very useful. Maybe we could watch some movie clips in class and then talk about them, which would clarify things and help me learn better.\r\nThe textbook is also very old, and some of the information is outdated.",
    "Strengths - Liu Laoshi is amazing, like a second mother. She's critical but extremely kind, and constantly pushes you to become better at Chinese. Also, the students are fantastic. Imagine being in a class where everyone has the same mission - to be better for their own sake and the for their families, not for their careers. It's rare. And beautiful.\r\n\r\nWeakness - none. Just be prepared to put in quite a bit of work.",
    "Strengths are the teachers. Incredibly warm presences, very understanding of students and wonderful to interact with. Very thoughtful of maximizing student learning while not maximizing stress",
    "I think we could definitely use a larger variety of skills developmentfor example, if we practiced reading and correcting essays more, so that we get more practice on the skill of revision and spotting grammar mistakes the second time around. I think the class size is also a little large (12-13 people), so in discussions each person didn't have the chance to speak enough to really start improving our speech skills. Even in a larger class, discussion in smaller groups would have been useful so we each get more minutes talking, and that way we could also practice correcting each other."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Especially with Liu Laoshi, she is so great.",
    "Recommended if you want to learn to speak Chinese",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, very worth it to round out your 132+142 experience. I definitely feel more solid in my Chinese abilities, and I learned a lot about Chinese history and culture through our class discussions.",
    "Yes, if you really want to improve your Chinese skills, this is a great course to take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they have taken Chinese 132. It is an excellent extension to that class and you will continue to learn so much more and your Chinese will continue to follow the upward trend that many students experience in Chinese 132.",
    "Yes. Please - this is the most amazing class. Please take this class - to learn more about your heritage, your culture, your language, your family. This has opened up doors for me to reconnect with my family.",
    "Yes! Although sometimes it seems like a ton of work and youre not getting anywhere, the moments of realizing how much more you know how to say are so cool and worth every bit of struggle",
    "Yes!!!!! Heritage Chinese is such a rewarding experience."
