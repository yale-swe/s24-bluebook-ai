A lot of the topics are related to things that we as humans experience everyday, such as weather, and while there are also topics that are also more removed, like that of deep ocean circulation or plate tectonics, all still felt at least somewhat relevant.",

I learned how to think about atmosphere/oceans/climate in a quantitative way.",

                "The structure of the class was clearly thought out. Every piece seemed to fit together perfectly. The problem sets and tests worked well. Overall the class was great!\r\n\r\nThe only weakness is that sometimes some of the data can be intimidating when preparing for a test. Professor Lora did a good job emphasizing that data does not need to be memorized, but I personally found it hard to find the balance of taking the lesson from the data without knowing the data. I also would love to know why some of my answers on problem sets were wrong. Instead of individual feedback, the professor could just release an answer key afterward. That would definitely help!",
                "On the whole, this is a very strong classI felt like I learned a lot, and wasn't even challenged that much in the process. Lectures were clear and interesting, especially when they involved board-work; PSETs were helpful and very doable; and exams could be tough and were a bit of a time crunch, but if you studied a decent amount beforehand, you could definitely get a good grade. One weakness involved the textbook, I thinkwe were told to buy a $45  textbook, and while it did track pretty closely with the material throughout the first half of the course, because it didn't add much information, rather simply restated in more (and unnecessary, when it came to PSETs and exams) detail what was covered in lecture, and because it didn't have sections corresponding to the later units, I honestly think I would rather not have spent the money, and probably could have done just as well in the course without it.",
                "This class covers way too much material. I'm an engineering major, and I felt that this class covered way more than any of my engineering classes. The rate at which Professor Lora went through material was astonishing. It felt like he was always rushing, and there was no end to amount of information he wanted to go through. Professor Lora also kept saying that the goal of the class was not to memorize facts, but it definitely felt like we were expected to memorize facts. On the first exam, he asked us to recreate a diagram from memory that he taught for about 15 minutes. The equation sheet on the exams were also incredibly unhelpful. Instead of equations to answer the problems on the exam, there were constants and formulas we never learned and a bunch of other clutter. Sometimes, you had to know arbitrary constants as well, like how much of the Earth is covered in water, so it made you question whether your approach was right in the first place.",
                "There was extensive discussion on the topics of the class, but this also was a weakness as it was hard to know what I should focus on or what were the big ideas to understand when preparing for exams. More emphasis on that would help.",
                "This course could be improved if answer keys were provided for the psets and exams after their due date. Ive found that looking at past answer keys in other stem classes helps me determine what exactly the professor is looking for, and makes it easier to study.",
                "Prof. Lora is a wonderful professor! Lots of interesting topics covered in class.",
                "The class covers a lot of material without going into a lot of the math past algebra which was nice. The content was presented in a relatively digest-able way. I think a weakness of the course was that a lot of the quantitative work was done on a whiteboard but then not posted. Even though I attended most of the lectures, it would have been nice to have a more organized set of class slides/notes.",
                "Answer keys for the problem sets should be provided",
                "Overall, it was quite good. One negative was that the equations were sometimes given in an odd form on the exam (a form different than that given in lecture). Eventually they could be figured out, but it was a little stressful when taking the test. Also, the tests were maybe a touch long, especially towards the beginning of the semester. Otherwise, I thought the class was nice. The information was interesting and Dr. Lora's lectures were all clear and interesting.",
                "Strengths: good intro background\r\nImprovement: textbook reading and posting of slides was unclear and delayed",
                "I thought the virtual whiteboard classes helped to solidify important concepts, and the PowerPoint lecture courses were a little dull at some points",
                "strengths: well-organized, wholistic, brings up relevant current issues\r\nweaknesses: not very engaging",
                "Strengths: pretty thorough instruction, psets applied lecture material very well, exams were fair and reasonable; course was organized well for solid learning\r\nWeaknesses: pressure to turn on cameras and at an early time (9:25 am)\r\nBoth: lower-than-usual engagement (allows for more independent learning but less structured learning/less beneficial if greater engagement is desired)"

                "This was the only remote class I took this semester that involved synchronous board-work, as opposed to simply lecture slides, and this was massively helpful to keeping me focused and engaged under the online circumstances. Because Professor Lora was actually explaining content while writing it, you were forced to pay attention to both his words and his written notes, and given that he was writing at the same time, I wasn't completely rushing to jot down everything as I was in many lecture-based classes. When the class became more slide-based, particularly towards its end, I definitely noticed that I was less engaged than I had been. On the whole though, this was one of the best online courses I took.",

                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this class to everyone! I think the fundamentals learned in this class are extremely interesting and gives a greater understanding of the world we live in.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, both for those who need to take it for their major and for those who don't. Perhaps it's the environmental scientist in me, but the topics covered were genuinely interesting and teach you a lot about phenomena that people are generally in contact with every day but really don't know much about, when it comes down to it (like weather, for instance). Not to mention, the topics feel pertinent and even necessary, given the changing climate. Furthermore, I would even go so far as to recommend this to those people who fear all things math- and science-related; for a class that fulfills a QR/Sc credit, the computation element of the course is almost remarkably easy. I haven't heard of this class being on anyone's radar as a good science class for non-science people to take, but I would absolutely recommend it for anyone who's trying to get a QR or Sc credit out of the way and also learn some interesting and relevant content along the way.",
                "Unless you have to take this class, I would avoid it. I thought this was going to be a math-heavy class, but that was definitely not the case. The class was way more qualitative than quantitative, and there were too many random facts we had to memorize. Professor Lora also kept telling us to read the textbook, but the textbook was overpriced without a PDF version, so I ended up just not getting one. You probably should get the textbook if you intend to take this class seriously because Professor Lora will go through the material so fast, you won't actually have time to learn it. In the end, you probably can't get worse than a B, but there are also much better classes at Yale that you could take (even for the science requirement).",

                "Yes, this class really turns the wheels in your head without the headache part because the prereq. for the math portion is just algebra. It got me thinking about how natural processes worked the way they did. Overall, super valuable and interesting knowledge to have.",
                "This should not be treated as a science gut class. Take it for the major or if you're really interested in the material, otherwise it will be challenging.",
                "I would recommend it, especially if you're interested in the atmosphere and oceans. It has a bit of physics and equations involved, but it isn't that bad and there's lots that we learned without math. It was pretty interesting to learn about the things that we see every day (storms, dew point, etc). Dr. Lora was very nice and explains things quite well, so I'd recommend it if it interests you at all.",
