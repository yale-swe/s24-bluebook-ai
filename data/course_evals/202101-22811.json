You'll better understand your body and the general human body, and you'll develop a better socio-cultural framework for biological studies.\r\n\r\nYou also meditate before each class and the course structure/class community will show you what it means for a professor and course to care about your health and learning.",

                "Strengths:\r\nClaudia is EXCELLENT. I would take any class with her, and I'm an English major! The syllabus is so excellently balanced to be challenging/engaging while still manageable. A lot of introspective assignments, flexibility, etc. Super well organized for people of all levels of scientific study. Everything you could want in a science credit. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nHard to get into! Took me several tries and a lot of begging. Good and accessible science credits are SO NECESSARY so Yale should work to make sure that teachers like Claudia can teach multiple sections or teach others how to teach like them so we can have more classes like this.",
                "strengths: the professor; content was very relevant and interesting; discussions were very open and judgement-free\r\nweaknesses: none!",
                "Professor Valeggia is amazing- she made this class one of my favorites.",
                "They are all strengths.  I LOVE Claudia.  She is unique in that she respects the student and creates a collaborative and inclusive learning environment.  She pushes her students to think critically, while engaging with the world and each other.",
                "Strengths is definitely Professor Valeggia. She's amazing",
                "This was an excellent and engaging course. The readings supported lecture material very well and were enjoyable, the class community was outstanding. Overall, am an outstanding course.",
                "This is the best course I have taken at Yale by far! \r\nStrengths: I learned so much about the female human body and reproductive and women's healthcare across many different cultures. I also learned about the inadequacies of women's healthcare in the US today and many of the problems that need to be addressed still. Professor Valeggia is the best professor and made the space welcoming and inviting. She had us do a 5 min meditation at the start of each class to ground us and prepare us for the class ahead. The final project is really open and creative which allowed for students' to express individual and unique perspectives about what they learned in the course. Students led the discussion each week which provided a myriad of different perspectives as the starting point for each topic. \r\nWeaknesses: There was a good amount of reading that didn't end up getting discussed because there were so many interesting topics to talk about. This made doing some of the reading a chore because it wasn't discussed at all.",
                "Honestly no weaknesses. Despite being a virtual class this was one of the best classes Ive taken at Yale - the Monday lecture and Wednesday discussion was a good format, I greatly appreciated the 5 min meditation sessions, and the readings and content were interesting!",
                "Strengths: This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale--Claudia and my peers were wonderful and I felt like I learned so much about female bodies and reproduction. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: NONE",
                "Dr. V is honestly one of the greatest strengths of this course, she is just a wonderful professor and so understanding. She knows the material like the back of her hand but still values hearing our perspectives and ideas. I don't think there are any weaknesses in this course, I think everyone should take this class.",
                "Strengths: Important coursework, easily relevant to your life, understanding professors, clear assignment due date structure, creative space to take your learning where you want it to go, useful life skills, inclusive to various backgrounds and various methods of learning... and more, it was an amazing course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Occasionally, the rubrics for assignments were a bit vague but easily clarified in the many office hours held for the class. No complaints other than that!",

This was very useful in reviewing tough information or clarifying any course material confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nWednesdays were live seminars in small and large groups, this was great and probably the best format of any of my online courses so far.

I really got to know the other students in the class as well as my own body. The class environment was so warm and inviting, and I feel like I \"walked out\" of the class with so much knowledge and many new connections. Even if you're just looking to learn a bit more about menstruation or birth control or pregnancy, you will not regret this class. I am not a STEM-oriented person, and even though a few of the readings might have been confusing, the assignments were definitely doable, and for the final project, Dr. V allowed us to choose our own topics and mediums. Definitely a highlight of the semester!",

If the content is not applicable to your biology, take it to learn the nuances and sensitivity that these conversations require. Educate yourself so that you can go out in the world and help contribute to a society that is open and understanding to the lives of female-bodied people.",
