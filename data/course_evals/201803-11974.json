    "I improved all aspects of my Spanish knowledge-- writing, speaking, listening.",
    "Most of this reviewed content from L2 Spanish, but did so in a way that was much more understandable.",
    "I learned a ton of grammar. I also became a lot more comfortable reading and understanding long and more difficult texts in Spanish.",
    "My ability to speak and read Spanish definitely improved. It was very helpful to have the review of my first two semesters of Spanish and apply that knowledge to the books we read and movies we watched. It was nice to have daily practice speaking and reading Spanish.",
    "I learned Spanish grammar and vocabulary. There was some engagement with Spanish culture.",
    "OMG! I'm not exaggerating by saying that my Spanish improved exponentially by taking this course.",
    "I learned how to control my Spanish that I had developed already much better, while also expanding on it",
    "improved my grammar and vocabulary, furthered my speaking and writing abilities, reading comprehension",

   "comments": [
    "Very good course-- has the perfect amount of homework and all of it is helpful and relevant.",
    "Professor Reymundi was definitely an asset for the course. It could have been improved by including more relevant\/realistic to read texts for the lecturas. Also the quizzes were an unreasonably hard compared to the other assignments.",
    "This course was heavily focused on grammar. I certainly learned a lot of grammar, but I wish it wasn't quite so rooted in the textbook. I liked the end of the course a lot, in which we read a book and watched a movie. I felt like my ability to read texts definitely improved.",
    "This class is just a ton of mundane work. The major strength was the instruction from Professor Reymundi, but be prepared for constant assignments, many of which feel minimally helpful. I will be an anti-Supersite evangelical until the day I die.",
    "Strengths: speaking in Spanish every day, grammar lessons, reading and writing in Spanish\r\nWeaknesses: too few opportunities to practice speaking and listening in Spanish",
    "The professor was absolutely amazing! She was a major strength of the course. I think one of the weaknesses of the course is that some of the readings were extensively long. But other than that, the overall course was great.",
    "I think we could spend a little more time on the bigger sources we've read but other than that everything else is strong",
    "Strengths: variety of assignments, covers a lot of material, very few peaks in work\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes speeds through lessons and material, requires constant attention and work, homework was not always helpful",
    "I think the course does well in building on one's grammar. However, I think that often times the work can prove overwhelming.",
    "strong that it was well taught, had to come to class and engage every day, could be improved with better readings or unnecessary work"

   "comments": [
    "Yep! Great teacher and great information. Very clear instruction",
    "Based on earlier experiences with the this department, I wouldn't try to do Spanish here for your language requirement. However, Professor Reymundi definitely made the experience better, so if you have to take it, try to do so with her.",
    "I recommend this course if you want to improve your grammar and your ability to read long texts in Spanish. It was certainly a bit tedious at times, but I definitely improved overall. I'd recommend taking it over L1 of a new language if you placed into L3 Spanish. If you do the work and study for the tests, you should get a good grade.",
    "Yes, I think I still would despite my reservations. My Spanish has certainly improved, and because this is the only way Yale offers to get better at Spanish at this level, if you're looking to learn the language I'd take this course.",
    "Yes, especially if you want to improve your Spanish",
    "Yes! If you're looking to improve your Spanish and read\/speak\/listen at a high level, then this class is for you.",
    "Yes",
    "If you are trying to fulfill a language requirement, then take this course. The course is very dependent on the professor, though. I really liked my professor so class was often engaging and interesting.",
    "Yes, for students who are looking to improve their understandings of Spanish I think this is a great course if you are willing to put in the work.",
    "yes for span 3 but it was a lot of work and would not recommend if they didn't have time to put in more work than they would expect."
