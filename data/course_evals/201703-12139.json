    "I learned so much about how different people see things differently in the world in terms of religion and the Prophet Muhammad specifically. this class taught me how to use text to back up an argument and how to combat ideas that I oppose with class and respect. This is also the first discussion class I had at Yale and the way the discussions flowed so easily helped me to understand how a proper discussion is supposed to go.",
    "I was able to learn about different representations of the Prophet Muhammad, and why he is such an important figure for Islam, but a polarizing figure for the rest of the world. We were able to learn about how different groups of Muslims viewed the Prophet, and how non-Muslims and polemics viewed him, and the culture clash between Islam and the West.",
    "I vastly improved my writing skills and passage analysis skills in reading complicated and lengthy (but interesting!) works."

   "comments": [
    "I loved how the texts, professor, and class were so engaging. The course gave so much knowledge in such little time. Bringing in more religious texts like the Quran's representation of Muhammad could be very useful but overall, the class showed a lot of representations and explained why they existed and why they no longer exist so ubiquitously.",
    "The class was very intimate. There were only 5 students so we were able to delve deep into readings and have very interesting class discussions.",
    "I really enjoyed the small class size, and our field trips to the Beinecke. Professor Zadeh is very knowledgeable and an amazing teacher. I learned vast amounts in this class, and it sparked my interest in the Middle East even further.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness of this class is that it covers a broad amount of material in a short time. Each individual class could be made into a semester long course! I would have loved to delve deeper into some of the material."

    "YES. this class was so fun, informative, and interesting. If you want to learn about freedom of speech, blasphemy, and religion-- this class is for you. Certainly one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend.",
    "Yes. Great freshman seminar.",
    "Yes! It was a fantastic class! I learned a lot, and was constantly engaged and pushed to do my best. Professor Zadeh provides excellent feedback, and so I know that I improved vastly."
