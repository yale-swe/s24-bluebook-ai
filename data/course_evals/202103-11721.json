                "I learned about climatic disasters, some instances of societal collapse in early history and how climate played a role, instances of cultures trying to control climate for certain purposes, environmental determinism, climate theory, non-western views of climate, how weather hypothetically affects the development of culture and personality, ethnometeorology, emic vs. etic views of climate, and how climate is intertwined with migration in rural Guatemala. I learned about some anthropological terms, like flow, friction, emic, etic, environmental determinism. I learned about some schools of philosophical thought in anthropology. I also learned how to structure and write an extensive research paper.",
                "I gained a better insight into analyzing climate's role in society beyond a Western perspective. We thought critically about all of the pieces we read, acknowledging the biases and perspectives from which they were written. Overall, I came away with a much broader knowledge of how climate affects society in all of its aspects: day to day weather, seasons, extreme events, etc.",
                "Through this course I learned about the various ways to examine the relationship between climate and society. I also learned that I had the ability to write a 25 page paper."

            "comments": [
                "This course definitely has a lot of interesting readings and exposed me to new ways of thinking about nature and culture. Professor Dove is incredibly knowledgeable and his lectures always connected the readings in a really interesting way. Another major strength was that the course format (discussion) was flexible throughout the semester and often changed to best facilitate student conversation. The final project is quite hefty, and although there were some deadlines throughout the semester to help us produce the paper, I think more guidance could have been useful. Perhaps adding a deadline to submit an outline would be most useful because the jump from abstract--> paper felt quite large.",
                "I liked that students were able to lead discussion every week; these discussions were always really engaging and led to new ideas being developed and challenged. However, since students were also expected to present on the readings in addition to Professor Dove's lectures, the time left for discussion was sometimes too short. Allocating more time for these discussions would have improved my engagement in the class and allowed us to interact more with our peers.",
                "I enjoyed the lectures; Professor Dove did a great job tying modern events, politics, and even casual Internet discourse into the topics each week. He usually kept me pretty engaged during class. I know this is supposed to be a graduate level course, but I'd like to see the format of the course changed in the future. Smaller papers seem like they might be more meaningful and easier to connect to what we learn in class, as opposed to writing a giant paper at the end on pretty much any topic (not necessarily even having to do with climate or society). I also would have liked to do more of the reading response mini-papers instead of the large final paper, since the reading responses were more fun and actually forced me to do the readings. \r\nOverall, I thought this course was very interesting, but it isn't very friendly to non-anthropology majors or those who have no background in philosophy. Many of the class discussions devolved into debating anthropological philosophy, which I didn't really enjoy and didn't expect from this course. A little more of class time should be spent opening up the room for discussion, or Professor Dove should ask students more questions during his lecture time.\r\nI would have liked to get more feedback on my writing, especially for the reading responses. I don't think I was taught much about writing from this course, although it was a good opportunity to practice.",
                "The course has a very passionate professor, Professor Dove, and has a very large range of topics. There is not much room for discussion, which I believe would have been helpful for some of the more complicated readings. I think the class could also be set up in a way that would promote more discussion during the lecture portion itself, as opposed to saving the large majority of it for the end. The office hours were something I never figured out how to sign up for, and the slots were put at a difficult time to attend (Friday evenings, when a lot of club and sports events were happening).",
                "This course had very interesting readings and the potential for interesting discussions. Unfortunately, there was very little time set aside for discussion and the discussion was usually monopolized by a select few. Additionally, contrary to what the syllabus said, there was very little guidance for writing the long final paper until the week before it was due."

                "I would recommend this class because the content really is quite interesting and Professor Dove is great. I've never written a 30 page paper before so that was definitely a good experience, though I think the class would benefit from more guidance.",
                "I can't say I'd recommend it to undergraduates. Around half of the students in the course were MEM students at the School of the Environment, and the course felt like more of a graduate course because the main assignment (worth 50%) is a 25-page \"paper\" (more like a mini thesis) due at the end of the semester. I did find that the class wasn't much work besides that paper, and some of the readings are really cool. There's a lot of variation in the readings and topics covered, and towards the latter half of the course, most of our class discussions ended in a philosophical debate, which often went over my head. Take the class if you're interested in anthropological philosophy (not environmental studies), climate crises, and humans' philosophical relationship with weather and climate, and if you want to write a big research paper.",
                "I would recommend this course for an intersectional look at climate and society throughout time. It helped me gain the perspective I need to continue reading and researching climate today, especially when considering the influence of Western science.",
                "I would recommend this course if you have a topic that you are excited to write a 25-30 page paper on. There is also really interesting readings and the potential for great discussions, depending on who is in the class."
