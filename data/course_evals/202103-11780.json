I appreciated the technicality of this class; we really dove into the small details of a reading / passage to more fully understand it. I also thought our class discussions were always lively and insightful, and I enjoyed everyone's consistent participation.",
                "This was probably the best English class I've ever taken. Really helped me become a better close reader, especially with poetry. Thought about how texts connected with each other and the world.",
                "This course offers a wide array of American Literature, curated by the individual professor. I felt that this course offered both some understanding of the canon, but more importantly, an understanding of what a broader definition of American literature entails. The authors were diverse in time period, race, and writing style. The course offered a dive into the lives and writing styles of myriad authors in a way that felt meaningful and manageable.",
                "Close reading, discussion, the duality of literature.",
                "Having never taken a discussion-based class before, I learned a lot about how to engage in meaningful discussion in class. I also learned how to write in a completely different style than I was used to in which I was free to interpret the readings as I pleased as long as I could make a valid argument about them. There was no right or wrong answer when analyzing a reading, which was scary at first.",
                "Throughout this course, I learned to analyze a broad variety of texts from different eras of American literature. I learned to engage in close-readings of these texts and share my interpretation through student-led discussions.",
                "I improved upon my skill for close reading as well as contextualizing a given text within its specific time or place.",
                "A better grasp on many foundational works within American literature. Not all encompassing, but well worth the time.",
                "I loved every single class I had this semester with Professor Mitchell. The syllabus was incredible and the class discussions were fruitful and interesting. I definitely got a wide survey of American Literature and American authors and I loved hearing my classmates' and Professor Mitchell's insights about the literature and about the authors.",
                "I feel like I really learned how to analyze poetry and passages very closely and also be attuned to the emotional impact of the pieces."

            "comments": [
                "One of the biggest strengths to me was the diversity in the curriculum. We read so many wonderful authors I had never heard of before, and many of them helped broaden my idea of what American Literature is. I appreciated this attention to often-overlooked voices, particularly those of women, people of color, and queer authors. I think a weakness of this course was, honestly, Moby Dick. I didn't like the book that much and wished we could have devoted those three weeks to exploring other texts that I think could still serve to nuance and enhance our understanding of the American canon.",
                "The first strength has to be Prof. Mitchell. He is a gem. Runs a class so well to facilitate discussion, is very kind and understanding and also wicked smart. He also felt very real and actively engaged with what the students were sharing. Another strength has to be the syllabus. All the books were really great. Only weakness might be that essays didn't come back very quickly so it was hard to get feedback.",
                "The course makes literature, something I've often struggled to fully engage with, manageable and interesting. The discussions helped break down complicated texts and show the connection between texts and historical realities and then connect back to modern day. Professor Mitchell was deeply kind and thoughtful and cared so much about the class atmosphere that he created. No real weaknesses! Moby Dick and the poetry at during the first unit can be a little tedious, but the class discussions helped liven up the reading.",
                "Strengths: very involved and engaging discussions",
                "Strengths: The class had a very welcoming environment that made participating easy and fun, something that Professor Mitchell primarily aided in creating. Everyone actively participated because we genuinely wanted to add onto each other's ideas. \r\nWeakness: We did not receive feedback on the first and second essays in time for the next one, which was frustrating since we did not know how to improve our writing for the next paper. We only received a final grade on the first essay before the end of the semester. This was frustrating because we were told we would receive feedback on the second essay before the third one was due, but we never did. Overall, I'd say this class could incorporate much more feedback to allow students to improve their writing.",
                "A strength of this course is that it promotes engagement through student-led discussions. There is a lot of flexibility regarding deadlines and extensions. In addition, diverse viewpoints were represented across the selected texts.",
                "I absolutely loved this course and didn't really find much not to like about it. At times it was a bit cramped but otherwise great!",
                "The structure of seminar could be a little better prefaced. I think the intentionality behind seminar wasn't fully realized until weeks into the course. However, the discussions were always interesting and the course allowed for us all to gain new understandings following discussions.",
                "I loved the entire syllabus and all of the class discussions and structure to the class. I wish we had more papers/more opportunity for feedback in this class",
                "Strengths: The pieces we read were really cool, not a single one I didn't like. Prof Mitchell was amazing and helped facilitate good discussions. I feel like we were given more freedom to write our papers which was really refreshing and challenging.\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been nice to get more feedback in a more timely manner so we use it for next papers."

                "Definitely! Caveat though; I shopped the class with another professor and found it pretty dry. Professor Mitchell makes the text really come alive though and cares so incredibly deeply about his students it's hard not to be caught up in his passion for the texts. Additionally, his syllabus is particularly diverse in terms of time period, race, gender, and writing style. Great class discussions and interesting readings that just got better as the semester went on.",
                "YES! Prof. Mitchell is a great speaker and a great professor to have when you're just starting Yale and nervous about contributing to an English class.",
                "If you want to take a class because you like reading, poetry, and writing, yes take this class. If you are looking for an intro writing class with feedback to improve your writing however, I do not recommend this course. Engl 120 sounds like a much better option for developing writing skills.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who wish to be introduced to the many types of texts in the canon of American literature. I would also recommend this course for those who wish to strengthen their writing skills.",
                "Absolutely! This course was incredible and extremely helpful for those interested in the specific texts or in just improving their literary abilities.",
                "I would absolutelywith Professor Mitchell. His warmth is evident throughout the course, and he takes great care in his handling of the course materials. It would be hard to do badly with such a phenomenal professor.",
                "Yes! For English majors and American Studies majors and everyone else-- the syllabus is great and Professor Mitchell is a wonderful professor who leads some amazing class discussions. This class was probably my favorite this semester-- I always left class feeling like we could have continued the discussion for another two hours.",
                "YES! I absolutely LOVED this class. Prof Mitchell was incredible, the books/poems we read were amazing and the discussions in class were very helpful. One of my favorite courses ever."
