More importantly than the content, however, the dynamic, deeply thought-provoking and engaging discussions during class taught me how to think, write, question like a philosopher. I will take what I have learned in this class with me for the rest of Yale and beyond.",

                "The course's primary strengths are the dynamically compiled syllabus with a diverse selection of complementary works, the excellent instruction and guidance of Professor Charles, and the engaging class environment which fostered challenging group discussions. As far as weaknesses, I can only say that at times I felt as though the readings went over my head--that said, Professor Charles was always available to meet after class or at office hours, and did a great job at clearing up any confusion.",
                "The Aristotelian and Neo-Aristotelian weeks were simply much more engaging (despite my own preferences) than the weeks we focused on theatre or aesthetic theory, as the class was strongest when we discussed topics that were of personal interest to Professor Charles. The class really depends on Professor Charles seminar leadership. It is truly spectacular. His ability to connect every comment to the strands of argument he wants to pursue is uncanny. That said, when he didnt have a clear argument to put forward we did have more of a tendency to sputter.",
                "I think the course would benefit from a more robust intro to the Aristotelian background.",
                "I wouldve liked to have had a set list of readings rather than deciding what we would read along the course. But I enjoyed reading literature in a philosophy course.",
                "The course was very engaging and the focus on class discussion and prepared questions meant that everyone came to class with interesting thoughts and observations. I also enjoyed the freedom given to us in terms of choosing our paper topics.",

                "Yes, absolutely. Apart from becoming well-versed in the Attic and Ancient Greek philosophical traditions--as well as becoming acquainted with various other philosophical ideas over the course of the semester--what this class teaches best is how ask the right questions, construct a compelling argument, and think deeply about philosophical questions in a way that is important for both academic discourse and living a good life.",
                "If you like in-depth discussions about the nature of happiness and how quickly tragedy can ruin everything, this class is for you! A really interesting class focused on how various theories of human happiness hold up in tragic circumstances.",
                "Absolutely. Take any class with Professor Charles that you can. He is extraordinarily kind, and he invests a lot of time into his students. He reworked the schedule multiple times and routinely offered extra office hours to help us in the course. He is very receptive to feedback, and you can tell how much he cares about the course. Not to mention that he also a world expert on Aristotle.",
                "Absolutely! This was, in my opinion, the best philosophy class that I've taken. We discuss not just the texts but also trying to fit the texts within a broader concept scope and trying to answer fundamental questions about happiness and what makes life worth living.",
                "I think the course is fantastic for students of contemporary philosophy, especially those interested in ethics or more broadly the analytic school. That said I dont think the course is particularly well suited to students of theatre or aesthetics, or even students who are interested in less Aristotelian notions of ethics.",
                "Would 100% recommend any course with Prof. David Charles, if you are in any field remotely related to Philosophy at all. At least take one course with him",
