I learned a lot about the workings of energy grids, the most important modern and future energy sources, how institutions from Yale to the country of China are modifying their energy usage over time, and practical constraints of the global transition from fossil fuels (moving to renewables is a lot harder than it sounds).",

                "Strengths: Michael is super knowledgable, it's really great to have a professor who has the answer to every question. Lectures went into a lot of detail but we weren't expected to memorize everything said, but just the overall themes.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Because we don't need to know every detail, I felt like I didn't need to pay 100% attention-perhaps just due to my ADHD or Zoom fatigue, but I wish I could've retained more of the knowledge we were being presented.",
                "Strengths: all of the assignments were very interesting, they were all designed to encourage original thought and analysis, which made it a really effective way to learn the material. Professor Oristaglio is also extremely knowledgeable and put a lot of time and effort in the class, which made the whole experience really great!! He is clearly very passionate about the topic as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I dont feel like I got much use out of the readings. There was not a lot of discussion time or place to express our thoughts about them.",
                "Great course.  It would be a little better with a little more of a seminar feel, which I realize was much, much tougher over zoom than if the class was in person.",
                "A strength of this courses as that it allowed me to engage in energy-related topics without the stress of timed exams since our midterm and final were essay-based. I think a weakness was that the topics were very broad and we were not incentivized to retain that information since our midterm\/final did not necessarily rely on it.",
                "Well-structured course on a multitude of topics pertaining to energy. The course readings were dense, but that is to be expected given the material. I would have liked to learn more about carbon capture, as this, among other topics was crammed into the last meeting of the course.",
                "Strengths - fun group activities like the electricity market bid. Oristaglio is a great guy, clearly very knowledgeable and always wants to help his students, and pretty low workload. Weaknesses - not a very engaging seminar. Felt more like a lecture and it felt like some of the topics could have been better distributed. For example, we spent many many weeks on the geoscience behind different resources and crammed a lot of important topics and countries together at the end. I thought that we were going to discuss different countries or regions every week based on the original syllabus, but it changed over the semester and we pretty much only spent 2-3 classes discussing a few countries.",
                "This course was extremely well taught and comprehensive. My only wish is that it could meet more often instead of the one lecture a week.",
                "I think the material is very interesting and Prof. Oristaglio is very knowledgeable. I think the course could be made more engaging with more discussions, but it was hard over zoom.",
                "Strengths - you get to know some classmates in energy studies through several group projects; Prof. Oristaglio is always willing to discuss whatever topic is of interest to the class. Weaknesses - some lectures can get pretty slow\/dry especially if you already have a general foundation in energy topics, but then again this course is meant to fill in the gaps and be a foundation.  This was also the first time the course was taught I think, so it will probably continue to become more organized."

If you want a survey class to learn more about the energy sector and to determine which youre most interested in, definitely take it. The assignments, such as the energy market bidding assignment, are lots of fun to complete as well",
                "100% yes.  Great for understanding the foundation of energy as well as the worlds transition to green energy.",
                "I think this a good 5th class to take or if you want an introduction into the energy sector and its possible trajectories over the coming decades. I certainly learned a lot since this class goes more in depth than what is talked about during a casual energy-related discourse. I think this class is one of those \"you get out what you put into it\" classes. Therefore, you can easily pass this class without paying attention in lecture but obviously that would be a complete waste of your time since the topics you could learn about are super important.",
