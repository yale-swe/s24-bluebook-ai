I would definitely suggest taking the notes on a laptop. You really spend a lot of time on the initial development of the trans Atlantic slave trade and racism as an ideology, and then move through the development of the institution through the American and Haitian revolutions.\r\nDefinitely worth it if you arent a AFAM or history major but are interested in this topic. I am an EP&E Major and I left this class with a very satisfied feeling that I had actually learned a lot.",
                "Foundational knowledge of Atlantic Slavery, interesting background regarding revolutions/attempted uprisings of the enslaved.",

                "I developed an in-depth understanding on the origins of slavery. I learned how to write very well responding to primary source documents.",

                "I would have appreciated some discussion/awareness of positionality in a course about slavery taught by a white instructor and 2 white TFs. I think its important to have a Black person in the course leadership    as well.",
                "Sometimes it was difficult to understand the course material and gaps within my comprehension of the course material hindered my comprehension ( although not greatly) of the course material.",
                "I thought that the material covered in AFAM 160 was interesting, varied, and well-relayed, and I appreciated the syllabus' blend of primary and secondary readings.",
                "Largely just strengths. Except Professor Rugemer had to work on the passing in some of the last lectures that seemed like they needed to cover too much info.",
                "Strengths: curriculum Is extremely useful and important for anyone studying history \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: little variety in lecture format, low engagement",
                "Discussion sections and reading were great. The primary sources for each of the essays were interesting and engaging. A few more materials for studying for test would be quite useful.",
                "Strengths: section, the lectures were pretty engaging, the exams were fair (the final was more fair than the midterm)\r\nWeaknesses: a LOT of content to cover; feel like the midterm and final study guides couldve had fewer terms, wouldve been nice to have a review session for the final during reading period",
                "The professor is incredibly invested in making course materials accessible & is interested in helping students who are involved with SAS accommodations. I really enjoyed his lecture style. He tells a story almost, and uses his voice as a tool of emphasis for the history he's teaching us. It makes lectures so engaging. It also helped so much when he stops to let us ask questions. Really enjoyed his class. I also really appreciated how willing he was to meet with students over office hours. Great class!\r\n\r\nImprovements: We didn't go over the primary source documents in class. He saved it for section discussion. I support that decision, but I would appreciate at least a few sentences in class on how he got the primary source documents, why he picked the one he picked, and how it relates to the topic of the week. Maybe even that can be added in the section class rather than full class, but more explanation on that is requested. Especially as we go on to our own future research and figuring out what to look for when looking at primary source documents.",
                "Three papers and two tests was a bit excessive. If there were two papers and two tests I would've gotten more out of the class. A strength was that we could revise our papers.",
                "Strengths: Content\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were no resources for exams outside of lecture. If you were sick and misses a lecture, there was no way to learn about the information taught. This made studying for exams very difficult because the list of terms given for the study guide had no information connecting to them. It was hard to know what should have been reflected for each term.",
                "Learning about Atlantic slavery as a whole is a hefty and dense subject matter. Due to the influx of information, I found it hard to keep events in the United States, Haiti, Cuba, Brazil, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, etc. straight in my mind. I'm not sure what the solution to this would be but I think it could potentially be organized differently. The handouts help a lot though!"
