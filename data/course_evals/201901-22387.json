    "The strengths are the title of the class and 2 of the books you read.\r\nWeaknesses: the professor has no idea what he's talking about. the class is structured awfully - he talks for 1.5 hours and then tries to have a seminar discussion but no one has anything to say because what the professor said makes no sense. it's boring. the readings make no sense. also policing is messed up and that's not what the class is about?!?!?!?! it's not about whether or not policing is a valid way of keeping people safe... it's a bad class. also there were no assignments except for the final paper, which literally makes no sense and makes me nervous about my grade.",
    "Strengths: the ride along is a good idea and visitors (i.e. real police officers) were really interesting to talk to + it is a gut\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We did not have a single assignment except for the final paper due in May. We were not really given space to talk in class; the professor essentially lectured for 90% of the time. Because of this, our engagement was extremely low.",
    "This course was EXTREMELY disorganized. We had no written assignments before the final, and the expectations were entirely unclear. For being a seminar it shouldn't have been so lecture-heavy. Still, the readings were interesting and the guest speakers were great.",
    "Though the course was supposed to be a seminar, there was very little opportunity for deep discussion between the students. Though we were assigned about a book a week to read, we rarely did a deep dive into the material of the book. I think allowing for more structured discussion led by students would have been helpful. More assignments throughout the semester would have been helpful, as well. \r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the panel of female police officers at the end of the semester.",
    "The syllabus could be made clearer before the course begins so that it is less spur-of-the-moment and students can plan ahead.",
    "This course was ran as a lecture and not a seminar. It was really disappointing."

    "DONT TAKE THIS CLASS. It's really not worth it. The professor makes no sense and the readings are terrible. There were no assignments and I never got any feedback, so...... don't take this class. but it is easy.",
    "Probably not. It's not really worth your time. It takes no effort at all and very little time, so if you need a gut, go for it. However, you probably won't learn anything that you don't teach yourself.",
    "Unless Ture overhauls his teaching style or it is taken over by a different prof, no. The subject matter, however, was fascinating.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. I gained insight about discrimination and policing, as well as developing empathy and awareness.",
    "No. It was a lecture, not a seminar. \r\nHe asked us to go on ride along with policemen. It was poorly managed. I didn't get someone assigned until too late. The cop was rude and disrespectful. He did not have to put us in this situation especially when many of my classmates are of color."
