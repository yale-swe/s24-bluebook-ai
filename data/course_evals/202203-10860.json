                "I gained a broader, more complex perspective on imperialisms broadly and a de-centering of Europe's modern empires as the only form of empire that's important to study.",
                "This class strips the history of empire down to its component parts and questions each in depth. I learned to think critically about imperialism and its legacies, and about history as a process more generally. Like any history seminar, this course gave me valuable experience in designing and writing my own research paper.",
                "learned more about different examples of empires and imperialism",
                "I learned a great deal about the conceptualizations and practice of imperialism in the 19th and 20th centuries as well as in history overall. We did a lot of global contextualization and bouncing back between the specific and the general. My ability to discuss these concepts in a classroom of fellow well-read students was engaging and made me think more about how best to structure and convey my ideas about this subject matter.",
                "My most significant takeaway from this class was doing preparatory work and research for the final 25-page paper. It was a useful exercise and helped a lot with my approach to the senior essay."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: great breadth of what we studied, interesting readings from less-traditional authors like Adom Getachew\r\nWeaknesses: large class, a loud few people who always wanted to talk",
                "Strengths: class discussions were among the best I have ever had at Yale. No topic is off the table; students are willing to have their statements questioned and examined. The reading list is fantastic, and Prof. Westad is very skilled at navigating topics and guiding discussions to challenge students' thinking. \r\nWeaknesses: Prof. Westad was very content to let class discussions diverge significantly from the readings, which meant that some class discussions were completely detached from the common base of knowledge that students were expected to have. The reading load was more than I could handle in depth, but mostly did not require close reading.",
                "Strengths- Westad is a great instructor who asks engaging questions and makes it a really fun place to learn. \r\nWeakness- really difficult to engage in discussion if you don't have a background knowledge in empires and imperialism, it would be helpful to either assign a survey reading to be done before the course or have a prerequisite class that is a more general historical overview of the topics covered. i think the discussion would also benefit from a smaller class size",
                "I found the course to be super engaging and rewarding. The readings were consistently interesting and the discussions were always well led and productive. I think perhaps one place to improve is more clarity on expectations and guidelines for some of the assignments like the midterm paper. More procedural things like citation style and maybe some more prompting for the midterm to get an idea about what is looked for could be helpful. I also think more opportunities to discuss our final paper ideas within the class could be interesting to see where everybody wants to go in their own individual directions.",
                "The seminars are very interesting and the class is worth taking for professor Westads insights alone. Hes clearly extremely knowledgeable and personable, enabling very engaged discussion. \r\nI wasnt the biggest fan of the work assigned. The final was 25 pages, which is just far too many words to write for one class, and all the essays assigned were so open-ended that it made it difficult to apply the classs concepts to the assignments.",
                "The course is a broad survey of different empires and forms of imperialism from 1840 onward. Professor Westad gives a good job of arranging each week by theme/geographical region and exploring that theme with the class. In terms of weaknesses, some other students and I felt that the readings were too rudimentary and were not challenging enough. I did enjoy some of them and found some insightful; however, I felt that most of the pieces we read were simply describing historical events in a \"what happened,\" matter-of-fact way, and I already had some of the background knowledge so did not learn much as a result. I think a seminar about empires at Yale should assume some background knowledge already on the part of students; I do not know why the bar for undergraduate history seminars at Yale College is set so low these days. I would have appreciated a selection of readings that present an issue/controversy in the historiography, as that would have led to a more substantive discussion. The discussions themselves were also sometimes unproductive, with many overly eager juniors who like the sound of their own voice trying to dominate the discourse with no meaningful contribution.",
                "Strengths: breadth of material, Professor Westad, great readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the same 3-4 students tend to dominate every discussion. It would be worth soliciting comments from more students in the class"

                "If you want to learn about the history of empire in an honest and stimulating way, and are willing to do a significant amount of reading, take this class. I hope it is taught again!",
                "Yes if you are interested in the topic and have a background in it",
                "I would very strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in developing more understanding of imperialism as well as 19th and 20th century history overall. I had no idea how interconnected the world of anti-imperial resistance was nor about how much the different world empires played off of one another. Having a broader scope also meant that I had the great opportunity to synthesize knowledge from other classes. I will say that this class certainly would have been difficult earlier on in my academic career as you are definitely incentivized to come in with a strong breadth of knowledge of world history.",
                "I would recommend this course to students with little to no background in world imperial history. Those with some knowledge may be better served by a more specialized class or seminar.",
