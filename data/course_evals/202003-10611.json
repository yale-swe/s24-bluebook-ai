I also learned a lot about the historical epistemological and metaphysical arguments surrounding platonism and the nominalism (anti-platonism).

The student-run seminars were a bit tedious. Professor Shin did a good job integrating her ideas, but I would have liked a mix of discussions led by students and led by her.",
                "Sunjoo is incredible (as always). Writing the report for each weekly class was definitely a huge strength. The reading was manageable enough to let us really spend a good amount of time understanding, and the report somehow really aided in comprehension.",
                "I found the format of class very helpful in understanding the arguments in the text while still getting to have some really fun conversations about it. Students present the material during one class; this is very helpful because it causes students to become more familiar with a certain part of the course, which helps students find possible paper topics and become better thinkers.",
                "Having every student lead a particular seminar each week was a unique way to keep the class engaging. It did feel that we rushed through a lot of material, without going too in-depth with any particular topic (outside of the research paper)",
                "Prof. Shin is a great teacher and the course covers really fascinating material.  But the structure of presentations every week and little discussion made it in my opinion less productive than it could have been had we gotten either more lecturing from the professor or more seminar discussion.",
                "The material covered in the course and Professor Shin's comments were great. I think the course could be improved by having more discussion between students. This was hard this semester, given that class was online."

                "Incredible class that gave me a sense of the greatest minds in mathematics and philosophy. Most of the workload involves reading a paper once a week and discussing it in class. These papers range from the 1700s to the 1960s and were mostly really easy to follow and discuss. The seminar format really optimized learning while not requiring a great deal of outside work. That being said, the final 15 page paper was difficult and I hope the grading will be fair. I got the majority of it done over Thanksgiving and would I highly recommend getting an early start. Prof. Shin is amazing and is willing to work with students in crafting their argument, and the personal feedback we received on the weekly reading reports was very much appreciated.",
                "Yes, though I will note that it is an upper-level seminar, and should be treated as such. As somewhat of a beginner in the discipline, there were moments I was confused and a bit intimidated to ask questions.",
                "Yes, definitely. You should take any course offered by Sunjoo. This class was a great introduction to the philosophy of mathematics, and I believe that the topics covered are pretty canonical.",
                "Absolutely! If you like math and like thinking about the more philosophical side of things, this course is for you. The material is super interesting and will probably change how you think about mathematics. Professor Shin is very kind and knows all about the subjects covered. She makes the discussions fun and provides a lot of useful, and interesting, insights into the material. Some of the material may be a bit hard to understand at first if you aren't already familiar with general philosophy terminology, e.g. \"epistemological,\" \"ontological,\" etc. Familiarity with mathematical proofs is not necessarily needed but will make you appreciate the content more and will make some of the arguments easier to follow. Overall, if you like logic and math, take this course because it is very fun.",
                "If you are interested in this particular subject, and you have studied set theory and know what this course is going to be about, it's pretty good.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students, especially if they are interested in the more epistemological side of mathematics, and how we understand it.",
                "Absolutely i would recommend this course (as well as any course with Prof. Shin)! But be prepared to learn a lot about whichever topics you choose to write about and present about, and understand that for weeks where presentations are subpar you will get a lot less out of the class.",
                "Professor Shin is an amazing teacher, and the material covered in this course is very interesting. The topics we covered in mathematical foundations should be of interest to anyone studying logic, philosophy of science, epistemology, or math. The readings were incredible, and Professor Shin does a great job of explaining the material.",
