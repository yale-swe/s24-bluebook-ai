    "I learned about different presidential administrations and how their policies impacted the US economy.",
    "I learned how thoughts of political economy changed within the United States in relation to the time period and contemporary events. This class gave me better insight into how events are able to shape thought and theory regarding the economy and vice versa.",
    "I gained a thorough understanding of economic history and overall basic understanding of macroeconomies.",
    "I gained an understanding of American politics, history, economics, and social developments since 1877, just what I hoped for when I signed up for the class",
    "A much fuller understanding of american politics and economy in relation to our general history. I think I gained the skill at writing concise responses after analyzing primary\/secondary sources, too."

   "comments": [
    "I really liked the topic and found the material very intersting and helpful. Sometimes the lectures were a little rushed - lots of info in a short amount of time, but then again there is a lot to cover! I found the midterm\/final a little difficult to study for, simply because there was so much information to go over\/memorize, so it would be helpful to maybe narrow that down in someway. Otherwise I really enjoyed this class and found it very helpful in understand the political\/economic debates today!",
    "The course enrollment seemed to be small enough for a seminar instead of a lecture.",
    "This course is great in that it is also geared so that history students as well as econ students can gain a good grasp of the material.",
    "This course covers a ton of material but it is incredibly organized and well thought out. It was stated on the first day that you don't need any background in economics, and while you can get by without one (since I did), the class would be significantly easier if you had even a slight background in econ. There is also a lot of reading which is not really covered in section.",
    "Prof. Milner was a great lecturer who came into class very incredibly prepared each time. The lectures were definitely the highlight of the course.",
    "Strength was the format - 5 short papers, midterm, final. Strength was also the organization of lecture and the straightforward laying out of expectations. Weakness was lectures were often a bit dense and I think certain topics were made to be more complicated than necessary."

   "comments": [
    "Yes most definitely. Very good overview of the various economic trends across modern American history and a light exploration of their theoretical justification",
    "Yes, I recommend this class if you are genuinely interested in the material. It is a history class with a poli - sci focus, so lots of discussion about how executive\/judicial branch influences the economic policy of different eras. There are a few confusing\/rapid fine lectures, but overall the material is very interesting and Professor Milner does a great job of presenting the information in a straightforward, easy to comprehend way.",
    "I would because you learn about important developments within the US government.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as it gives a good history of a part of American history through the lens of the relationship between economic and political thought",
    "I would recommend this to a student who wants a better understanding of this history of business in America. The class is very much focused on labor relations, much less about actual money in politics.",
    "Highly recommend. If the title of the course sounds interesting to you, then it is more than worth it.",
    "It would depend on their interest in topic and willingness to engage."
