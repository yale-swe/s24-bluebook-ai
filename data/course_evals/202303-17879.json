                "Perfect",
                "The primary strength of this course is the instructor. I think it could be improved if the discussion was more regulated. As an undergraduate philosophy student I found myself lost in some of the exchanged dominated by a few of the graduate students.",
                "The strength of this course was the opportunity to engage deeply with a philosophical system, and the opportunity to revise the midterm paper. A weakness was the course's organization. We went thematically through Leibniz's work, but Leibnizian themes are difficult to separate, so we often wound up discussing themes that hadn't been mentioned in the readings, and that we hadn't discussed yet. \r\nTo improve the course, I'd suggest taking a more historically grounded approach. I would have liked to do a course on Leibniz's scientific, philosophic, and political contemporaries, and on his personal life. Then, I would have liked to move through his philosophy chronologically, to look at the way his thought developed over the course of his life, as a result of different philosophies he encountered. Finally, I would have liked to have one or two class sessions on Leibniz's influence on philosophy, math, and science, after his lifetime. \r\nA chronological/historical approach to Leibniz's philosophy would have several benefits. As the course was currently structured, it was difficult to track whether we were discussing Leibniz's mature views, or his early views. It often felt like we were attempting to create a synthesis, or philosophic coherence, from all of his writings, when such a coherence did not truly exist across his lifetime. If we treated each stage of his philosophy as its own system, then we could have identified incoherences within those single writings, and could have tracked the way Leibniz attempted to address/resolve/live with those incoherences in later writings. \r\nIt also would have allowed us to differentiate between different philosophic systems that Leibniz proposed, and to better identify the important continuities and discontinuities between his stages of thought. This approach also would have given us more space to understand Leibniz's contemporaries (like Spinoza, Locke, Descartes), and to understand Leibniz's thought as emerging in context, rather than in a vacuum. Finally, a historical approach, which would spend one class session on a single Leibnizian text, would have allowed us to continually understand Leibnizian themes in relation to one another. As our class conversations suggest, it seems that Leibniz's themes are codependent, and he proposes different philosophic stances based on other philosophic stances. A historical approach to this class would encourage us to analyze the interaction of these stances, instead of attempting to artificially excise each topic from the larger system of his philosophy.",
                "Mostly strengths for this course: great teaching, reading material, discussion, etc.",
                "I think it would be good to try to cover less and to be more text specific. Covering a whole set of correspondence--like the Arnauld or Clarke correspondence--might be a nice way to gt into a lot of Leibniz's ideas in a really focused way.",
                "The course was very thorough in both it's presentation and criticism of the material. It's instruction was engaging. Feedback on papers and comments in class were always insightful. One complaint I have is that the latter part of the semester in which we focused on Leibniz's theodicy and moral philosophy felt less thorough than when we were dealing with earlier subjects. I think this was probably just a problem of pacing and running out of time at the end of the semester, which could be resolved through a more strict adherence to an agenda in each class. I think a five minute break in the middle of the class would also go a long way."

As a philosophy student, I took this course as my only course in the history of philosophy post-DS, and now I wish that I could have taken more history courses, especially with Prof. Della Rocca.",
                "I would recommend this course, with a few caveats. First, I'd recommend it to students who are particularly curious about Leibniz, and have personal reasons to spend a semester diving into his intricate philosophic systems. If you don't have a specific interest in Leibniz, I'd suggest taking a different course. Second, I'd recommend it to students who are open to a roaming style of conversation, which ranges widely across different topics, and doesn't spend much time on deconstructing individual arguments. The mode of the class was principally in the style of summarizing a theme, then students raising their hands and proposing objections. If you're looking to develop an analytic mode, I think there are courses that better develop that skill.",
                "Definitely, Leibniz is an important figure in the history of philosophy and there are few better instructors to learn about him from than MDR.",
                "Yes, this was a detailed and engaging introduction to Leibniz.",
                "I'd absolutely recommend this course to another student. The content was interesting and the instruction engaging. The presence of philosophy grad students and divinity school students helped push me to think in ways that I rarely had in solely undergrad seminars. While the course was focused on Leibniz, the analytical skills that were developed by this course will certainly help me elsewhere."
