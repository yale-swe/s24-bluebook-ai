                "I greatly developed an understanding of what shapes the political moments in which leaders act. As my first class in political science, this course was a jump start in the polisci way of thinking for the social sciences. The type of analysis was unlike I had ever seen and was as challenging as it was enriching. I also learned to conduct long-term research and I practiced my ability to make subtle points about historical situations.",

I think a lot of people feel awkward about giving direct and honest feedback, and I think it hurts writing development in many classes, but not this one. The readings for each week were very interesting, and I think the critical debates were very helpful.",

                "The material is very well chosen, and the professor knows it very well. The lecture part of the class is always tremendously insightful, and I found the discussion to be engaging. The class does due diligence in providing an introduction to political leadership, but it might as well be an American presidency class. As an international student, I learned a lot about American presidential history, and I acknowledge that Prof. Skowroneks expertise is in that subject, but I wish we would have done as deep of a dive in other important leaders, particularly those of non-western countries. In terms of the writing part, the investigation is completely independent and there is no hand-holding whatsoever. There was never a rubric and the commentary that the professor did was sharp and insightful but limited, and can only be understood with a clear mind about the subject. If you are not confident in the subject, which few people ever were, there is little help to get you out of that gutter. The writing is also basically completely independent of the reading, which is okay, but different than other writing courses where they are more intertwined.",

The courses overarching theme and main takeaways are the subject of a 200-level course, but sometimes the discussion, writing feedback, and general independence feels like a senior seminar would. Do not rely on the professor to help you untangle the paper, only to inspect the argument.",
