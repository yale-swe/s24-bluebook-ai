                "This class delved deep into the many intersectional elements of gender and sexuality in U.S. politics (with a lean towards gender probably due to the amount of scholarship more broadly). We got a good mix of theory and quantitative  analysis to go into which was great. I really enjoyed it!",
                "Great survey of the lit about gender, sexuality, and race in US politics. Really thoughtful intersectional focus.",
                "I learned a lot about how to use an intersectional lens to study U.S. politics. It was really interesting to synthesize different sources from our syllabus, and class discussions helped me draw connections between the books, studies, and films we watched. The class also offered a great historical background on how gender and sexuality have been constructed in the United States and how they have come to be included in political science research.",
                "We developed our writing and research skills with the reading responses and our final project. We also developed our communication and presentation skills through class participation and the \"mini-conference presentations\" in which we presented our work-in-progress final papers. We also learned a lot about how gender, sexuality, and race (and the intersection of all 3) influence politics."

                "The discussions this class worked were amazing I learned so much from both Prof Strolovitch and my peers. The professor chose such interesting texts. I always felt listened and supported in this environment. We got great feedback from the professor as well as from our peers when we presented the bare bones of our final paper\r\n\r\nThe only thing was the cost of the books might prove to be a barrier.",
                "Great materials, intersectional focus, and good survey of lit from different times. No complaints!",
                "Strengths: This course was great! I really liked the way the syllabus was organized, and class discussions were well-organized. It was nice to have student-led discussions that summarized the readings along with guiding questions and explanations from Professor Strolovitch. Professor Strolovitch is really knowledgeable and gives great feedback - her guidance made our semester-long research project very manageable.",
                "I think the readings were sometimes too lengthy/time-consuming relative to other seminars I have taken, but they were interesting and class discussions were always lively and insightful. I also liked the way the course was structured, including how each module was organized and the course requirements (reading responses were helpful for engaging with the readings in a different way and the paper presentations were a great way to gain insight into what our classmates were working on and to get feedback)."

                "Yes! It was such a great environment and I learned a lot about the material and modes of political analysis",
                "Absolutely. The literature is pretty deep but its accessible enough that it can easily be your first course in the area if youre willing to really dive in.",
                "Absolutely. This course was a thorough, inclusive look at US politics and I was very pleasantly surprised by how thoroughly it considered the intersections of race and gender. Strongly recommend to Political Science majors with interest in WGSS or any Political Science major really.",
                "Yes!! I recommend this as a seminar for any political science or WGSS student. Its a great way to develop research and reading skills, and most importantly its focus on intersectionality as a frame for understanding U.S. politics should be the standard for the department. I also really appreciated Professor Strolovitchs thoughtfulness and flexibility in switching between Zoom and in-person meetings in order to protect everyones health.",
                "yes!! the class atmosphere was really open and welcoming and the course materials are interesting and important. Professor Strolovitch is great!"
