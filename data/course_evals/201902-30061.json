    "There could be more of a focus on the different styles of writing in investigative journalism and how to achieve them, as well as the appropriate context for each type.",
    "Strengths of the course were interactive lectures, the types of assignments and the content of lectures. This course could be improved with more regular feedback, and by incorporating more smaller assignments, focused on a particular skill. Greater focus on writing style would have been helpful."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The level of instruction in this course was high quality, the content was very interesting, and provided tremendous insight into the world of journalism."
