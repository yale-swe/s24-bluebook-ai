                "I learned a lot about politics of culture in Southeast Asia - as the course title implies. But I also appreciated that Prof. Harms helped us improve our writing and presentational skills. Besides the final paper, our major assignment was to write a book review of one of the books we read this semester. We go through multiple drafts with comments from Prof. Harms and our classmates. By the end of the revision process, I had a book review that I was actually proud of. It helped me realize the value of feedback and revision. We also gave a presentation of our final paper during the last class that was a lot of fun and also a great opportunity to practice our public speaking skills.",

                "The course has provided ample training and equipping for engaging with and understanding contemporary phenomena and issues in various countries in Southeast Asia, not only from an anthropological lens but also in terms of historical, cultural studies, agrarian studies, and political science approaches. It has bolstered some confidence in researching and talking about Southeast Asia and has also proven to be a robust survey of past and present scholarship from across Southeast Asia. To this extent, it has been an excellent opportunity to deepen an understanding of the region and of existing scholarship on the region.",
                "I gained a better understanding of the region. The discussions in the books also propelled me to consider things outside of SEA in new ways."

                "The readings are fascinating, my classmates (about half of them were grad students) were so wise and insightful, and Prof. Harms is so generous with his time and advice. A weakness is that the book review has an extremely tight turnaround (read an entire book and write a draft review in 4 days). Although I'm sure Prof. Harms is flexible with deadlines and understanding with the progress on the draft, I wonder if there's a way to ease the stress a little on that assignment. But the rest of the semester, the workload is very much \"you get out what you put in.\"",
                "Overall Professor Harms was very supportive and appraochable. He was also a brilliant discussion leader!",
                "The meetings are very well-planned. The readings are consistently thought-provoking. That's a strength that could be a possible weakness: and we learned how to think about anthropological research through individual examples (the readings), but there's a bit less on how to think about Southeast Asia as a whole.",
                "Strengths: Robust set of material provided, opportunity to engage with like-minded classmates about issues relating to SEA, great opportunity to speak to academics, wide range of fascinating books assigned\r\nWeaknesses: Though the course already has a great amount of restraints that it's operating under, I would have liked to read books pertaining to Singapore, Malaysia, and Cambodia in particular.",
                "Some of the readings were less engaging than others, but that might be because of my lack of prior knowledge in the region."

                "Yes! The readings are cool, your classmates will probably be cool, and Prof. Harms is definitely cool. He organized a class dinner at a nice restaurant during the end of the semester! My writing and public speaking skills improved through this class. Prof. Harms switched up the seminar format a few times to keep things interesting. He even got the author of one of our books to speak to us over Zoom! The workload is what you make of it.",
                "Yes! This course is a great course to dive deeper into Southeast Asian culture and politics. It is definitely more niche and focuses on Indonesia/Bali for a bulk of the course. However, the content is engaging and Professor Harms is extremely supportive for those less familiar with it.",
                "I wouldn't call this a \"survey course\" necessarily, but it is SUCH an important course to take in order to get a taste of politics and culture in Southeast Asia. The readings, resources, and Professor Harms' teaching alone, make this course was must take if you're even remotely interested (and you should be) in Southeast Asia. The absolute best course I've taken at Yale hands down, I wish we had more Southeast Asian classes like this.",
                "Yes! I enjoyed it and it's definitely intellectually rewarding.",
                "Yes. Although the course seems geared towards advanced students, anyone will benefit from the methodological discussions and substantive, very interesting readings.",
                "Highly, though depending on their level of engagement and familiarity with Southeast Asia. Definitely not a course for those with minimal interest in the region.",
                "Yes. Erik is a great professor who is very passionate about teaching. I always walked away from the class feeling like I've learned something."
