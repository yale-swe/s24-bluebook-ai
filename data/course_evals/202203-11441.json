                "Pros: The visiting artists class was the only one I felt really engaged in. It was really nice to hear about the grad students' work.\r\n\r\nCons: This course was taught in a very \"artist\" way...the subject of each week was always subject to change and there was no syllabus or structure. Moreover, the class would often run 20 minutes over because the professor didn't keep track of time...this would have been more tolerable if the class didn't end at 8:50 PM. Additionally, when we were doing artist presentations, some people were cut short at 5 minutes while others got 30+ minutes to themselves...people who liked to talk and were more confident were getting a disproportionate level of attention. Basic scheduling of presentation slots could have fixed this.\r\nThe energy of the class was very subject to the mood of the professor, and more often than not I did not enjoy being there.",
                "This course mainly consisted of discussions based on readings or just different topics people are interested in, so it was very freeform and nice. I can see this causing stress for people who like to have more concrete deadlines and tasks but personally I enjoyed it. The artist statement was a bit tricky for me because as a Computing and the Arts major I don't quite consider myself an artist sometimes.",
                "strength, it is a low work load course and it gets you to think in a new way about art. weakness it is difficult to keep up if you don't have background in art theory"
