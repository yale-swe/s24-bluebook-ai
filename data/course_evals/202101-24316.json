I learned about the different ways various businesses in various fields have to think about and go about functioning ethically. I particularly liked that the media we consumed varied greatly-- from tv shows, to movies, to articles-- and were relevant to our present situation.",
                "A great class to introduce Kantian ethics, Utilitarianism, virtue ethics and John Rawls justice principles. If you plan on being a CEO then I highly recommend this class it provides very applicable readings to leading a company.",

                "A very basic, surface-level understanding of philosophical concepts, which likely would have been better taught in a philosophy department class. The ethical case studies in the class were very interesting though, and the balance between lecture and podcast or film worked well (although the case studies were not always related to the lecture materials, which sometimes felt disjointed."

                "Very interesting material, but the homework assignments were unnecessary.",

                "This class was just really....bad. I have no idea if it was because of zoom or what, but my experience was horrible. Professor Carreras is absolutely the sweetest lady alive but it was an unorganized class where I really had no idea what was going on.",
                "Strengths- Dr. Carreras was very kind and helpful. She made the class worth attending. Her lectures were fun too given that she showed different movies and shows to supplement her material. \r\n\r\nWeakness- The case studies took a long time to complete (2-3, 5 page papers per week) and they never were discussed in class. They were graded fairly, but they felt like busy work.",
                "A nice fun course that provides some interesting thought experiments",
                "Greater student participation with the questions posed would have strengthened students' ability to hear various perspectives on ethical dilemas.",
                "This course is very accessible in terms of how gradually the content is introduced. The weekly assignments are pretty light roughly ~2-3 hours a week. All around great class.",
                "The classes are engaging, with great discussions and interesting, topical issues. The main weakness was the volume of case studies we did outside of class, though this was mainly an issue due to the compressed schedule of this semester.",
                "While Professor Carreras is a lovely, kind-hearted person, I do not believe this course should be taught again. Each class consisted of Professor Carreras simply reading text off her presentation slides, and while there was some class discussion, the classes felt like pre-recorded lectures. When the class ended, Professor Carreras would stop abruptly in the middle of the presentation and would not finish the topic in any of the subsequent classes. The homework assignments were entirely unrelated to the class materials and were comparable to middle school homework assignments, mainly asking us to write up what was discussed in each paragraph of a reading. While the case studies presented in class were interesting, they would have been much more pertinent if they had been connected to the class materials and homework assignments, which many were not."

Prof. Carreras is sweet though, so it's nothing on her just the class itself.",
