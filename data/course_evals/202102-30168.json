                "I learned about the lives and habits of ~7-8 geniuses throughout history (some of which were new to me), and I learned what it is they did that earned them the title of genius. In particular, we discussed the social relevance of genius and the role of sensationalism in creating the story and legacy of a genius. Additionally, the various habits of geniuses were discussed, which provides a guideline for us as students as to how we can be more effective and creative in our own work. The lessons on creativity were especially impactful and definitely opened my eyes on how to be a better student.",
                "I now have a more refined definition of what genius is and I no longer have the misconceptions of associating success with genius or prodigy. Additionally, we went over \"enablers of genius\" in the class and by following the list we explored I will try to lead a more creative life.",

                "The readings and videos prior to each class were very interesting, and they were efficient in relaying all the background info needed to understand each class's discussions. Sometimes the discussions could seem a bit repetitive as we went over this material again, but that did also serve to further cement the information in my mind. The weekly essays and options for re-writes provided very good feedback on writing skills, and I feel this course definitely helped to improve my writing. A particular strength of the course would be the engaging class discussions, led by  Craig and Jakub - they were always insightful and interesting; they  made attending class and doing the assignments extremely enjoyable and have definitely provided me with one of my best course experiences at Yale.",
                "Strengths: Great professor/TA, really interesting subject matter\r\nCons: Maybe it would be nice if we covered more modern geniuses, but not a huge criticism",
                "Strengths: improve your writing skills, resources (prof., TA, Writing center peer, etc.), Profs are always available to answer questions about planning essays or revising essays, engaging discussions during class, variety of course material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lecture (where the prof. goes over autobiographical stuff) can be a bit redundant with readings and is also a little dry. Also, I think we get off topic a lot of times in class, and so we end up not talking about the actual content sometimes.",
                "There was little time between assignments and consequently the workload was very high. My biggest focus was on meeting the frequent deadlines.",
                "Strengths: in class discussions are deep and interesting. Writing wise, you can improve your writing if you take advantage of the revisions.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometime class discussion can be difficult because of lack of participation",
                "Strengths: the papers were well-designed; the pace is fast but the workload is manageable for a summer class; the readings were very interesting; Professor Wright and Jakub were both very engaging.\r\nWeaknesses: maybe it would be better to have fewer geniuses in the second of the half of the class but more information about each of them, I really liked the pace for geniuses in the first half (Leonardo, Newton, Mozart).",
                "A strength is that it very thoroughly covers the concept of genius and will allow you to explore historical figures in depth from a new and intriguing perspective.",
