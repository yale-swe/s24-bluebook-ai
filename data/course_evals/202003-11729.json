More than anything, this course taught me how to succeed in an academically challenging environment using collaboration while making friends along the way!",

            "comments": [
                "The support from the instructor\/TAs\/Peer Tutors was fantastic and the camaraderie amongst the students was a defining feature of the course. I always felt like I could get help 24\/7 because of resources like Piazza as well as my fellow classmates. Despite the difficulty of the class, it is entirely doable for anyone who is willing to put the effort in. \r\n\r\nThe only possible weakness of the course is the occasionally ambiguous structure. We jumped around from topic to topic and it was fun at times, but very difficult to follow at others. This also could be due to the difficulty of the material, so this \"weakness\" should probably be taken with a grain of salt.",
                "The course was exactly as advertised. It is a proof based math course with a ton of work. Strengths: interesting work for those who are genuinely interested in math. Weaknesses: quick paced",
                "Pat is great.",
                "I thought the course was well organized and the psets reflected the topics we were learning in class.",
                "Strengths: interesting material, great professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I personally wish there was more of an emphasis on problem-solving and general techniques for mathematical problem-solving. Also, I wish Pat spent a little bit more time discussing the \"intuition\" behind the abstract concepts we discuss.",
                "The main strength of this class is its professor. Pat made an introductory math class that could have been discouraging and alienating into one of the most welcoming communities I've found at Yale. The problem sets were challenging but never impossible, and collaboration was encouraged. The lectures were well-paced and enjoyable, including a mix of definition\/theorem\/example lecturing, breakout-room work, and discussion about *why* whatever we were learning was defined the way that it was (giving us intuition, instead of just feeding facts). There was also an incredible amount of support -- office hours, Piazza, TAs, occasional posted solutions, recorded lectures, posted notes from the lectures.",
                "A weakness of the course is that, even with Pat trying his best to combat it, imposter syndrome was very high. Many students dropped out of the course and it was easy to feel disheartened. In addition, finding in-person study partners was difficult. While some people were very warm, others remained aloof. A strength of this course was Pat's teaching and the many office hours.",
                "Strengths: Pat is a really great professor, and there are always resources (office hours, study groups, etc.) if you need them. Some of the proofs are really interesting, and it's super satisfying when you figure them out.\r\nWeaknesses: Everything is extremely theoretical, so if you don't already have a strong math background, some of the concepts can get kind of confusing.",
                "This course is a LOT of work, but that's mostly a strength. You will end up spending about 15 hours a week on psets, but this means the content of the course sticks in your brain extremely well afterwards.",
                "Pat is one of the biggest strengths of this course. He is passionate about math and genuine in his hope for everyone to enjoy math as much as he does. The course content is extremely helpful in developing skills in quantitative reasoning. The workload is heavy but they helps a lot in clarifying concepts we learn in the class. Sometimes I start the sets being clueless but by the end of it everything makes sense. The course and the assignments (and even the exams) are carefully designed such that things click step by step. It's extremely satisfying to see that everything makes sense in the end. If this class has any weakness it's probably the level of difficulty and workload (which really isn't a weakness since anyone who wants to take the course should be prepared for them).",
                "Strengths: a) Pat. Hes an engaging lecturer, and makes you excited about even the most routine concepts in math. b) The 15+ hr\/wk psets. As much pain as they give rise to, they help build some unbreakable friendships and result in the most euphoric highs when you finish them. Theyre also artfully constructed, so that each result elegantly draws on previous ones, and by the end of the course, you feel like youve really proved all of analysis yourself.\r\nWeaknesses: While this course is titled Vector Calculus & Linear Algebra, you wont learn any procedural methods from either discipline; rather, the course is focused on proofs (almost exclusively).",
                "Pat and the TAs are great and super supportive. The content is interesting and the grading is fair. I think there could have been more feedback\/emphasis on good proof-writing techniques.",
                "Strengths:\r\nBegins with foundational concepts and builds up -- it never feels like an idea \"came out of nowhere\"\r\nProblem sets (everything about them -- question types, number of questions, difficulty, etc.)\r\nIn-class lectures moved at a good pace\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI feel like the ordering of the material could be rearranged a bit to make it easier to absorb, but the general structure and ordering I liked a lot",
                "The strengths were that it taught me a lot of logic throughout the course.\r\nThe weaknesses were that since there was not a lot of time for the lectures, the professor tended to rush a little bit.",
                "To be perfectly honest, I learned more from the problem sets themselves than from anything else. I think much of the learning done in this course is self-motivated. Obviously, the lectures cover necessary material (and are really engaging), but it's the individual work that forced me to reexamine how I approach math problems.\r\n\r\nAnd the feedback on problem sets is insanely specific - these comments in particular helped me improve my proof-writing skills.",
                "The course is very engaging and well organized, and it was overall a very enjoyable experience. The office hours are also very helpful with lots of time slots available.",
                "Strengths: Amazing professor, recommend for any hard STEM student and those who are interested in mathematics as a field, great office hours and quality examination and homework questions to think about\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Be prepared for a lot of work if you want the most out of the course, but it was personally worth it!",
                "The lectures were very helpful, and the Pset problems were fun and engaging with an appropriate level of challenge.",
                "You are highly encourages to work with other students, and it builds a collaboration atmosphere that runs throughout the course. There is a lot of math to be learned, and there is a lot of support in the class.",
                "The course moves very quickly, and it's hard to keep up especially when everything is virtual.",
                "The course was well organized to build on itself and develop complex ideas. The lectures and problem sets complimented each other to both solidify concepts and move the content forwards. There were lots of opportunities for collaboration and ways to ask for clarification or help.  I honestly don't know how the course could have been improved.",
                "Pat Devlin is a genuinely amazing instructor. He really succeeds at fostering a sense of community. The class feels less like a normal intro stem course and instead like an intensive but gentle boot camp for people who are all interested in math. He also really emphasizes creativity in math and people engaging with math outside of the curriculum. I've also been impressed by the detail and clarity of feedback I've received on psets.\r\n\r\nI'm glad there's not a textbook -- it would kill the spirit of math 230 -- but I often wished there was a more central, organized place to review what we've covered.",
                "This is an excellent course, probably the best I took this semester. Strengths: Pat's an incredible professor and person. He's really good at explaining concepts and making the course interesting and interactive even in a virtual format. He put in a great effort to have us form study groups and work with each other, which was awesome. He was also really helpful and understanding with deadlines\/exams, and made things less stressful during a crazy year, which I really appreciated. The TA's were also really helpful.  The workload was pretty manageable and rewarding, and honestly not as hard as people describe it to be. I  can't find any weaknesses.",
                "The PSETS for this course were incredibly interesting and engaging, and I think that's where I grew the most. It could've been useful to have more time in class spent doing example proofs that were more like the PSET problems -- we often proved theorems and statements stated in class and there was a great deal of time spent on proofs, but a little more could have helped. Also, the midterms were very, very long -- each one would contain a three-hour timed exam on top of a pset-type untimed exam (which could take many hours). These could pile up and be overwhelming in the middle of the course, although I definitely learned a lot from them.",
                "This is a fantastic, engaging course. The professor is excellent, the material is interesting, and the work is challenging but enjoyable.",
                "Strengths: Pat and the PL's create a class where collaboration is welcome. Office hours are numerous and there are several check in's and attempts by Pat to make sure people that want others to work with can try to find those people. I was fortunate to form a pset group early on in my residential college, and most of us met to work together almost every week for the rest of the semester. The psets are such that you can do the pset yourself, but it becomes even more enjoyable and manageable if you discuss and work on the questions with others. \r\n\r\nSubmissions are all via gradescope, and comments are generally specific and informative, so it's easy to see what exactly you did wrong or what you did well.\r\n\r\nThe class also uses a Piazza page that is very active. Responses by students, PF's, and Pat are pretty substantive and often include links or their proofs of results to answer the question.\r\n\r\nFinally, I note that a majority of the learning is done outside of class. In class, you get important definitions, theorems (proved and left to prove), and some example problems that are useful as reference. The learning took place when you were stuck on a deceiving problem and were forced to try different strategies. This, however, is necessary to gain math intuition. It was almost always worth it to figure out a proofand sometimes, to confidently catch all the special cases.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It is a large time commitment with long, weekly psets. For most, in addition to solving the problems you also have to type up\/rewrite your answers to be more clean. Still, we got two homework extensions, our lowest pset was dropped, and Pat was understanding about special circumstances.",
                "It definitely had a lot of workloads, but I think all of them were necessary (and even fun) to teach us the concepts. Also, although the psets were challenging, there was more than enough help from the professor and the TAs. \r\n\r\nAs for the weakness, I think there were some people who did not have any partners to work on problems together. Perhaps next semester or in future classes this component can be improved (especially for online classes).",
                "The course's strength was helping students discover the material for themselves through proofs. However, this was also a weakness, as it meant that less of the material was covered in class.",
                "Strengths: Through taking 230, I gained a better understanding of math. Specifically, I have learned how to approach a general math problem and figure out how to get to the desired solution. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, I found it difficult to see the connection between the material we covered in the lecture and the material on the problem sets. I think this could be improved in a future semester.",
                "Pat is an incredible instructor, and he was excellent at getting to know students and making sure to cater towards all abilities. The lectures were also recorded and Pat uploaded his notes after each class, which was very helpful.",
                "Pat is the greatest strength of this course: although you can learn math anywhere, he made the material so engaging to the extent that you feel that this is the best intro analysis course you could have taken anywhere in the world. All the peer tutors have also been stellar.",
                "Strengths: Serves well as an introductory course. Course is logically well-structured, and problem sets follow from material covered in class. Material is very interesting. Doing proofs is also very satisfying. Community is definitely a plus too - study groups are highly encouraged, and you can bond through working on problem sets. \r\nWeaknesses: workload is very high. Extraordinarily so. Problem sets require a lot of thinking.",
                "Despite having little prerequisites, the course maintained a high level of rigor and was both accessible and challenging for students of various mathematical backgrounds. The lectures were clear and well-prepared, and the problem sets and exams were excellently designed to both further the concepts covered in class, as well as present new ideas for self-exploration. Collaboration was encouraged, and plenty of office hours were made available each week. Google forms were sent out a few times during the semester to ask for student feedback on the organization of the course. I did not feel that the course had any particular weaknesses.",
                "The class is very accessible to most, if not all, students in the class, and it helps level the playing ground for everyone. I really appreciate that every topic is accessible without much prior knowledge.",
                "Honestly I think this course has pretty few weaknesses -- the class content is taught well and is engaging, the students are all eager to learn and to help each other, and the office hours are generally helpful as well. Further, the midterms\/final had clear links to topics covered in class. My one comment is that the speed of grading lagged a little bit near the end of the semester, so by the time the final rolled around, I didn't have feedback on my second midterm or on my final assignment that I could use to study\/improve.",
                "Strengths\r\n- Proof-based math: it's just so much fun, and it makes math feel more like a creative and analytical exercise than the monotony of mechanical computations and memorization\r\n- Problem sets: I loved how the problem sets all interrelate and how we can use stuff we proved already to prove more stuff! Also, the TA's are really helpful in giving guided hints if you get stuck on a problem.\r\n- Exams emphasize understanding rather than speed\r\nWeakness\r\n- Lack of a textbook: for the most part this isn't a problem since Pat explains concepts clearly and often provides some optional readings, but I still think it would be nice to have one not just as further treatment of a specific topic but also as a kind of roadmap for the course (since we do jump around a lot)",
                "Pat allows made the lectures engaging to listen to and explained the concepts very naturally and clearly. The problem sets were also fun, and while they were a good amount of work each week, it never felt overwhelming.",
                "The strength was the enthusiasm Pat had towards math -- it was almost contagious. I appreciated that a lot. It also assumed very little *actual* math knowledge -- technically someone who has only taken Calc 1 could take this course, although it was far more common to have taken more math than that.\r\nThe weakness of this course during covid-19 was the lack of engagement between classmates during lecture. Also, it is easy to feel like an imposter in this class -- some things that are very challenging to you can seem like second nature to others, and that can be really discouraging for someone who used to have confidence in math.",
                "Pat did an excellent job making material both approachable and engaging despite the virtual format. One thing I would improve would be the amount of feedback on proofs earlier in the semester.",
                "This course is all around excellent, there isn't anything I would change.",
                "The strength of this course is the cumulative progression of the material. In most classes, material that the instructor introduces at tthee beginning of the semester becomes obselete by the end. However, I felt that I continued to develop my understanding of the topics from the first two weeks throughout the semester, and this focus was necessary to build into ever more complex and abstracted realms.",
                "I honestly don't have any feedback for this course. The material was interesting, the teaching was excellent, the problem sets were challenging but still doable (although the workload is pretty intense; I spent lots of time in office hours), the tests were fair, and there was a real sense of camaraderie among the students.",
                "Strengths: clear lectures; clear and complete lecture notes; easy to participate in either synchronously or asynchronously; helpful feedback on proofs; the grading felt fair; useful office hours; Pat and the TAs went out of their way to help us find people to collaborate with. In an absolute sense, the workload was a lot, but it didn't feel like too much since there was so much support given.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None? If you love math, this is an excellent course. If you hate writing proofs, probably not.",
                "Strength: Pat is a great professor who explains things very well. \r\nWeakness: High workload",
                "Sometimes it was really hard to get valuable feedback on the Office Hours cause there was sometimes a small chance of actually getting access to the professor. Sometimes it was also hard to understand what was necessary on assignments.\r\n\r\nIn positive news, it was a very strong, intensive course, but taught in a way that was very accessible. The collaborrative nature of the course really improved the experience.",
                "This course could do with a slightly more rigid structure, but then again the content always seemed to flow very well and we rarely had gaps in our knowledge.",
                "The problem sets were thought-provoking, rewarding, and helped me a lot in understanding the course material. The professor's lectures were engaging, welcoming, and comprehensive. There are few to no weaknesses, as the teaching staff made efforts to provide ample office hour opportunities.",
                "This course was well taught. I think that this course could cover a bit more multivariable calculus, but other than that, it was really all I could ask for.",
                "Strengths: The reviews don't lie, folks, Pat is AMAZING. Even through Zoom, I was blown away by the amount of support he and the TA staff gave us. Content-wise, I found the material super cool too, and proof-based math is strangely addictive. (But I know some may disagree with me on that)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None :D",
                "very high learning curve \r\npat is very engaging\r\npsets took a lot of time",
                "many more example problems and the use of a TEXTBOOK to follow along. notes were vague",
                "Pat is a great math instructor. He really tries to make the content accessible, even to students (like me) who aren't ~amazing~ at math.",
                "This course does have a significant workload, but the psets really aided my understanding of the subject.",
                "This course was amazing. The quality of Pats teaching is probably the best Ive experienced in any math class. He makes the content extremely engaging and even the driest of subjects are fun to learn about. The difficulty of the problem sets is just right: hard enough to require lots of focused work and creativity, yet easy enough to keep me motivated. I also had a great experience with the TAs: they were always helpful and approachable.",
                "A strength is definitely the professor and how he created so many opportunities for us to be engaged with the class and students outside of normal class times. A weakness would be the workload in the second half in which we had multiple midterms and then a final in a short amount of time. We didn't even receive feedback from our past tests before we had to take another one.",
                "This course is really very strong. I have no advice at this time.",
                "The focus on writing proofs is central to this class. Think 75% proofs and 25% content. I started this semester having never experienced proof-based math before and am now confident in my ability to write them. Math 230 is a fantastic introduction to higher level math. With that said, this class is incredibly challenging! The weekly PSET dominated my schedule, and I had to put in significantly more time than the quoted 20 hour average. Going to TA office hours and making friends in the class is life saving! Math 230 has an excellent community in which you can find others to collaborate with. There was an abundance of kindness and friendship found in mutual suffering. Pat is very kind and helpful, but also, relatively chaotic (the class does not follow a book but rather is an amalgamation of topics, which can be overwhelming at times). He provided great, detailed feedback and was readily available to help. I ultimately learned a lot of math this semester and am glad I kept at it.",
                "Maybe if we had more office hours? Sometimes it felt like I couldn't review my past psets or midterms since I was so focused on doing that week's pset",
                "The strengths are that Pat is awesome, and you will find a new appreciation for mathematics if you take this course. Furthermore, it's extremely flexibly taught, with lectures and notes posted online and extensions available for Psets. Although its weakness could be considered a high workload, I actually found it more manageable than other classes with lower time requirements, because the flexibility lets you complete the work whenever you have time. However, it is not so flexible as to be easy to fall behind. Overall, I highly recommend despite the necessary time commitment. You just find a free day when you and your study group have time, and get the work done, and if something comes up, you use an extension. And you finish with a better understanding of the world of math and a lot of practice at thinking hard.",
                "Wished for an outline of different units.",
                "I think Pat is a great teacher. He is really good at teaching you how to figure out and write a proof, which is really hard to teach.\r\n\r\nI want to emphasize that this course does NOT cover the same stuff as MATH 120. That was made pretty clear to me, but I don't think I got a good grasp on what I would need the stuff in 120 for vs. what I need the stuff in this class for. I still don't have a good understanding of that.",
                "230 was an amazing course, easily the best Ive ever taken. Pats lectures were fun and easy to follow over zoom, but also packed a lot of information (although I think the pace could have been fasterin the manifolds unit in particular, we could have used fewer examples and more walked-through proofs of theorems). Psets were amazingly fun, and exams were exactly the right balance of chill and challenging.",
                "I think the main strength of this course was definitely the professor. Prof Devlin definitely made this class a lot easier to understand and was very helpful. Apart from him, the notes and lectures were also structured quite well.",
                "This course has no weaknesses. The strengths are the material, Pat's clear teaching style, tons of office hours and wise TAs, and lots of resources available to students. Pat is the single greatest strength of this course. Aside from his clear lectures, supplementary notes, and office hours, Pat also fosters a welcoming and collaborative environment that encourages creativity  and makes math approachable for all students.",
                "Fantastic and challenging course if you're interested in pure math (or not). The instructor is incredibly passionate, understanding, and engaging. He does frequent course polls to gauge student opinions and see how to best proceed; I have no comments on the course's weaknesses.",
                "This course is perfect. It highlights proof based methods in a work intensive style covering both vector calculus and linear algebra. The difficulty was made easier through the collaborative environment fostered through the classroom and various office hours\/peer tutoring sessions as well as efforts to connect students to local study groups."

                "Recording lectures and posting the notes was super helpful for me. Having breakout rooms during live lecture was also good, allowing us to meet people in the class and work in groups. I would have like to see what in-person office hours would be like, and I may have attended them more in that case.",
                "I think taking the class virtually has not have any negative impact on my learning.",

                "Office hours  -- did not go often but when I went they were helpful despite the virtual format\r\nCreating \"Math 230 communities\" in colleges through breakout rooms. This later helped collaboration on the p-sets.",

                "The virtual office hours were really convenient.",
                "The use of Piazza (which I believe is used during non-COVID times as well) was great and endlessly helpful. Office hours were an amazing resource - especially on Thursday nights when I was struggling with one last problem that just wouldn't click!\r\n\r\nHonestly, I think the Zoom lectures were as engaging as a Zoom lecture can possibly be. There's something about learning through a screen that will always feel a little bit cold and sterile, but Pat did a great job of making lectures feel as warm and true-to-life as he could.",
                "Having the classes be synchronous, but also uploading the lectures and letting students watch them later and read the class notes is very valuable. The class was taught by Pat sharing his screen as he wrote by hand on some ipad app - it was very effective for us to see what he was thinking as he taught.",

Really liked how the lectures were offered live, but in case of an emergency, recorded lectures and notes were offered afterwards. The plethora of office hours was definitely a success for the class given its difficulty, and they allowed for a much better experience with the class overall.",

                "The virtual lectures went well, besides breakout rooms occasionally being awkward or unhelpful (but that's kind of a given). Office hours were wonderfully accessible and still very helpful - they were structured well to provide a space for virtual collaboration. I really appreciated how everyone explored different resources until finding methods that were most helpful to us. Gather town worked really well, and the piazza page and gradescope allowed feedback to be quickly available.",
                "The use of the platform gather.town for office hours was initially chaotic but ended up working out. I also thought the piazza forum was a success and people genuinely asked a lot of questions through it. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is specific to COVID but one thing about the class was that it can be a bit grueling. It would be nice to have one off-week for a pset. A double pset or a half pset doesn't mean as much to me; I would have loved to have one week of the semester where I didn't have to work on pset.",
                "The format of the course (with Pat writing on a whiteboard during the class and publishing his notes later on) was pretty effective in my opinion, made the class more interactive and less dry than a simple presentation. Piazza and Virtual Office hours were also really helpful! Gather town office hours were also pretty fun, though the platform would sometimes crash when there were many people on.",
                "Recording lectures allowed students to watch lectures at their own convenience.",
                "Office hours worked pretty well. One resource we used was gathertown, which I found pretty useful in that in addition to being able to video call with multiple people, it also felt easier than on Zoom to sit in silence working on your own without feeling pressured to come up with something to ask.",
                "More opportunities for students to meet each other for working together on psets.",
                "I thought the professor was engaging and made the class interesting. Since I was on campus this year, I found it easy to collaborate with my classmates on problem sets, but I think this would be much more difficult if I was learning remotely from home.",
                "The live and recorded lecture allowed students great flexibility. How exams and finals were organized was also a great example of balancing rigor and flexibility.",
                "Lectures were held live but also recorded. This was a good balance, since  the live lectures allowed for interaction between students and instructors, but was also adaptable to changing conditions.",
                "Lectures were live, but were also recorded and made accessible on the class page. Notes were uploaded as well for each lecture. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the midterms and the final were take-home exams, each consisting of a self-timed and untimed component to be uploaded within several days (around a week for the untimed component). This flexibility in terms of scheduling was very helpful, although the untimed component often felt more like a problem set than an exam.",
                "The exams divided into timed and untimed portions were very friendly.",
                "Having recordings of the lectures is a benefit of the virtual format that helped me learn the course content.",
                "I think this class was conducted well over Zoom. Pat's way of displaying his notes (I think he was writing on a tablet or something?) was effective, and he posted his notes each day after class. In addition, having the class be recorded was very helpful when it came to studying or revisiting concepts that were confusing. For office hours, both Zoom and gathertown worked for me.",
                "I think Zoom live lectures worked pretty well on the whole.",
                "Having the lectures be recorded to be able to viewed later at any time was very helpful during the pandemic.",
                "I appreciated office hours, which happened relatively often. I also liked the residential college breakout rooms, because we could meet easily afterwards to work on problem sets. However, sometimes the TAs had poor mic quality, which made them very difficult to understand. I also wish that I got to connect with the lecturer more, because students rarely got to engage with him during lecture save for a few students. He would show up to office hours sometimes, which is when I got to engage.",
                "This course felt very natural online. Pat managed to deliver insightful and entertaining lectures wonderfully through the new medium. Having a live drawn virtual chalkboard felt perfect for his style.",
                "I felt that this course particularly handled the virtual format very well, through a combination of active outreach on social media by TA's and instructors. The Piazza page, the discord, and the groupme chats were very helpful.",
                "Pat was very good at adapting to virtual learning. He had some kind of tablet and wrote down the information basically as if we were in class on a whiteboard, and that kept the pace of learning reasonable while being more engaging. The office hours were on a website called gather.town, and I liked the format a lot.",
                "This course adapted successfully to remote learning. By providing recordings of the lectures and good lecture notes, Pat made it possible to participate either synchronously or asynchronously, or in some combination of the two. I believe use of Gathertown as a virtual meeting space for office hours was particularly successful; it emulated the experience of actually being in a room with the professor\/TAs and your peers. Pat also went out of his way to connect remote and on-campus students. I think a lot of other courses could take a page from Pat and the TAs' book in adapting to remote learning!",
                "The recorded lectures and course notes online were very helpful.",
                "I think the professor did a really good job at making the class assessible, fun and useful. Math is a really hard set of courses to make fun, especially online, but they did this really well.",
                "The flexibility of the course, along with the posting of both notes and lectures allowed for students to tailor the course to their own style of learning, which I appreciated.",
                "Lectures were recorded for students' convenience, and the process of submitting problem sets and exams was not disturbed too much by the virtual setting. The teaching staff tried to make office hours as inviting as possible despite virtual barriers.",
                "The recorded lectures and lecture notes uploaded to canvas was very important. I found that I would go and rewatch the lectures or reread the notes many times.",
                "Pat's teaching style was a really good fit for virtual learning. He hand wrote all the lecture notes in real time, which made it much easier to follow what he was saying, as opposed to some other classes I had where I felt bombarded by too much text flashing on my screen. The office hours site (gather.town) was creative and I think it worked well, although I wasn't personally its biggest fan because of the occasional technical glitches on my side. And on that note, the amount the TAs made themselves available (especially Mirilla and Matt with their super clutch exam review sessions) was really fantastic and essential when we as students felt less connected to the class.",
                "recorded lectures were helpful\r\ncourse notes were helpful",
                "all office hours were online but math is a subject that should be taught in person",
                "The office hours were SO incredibly helpful. I wouldn't have succeeded without it. The \"math lounge\" hosted on the gather.town system was very effective as well.",
                "the virtual math lounge was wonderful and a good alternative to zoom breakout rooms",
                "I thought everything worked as well as possible. Pats lecture style of writing notes in real-time on a tablet was very engaging and felt organic. Students were engaged with questions throughout the lectures and occasional breakout sessions.\r\n\r\nThis isnt specific to COVID-19 practices, but I wish there was an optional recitation session to review course material periodically.",
                "The opportunities outside of class such as office hours, talks, and one-on-one meetings made the class much more engaging. There were a ton of resources as well such as class notes and videos which was helpful!",
                "I personally was fine because I had a good group to do PSETs with. The problem would be those who were unlucky and not in close proximity to other Math 230 folks.",
                "The lecturing format was ideal for this year's learning conditions. It was helpful to be able to ask questions and interact in the live lectures while still having access to recordings and pictures of notes for review. TA office hours via Gather Town truly got me through this class; they facilitated collaboration and tended to be more interactive. I made many great friends working on PSETs those late nights. Furthermore, the Piazza discussion form was useful for clarification questions on PSETs.\r\nI would continue to focus on Gather Town, but otherwise, do not have any suggestions for improvement.",
                "The asynchronous lectures definitely helped. Office hours was undeniably my saving grace for this class",
                "Very kind and engaging professor.",
                "I have no complaints with the online format. It was really smooth, to the point where it felt as if it had always been a remote course.",
                "This course was FANTASTIC virtually. Pat had this awesome tablet that allowed him to write clear notes on zoom that were better then any in-person chalk board. Furthermore Pat and the TA team took advantage of the online format and used many softwares like gather.io to host office hours that made collaboration easy. I see no improvements this course could make.",
                "The instructor was incredibly engaging despite the Zoom platform. Between class polls and encouraging small work groups, I think this class manages to be very successful while still being online.",
                "COVID adaptation was perfect, lectures were recorded for students unable to attend live. Many office hours and peer tutoring sessions were hosted online."

                "I would recommend this course to any student who is truly interested in math. I was very nervous about my background going into Math 230 (only basic calc, no math competition experience), yet background was only loosely correlated with success in this course. Going to office hours, seeking help when you need it (which should be often and that's okay), and reserving enough time for your work will guarantee success. If you think you want to be a math major, this should be your first course at Yale.\r\n\r\nIf Pat is the professor that is also a massive bonus :)",
                "I would only recommend if you are ready to put in A TON of work. It is a very demanding schedule with no breaks, but it is very cool stuff if you are interested.",
                "Yes! Pat is super awesome.",
                "Yes I would if you are interested in math! If not, then maybe not because it does take up a LOT of time. But, it is an amazing class and Pat is great instructor that truly cares about if you are understanding the material. The 230 study groups are also the best and it really is a tight-knit community.",
                "Absolutely. Great class and an amazing professor.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Take the class for the incredible improvement that you'll have in proof-writing skills. (Problems that seemed painful and impossible at the beginning of the semester I can now sort out in an hour.) Take the class for the chance to struggle with math with friends (this is way more fun than it sounds). Take the class for the real analysis, honestly -- it's like a really rigorous version of calculus, and it'll allow you to see the connections and motivation behind math that you learned in high school but never *really* understood. Math 231 is the class that I'm looking forward to most next semester just because of how great Math 230 has been. Absolutely take this.",
                "Yes and no. Only if a student is aware of how high the level of material and workload is. Other than that, it's a great class.",
                "If you have a strong math background and are willing to commit a lot of time and energy, I would absolutely recommend this class. Personally, I don't think I was prepared to take this class straight out of high school (given that I had a fairly weak math education, but a strong interest), but if you have already seen some amount of multivariable calculus or have experience writing proofs or solving problems, this class is a great choice.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, if the student is interested in the math major.",
                "I highly recommend anyone who is remotely interested in higher math to at least shop this course. It is true that this course is not for everyone due to its difficulty and workload, but at least try it for yourself and you can switch to MATH 120 or 222 anytime before the midterm if you feel 230 is not your thing. If you end up liking it after a few weeks, however, you will finish the class getting so much out of it. The content of this course isn't particularly useful unless you take higher level math class like analysis or algebra, so you should take 120 and 222 if you want to learn math that is more applicable. This class, in my opinion, is about intellectual challenge and developing skills of abstract thinking and analysis (do notice the pun here). If this sounds like what you want then make sure to try 230! (Also, yes, you can be a prospective humanities\/social sciences major and still enjoy this course.)",
                "If youre looking to apply multi-variable calculus to physical problems, this courses material is perhaps not directly relevant to you. But, the conceptual understanding of calculus and analysis that it provides is unparalleled, and its worth having to forgo 120 (and self-study actual procedural multi-variable calculus) to enroll in 230. Pat is such an animated and compassionate professor, and there will never be a dull moment in his lectures.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. It seems super hard the first few weeks, but calms down and is very manageable.",
                "Yes. The way the course builds from foundational concepts gave me a much deeper understanding of the calculus ideas that I learned in high school and much more. Also, proof-writing really helped me clarify my thought process and internalize each concept.",
                "Absolutely! This course teaches you so much.",
                "Yes, a person interested in logic behind mathematics would greatly enjoy this.",
                "Yes! I was really worried about this course: I have a pretty extensive math background, but the 9999\/5 workload rating on CourseTable gave me pause, especially as an incoming first year who didn't know what \"a lot of work\" meant in the context of Yale.\r\n\r\nThe honest, wishy-washy answer: it's a lot of work, but it doesn't feel like a lot of work. Each week you get one assignment, and the work on that one assignment is spread across days. The total time could be upwards of 20 hours, but it doesn't feel that way, especially when you're working with friends and enjoying the material itself. So I guess I'd say this: take 230 if you like math (the weird, mind-bendy kind of math that you have to stew over); don't take 230 if you don't. And if you're not sure, take it. Why not? It's a semester.",
                "Absolutely! You have to be willing to put a lot of hours into it, but if you are you get a whole lot from the class.",
                "Yes, it is a great introduction to proof-based math, and the office hours are really helpful for Psets.",
                "Yes, but only if you really like math and are considering a math major.",
                "Would absolutely recommend, the professor is simply amazing and the experience of the class helped me grow much more as a student in mathematics and rigorous study.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who want to figure out what proof-based math is like.",
                "Math 230 is an intense class. Let no one tell you differently. It requires work and thought beyond just learning material. Even if you've never done proofs before (I had not done them), Math 230 is worth taking. It is a fun class with a professor (assuming you will have the same in the future) who will draw you into the world of Math. As I said before, Math 230 is an intense class, but, if you think you could want to take it (or major in Math), take it, and you will find other people just like you.",
                "I came in with just calculus background and a bit of linear algebra, and I would say that this class is very challenging. The concepts can be hard to grasp and you will often look back to review the concepts (not just to understand, but you will likely use them on the coming pset). However, there is a lot of support if you seek for it [office hours (both Pat's and TA's), peer tutors]. The workload is also quite heavy -- the psets take hours to write up even if you know how to do the problems. Pat's amazing, though.",
                "Yes, but only if they're interested in mathematics. It is very challenging and you need to spend a lot of time reviewing and thinking about problems.",
                "Absolutely! Pat is awesome, and so is the course content! (oh, his cats are cool, too)",
                "Yes! It is a significant time investment, but the knowledge, friends, and skills you gain make it worth it. It provided a solid foundation in theoretical mathematics and proof writing that would serve any future math-majors especially well, but I would also recommend it to anyone who enjoys math.",
                "Yes! The type of math taught in 230 is different than high school and worth exploring no matter what your background is; I actually had a pretty limited background in math and never felt that it held me back.\r\n\r\nMost intro stem classes aren't nearly this passionate. Pat's enthusiasm, dedicated to community building and focus on growth over rote learning, makes this class exceptional.",
                "Yes, absolutely! If you're serious about going into Math, or are wondering whether Math is right for you, or just want to have fun with proofs, or any mixture of the above, go for it! It's a very rewarding course with an incredible professor.",
                "If you're considering a math major, I would definitely recommend it -- it is a deep dive into proof-based math that will let you know whether it's something that you love or something that you hate. If you are trying to learn the mechanics of the math (i.e. how to do integrals and find Jacobians and work with matrices), then the standard math sequence might be better; this course does not contain really any computation. But if you love math and want to be challenged, this is a great opportunity!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone considering a math major. The professor is great, the course material is compelling and super interesting, and it gives its students a taste of the math major.",
                "If you're on the fence, definitely try it! While the class is not for everyone because of the time commitment and amount of times you might get stuck on a question for a while, I gained a significant amount of intuition in writing proofs and a newfound appreciation for mathematics. The class is well designed and problems nicely chosen to complement each other, and you will reference a lot of work you've done in a past (or the same) pset to use on a current proof, which can be very cool! Working with others on psets also feels organic, and it's nice to get to know your classmates along the way.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in math who is considering taking math at a higher level.",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed this class -- even if you don't think you will like doing a lot of proofs, I think learning theoretical math is an important skill to have, and if you have the time to commit to this class, I'd encourage you to take it.",
                "If Pat is teaching this, yes. Although this is a very challenging class, it is also a great introduction to proof writing, regardless of previous experience. I came in never having done multi-variable calculus or linear algebra, and although it was difficult because I felt behind compared to other classmates, Pat built everything up from scratch and didn't assume prior knowledge.",
                "Yes because your life is better with manifolds in it.",
                "Depends. Material is interesting and exciting, instructors are great, but workload can be very VERY heavy and can be difficult to balance. For me, each problem set took 10-20 hours a week to complete; this will depend on the person, but still requires some consideration. Otherwise an excellent course.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in math. There are truly almost no prerequisites, although a basic single-variable calculus background is definitely helpful. In particular, there are no prerequisites in terms of experience with proofsthere are plenty of resources on proof-writing and proof techniques, and each problem set is an opportunity to practice proof-writing and receive feedback on submitted work. However, keep in mind that the problem sets are quite time consuming, and the workload of this course is likely among the highest for courses taken by first-years.",
                "Yes. I think it provides a solid foundation for analysis and linear algebra.",
                "Absolutely, for those interested in abstract proof-based math.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they wanted to improve their proof-writing skills and learn about various topics in linear algebra\/multivariable calculus. The workload is not too bad (as long as you don't procrastinate until the day before!), and there are many support systems to help with the work (peers, office hours, Pat).",
                "Yes. I took this class as a computer science major, and it was fun and challenging. I can't say how much the course material overlaps with MATH 120 \/ 225, but I feel like I walked away with a pretty solid grasp of the fundamentals of multivariable calculus and linear algebra (and I'm only halfway through the 230\/1 sequence). Did I really need to take proof-based math as a CS major? Probably not, but MATH 230 is easily the best math class I've ever taken, and I think a large part of that is due to 230's emphasis on proof-writing, although I know it won't be everyone's cup of tea. But I found proofs to be a rigorous intellectual challenge that required both creativity and precision. If you are willing to put in the work, I think MATH 230 will be quite a rewarding experience.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The course is a very good introduction to proof-writing and is valuable both to students who are either new or already experienced with writing proofs. The topics build naturally off each other and Pat did a great job of teaching the material in an interesting and engaging way.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you see a future for yourself that involves math for its own sake. In other words, if you do not want to be a pure math major\/applied math\/some sort of closely related field, I cannot see why you would take this class. However, if you want to pursue a math major, this class with 231 is definitely the way to go.",
                "Yes! Pat is an excellent instructor who makes math both exciting and engaging. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone wanting to explore math .",
                "Definitely! It's a wonderful time and I strongly recommend it to anybody who's curious. However, I'd recommend having either some experience with vector calculus \/ linear algebra prior, or having plans to practice the concepts further later on down the line. This class is excellent, however, it inherently misses a lot of basic concepts and applications in those subjects. This is no accident, though it is certainly possible that MATH 120 would be more useful for a student without experience in these areas. Otherwise, I'd highly recommend to anybody vaguely interested in proof-based math, and not afraid of a challenge.",
                "Absolutely! This is a good taste for those who are unsure about a stem major, and a wonderful introduction to proof based math for anyone. The excercise of logic will benefit me in areas well outside of math.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but with the caveat that this will undoubtedly be a challenge. The workload is pretty heavy, and this is a class that is intentionally made to be difficult, so you're going to need to invest some real time into it to succeed. That being said, it is a very intellectually fulfilling course and it is worth it.",
                "I would 100% recommend MATH 230 to any student who enjoys math. It was a lot of work, and there were some hard proofs, but it always felt worthwhile. There's nothing more satisfying than finishing a proof and knowing that you have internalized some portion of the vast beauty of mathematics. Collaboration was not only allowed, but actively encouraged; in fact, Pat (Prof. Devlin) helped us to form study groups and meet other people in the class. I am very excited for the next semester of the sequence (MATH 231).",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone seeking a calculus background or pursuing a math major. It is very well organized course; though, it does have a high workload.",
                "I would recommend this course only if a student is very interested in math and doesn't already have an already intensive schedule. Students constantly hear that the course is very difficult and tend to brush it off, but its important to recognize it really is very difficult and tests the limits of most students. That said, its a very beneficial course if taken and does a lot to improve math skills.",
                "This course is a great intro into proof based mathematics and I would absolutely recommend it to students who think they might be interested in such mathematics.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course - it is the quintessential \"high workload, high reward\" class which really trains you to become a logical thinker and a great problem solver. Pat teaches this class in an engaging manner and communicates his enthusiasm for proof-based math. While you may not pursue more proof-based math in the future, the class is still helpful, nonetheless, in preparing you for other classes which focus on theoretical, abstract concepts.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially someone that is interested in getting into proof-based math. This course was geared toward all backgrounds and was generally very enjoyable.",
                "YES! Everyone who wants to pursue math or any QR-related field should absolutely take this class. Pat says on the syllabus that there are \"virtually no prerequisites,\" which is true because we literally derived all of vector calculus from nothing, so it's meant to be accessible to everyone at Yale (not having AP Calculus AB\/BC could make this harder though, I'm not sure.) Proof-based math is something that is relatively new even to people with lots of math experience, simply because no classes before this one work that way. But Pat doesn't assume any knowledge of proofs and makes learning extremely accessible, even through this year's virtual format. (He also lets you substitute a p-set question every week if you go to cool Yale math events!) The TA\/ULA staff was amazing (the best of all my classes at Yale this fall) and were super helpful in office hours. It's objectively a lot of work, and you'll probably have to think more in this class than anywhere else in your semester, but it's so worth it when you're able to flawlessly put together a string of logic to complete an analysis proof at the end of the term using exclusively things you have learned in 230. I can't wait for 231 this spring :)",
                "yes! I feel like I understand math much better now by having an intuition of how different definitions and theorems are proven",
                "I mean unless you are that dedicated to put in the time and dedication to learn everything on your own then I suggest not.",
                "I'd recommend this course to anyone who a) loves math or b) wants to get better at proof-based math but hasn't yet had the opportunity, or has found the content hard to approach. This is a great proofs class to take as a first-year.",
                "Yes! I found it easy to stay engaged throughout the semester",
                "Yes. I think anyone with an interest in proof-based math should take this course. It gave me a much stronger foundation than I had gotten from other non-proof-based calculus and linear algebra courses. I felt much more comfortable approaching a proof by the end of the course, whereas I started the semester feeling very insecure about this.",
                "Yes. Its a good course.",
                "Iff they are interested in pursuing math or are willing to work through many long nights. Math 230 is one of those experiences that is grueling and difficult to press on through but incredibly rewarding in retrospect. You really learn how to write proofs. The decision is personal and based on how much you are willing to put into this class. I would definitely recommend shopping it and determining whether you think it is a good fit. Also, remember that help is always there in the form of office hours and friends.",
                "Yes, but I would warn them that Math 230 is a significant time commitment",
                "I would strongly recommend. The flexibility made the workload very manageable, and the material was fascinating. Pat is great.",
                "Yes!",
                "I recommend this course to other students as long as:\r\n1. You've covered the material of math 115 and everything that comes before it. Pat says that there are no prereqs, but it is implied that you have taken calc 1 and 2 (derivatives and integrals). If you wanna take it despite this, you should talk to him about it I think (or whoever the future instructor is).\r\n2. You're interested in a math major. If that's the case, this is a GREAT intro. Pat walks you through everything very clearly.\r\n\r\nI had basically 0 experience writing proofs coming in, and I have succeeded in the course.\r\n\r\nNote that this class does not cover applications of concepts. So if you want to do engineering or something you should maybe take MATH 120 or ENAS 151. We didn't spend any time evaluating derivatives or integrals. Rather, we were proving things ABOUT derivatives.",
                "Absolutely, if the student has an interest in math or wants to have an interest in math. The lectures were great, the psets were not only fun and informative, they were a highlight of the week for myself and many of my classmates. The untimed final exam walked us through some of the most beautiful math Ive ever seen. All in all 230 makes you really appreciate math.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in math, regardless of how much experience you've had with proofs. If you engage with this course enough, you'll get a lot out of it.",
                "100% if you are vaguely interested in math take this course! It is wonderful, just marvelous. The content is fun and interesting, Pat is a great teacher, and you learn SO much math. I've never felt like I've gotten more out of a course than 230. I learned how to be a great problem solver, overcome struggle, and boatloads of math. If you want to take a course in which you will not only learn math but how to thrive academically and push yourself, take this course! Also, the psets and tests are so satisfying and make you feel like you are learning a crazy amount.",
                "Yes, highly. If you have a passing interest in proof based math, I would recommend you at least try this course. The instructor is fantastic and makes the course material feel particularly special.",
                "Yes; the instructor is excellent and very caring and the content is strong.",
                "Yes I would highly recommend, but only if the student has a strong interest in math."
