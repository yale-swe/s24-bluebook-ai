At least this semester, the course was structured around a final paper (or for those writing it, a senior essay) for which there are several checkpoints through the semester to keep you on track. The workload is manageable, and the content is always well selected for good discussion in class. Professor Harris is also excellent, made the class really straightforward and enjoyable to be in.",
                "The strengths are that the course materials and lectures with a broad through thorough survey of research on the dimensions and implications of the carceral state at federal, state, and local levels while also providing students with insightful knowledge about causal inference, research designs, and the limitations of research studies. Another strength is that Professor Harris is extremely accessible and provides clear expectations and feedback that help students improve their writing and research (i.e. outlining ways to construct a concise, clear, poignant thesis statement).",

The structure of the course (e.g. selecting your own dates for the response paper, submission of weekly discussion questions) makes it so that you stay engaged with the course material, but never feel particularly overwhelmed. A great course that teaches a lot about the criminal justice system as a whole, as well as broader institutions and historical trends which create the environment around crime, policing, and jailing that we see today.",
