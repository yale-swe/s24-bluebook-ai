                "Prof. Velozo is a deity at teachingabsolutely phenomenal, transcendental, even. In his classroom, it was as if his words showered my mind with a relentless torrent of knowledge and math abilities. As someone who was about to give up on math prior to deciding to give it one more try, Prof. Velozo's Math 300 has changed my life for the better. I will definitely keep engaging in mathematics in the future, with fond memories of my time in Prof. Velozo's class.",
                "This course was well-taught but at times went a bit fast for me. Office hours were extremely helpful, but I did find some problem set questions to be particularly challenging.",
                "Great class! Everything is very well explained and office hours are incredibly helpful",
                "I thought the class well taught but had some concerns with grading. Grading was very tough and only half of the problem sets questions were graded since there was only one grader instead of the usual two. I felt like the questions I struggled with were always graded. Just based on the way grading out of 30 vs 60 worked I felt this lowered my grade. I liked the option to complete a project to boost your grade",
                "The strength of this class was the professor, Anibal. He is a phenomenal professor, best math professor Ive had at Yale so far.",
                "This course is now defunct so it doesn't really matter.",
                "Strengths: the professor and peer tutors were very engaging and always willing to answer questions for the psets; the psets were very relevant to what we were learning in class",
                "Anibal is a great professor who makes all the course material very very clear. He's definitely the best part of the course since other math courses often don't have the same level of clarity on the material and what's expected.",
                "The class was a great introduction to the language of analysis. This doesnt feel like a class building up to some climax (like Math 250 does to Stokes Thm), but it does give you the tools youd need for higher level analysis proofs. It was a really great class, but if there had to be one improvement, it would have been nice to talk about multiple definitions for certain terms and how they reconcile with the ones we used",
                "The topics in this course are weaved together BEAUTIFULLY. Psets and exams (take-home) were all reasonable in length with interesting, modestly-challenging questions that furthered understanding of the material. The pace was quick while sacrificing little in depth, which I consider a strength (there admittedly were a number of statements that we used but didn't prove, though I'd argue this was for the best).",
                "Anibal was a fantastic instructor and that's the clear first strength. Also the problem sets were very reflective of class material (had the perfect amount of overlap between studied material and new material). Also, Anibal gave us several breaks during the semester by making several psets optional, which made the entire class much more manageable considering we didn't have a Spring Break.\r\n\r\nOne improvement is that we were short a grader in the course so only 3 out of 6 problems on each pset got graded, so there were a bunch of questions we didn't get direct feedback on.",
                "A lot of strengths. The lectures were engaging. The problem sets were interesting and not overwhelmingly long or difficult. Exams were very fair. The topics were relevant and crucial to a good mathematical understanding.\r\nHonestly, the only weakness is that this class wasnt in person. I think the class wouldve been even better."

                "Yes. This course is a great introduction to analysis, especially if Prof. Velozo is teaching it. The workload is reasonable (1 pset a week) but expect to spend a good amount of time on it. Some problem sets took me a couple hours, while others took me days.",

However, try to take it with Professor Velozo, he really cares about the students' understanding of the material and went at a reasonable pace for the difficulty of the topics. The class is challenging and psets and exams are tough, but you will come out with a lot more proof practice and hopefully a deeper understanding of basic calculus and general math topics.",
                "I would definitely recommend if Anibal is teaching. It is a great foundation for analysis, follows directly from Vector Analysis.",

                "If you want to learn a more in-depth treatment of calculus and functions, then yes. It's pretty cool material if you like math.",
                "It's not the type of course most people would take for fun, but it certainly wasn't painful. Some parts were pretty cool, and there's many resources available to help with psets and understanding the content.",
                "Definitely! You learn a ton, and its not super difficult. A great, accessible intro to analysis.",
                "ABSOLUTELY. This course is wonderful, especially with Professor Velozo (he alone is enough of a reason to recommend this course). The systematic way he presents the topics in this course keep the pace quick and exciting, while providing so many of those \"aha!\" moments when he helps make connections between topics. Assignments are fair in length and difficulty (fair for a math pset meaning challenging enough to force you to engage with the material, without consuming your entire week). I guess the caveat is that you kind of need to like math in order to enjoy this kind of course, but chances are the students looking at this either like math or need to take this course anyways. So, go ahead and take it!",
                "Yes. Take this course early since it is a prereq to many other math courses (this was a mistake I made). Also I would recommend this course especially if it is taught by Anibal. He is passionate about this material and very knowledgeable in it, and it shows in his lectures. He is also a very forgiving and accommodating professor who cares about his students' mental health (he gave us several optional psets because we didn't have a spring break this semester, and he has accommodated pset extensions as well). The material is interesting and not too abstract since after all, it is all focused on analysis of the real line. The midterm and final were very fair, and Anibal even offered a small project option to boost your grade. The psets aren't bad, and office hours are very helpful. Take it!",
                "YES!!! Please take this course! Im really sad that Anibal is leaving for Chile, but he really made this class my favorite class of this academic year. I couldnt wait for the next lecture, because the things we learn are so fundamental to understanding mathematics, especially calculus. He really explained each topic really well, providing a solid intuition of how everything works, without assuming that you already know everything. I wish the math department hired more people like him, because we need more inspiration in the math world, not gatekeeping, snobbery, and exaltation of genius."
