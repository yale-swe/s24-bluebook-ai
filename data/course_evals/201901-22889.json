   "comments": [
    "Besides the obvious knowledge I gained from the books on the syllabi, I learned how to write stronger comparative papers and how to set up and lead a class discussion.",
    "I learned a huge amount about the subject matter, but also about methods of learning about history itself.",
    "I learned how to read historical works in the Western Canon and be able to reconstruct their main ideas\/arguments. I also learned to write more concisely and clearly.",
    "An amazing survey of Western political thought. My professor made the material really come alive for my class, helping us to draw connections between writers and between past and present. Highly recommend!",
    "I learned the major undercurrents of Enlightenment political thought and how to contextualize each thinker within the tradition in terms of their approaches to human nature, historical teleology, method, and disposition.",
    "Critical Thinking and analysis are a given, but Sorkins real skill is teaching people how to write very very well. My writing was certainly clearer and more precise after having left his class.",
    "This course taught me about historical and political thought in the Western canon. I learned how to analyze political texts, reconstruct arguments from texts, write papers, and actively participating in seminars.",
    "Participating in seminar discussion, leading seminar discussion"

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are too many to count. One particular weakness is that the readings are too long (in conjunction with other DS courses) to reasonably expect all students to complete. I understand students are expected to learn to manage their time better, but I think cutting out some reading and focusing on passages and chapters of particular importance would greatly benefit students.",
    "No weaknesses",
    "I think there could be a greater acknowledgment of who was left out of the canon and why. With each work, we should be having more conversations about why that given author was able to write in his or her time while others weren't due to the barriers posed by race, gender, and religion.",
    "The spring semester was all around more interesting and engaging than the first, bringing more contentious conversations to the table. This seminar would have been better if it's texts were chronologically lined up with the texts of the other courses, so we are not reading Marx before Hegel, Mill before Kant, etc.",
    "Maybe more evaluation and critical thinking about arguments rather than just charitable reconstruction? I mean they need to be balanced surely, its not a philosophy class. However, I would have liked to do more thinking about the merits and drawbacks of each thinkers ideas.",
    "The only weakness I found in this course was the syllabus: while for the most part it is great I feel there isnt enough time to look at certain works, while other works shouldnt be on the syllabus only because there are others that are more important (ex. Montesquieu).  The strengths were the brilliant students and excellent professor, as well as the way it was aligned with other DS courses.",
    "A lot of reading- both a strength and a weakness"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, provided that they are interested in the development of historical and political thought in the Western Canon.",
    "Absolutely. Its incredibly important stuff, and really enjoyable",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in the Western Canon.",
    "Yes! Definitely recommend. Every seminar forced me to rethink the work at hand, and I finished the semester feeling like I gained a great overarching understanding of Western political thought.",
    "I would recommend this course if the student is curious about the foundations of political thought and how they can build up from first premises and methods, but not if they wanted an extended inquiry into any one political topic or theory.",
    "Yes! Sorkin is a wonderful leader of class discussions. Youll always feel like ur contributing, but somehow he leads the discussion with a steady hand. Youll also be a much better writer.",
    "Because it is part of DS, I cant recommend the course by itself, although if it were a standalone course I definitely would.  It is a great course for anyone interested in Western political thought, and it also gives an interesting perspective on historical events that coincided with these authors.",
    "Yes- Sorkin is amazing and teaches you so much context and directs class super well"
