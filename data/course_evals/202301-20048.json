                "This class includes a lot of mechanical derivations and problem solving, but also ties back to the biology and clinical significance. We learned how to do these extremely complicated mathematical modeling problems but still kept the fundamentals all the way through. The main problems solved are modeling stress through an artery and inter cranial aneurysms.",
                "How to represent mechanobiological scenarios with math.",
                "Best class ever. I learned so much in this class. You learn about how to apply continuum mechanics to biological systems (pseudo-elastic behavior and neohookian [rubber-like]). You learn about how to model systems that involve both solid and fluid mechanics and their interaction. You learn about mechanobiology and biomechanics and their differences and respective importance. Why do we study the mechanics of biological systems? What is the point? These are things you cover repeatedly throughout the course.\r\n\r\nThrough solving problems, you learn generally how to think about biomechanical problems and problem-solving in general. \r\n\r\nYou learn about the history of mechanics as a field and how we got to where we are today.",
                "In the first half of the course, we learned about the mechanical properties of blood vessels and how to mathematically model their behavior; in the second half, we then applied this knowledge to study the biomechanics of aneurysms.  We also learned about the importance of the vascular system in human health and studied the pathology of various vascular diseases.",
                "I learned how to develop an approach to and solve 4 representative problems in vascular biomechanics. This course is also a nice application of solid mechanics if youve taken that before.",

However, there are not really any notes or slides so you better come to class and pay attention otherwise you will get lost in the math very quickly. This is not a weakness, just a warning for anyone thinking about taking this class and thinking they can skip half the classes.",
                "This course is extremely well organized and thought out. The pace matches the students and the Professor is incredible. Everyone gets to interact with the material and come out understanding it.",
                "The Professor is great and he teaches at a decent pace and is open to questions.",
                "Strengths:\r\nProfessor Humphrey is an exceptional teacher and a living legend within biomechanics. He is extremely kind and gives you a birds-eye view and zoomed in view of biomechanics and mechanobiology. The course is challenging in terms of the concepts, but not overwhelming with work. The course is extremely well taught which makes the challenge manageable. The grading isn't tough.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nIt's only offered every other year! In order to get through more problems, Professor Humphrey often has to say \"it can be shown that...\" which he joked about often. While this enables us to cover more stuff, it also means you don't get a lot of detail in those derivations.",
                "Strengths - Prof. Humphrey is a fantastic lecturer who has an incredible depth of knowledge about the field.  He keeps the lectures very engaging while balancing conceptual lessons with the physics side.  Overall, the lectures are much more difficult than the homework (which Humphrey keeps sparse) and the exams.  \r\n\r\nWeakness - Lectures are fast-paced and cover a lot of material, but he lectures on a whiteboard.  While this makes them easier to follow because you can see the step-by-step progression of derivations and problems, there aren't any uploaded notes or recorded lectures, and catching up on missed lectures is very difficult to do.  The final exam/paper combo is also kind of tough.",

                "Eloquently taught by an expert in the field.",

                "Yes because its just a great course and although its tough its worth it.",
                "I absolutely recommend this course. It is easily the best BME elective, and, along with Physio, one of the two best courses. Prof. Humphrey is an incredible teacher, brilliant scientist, and is very kind. The course is fascinating and isn't too much work. It's challenging without being stressful.",
                "Yes for any BME majors looking for an engaging upper-level elective, as well as any students interested in human vasculature.  Professor Humphrey is a fantastic lecturer, and the class doesn't assign too much work or have particularly difficult exams.",
                "Yes you should take this class if youre interested in research, medicine, or industry. If serves as an introduction to the mechanics of the cardiovascular system that no other course at Yale can replicate. Be warned, this course contains as much math as youd expect from a biomechanics course.",
