However it could teach the students even more if the pace over the entire semester were somewhat quicker, which may be a problem specific to having to accommodate speaking and repeating to zoom class. Professor Illakowicz provides more than enough feedback and all the opportunities a student could want to get ahead however and focus on learning polish.",
