                "The projects were very interesting.",
                "Richard's lectures are definitely one of the best ones I have attended. My favorite class at Yale!",
                "Great content, super practical education in building systems. Problem sets were great and felt very relevant to lecture content. However, the lecture pace was often too fast.",
                "I really enjoyed this class. There was a lot of support which made tackling difficult content not overwhelming. You learn very applicable skills, but also a lot of theoretical background on how most systems work nowadays.",
                "Strengths: the format of covering both breadth (mostly in lecture material) and depth (e.g. the Raft pset) worked extremely well for making the content feel accessible and relevant. Psets were long but focused on useful material, and grading was fair. Some approachable extra credit was offered. I liked having the chance to explore a topic in the course more in-depth through the final project.\r\nWeaknesses: Prof. Yang should slow down his lecturing speed. More proactive teaching staff support would be helpful (holding smaller, spaced out review sessions or more frequent check-ins). For the project, I quickly found out it's really difficult to build anything in distributed systems in a month! I think more time or encouragement toward a smaller project scope is needed.",
                "strengths: strong instructors support, informative lectures, interesting labs, a lot of office hours, helpful study guide\r\nweaknesses: this course doesn't provide recordings by default, so you need to attend lectures in person, or you will spend more time on the materials to prepare the midterm",
                "Strengths: psets were very fun and challenging, staff were all quite receptive and helpful, weaknesses: the lectures could be a bore, and Yang went through too much content in too little time.",
                "The lectures were well-prepared and motivated, and the problem sets were engaging and interesting. While it's hard for distributed systems, I think some smaller more tangible examples and applications of things would have been useful for some concepts.",
                "It's very interesting, but pretty hard at times. I think it goes over materials faster than I could follow.",
                "Lecture content is always really interesting and relevant, and we get guest lecturers from very accomplished members of the field. The pacing of the class is quite fast, but if you're willing to put in the work it's very rewarding.",
                "Strengths: The material is so useful to learn and the teaching staff puts a lot of thought into the design of the course. The PSETs are interesting and the midterm is fair. Weaknesses: although Professor Yang is receptive to feedback about this, the lectures go by very quickly and are hard to follow at times.",
                "The course has an incredible professor, Richard, and Xiao who's long graduated acts as a fantastic TA/instructor due to his commitment to the class and experience at Meta. The course goes through material very quickly and the labs come fast, but you learn a lot. The labs were a huge amount of work but I really enjoyed them.  The grading at the same time was fairly nice though the presentation of our results could use some work (being an inscrutable csv row).",

                "Strengths: the problem sets, guest speakers of significance in the distributed systems world, writing in Go; Weaknesses: hard to learn from lectures since they go too fast and slides aren't clear",
                "Strengths: professor yang was very knowledgeable and xiao was also very helpful in offering his knowledge from industry",
                "strengths: really good psets, excellent help from Xiao/Prof Yang/ULAs, exam covers a ton of content but is fair, lots of opportunities to earn extra credit and be rewarded for working hard, insightful guest speakers weaknesses: lectures cover a lot of content & psets are barely spaced out. most of them are not terribly difficult, but they are often released one week after the other, so you only effectively have a week to do some of the easier psets",
                "Raft pset is simply too difficult. I spent over 100 hours on it and still failed the pset. Another weakness is that the professor can be hard to follow in class often."

                "Yes, being able to work on the projects was a good experience.",
                "Definitely, for the wonderful professor.",
                "Yes! Definitely one of the better upper-level computer science electives. You usually get what you put into Yale, and this class is a great example--higher workload, much higher reward.",
                "Absolutely. I am not sure when this will be offered again but it is really cool to learn a topic like distributed systems. You cover so much, networking topics, consensus algorithms, k8s, databases, etc. You basically get to see a practically implementation of distributed systems which is super cool and very applicable in the world we live in where streaming services, online apps, and IoT devices are taking over. Pretty much all of the internet uses these systems and it would be criminal to not be exposed to this topic during your CS education. You get to implement RAFT, which is the consensus algorithm that most distributed systems actually use nowadays. Also, Yang brings in industry experts, including the guy who designed RAFT!!, to hold lectures about current developments in the field. It was a neat experience. Also, Yang managed to get Xiao, a former Yale grad, to help teach this course. Xiao is a distributed systems guru who has made significant contributions to Meta's distributed systems and he helped teach the course on only a ULA's compensation, shout out to him! Yang is a very intelligent guy too... he's super nice and really cares about students and their learning. As a result, even though this class is hard, if you stay engaged and do the work you will definitely do well. Don't worry about the grade, Yang awards students who do hard work. Even if this class doesn't get taught again, definitely don't miss out on any other course taught by Yang before graduating... Overall, if this class is being taught TAKE IT! I am so so glad I did and 15 CS courses later, I think this is my favorite I took during my time at Yale.",
                "100% without a doubt -- as long as they have some solid time to devote to it. Firstly, this course is a great chance to get to know Prof. Yang in an individual setting and to make connections with teaching staff who are extremely knowledgeable (and in some cases are on the forefront of some of the lecture material). Psets: on the time-consuming side and came one after the other without much of a break. Nonetheless, some (such as Raft) were extremely rewarding, as they guide you through building bits and pieces of actual distributed systems implementations with many of the ideas in use in industry. Be prepared for >=10 hours of psets a week. Most test cases were public, grading was fair, and the midterm was a reasonable test of knowledge. The lectures' emphasis on design principles (making tradeoffs, abstraction, etc) and in-lecture design exercises sets this course drastically apart from Theory of Distributed Systems in a way that was strongly appealing to me as a systems-builder. You could feasibly take this course as just another CS credit... but I would strongly recommend slowing down, taking a 4-credit semester, and giving yourself the time to process and pay attention to all the details crammed into the lectures. It's not 323, but the course is an attempt to cover much of the breadth of a massive and expanding field. Perhaps in this course more than any other I've yet taken in the CS department, you get out what you put in: there are so many connections and patterns weaving in and out of the various topics and tools of distributed systems that any effort you can give will be worth it.",
                "Yes if you prepare to input a lot of time and want to take challenges. The labs are not easy and require a lot of input. But they are quite rewarding.",
                "Yes, if they would like to dip their toes in distributed systems especially in industry.",
                "Yes, probably the most useful course after data structures/algos for CS students going into industry, but be prepared to have some very busy and some lighter weeks",
                "Yes, learned a lot.",
                "Who knows if this class will ever be taught again so consider this review a tribute to the class. The guest instructor Xiao Shi was the star of the show, writing many of the psets, answering many of the Ed posts in detail, and providing invaluable insight from doing Distributed Systems engineering and research at Meta for 6 years. The content is incredibly cool about the theory and practical aspects about building systems that use distributed machines and the challenges that come along with it. However, sometimes the execution got botched with, in my opinion, confusing or hard to follow lectures. The psets were a great learning opportunity though with us completing an introduction to concurrent programming in Go (~10 hours), a Video Recommender Service to practice RPC networking (~20 hours), Kubernetes deployment (~10 hours), the infamous Raft (~40+ hours), and Distributed Sharding (~20 hours split among a group of at most 3), along with a final project. The first 4 psets were before Spring break, while the last one, midterm, and final project were after. The class felt like a 5.0 workload before break and then 3.5 after break. The midterm was the hardest Ive ever studied for an exam in 30 credits, but it all felt worthwhile as we were given a study guide of questions we needed to know the answers to. While it was a lot of work at times, we were rewarded with lenient grading (with lots of partial credit) and a wealth of practical knowledge.",
                "Definitely. Best CS class I've taken at Yale. Professor Yang and TF Xiao really care about your success in the class.",
                "Yes, I would take this even if youre not planning to go into the field. The topics you cover are important, but keep in mind that youll likely get as much out of the course as you put in. The teaching staff is great and very accommodating.",
                "Yes! Be forewarned it's a ton of work and some argue Raft is the hardest pset at Yale (debugging it and understanding the paper behind it perfectly is very difficult). That said you learn a ton! I strongly recommend it *if* you have the bandwidth.",
                "Yes! The content we learned this semester feels very applicable to work in the industry, as we have seen many technologies that are widely used currently (Raft, etcd, gRPC for example). Go was really interesting to learn and it felt like it was the right language for the class with its built-in support for concurrency. I learned a lot through the programming labs (especially with implementing Raft and a key-value store).",
                "Only if you have a genuine deep interest in distributed systems from a practical standpoint. The lectures are really difficult to follow as Richard speaks really fast and the slides are not detailed, and the attendance of lectures dropped over the course of the semester. I think I learned more from the problem sets though, which were good quality though Raft took a substantially long time (spreading 50 hours over 3 weeks). Overall, I still would recommend as it is one of the more practical CS courses at Yale and you do get a good handling of concurrency programming and RPCs with Go.",
                "I would recommend to any student interested in building large scale systems, although prior knowledge in computer networks is definitely helpful/recommended",
                "yes, I think this is a great course for any CS major who wants to challenge themselves. it's probably the best course out of all the \"hard\" CS electives and possibly all the electives in the department. Prof Yang really cares about making sure that students are well-prepared for industry and spend time actually learning things that are useful. There are plenty of extra credit opportunities available for students, and the psets/exams aren't designed to be impossible or nitpicky but instead challenge students and reward them for hard work. Xiao is also very helpful and responsive as a member of the teaching team. The only thing is, make sure the rest of your course workload isn't super heavy. Some of the deadlines for this class are spaced apart by only a week or so, and you have to be constantly on top of assignments and lectures to do well. The work itself isn't super hard, but it's all about time management. Taking the class with friends is also super useful because one of the assignments can be done in a group, which makes it significantly less work.",
