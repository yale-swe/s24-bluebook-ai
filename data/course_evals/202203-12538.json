Professor Miller emphasized studying the big effects and brought primary literature in as evidentiary material for the relevance and importance of topics in physical organic chemistry.",

                "Final exam didn't test on a lot of content that seemed relevant to the course, such as Kinetic Isotope effects, Linear free energy relationships, FMO analysis of pericyclic reactions (Diels alder, electrocyclic reactions, carbene reactions, migratory shifts). Instead it tested on some more obscure topics that didn't seem as relevant, such as Native Chemical Ligation, choosing whether a hexaphenyl ethane would exist as a diradical, and light induced isomerization (which didn't seem to be covered at all in the radical chemistry lecture at all). I think challenging exams are fine, as long as the topics tested on are given reasonable exposure to the students. It seemed that the exam had too many concepts that weren't well covered or didn't have any practice problems to help prepare for the questions.",
                "This class has a lot of interesting material, i think lecture could get a bit hard to focus on with the explanations of papers made it hard to connect with the lecture material",
                "Kept to topics which I found to be very relevant. Sometimes slides were a little overwhelming.",
                "I think this class provides a lot of great concepts that are relevant to all organic chemists and the use of real-world examples helped me see how physical organic concepts are applied. I wish that there were more practice problems during class as that would help me see how I can apply topics.",
                "Lot of notes. sometimes wanted more core concepts but overall great class.",
                "It is a wonderful course.",
                "I greatly appreciated learning about physical organic chemistry concepts though exposure to the primary literature from different fields of chemistry. Another strength of this course is Professor Miller's enthusiasm for the field and for teaching. I also enjoyed the weekly/biweekly problem sets that allowed me to consolidate the knowledge gained in class.",

Prof. Miller introduces a lot of examples at the intersection of organic chemistry and biological processes and the MO theory explanation of multiple processes (like pericyclic reactions) aided in my understanding of why some reactions are allowed or prohibited.",
