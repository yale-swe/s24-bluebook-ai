                "I think this course is really informative but could benefit from reordering the material for a more cohesive timeline. Information got a bit confusing and felt like we were jumping around topics a bit",
                "Strengths: It's a good introduction to some practical applications of techniques so is useful for applying to our own research and the material is kept very up to date with new advances in biology.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The homework was time-consuming and sometimes had information/concepts/equations not covered in lecture so took a lot of outside research to complete. Discussion sections were not super helpful.",
                "This course is well-crafted. The homework assignments are difficult, but they kept me engaged with the material and ensured that I was keeping up in the class. I think some of the homework assignments could be improved through clearer wording. Often times, I would spend quite some time just trying to figure out what the question was asking for. The lectures were fast-paced, which was difficult but also necessary in order to get through the abundance of material for the course. I do not think there should be a homework assignment due the week of the final exam as it limits student studying and I also think it would be beneficial if TA sessions were held in the day or two before a homework assignment is due.",
                "This course is very good course to know the basic knowledge of structure biology and optical biophysics. But the biophysics about the molecules can be more and more detail",
                "Strengths: Professors were clear and taught the material well. Their lectures were usually clear. The material was overall interesting and I learned a lot about different techniques used.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish that there was more examples/biological context to how the techniques were used and why one would prefer one technique over the other. Also, some of the homework problems were presented in a vague/unclear manner, but the problem was resolved by going to office hours.",
                "The homework can be better worded and proofread. The TF session is best to be held at a later time. It is really inconvenient to have it around 3 pm for me to arrange my schedule in lab rotations.\r\n\r\nI like how the course material is arranged. Although the final is a bit heavy on techniques, I like how I can connect X-ray Crystallography and Cryo-EM by wave-object interactions and review them together.",
                "Strength: information from the lectures are effectively taught and intriguing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: problems sets are very frequent, some questions that require the use of a software (e.g. PyMol) are very difficult due to a lack of prior practice in such software, spans a very large number of areas in biochem and biophysics of which not everyone will ultimately end up using and have fundamental understanding.",
                "Some of the lectures felt disjointed from their place in the course, and quite a few jumped around topics quickly",
                "The lectures were clear and engaging, and the material was interesting. Maybe a hands-on demonstration that students can take part in or a visit to microscope facilities would be useful during the microscopy lectures. Some of the homework questions felt too challenging to approach without consulting the TAs."
