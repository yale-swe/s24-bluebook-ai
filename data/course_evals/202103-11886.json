                "Ive learned more about integrals, series, and calculus II topics, but also how to analyze differential equations/systems, understand biological readings with differential equations models, create and understand phase planes, and classify and understand phase plane solutions/straight line solutions.",

I built upon mathematical foundations that were reinforced throughout the course and used to model these systems. The class also made me think about certain mathematical approaches in different ways.",

                "I learned how to analyze differential equation models, draw direction fields, use Euler's method, how to analyze/draw phase lines and phase planes, determining the stability of equilibria, evaluating integrals, infinite series, and partial derivatives. I also learned how to analyze biological models (ie epidemic models, predatory and prey, etc) in the lens of differential equations.",

                "In general, I think what you learn in this class can be broken down into two subparts: calculus 2 concepts and knowledge about mathematical modeling. I feel like a lot of the calculus concepts you learn are somewhat unrelated to the modeling component, therefore, this modeling requires separate lecturing and cannot be inferred, per se, by the calculus you learn in class. Despite this, you do learn a lot about both. At the end of the course, you even yet into some multivariable calculus concepts such as partial derivatives. By the end of class, I also feel like we deviated from calculus 2 and ended up learning a lot of specific methods for the analysis of biological models. That being said, I feel like the greatest skill I came out of this class with is being able to read certain scientific articles and recognize and understand the math that they are applying.",
                "Apart from traditional calculus, I learned skills to be able to read scientific articles and understand the mathematical models behind them. At the beginning of the term, I had to memorize what different parts of the model meant, and at the end, I was able to figure it out by looking at the terms of the model in the context of the article.",

                "In Math 116, I was able to learn the basics of calculus 2 through the aspect of biological sciences. I was able to not only learn the material from calculus 2, but also apply the models I learned in class into real-life applications. The class taught me the basic integration skills and taylor series (which I have never been exposed to in high school). I also learned basic 2-D models and learned how to analyze 3-D models through linearization. The class was fast paced, but it was able to give me a quick review on calculus 1 and introduce me to all of the concepts in calculus 2 while applying them to real life cases through biology.",

I took this course as a pre-med requirement, but it actually ended up being super interesting and I'm very glad that I took it. Math 116 allowed me to understand how mathematical modeling applies to HIV dynamics, neuron firing, ozone depletion, influenza epidemics, and other important biological phenomena. Through the readings and problem sets, I effectively learned how to apply the knowledge I learned in class.",
                "I learned how to apply modeling to biology.",

Throughout the course of the semester, we learned various methods for solving + finding solutions to individual differential equations. Additionally, we learned methods for analyzing systems of differential equations, with regards to both equilibrium points of systems of differential equations and behavior of solutions to systems of differential equations. We also developed insight into how the concepts we learned in class were applied to the scientific literature of various disciplines of the natural sciences. In addition to all of this, we learned about the more traditional Calculus II topics (series, integration techniques, etc.).",
                "I learned a lot about differential equaitons from this course, and the different ways in which they can be applied to math problems in order to find solutions. I think I developed stronger reading skills as a result of the many biological research papers we read throughout the course. The papers also helped me learn how to understand how mathematical models can be applied to real life scenarios and the limitations of these models.",

                "Boring but intellectually challenging",
                "Strengths - exactly as described, it's a good blend of calculus and science/applications. PSets, notes, readings prepare you for exams. Exams are representative of content covered. Accessible peer and professor office hours.",
                "Weaknesses: psets were sometimes insanely hard based on what had been covered in lecture, would have to spend an inordinate amount of time in office hours in order to be able to get psets done \r\nPros: Hall is an awesome prof and is good at explaining things clearly, also just a kind guy who really wants to see everyone succeed",
                "Strengths: Professor Hall explains the material clearly and thoroughly. Class is engaging. Workload is manageable and practice exams actually help in preparation for exams. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it felt like we were cramming material during class. Some material would be covered briefly during class and then it would be on exams.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hall clearly and concisely explains the reading concepts and the way that lecture is organized (concepts with examples to show the concept) worked well for my understanding, there are many office hours, and the exams are reflective of the many practice resources, problem sets, and lecture material\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "The workload of this course was very very high - we had weekly psets as well as readings.  But the instructors and peer tutors are wonderful, and office hours were really helpful for making sure we were able to complete our work.",
                "I legitimately enjoyed going to class every day and felt like each lesson built upon the previous. There was never a day where I felt out of the loop of like we were covering something unexpected. However, this class can be a bit fast for students that have never taken a Calc BC course, so I recommend it for people who have some Calc BC experience but want to build upon their understanding.",
                "Strengths: -Prof. Hall is knowledgeable and a rather good lecturer; -there are lots of opportunities for help on PSets from peer tutors which are very helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: -material doesn't seem to be Calc 2 level (very far above); -HUGE emphasis on differential equations which is tough; -PSets are sometimes impossible without peer tutor assistance.",
                "A strength of the course is its focus on mathematical modeling and applying differential equations to actual systems such as epidemics or ecological systems. Even taking calculus BC before, I would say the majority of the class felt like new material, but it was never material that felt unnecessary, abstract, or uninteresting. Professor Hall is also an amazing lecturer and makes a genuine effort to get to know everyone in the class. A weakness might be that the course was a little disorganized or off on timing based on the agenda that was set and the time dedicated to each topic, but it was nothing too distracting nor troublesome.",
                "I loved this course! John almost always did a great job of explaining the concepts and the TAs were super helpful on the PSETs. I really enjoyed the math we learned even though I expected to not enjoy the class and was only taking it as a pre-med requirement. The practice exams and reviews sessions prepared students very well for exams, and the grading format of the course was conducive to improving throughout the semester (your lowest exam score counts for less of your grade than your highest exam score, students are not curved down so collaboration is always beneficial). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses of the course include: The PSETs were sometimes a little too high level, resulting in the TAs significantly struggling with some questions even though they had the answer key. I also wish there were recordings of the lectures so I could go back and review and / or make up missed lectures due to sickness.",
                "The course was very organized. I think a weakness was that the problem sets were a bit too difficult and thus took too much time.",
                "I loved the psets and how in-depth they were. They were great preparation alone for the exams. Perhaps, some of the homeworks may have been a little long depending on the week and how stressful other classes were.",
                "Strengths: very well taught! The progression of the course made a lot of sense and I genuinely feel like this is the best math class I've ever taken. \r\nWeaknesses: Nothing specific! I really enjoyed this course :)",
                "strengths: Professor Hall enjoys teaching the class and he's always willing to answer questions, and office hours and peer tutors are extremely helpful\r\nweaknesses: moves kind of fast, there isn't really a textbook to supplement the class so the only examples you can refer to for the psets are the ones from the notes, and the notes can only be acquired from class and aren't online. Make sure you have someone in the class to share the notes with you.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hall is a great, engaging professor how's enthusiasm for math allows for students to come to class interested in what the course has to offer. The course has a lot of resources to help students gain a better understanding of the concepts discussed in class. You can tell that Professor Hall wants to help students learn. The class allowed me to see math in the context of real-life. Weakness: Sometimes lectures felt like there should've been more time, at the end of some lectures it felt a little rushed to get through content and therefore faster to follow along with.",
                "I really liked the whole course",
                "A strength of this class is that the professor is very clear in what is expected of you and I feel like the breakdown of the class regarding how much certain assignments count towards your grade is fair. The class is extremely well organized and Professor Hall teaches in a way that is easy to follow. \r\nI feel like this course could be improved in a few main ways. First of all, more time could be spent on developing the foundational knowledge of calculus 2. Sometimes I felt like we rushed past the foundational knowledge to get to the mathematical modeling portion of that unit. Secondly, I feel like the mathematical modeling portion of the class and the calculus 2 component of the class could be better integrated. Lastly, I think the psets were unnecessarily difficult at times. Not all of the problems were extremely challenging, but some of them seemed impossible to figure out without the help of a peer tutor. Due to this, the peer tutor office hours were always packed. I think more peer tutors should be added.",
                "One strength of this course was that the peer tutors, who had taken the class before, as well as Professor Hall were always available to answer questions. This made it so that if I was confused, I could always quickly get answers. It was also amazing being able to see how math is used to model biological phenomena.",
                "A big strength in this course is that the exams are great reflections of what is learned in class/seen in p-sets/seen in practice exams. Another strength is that Professor Hall is a great teacher. One weakness is that this course is fast-paced, which makes it harder to understand difficult concepts.",
                "Strengths of this class was how straightforward it was. I was never confused that much on tests because the practices tests really go hand-in-hand. The professor did an amazing job at going through examples in class which appeared on tests and exams. A weakness of this course was how fast it was. I think there should've been checkpoints to seeing how much we were able to retain the information. But overall, the peer tutors were very helpful and the grading for psets and exams seemed extremely reasonsable.",
                "Readings are really engaging. \r\n\r\nProblem set questions often cover things we haven't really discussed in class, so going to peer tutoring is essential. Maybe this was the professor's intention, but I would have preferred to cover topics before being tested on them.",
                "Weaknesses: I wish the course was offered at more hours. Its sometimes hard to find a non-conflicting time in my schedule.\r\n\r\nStrengths: John Hall teaches the material extreme well, and the peer tutors are very helpful during office hours.",
                "John is a wonderful professor who makes a 9am math course engaging and digestible. The material itself is far more engaging than a normal math class just by nature of its applications. Psets are difficult but definitely manageable with office hours!",
                "The course was taught in a very interesting way, overall. Assignments were clear, and lessons were structured so as to be very easily understandable. However, the problem sets were much more difficult than the class example problems, and I could not have solved them without going to office hours every week. Office hours were essentially 3-4 hours of extra math class, which took a lot of time and prevented me from focusing on other classes. Problem sets could have been a bit shorter, and class problems could have been a bit more similar to the homework sets. The peer tutors were all incredibly helpful and always available to answer questions.",
                "I wish that the last chapter was more clear. It felt rushed at times.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hall is extremely dedicated and very passionate about math! He is a great professor to learn from. \r\nWeakness: The biological aspect of the class felt forced. The calculus we often learned had no correlation to the biological models we were reading about  it felt like the biology part of the class was just something extra we had to memorize.",
                "Strengths: Very good problem sets that test understanding, a good grading scheme, and a great professor\r\nWeaknesses: I think more examples and worksheets would be helpful.",
                "Course is really well balanced, with excellent office hours and instruction by John Hall. I can't really complain about any aspect",
                "The PSETS were difficult for me, but that was mainly because of my schedule. I would have enjoyed more readings, as I thought these were really, really interesting and helpful for understanding the applications of what we were learning.",
                "The beginning portion of class moves so quickly that it somewhat requires prior knowledge in the areas learned in order to not feel overwhelmed, like the Taylor polynomials and series.\r\n\r\nThe course was easily applied to everyday research and problems.",
                "I felt that the class material was definitely challenging for me, and so I was able to learn a lot. However I felt that in the scope of what it was trying to accomplish it was hard to find resources outside of peer tutor and office hours that would benefit me. (Peer tutor and office hours were integral to my understanding of the material)",
                "Strengths: As a whole, this course is strong overall in both content and organization. Lectures were structured and paced well, and examples of various problems we would see on problem sets were gone over. Readings were also addressed extensively in-class and in review sessions, and it was always clear what we would be expected to know for exams. The enriching curriculum of the course was definitely a strength. Concepts normally found in differential equation and linear algebra courses were introduced for the purpose of our analyses of differential equations, as needed. There were an adequate amount of office hours throughout the week for us to get any questions regarding content/problem sets addressed. \r\nWeaknesses: The single largest critique I have of the class is that the ULA's were not always clear about when office hours were rescheduled/cancelled. A smaller critique is that the no-extension policy is kind of unreasonable. I understand the intentions behind it, but allowing single-day or two-day extensions on problem sets will most likely not set students significantly behind. Beyond that, the course, as taken with John Hall, was truly phenomenal.",
                "The classes and PSETs do a great job of creating a balance beween lecture-style and collaborative learning. The exams also did a great job of evaluating the skills we were taught in class and through the PSETs. I have no suggestions for how this course could be improved.",
                "I believe one strength was really demonstrating the importance of calculus in biological modeling through real life research that used calculus in creating models, as well as evaluating them. One weakness was that the biological modeling felt more of an extra edition to the Calc II curriculum rather than a necessity or something that highlighted truly important calculus topics. When talking to friends in 115, they explained that a lot of the stuff we learned was not important to their class.",
                "I think the course content is fairly engaging and that Professor Hall is a very good teacher. He's very good at explaining things in a way that makes sense. To improve the course, it may be helpful to spend a little more time on difficult topics (specifically towards the end of the course).",
                "I felt as though it was hard to fully engage with the topics because they were not explained in enough contextual depth",
                "The readings and their explanations in class were a strength of the course; however, I would have liked to learn the differences between different types of differential equation models in more detail. For example, I know the difference between density dependent and frequency dependent disease transmission, but I don't know how transmission speed is effected by using either model. Also, explaining the changes from one model to another model using the readings would help me to differentiate between models.",
                "This course is different than most math courses but very engaging. I liked how it tied in scientific models. I think it will be very beneficial to my major and career in the future."

                "No it's boring-- take math 120 if u took multi before",
                "Yes. It's an interesting, relevant, and new class (at least for most people coming from high school calculus).",
                "Yup, only if you have a pretty firm handle on Calc BC to begin with, though. I think a lot of BC knowledge is already assumed in the class that makes things a bit tricky. Hall is a wonderful professor and once you get the hang of things it's all really interesting, so there is that.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course over MATH 115. I enjoyed the readings and the biological models we looked at were very interesting to me.",
                "Yes, if you're the kind of person who does better with math when it's applied.  I liked this course because everything we learned was based in a real-world context that made it more interesting.  But be prepared for a bit of a higher workload.",
                "Yes! If you're in need of a QR credit and are a stem major (specifically something bio-related), I think this is an interesting and useful class to take. We read over a few scientific research papers in the class, which is always good to be exposed to if you planning on going into the stem field.",
                "If you're choosing between 115 and 116, I would pick 115 (I wish I had). This course has the potential to be good, but there is an undue focus on differential equations (which my friends in upper-level math courses are covering). Friends in 115 had no idea what we were doing and there was not much of an emphasis on integrals.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because its the first time I have ever applied calculus to real biological models and systems and been able to connect differential equations to something in real life. I would recommend this to a student who has taken AP Calc BC before because most of the content is new and interesting, and it doesnt hurt to refresh calculus knowledge before moving to 120 (though I think jumping to 120/121 directly would be fine too based on what Ive heard). I would still recommend this course over 115 for people who have only taken AB before, but it might be challenging since you have to first learn the calc II skills and then apply them. However, Professor Hall and the peer tutors are always there if you ever need more help.",
                "Yes! I loved this course, and I actually found the math to be pretty fun even though I typically do not enjoy math. I'm grateful I took this course.",
                "Yes, the course was very interesting especially with the biological applications. The workload is manageable although the problem sets are very difficult and sometimes it felt as though the basic concepts were not reinforced enough before trying the difficult problem sets",
                "Yes! The professors are amazing and the course is very well taught. It goes beyond just learning and absorbing math!",
                "Yes! This was a wonderful course, and Professor Hall was super available for help at all times. The problem sets were very difficult, but since there was easy access to peer tutors and office hours, I felt like it was a manageable challenge. I really like how we talked about bio applications since it made math feel real and attainable for the first time.",
                "I would recommend this course to students that are premed or that are interested in math or biology since it helps you read and analyze papers, which is a skill you would need in the future. If you're looking for a fun/easy qr credit, don't take it. It is difficult if you do not have a background in calculus or if you aren't interested in the biology aspect.",
                "I would recommend it if you want a bit of a challenge in the way you think about math. I took AP Calc BC before this and while some of the concepts discussed in this class I knew, it was nice to see them in a different application. I would recommend this class if you want a math class that will expand the way you see math.",
                "Yes yes take this course if you get the chance it is highly applicable to all fields and fascinating especially during Covid",
                "Yes!! So much more interesting than regular Calc 2 (115). You really learn how to apply the math you are learning, making it more fun and engaging.",
                "Overall, I would recommend this course to a fellow student. If you plan on going into epidemiology or environmental science, I feel like this class would be especially useful. If you have already taken calculus 2 in the past, it is definitely doable because you would already have the necessary foundational knowledge. The mathematical modeling components add something new and interesting. If you have not previously taken calculus 2, I think that this class would require that you put in a lot of extra time outside of class. The professor does teach calculus 2 concepts, but the class goes through them very quickly and I think it would take a lot of time on your own to thoroughly grasp them. Also, be prepared to spend time attending office hours with the peer tutors. The psets are not terrible, but basically everyone had to go to office hours for help understanding some of the problems on every pset.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course because it allowed me to learn about math in a way I never have before. Especially if you are interested in pre-med/biology, this class teaches you skills in interpreting models that will be very helpful in reading scientific articles. Even though it wasn't a seminar class, the support from Professor Hall and the peer tutors was amazing.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who has learned calculus AB or BC and wants to major in something that involves biology. This class does provide a further challenge because the bio-aspect of the class, but it is definitely doable and is not extremely challenging.",
                "I would recommend this course if you'd like to see how math can complement biology. This course was less where the two were strongly intertwined, but more so calculus was some biology readings on the side.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to other students because the professor was very good at lecturing. The resources provided by the course was able to ensure that everyone is able to pass the class.",
                "Absolutely! I loved how so much of the work we did could be used in biologically significant situations.",
                "Absolutely. The course covers very interesting applications of math, and it makes calculus feel more tangible. Its also taught in a way that helps you to truly understand the concepts in it.",
                "Yes. Especially if you are interested in biological science but even if you are not.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to math majors, pre-med students, and anyone else interested in how math applies to biology. It was very different from my high school math classes, with more focus on real-world applications. The readings were very interesting, though often difficult to understand, but the professor did a great job of explaining them. The workload is a lot, but as can be expected from any STEM class at Yale.",
                "Yes! It was good",
                "Yes, if you are premed and want a much harder version of math 115. No, I would not recommend if you arent a math person like me.",
                "Yes, definitely! When you really try to understand the diseases and real-life models we are analyzing through math, it is breathtaking to see how simple it becomes. This class also helps you understand topics like differentiation very well.",
                "Absolutely, fantastic and engaging math credit.",
                "I would. This course was definitely a challenge for me, in a good way. It helped me to better learn how to approach problems, appreciate the process of figuring them out, and kept me engaged with the applications in the readings. I'm very glad that I was able to take this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to students going forward. It is a great class to be introduced to math at Yale because it allows students to see exactly where the math they are learning can be applied in the real world.",
                "I think that if you have some advanced background and are familiar with the concept you learned in a class such as BC calculus, you would benefit from expanding your understanding of biological models. However if you do not have a strong understanding in calculus and are looking for a class that focuses in that, this would not be the best class to start in. The problem sets are definitely challenging and a lot of extra studying is required.",
                "In a comparison of 115 v. 116, I would definitely recommend MATH 116 to be taken out of the two. The course, as taught through a frame of differential equations and methods of analysis, was infinitely more exciting to me than just a standard MATH 115 curriculum. Taking this course also made me realize that a working understand of math (more specifically, differential equations) is integral to a working understanding of many of the processes we see in the natural/life sciences. Just generally speaking, the soft introduction to differential equations and other pertinent Calculus II techniques is probably reason enough to take MATH 116.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I feel that, not only did I learn new skills in calculus, I also achieved a deeper understanding of the concepts we learned, which will make it difficult for me to forget the skills I have learned. The readings also provided an excellent way for us to understand applications of the mathematical concepts we learned to biological research.",
                "It depends. I feel like this course only appeals to those very interested in biological modeling. The course adds extra work to calculus II, so only people who really like math and biology and are willing to put extra work should take this course.",
                "I would recommend this class if interesting in how math connects to other topics. I thought it was more engaging than a typical math class. The workload is really not that bad if you attend peer tutoring and office hours.",
                "Yes, if you think it would be beneficial to your major. If not, I would recommend normal math 115."
