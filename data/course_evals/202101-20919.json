                "Strengths are the wealth of speaking practice and cultural knowledge that help the student comprehend the language at a deeper level. The biggest weakness is the textbook. This course uses pilot versions of an unreleased TOBIRA I and II textbook. I think this is only because someone at Yale was involved in making it. TOBIRA I is fine, though it still needs some work. TOBIRA II is unpolished and contains many errors, even in Japanese text which is very frustrating for students. A new version of this textbook or a new textbook is needed.",
                "This course requires a bit of daily work put into it in order to keep up with the material, but class time is honestly very fun, and it's such a small group that we become very familiar and comfortable with each other. There's never the feeling of being embarassed to speak in front of other people or of not knowing something. One thing is that you don't get a lot of individual feedback during the semester on the chapter tests, so you just don't ever find out how you did on the tests. That said, there's not really stress about grades as long as you put in the effort.",
                "I really liked the class because the teacher made it really fun. She also teaches in a way easy to understand. At some points, however, I thought that the course was going a bit too fast.",

Other than that, this class adapted very well to the virtual environment.",
                "The video assignments can take a while but they're really good practice for speaking. Even though the class is completely virtual, basically all of our classtime is interactive and the instructuor really engages the whole class. The instructor is also very understanding of personal situtations during the pandemic and also technical difficulties.",

                "I would only recommend this course to students with a strong interest in Japanese. The textbook TOBIRA II makes the second part of this course difficult due to errors in Japanese text, strange organization, and a pdf copy that fails to properly match the physical textbook. Additionally, I did not receive much feedback in this course. Grades came only at the end of the semester, and I never really had an idea of how I was doing in the class. The content is interesting, so students who love Japanese should enjoy the course, but those just interested in taking a language should choose a better organized one with a better book.",
