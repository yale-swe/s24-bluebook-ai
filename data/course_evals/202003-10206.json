This class focused on non-fiction narrative style writing with five different categories of focus: personal experience, place, person, cultural critique, and satire.

In doing this we learned how to write in a way that uses what we experience as a reader to convey and convince our readers of what we want to say in our writing.",

                "I cannot think of any weaknesses of this course. It was simply amazing - definitely the best course I have taken so far at Yale. The topics are all engaging and relevant. The discussions are thought-provoking and there is real improvement in student writing (which I saw in both myself and my classmates).",
                "Strengths: good reading selection, manageable workload, good feedback given on essays, GREAT professor who made class engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some more direction could've been giving when writing the essays (i.e. having a general outline of techniques used in the sample essays to then apply to our own writing)",
                "Strengths: Prof Shirkhani is a godsend. She is engaging, insightful, warm, compassionate and understanding, and she will do everything to make sure you are doing your best in her class. Her feedback on draft essays were tremendously helpful, and drastically improved the loose ends in my writing. The readings (sample essays) are also artfully chosen, covering a wide spectrum of genres and styles of personal narratives, and most were fun to read.\r\nWeaknesses: There is always a draft or final essay due soon, which is somewhat stressful, especially if you dont know where to start. I guess the stress contributes to your writing in some form though.",
                "Professor Shirkhani was amazing at teaching different writing techniques and tools through the sample essays we were given to read. I loved the essays that she chose for us to read and loved how we were able to discuss and ask questions about the essays. I also really enjoyed the workshops, both having my essay workshopped and being able to workshop the essays of my peers. I think both the structure and format of the class was awesome.",
                "Strengths: Professor Shirkhani. She provided a lot of insightful comments on the readings and your own writing. She would always see more in your writing than you did, and would suggest ideas to improve it. The reading list was amazing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Readings were difficult and required a lot of time, but hey, what do you expect?",
                "A strength of this course was the amount of feedback I got for each piece of writing I turned in for the course. A weakness was the amount of reading required outside of class time.",

The professor and seminar style also allowed us to foster a real sense of community and friendship among ourselves. I honestly met one of my best friends through this course - through Zoom private messaging! This was only possible because of the sense of community built into our discussions.",
                "I really appreciated how the professor dropped one essay. In other words, in a regular school year, 5 essays would have to be written; this year, you could choose not to write one. This lesser workload considered the external difficulties students already experience because of the pandemic.",
                "I think discussions went very well over zoom, but maybe incorporating the use of the chat and emphasizing that a bit more could help students who may be a little hesitant to participate in class.",
