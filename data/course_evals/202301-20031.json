The course is definitely a broad review. I took it with an intention of building a general understanding of how intelligent life forms and was guided throughout the whole process step-by-step. I gained understanding of common astrophysics\/astronomy terms like parallax or redshift and definitely feel more comfortable with the idea of exploring astrophysics in the future. The reading material is borderline philosophical in a good way, and I really enjoyed looking at being alive from a planetary & civilization-ary perspective.",

Its definitely not a gut but its doable, especially if you find a good TF. The tests are fair and the problem sets (while due at an unfortunate time) encourage you to research answers online.",
                "We learned about the basics of space, star and planet formation and discover, then talked about the evolution of life and the possibilities of life developing elsewhere in the universe. We went over qualities of individual planets, exoplanets, moons and how probable it is for life to be elsewhere and what to look for. We then discussed the search for extraterrestrial life and the methods to try to make contact. The class provided a great foundation for astronomy as well as the search for life in the universe.",
                "For starters, my perception of the vastness of our universe has grown. I always knew that the galaxies and the universe were big, and had heard of statistics like \"there are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on Earth,\" but I had never really comprehended this until I was exposed to the  computer simulations presented in class that honestly had my jaw dropped near the end. Also, when I first heard of Astrobiology, I was completely confused as to what we would be studying. Biology means life, and throughout my life, this had never crossed over with Astronomy. Although part of this course did deal with radio signaling and hypothesizing what types of life we would find in the galaxy and what conditions is necessary for life as we know it, the real takeaway was how exploring how we could apply this to the history of humanity, from the birth of our star to the formation of Earth to the first organism to intelligence and finally how our technology is affecting our home and what we might see if we don't change our actions.",

                "I have always been interested in astrobiology but never had the chance to study it formally. This course was exactly what I was looking for! It was very engaging despite being a lecture. The curriculum is exciting and teaches you a lot about extraterrestrial life in the universe.",
                "I learned about about our solar system, the scale of the universe, the basic requirements for the formation of life as we know it, how intelligent life formed on Earth, and the probability of finding technologically advanced intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.",
                "The field of astrobiology, and ideas in biology and astronomy",
                "You'll learn a good deal of intro astro, less intro bio, and an interesting, but far too small amount about information theory, contacting aliens, extremophiles, and the fermi paradox. Frankly, the most interesting content of the course---theories about what extraterrestrial life might look like and how to contact it---was only discussed to a disappointingly low extent. Most of the information we 'learned' about extraterrestrial life was common sense---we literally spent class time discussing why it would be a bad idea to try and talk to the aliens in english and the rest you could probably get from a few hours of watching Kurzgesagt on youtube. I found the introductory astro part of the course interesting, the readings in general were quite good, and the p-sets were challenging enough that they forced me to actually learn and remember things, but I wouldn't really recommend this course. I had high hopes but it was disappointingly boring.",
                "This course gave me a very surface-level overview of astrobiology, including the basics of star and planetary formation, origin of life theories on Earth, exoplanet research, potentially habitable exoplanets, and the search for intelligent extraterrestrial life. It was largely conceptual and no one subject was explored with great depth, as it was an intro level class. There was some pretty basic algebra that was required but that was explained pretty poorly and a lot of that required figuring it out on my own.",

Most of the class involves discussing exoplanets, Mars, and the many terrestrial moons of our solar system. Other main topics include origin of life theories, extremophiles , SETI, the Fermi paradox, the Great Filter, the Drake equation, interstellar travel via generation ships, and sending a message to a nearby exoplanet (our class chose Ross 128b).",

                "STRENGTHS:\r\n- Course material is incredibly interesting.\r\n- The course culminates in a message that we send to space, (hopefully) contacting aliens. This was really cool, and the students got a say in exactly what message we would transmit and what star we would transmit to.\r\n- Faison is funny and quite engaging.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES:\r\n- Psets were a bit vague at times. Sometimes they would require clarification from TFs in order to determine specifically what they were asking.  \r\n- Ed could've been more useful. I felt like it was mostly an afterthought, whereas in other courses, it's been much more helpful. \r\n- Lectures were often disorganized. Most of my learning in this class came from the readings or googling for psets rather than the lectures it seemed.",
                "I loved this course! Starting with the astronomy component made the course really interesting, and Professor Faison made the biology part easier to understand. I have to say that making the problem sets due at 11pm on Friday rather than Saturday made it a little difficult for me to balance time, but the late policy was reasonable.",
                "The topics discussed were very interesting, as well as the problem sets. However, the grading\/expectation on midterms was a little bit harsh, or not clear beforehand.",
                "Strengths include occasional really interesting material about the universe and our place in it. Weaknesses include confusing lectures, problem-sets that are unrelated to lecture\/reading content, and tough grading on exams.",
                "A strength is the topic itself, however, a big weakness is that it's formatted as a lecture. I feel like as it's more a topic of debate among scientists and critics alike, it'd be best adapted as a seminar.",
                "The PSET results come out pretty late. I am currently writing this one day before the actual final exam, and my PSET 10 grades had just been released.",
                "I think that this course could be improved by having more clear lecture slides and notes.",
                "Strengths: naturally interesting material, great structure and order of the topics covered, kind lateness policy, psets and exams were amazing (not that type of hard that leaves you nauseous and hating the class, they were actually easy and mostly asked for clarity, logic, personal reflection, and creativity), kind TAs that help with psets during discussion sections. I genuinely enjoyed doing ever single assignment in this class. Weaknesses: the lecture presentations are non-informative (mostly just photos\/pictures), and the lectures are not recorded. That's probably a single consistent stressor I experienced in this class. The grading is somewhat nit-picky, and assignments are often returned much later, but that wasn't too much of a concern to me.",
                "Strengths - Michael Faison is a great, engaging professor who truly cares about the students. He invited us to see the Venus, Mars, and a star cluster up at the observatory one night as well. He is always excited to share new astronomy news with us in class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Sometimes, the teaching fellows would not show up to sections or would not show up on time.",
                "The content was interesting, and the TFs were very attentive. I think the class failed to teach us the mathematics needed to complete the problem sets, which was frustrating. It was not intuitive. Other than that, I felt the class was well-formatted.",
                "The inherent content is quite interesting, and Michael Faison can be fun to listen to lecture, but the important content of the class is a bit lacking. Faison doesn't put any words on his slides, and so accessing them later to compare with your notes isn't an option. Additionally, almost every question on every single problem set requires you to look up answers online, resulting in paying attention in class having almost no impact on how you do on the problem sets. This ultimately leads me to ask the question: Why am I spending two hours a week in a class when most of what I'm learning (and then applying on the exams) just comes from the internet? Why take this course if most of the assignments tell me \"look on Google\" and then *that's* what's on the exam. I appreciate that the class is trying to match the times, as I think the internet is a great resource and should be utilized more in assignments, but not exclusively and in lieu of learning content in class. Additionally, the fact that problem sets all relied on self-research online turned them less into a learning experience\/applying my knowledge and more into a chore I had to work out in two hours through various Google tabs.",
                "Strengths: manageable problem sets that reflected what we covered in readings, really interesting subject matter. Exams are well structured and I think that Faison really cares about his students having a positive experience and not being too stressed out while also learning a lot \r\nCons: Faison's lectures, while warm and engaging, sometimes deviated from the topics we were supposed to be covering that day. The one place I would say this course was seriously lacking was with the TA's -- there were several weeks where I showed up to section and the TA wouldn't know what questions we were asking or wouldn't have looked at the problem set, which was mainly why students were there.",
                "Only weaknesses are what I can recall from this course, those including spending a minimum of 30 minutes covering \"relevant\" news that did not correlate with our lessons, receiving PSET grades late and having a disorganized structure.",
                "Strengths: \r\nvery interesting content, unique course, I feel like I genuinely learned a lot of new information about the subject, the exams were mostly fair, brief, and graded well. The course emphasized student curiosity rather than memorization. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nI found the grading system very stressful to a degree that it made me enjoy the course much less. The problem sets were incredibly time consuming and made up of very subjective questions that would get points deducted if they were not answered in a certain way. There was also barely any preparation provided to students before the exams that made it very stressful and difficult to study for them. Thirdly, the course content makes some assumptions about students having a background in some physics and chemistry and does not review concepts in these fields, making it much more difficult for students who do not have a strong background in these subjects to understand the reasoning behind course concepts.",
                "Strengths are content. Weaknesses are due date of assignments.",
                "The weekly assigned readings seemed not to match the problem set questions greatly and some wouldn't of the asked about topics wouldn't be hit on in lecture in the same detail needed for the problem sets. I found myself having to do a decent amount of outside research but other than that I thought the lecture and amount learned overall was fulfilling.",
                "The biggest strength of this course, to me at least, was how engaging lecture was. Not only was I interested in the content, but Professor Faison's use of both puns and amazing images of interstellar nebula further pulled me in. The assigned readings also went a long way with broadening our understanding of the material, and there were always optional readings that further delved into specific subjects for those who wanted to know more - from Ben Affleck teaching about whale evolution to theories on how we would travel through black holes.",
                "The course material is fascinating, and the readings are mostly simple to understand and engaging. The lectures themselves, however, are the biggest detriment to the course. The lectures feel disorganized and disengaging. It doesn't feel like we are covering the material adequately within lecture.",
                "Strengths: Great teacher, interesting material, engaging environment.\r\nWeaknesses: This is not really a weakness, but weekly problem sets took a lot of time to complete. Either shortening each problem set or reducing the number of problem sets would help a lot. Moreover, the slides were not helpful at all. They mostly contained pictures, and I rarely used the slides to prepare for exams. Adding some text would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: the course is really interesting and easy to grasp for non-science majors. The topics we cover are really cool and I genuinely feel like I learned a lot from this class. Professor Faison does a great job keeping students engaged. Weaknesses: the scope of the course is so broad, so some classes sometimes don't feel as relevant to the focus of the class.",
                "The course topic was interesting, but it was somewhat disorganized and hard to stay on track",
                "Strengths: Good reading list, not a horrible workload, relatively interesting content. \r\nWeaknesses: The P-sets, lectures, and tests. P-sets: Professor Faison often tried to include math on the p-sets, but he wasn't good at explaining the simple equations involved in physics and astronomy to a non-STEM audience. Almost every single math problem was impossible to understand, never mind solve, without going to office hours. Most required additional information that we were either expected to figure out on our own or know already. Additionally, the p-set questions almost always required us to look up information that wasn't included in either the readings or the lectures. In fact, content from the lectures rarely showed up on the p-sets, and the lectures themselves weren't great. Professor Faison made a valiant attempt at engaging the class by spending the first 20 minutes of every lecture discussing whatever recent astronomical event happened to be in the news, but since most kids were just taking the class for the science credit, no one was interested in paying attention to an irrelevant topic that wouldn't show up on the tests or p-sets. I think students would have been more engaged with this section of the course if Prof. Faison tried to initiate a debate or ask us about extraterrestrial life, rather than astronomical phenomena that requires a high degree of subject knowledge to understand and discuss intelligently. We almost never got through all of the lecture material, and the slides never had any words or lecture notes on them---which is testament to Faison's skill as a lecturer, but made it difficult to follow what he was saying or take notes later. Attending lecture honestly ended up feeling like a waste of time since I knew I would have to google or look through the textbook for the information I needed for the p-sets anyways. The tests, though generously graded, were also way too short to be fair. Each was only 4 questions long. Given the amount of content the course covered, it's crazy that a subject you studied may or may not have shown up on the tests simply because of dumb luck. The p-sets were the main method by which I learned the content, since they were so long. I ended up spending close to 10 hours on each of them. Again, that seems like a bizarre way to design a course; this means that most of what I learned was by self-teaching. I feel like I went above and beyond what was required for the p-sets; I can't imagine another student who didn't put as much effort in as I did coming out of this course having learned anything much.",
                "Professor Faison's lecture style was incredibly confusing. He would often try to adopt a socratic method where he'd ask questions and open it up to the class to answer, but this was flawed in several ways. Firstly, by having student answers drive the lecture, it meant that the explanation of any given subject wasn't necessarily done in the most conducive way to a newcomer understanding it; rather it followed whatever responses students had given, which may end up resulting in a topic being taught circuitously. Secondly, Professor Faison often assumed that if one student answered something correctly, that the whole class could follow that student's logic, which isn't necessarily the case. Another major weakness was that especially at the start of the course there were massive amounts of reading that overlapped 80-90% with the lecture, so it frankly felt like a waste of my time to read, but occasionally we were actually expected to have found those random nuggets of new information on our own. In terms of strengths, the subject matter itself was quite interesting and the psets and exams felt fairly manageable.",
                "Sometimes the lectures felt a bit shallow\/didnt really go into much depth and were repetitive, but the professor is really great and covers so much.",
                "A lot of the questions on the p-set just required us to google stuff. Some of the readings weren't available on canvas.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Faison was great and knows so much about the topic, and his lectures were incredibly interesting\/engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Problem Sets were largely just poring through a few sources in search of long, written answers. The sources were interesting to read for someone interested in astronomy (like me) but it was often tedious and took a while to find answers.",
                "Strengths of the course are the clearly laid out units and how the course is divided into three sections, each of which has an accompanying exam. I think that the workload of the course was well-balanced and doable. Weaknesses of the course are the sometimes useless time in class during lectures. At times I found it more useful to read the textbook and watch the professor's recommended YouTube videos than to go to the actual lecture.",
                "Faison was an incredible lecturer, if a bit disorganized chaos style",
                "Some interesting facts, some was funny. Other parts felt like random details rather than cohesive",
                "I felt like the material on the problem sets was often unrelated to what was in lecture (and harder). We were told to try to reason things out using concepts, but often it was difficult to do this with mathematical problems.",
                "Strength: incredibly interesting and informative, and it got me to fall in love with astronomy.\r\nWeakness: there should be comprehensive study guides so that you can recollect what youve covered during the course easier",
                "Strengths: very interesting content, especially in the second half of the course, and Prof. Faison is a very entertaining lecturer\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Prof. Faison is also not a very organized lecturerlectures jump from topic to topic and it was hard to tell what information was important and what was tangential. Also the psets took ages to be graded.",
                "Its a fascinating class that helps non-STEM majors get excited about science. Pset questions are sometimes very subjective and vague and it was not clear what the graders were looking for making it hard to get points.",
                "Loved the session at Leitner at the end",
                "There are only strengths. Doctor Faison's classes are incredibly inspiring and thought provoking. Problem sets and assigned readings are short and reasonable. The assigned reading is actually incredibly interesting. There are short problem sets every week, ten in total. The problem sets are more difficult than the tests, and designed exactly that way so that if you know the problem sets, you're sure to do well on the tests. Regarding the tests, they are three things... short, reasonable, and fair (fair in terms of content, expectations, and grading). The design of the course alone makes it is clear that Doctor Faison is setting his students up for success and very much cares about his students. Further proof of this are the three discussion sections each week (voluntary, you don't have to go!) where TFs help students understand the concepts taught that week. Additionally, Doctor Faison has office hours three times(!) each week on Zoom. To excel in this course, all you need to do is come to class, and do the problem sets and the assigned readings. If something stumps you that week, you have six opportunities to get help outside of class every week, plus a discussion board where you can ask other students questions at any time. Advice: Study the problem set solutions when they come out and make sure you understand them, you'll be sure to pass with flying colors if you do this! Also, if you do take this class, please be active on the class discussion board! It is there to help you and your fellow students!! Again, there are no weaknesses. It is an incredible class!!!",
                "The lectures are not very organized and the problem sets arent based off of things covered in lecture. A more direct correlation would make the class easier to follow. Also the exams and problem sets arent graded consistently  answers close to the correct ones still get points taken off.",
                "I often felt that the questions on problem sets were open ended, but the grading for problem sets was too strict\/was looking for a more specific set of answers.",
                "I loved the lectures and the lecturer but the PSET was a bit exhausting every week. It ensured I memorized the material though.",
                "Strengths: interesting topic, and Faison can be humorous sometimes. I also enjoyed the more \"hands on\" parts of class, like getting to go to the observatory and see what we learned about in action.\r\nWeakness: lectures are a little bit unorganized, and it would be nice if they were also recorded."

                "Fun science credit, 10 PSets so almost every week even when it didn't feel exactly necessary.",
                "Yes, it's interesting and the topics covered are fun.",
                "Anyone with a passing interest in astronomy should definitely take this course.",
                "Absolutely. This class is incredibly interesting and genuinely changed my perspective on our role in the universe. Wouldn't call it a gut but it's not difficult to succeed in the course with help from TFs and a bit of studying. Great way to fulfill your science credit, also doesn't involve very much math. Take it with Faison if you get the chance.",
                "Not really -- it's not a gut science class like it's advertised as. The professor goes on random rambles all the time, and you never learn anything much in lectures, you'd be better off watching youtube videos or reading textbooks online. The professor is very bad at keeping up with grades - so don't take this course if you're anxious about grades\/need to know your grades",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I only took this course to satisfy my second science requirement (after Meg Urry's course Expanding Ideas of Time and Space), and by the end of it I was questioning whether or not I should continue pursuing astronomy. Although I would warn others of the mental strain of taking four-question exams, I really loved being in this introductory class and I think it has great potential of bringing people into astronomy and related majors.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to anyone, regardless of their major or whether they need more science credit or not, just take the class. The material is very engaging and interesting. We did a very cool project where we transmitted a message towards a star to search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Honestly, this is one of the most interesting class I have taken at Yale so far.",
                "not a science gut",
                "I'd vaguely recommend this course. It's... okay, not exactly memorable, but also if you're looking for a very broad introduction to exoplanets, blackholes, and SETI, it's pretty good.",
                "Yes I would.",
                "Absolutely! One of my favorites and arguably the least stressful class I took this semester. Enjoyed engaging with the material so much. Really glad I took this course.",
                "Yes. It is a great introduction to the development of life on Earth and the possibility of life elsewhere. It is also a \"taste\" of physics for the non-STEM majors who are a little curious!",
                "Yes! If you can handle the frustration of long problem sets, I think the content is worth knowing. It's interesting, and while I did complete this class for the distributional, I was pleasantly surprised by my interest in the topic.",
                "I would if they're interested in it, but I would want to warn them about how much of the learning is self-driven and researched online as opposed to in class.",
                "Absolutely not. The professor gave brash responses when students had questions and did not know how to teach a lecture full of generally non-stem students.",
                "No. I would tell another student that the content could be quite interesting at times, but the workload and time commitment of the problems sets were a huge burden every week and were barely ever content actually covered in lecture, almost always independent research questions. If we did not research certain aspects in our response, we would get points off for not being specific. \r\nI would only recommend this course to a student who is not already taking on a big workload and who has a background in science and would enjoy learning about the topic of the class. If they have the time and willingness to put in the effort, they will enjoy the class, but most people I knew in the class were not expecting this level of work and had a negative experience.",
                "Yes! Its intriguing and manageable.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes easy class overall and good science credit",
                "I would recommend for anyone who wants an intro about astronomy and the search for life outside of earth.",
                "Even though it was my fourth class of the day, I never had any issue with focusing, and really enjoyed every minute of it. Even if you are not interested in astronomy, no one can deny how amazing some of the visuals presented during lecture can be. There is a great mix of facts, math, theorizing, and plain fun that make this a course I would recommend to anyone. Also, my experience at the Yale planetarium and observatory was a highlight of the semester, and I definitely plan on visiting again next year.",
                "No. The course content is interesting, but the same knowledge could be gained simply by reading the assigned textbook independently.",
                "It is an easy science credit despite the number of problem sets that you will need to do in this class. Still, the class was interesting, and I learned a lot about extraterrestrial life in the universe.",
                "YES!! Really amazing course for science or non-science majors alike.",
                "Maybe not, it is not really a science gut, and it is hard to keep up with because of how it is organised",
                "Not really. If you're interested in astronomy, learn some physics and take a real introductory astronomy course. If you're interested in extraterrestrial life, you can lear about the same content by briefly scrolling through the internet. This course sounded really good in theory and the astronomy portion of it was well-taught, but all of the other content was covered in such a simplistic manner that it really isn't worth your time. I think the interdisciplinary nature of the class is very cool and the reading list is good, but the execution was pretty poor. The p-sets are long enough and test questions random enough that it doesn't end up being much of a gut. So not a gut and not very interesting unfortunately.",
                "I'd recommend this course only to someone who's desperate for a science credit and interested in the subject matter. It was poorly taught and organized and I've taken better intro astro classes for non-majors at Yale. But as I said, the subject matter was interesting, and out of the field of options I had for science credits this semester I still think it was the best choice for me. The drawbacks weren't so bad that they ruined the class, it was just annoying at times. I'd just recommend forming a group to work on psets together and study for exams.",
                "Overall yes. Its not an easy science gut, you definitely have to put a lot of effort into the piece sets. But overall a good and really interesting course thats worth it if youre willing to put in the effort.",
                "Yes! A great way to earn a Science credit and an interesting topic to learn about, no matter how much you already knew about astronomy.",
                "Professor Faison is a good lecturer, and the class is very thought-provoking even if I found some of the math on the p-sets a bit of a drag. Not to feat, though, math is only a small portion of the course, and it's very interesting if science-fiction and the extraterrestrial is something you're intrigued by.",
                "Yes I would recommend it if you need a QR or science credit and don't want to work ridiculously hard. I wouldn't consider this course a gut but it is definitely easier than many intensive stem courses at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. It was so fun",
                "Sure, if youre interested.",
                "Yes very much so. It is very interesting and having an understanding of SETI and space is something everyone should have.",
                "Yes if you take it with a group of friends and work on the psets together.",
                "I would since it is a good class to take for a science requirement.",
                "I really admire the enthusiasm Michael puts into his class, but one thing I think really needs to be improved on is on-time feedback for students, and accurate reflection of grades on canvas. sometimes I would receive the grades on Gradescope, but they are not reflected accurately on canvas (which is due to the grading policy, but still I would wish for a quicker turnover to canvas). Otherwise I would totally recommend this class, learning about potential extraterrestrial life is incredible, especially sending the message in the end of the semester is really exciting. hopefully we can get a reply!",
                "It depends. I was looking for a science credit as a non-science person, and for that purpose, this class was a good fit.",
                "Yes",
                "Absolutely 1000% yes. I highly recommend this course to all. In addition to being an amazing science credit, this course is particularly useful to humanities majors, especially those in writing intensive majors as many of the topics that are covered in this course have inspired great writers such as Isaac Asimov, H.G. Wells, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Ray Bradbury, and Kim Stanley Robinson. This class is applicable to all majors, and the topics are sure to inspire anyone. They certainly have inspired me. The class itself is a low threat environment, meaning psets and tests are more than reasonable, manageable, and inclusive (you don't need to be a STEM major to excel here). Additionally, towards the end of the course Doctor Faison takes the class to the observatory for a planetarium show and an observing session, which is an incredible experience and sure to be a major highlight of your semester if you take this course!! I also strongly recommend to students Doctor Faison's other classes, such as ASTR 110 and 120, which are great compliments to this class.",
                "Not really  it was disorganized which made it stressful to try to keep up. Also the grading policy seemed almost random so not knowing where you stand is also stressful.",
                "I would recommend this course to other Humanities majors looking for a science credit, but beware that the level of explanation on the work is somewhat arbitrary and much of the content we are assessed on is not actually discussed in class nor is it explained in the readings. To complete the P-sets, you must do individual research. The same problem arose to a lesser extent on the exams, but these could be answered with deductive reasoning and logic rather than specific content discussed in lecture.",
                "I wouldnt.  I enjoyed learning, but the workload was something that took me away from my other classes. I mean to say that for something I only cared about tangentially, the work took me away from my subjects too much.",
                "If you're looking for a science credit without too much math, this could work for you (nothing too complicated, only basic algebra and trig). Psets can be tedious but are doable."
