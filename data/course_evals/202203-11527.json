Professor Riley gave very helpful feedback on my writing and I think the quality of my arguments and writing style improved a lot over the semester. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like the discussions were on topics unrelated to the papers we were writing at times. Honestly I was a little bored of the topic by the end of the semester."
