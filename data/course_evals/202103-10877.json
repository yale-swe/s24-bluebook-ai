                "The topics are extremely in-depth and the class goes at an extremely fast pace. We received quick feedback on midterm exams, but I felt the exams did not offer enough time and did not accurately assess our understanding of the concepts. One third of the exam questions were multiple choice which I do not believe reflected my ability to understand the concepts.",
                "Strengths: clear lecture slides, good pset problems",
                "The problem sets guide you through the concepts well, though they can be a bit repetitive at times. However, they are not super representative of the  level of difficulty you see on the midterms, and having some practice/mock exams would definitely have been super useful for studying.",
                "Sometimes, we do not even receive feedback on an assignment before the exam that the content from the assignment is on, and we definitely do not receive feedback on problem sets before the following is due. When we do receive feedback, it is often illegible and typically only tells us how many points we lost next to the problem with little to no explanation. For the problem sets, we are told to compare with the solutions posted after the due date, but that seems to defeat the main purpose of receiving feedback. For the exams, we don't even get solutions; I did not know why I got most of the points off on my last exam when I got it back, and it took over a week to schedule a meeting with my professor because he doesn't reply to emails (or when he does, it is usually at least 2 days later).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this class is a lecture consisting of majority upperclassmen at 9:25, three times a week on science hill, which I feel sets students up to fail. Most upperlevel students don't have other classes that early in the morning, making it difficult to build a routine around it when extracurriculars can routinely go to midnight. Based on the typical schedule of upper-level college students, it seems unreasonable to expect students to be able to attend all three lectures while still getting a reasonable amount of sleep; even when I did attend lecture, it was often too early for me to focus well. Additionally, our problem sets are due on Friday, meaning that the reality is probably that most students are staying up to work on them late Thursday night, making it even more difficult to attend class on Friday. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the instructor only posts the slides that he projects rather than his lecture notes. Though the visuals are helpful, when reviewing material, it can be very difficult to recall what is going on in the slides/the explanation behind it without any verbal explanation. Sometimes, he also mentions details in class that, again, are not on the slides, and can have a very negative impact on our performance in the class if we missed them. For example, on the last exam, remembering one such detail was crucial to being able to perform well on a question worth 18/100 points. Because the class is not recorded, there is no way of going back over what he said and catching the details, unless we are expected to retain 100% of the information brought up in class, which again is extremely difficult given the time of this class.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is virtually no interaction in this class. I would say that he maybe asks us a question once every two weeks in this class, which is often just trivia regarding the content we are learning. People also almost never ask questions during the actual lecture unless something written on the board is wrong; most save their questions about content for office hours or other times. Thus, I think that the in-person component of this class does not benefit our learning, and we only do it in this format because it is the professor's preference. In fact, the in-person, non-recorded format of this class is a detriment to me and my peers' learning for the reasons listed above. I understand the desire to encourage students to attend lecture by not recording, but most students who don't attend lecture choose to watch the recordings at a time that works better for their own personal learning schedule, meaning that the only component they are \"missing out\" on is any live interactive component, which I already explained we do not really have. The issue is not that there needs to be interaction, as I actually tend to prefer my lectures this way, but that the class needs to be recorded or at a different hour. Thus, a recorded format, whether that means recorded live lectures or asynchronous, is objectively superior for this course.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe this class, which already has fairly challenging content and is typically taken by students just fulfilling a major requirement, sets us up for failure.",
                "Working through examples would be great during class time. So that the material can make more sense and be made applicable. This was especially a problem towards the end of the semester. Class material, homework material, and exam material seem to have a very scant area in any Venn diagram that could be constructed.",
                "Strengths -- Vaccaro is great, he really wants to help you learn and is helpful in office hours. He is by FAR the most organized and clear lecturer I've ever had at Yale. The peer tutors are really helpful (going to office hours really makes the homework manageable. Re-doing the homework is good preparation for the exams (if you go back and cross out the hints) and while the exams are difficult, they aren't out of bounds. The textbook is your friend! Most of the derivations he does out in class are also done out in the textbook, which is helpful for reviewing/practicing, and the textbook can really help put the content from lectures in context.\r\nWeaknesses -- While it's clear that the exams are curved, there's not much clarity about the grading scheme (i.e. how much does extra credit on homeworks play a role?) The extra credit seemed great at first, except that the median score on every homework was well above a 100%, meaning that the extra credit instantly became required (so basically just longer psets). Also the postponement of the final exam by like 6 weeks rather than letting us take it online just felt cruel",
                "strengths - organized slides.\r\nweaknesses - oftentimes class goes too fast to process the information. no exam practice, only rely on psets. sections are poorly taught, mostly just going over the homework and not learning new concepts. also, the final was forced to be taken next semester which has been especially hard for people who are busy over winter break / have to work and apply to jobs; just a very frustrating experience overall.",
                "This class is like drinking from a fire hydrant. The amount of content covered is overwhelming and it is hard to say what could be done to make the course less of a fire hydrant besides reducing the amount of content (which is an unlikely solution the department would take). The course meets three times a week (which is good to keep students learning) but the lack of any time to ask questions during class prevents a full understanding of the material. This can spiral into not understanding the material until the midterms/final exam and (re)learning everything.\r\n\r\nThe TAs of this class were not super useful but the peer tutors were. Perhaps an additional peer tutor (for a total of 3), would benefit the course.\r\n\r\nThe problem sets need to be shrunk down, the exams need to be actually designed for ONE HOUR and not THREE, and the final exam should have been offered BEFORE break for students. This class has made me question why I am STEM student and question why I hadn't just sold my soul to the Econ department.",
                "The course is extremely well designed. Professor Vaccaro is a great lecturer and has excellent slides, the problem sets are very useful for learning the material, and there are many opportunities to seek help for mastering concepts that you didn't understand the first time around.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I didn't find much utility from the discussion sections. After a few weeks I found we weren't discussing any new material or new applications on top of lecture, so I stopped attending. I could see how they might be helpful if you have specific questions you don't want to ask at office hours or such, though.",
                "Oh boy. For starters, when Yale moved finals online halfway through finals period, this professor decided to move the final AFTER winter break so it could be held NEXT SEMESTER. All students were required to request an incomplete/ABX from their deans without having a choice in the matter. All because he refused to have an online exam, saying it was too hard to proctor, never mind the fact that the entire econ department found proctors for every single one of their exams, and never mind the developing pandemic situation which promises to make winter break a very stressful time for students already, on top of having to study material for an EXTRA MONTH past when the class was supposed to end. Oh, and the class is curved, so we have no choice but to study over the holidays or risk getting destroyed by the kids who are privileged enough to not have to work, take care of younger siblings, etc. during the break. \r\n\r\nThis is a great example of how it felt that the professor had little to no empathy for students throughout the course. He included extra credit on all problem sets, which to me is ridiculous  in a curved class, extra credit is pretty much required. Why even offer it? Just make the problem set longer and be done with it. Exams were fine, except that they were held at night, and walking up Science Hill in the dark isn't the safest activity I've ever done. The scores on the exams are also completely impossible to interpret, and the curve for this class is about as clear as mud. I did try to talk to the professor about my grade, and came away with no understanding of where I stood in the class. Section was next to useless. Lectures were mildly engaging, except that no lecture notes were ever posted and most of class was written on a chalkboard, so god forbid you miss class as it'll get erased as soon as it's over and you'll never know what you missed. Also, no answer key was EVER posted for exams and all the gets written on your test is little red checkmarks to indicate where you lost points, so it's impossible to know exactly what you did wrong and improve.",
                "The content of the course is very interesting. One much make sure that they engage with it well in order to best understand it.",
                "Material presented well and lots of opportunities to get help and ask questions. At times Vaccaro seemed to go through the harder material very quickly and take a lot of time on objectively easier material. Would've been nice to get to kinetics topics to synthesize what we'd been working toward.",
                "The strengths of this class are probably the problem sets. They do a good job of reinforcing material from lecture and are (rather admirably) handmade by the professor. The problem sets do not take long. The weakness of this course lie in its structure. The course is taught in a way that prioritizes uninteresting details over the big picture/key ideas. I felt that we would learn some definitions of things, and instead of pushing deeper on the ideas, we ended up spreading out to uninteresting details or talking about approximations for real substances that would just be fairly easy to look up if we ever needed to use them. The topics were just generally uninteresting as presented and I found myself with zero curiosity and interest in the class, which is a bit sad.",
                "This course is by far the worst course I have taken at Yale. The TAs were extremely unhelpful. They would just copy lecture notes on the board and were unable to answer any questions asked. Professor Vaccaro was a great lecturer, but would never stop for questions. Everyone struggled to keep up with the lectures, and the only way that we could have digested the information better would have been to ask questions throughout lecture or engage with the students more. The prerequisites for this course are physics and Math 115, yet you need Math 120 to perform well in the course. Because I did not have knowledge of partial derivatives and their properties, I spent a large majority of my time learning Math 120 just to keep up with the course. Jamie and Jenny, the peer tutors for the course, were truly a saving grace! They were extremely knowledgeable about the course content and were very helpful. \r\n\r\nLastly and MOST IMPORTANTLY, this course was NOT facilitated to help students. It seems as though Prof Vaccaro took every opportunity possible to make it more difficult on students. First, he assigned a pset over a break week that was twice as long as normal psets. On a normal week, I found myself spending well over 10 hours on the problem sets. You truly have to invest all of your time into the course if you even want a chance at doing average. Secondly, final exams were moved online due to COVID. Vaccaro chose to ignore this and force the entire class to take the final exam after break. This was not in the spirit of Dean Chun's email and was extremely disappointing to see. A professor should not have this much control over students, especially as our winter break will now be spent studying pchem. The curve in the class makes it so that if others are studying the entire break and learning the material, you do too. This will be the last chemistry course I take; this was a terrible experience.",
                "Strengths: organized professor\r\nWeaknesses: the entire grading system in this class (having voluntary/extra credit on psets affect our grades just fueled a competitive atmosphere and pitted us against each other), having half the notes on the board and half online made it difficult to interact with the teaching, the TAs in the class were generally not strong and section was not helpful, Jamie was an amazing peer tutor who really saved us all",
                "The course is lectured well and covers a breadth of topics with sufficient depth. The weakness in the course is that the professor intentionally enjoys making his course difficult. The grading system is too skewed towards examinations despite 20+ page psets being required every single week. It can lead to a sense of despair on the student's part.",
                "PHV is highly organized, the fastest exam grader I have ever encountered, and extremely good at explaining difficult concepts. The exams in this class are (i) among the most difficult I have ever taken and (ii) count for a substantial portion of your grade, which can be taken as strengths or weaknesses. I think that the course could be improved by decreasing the role of exams in determining grades, though this is due to my personal weaknesses in test taking.",
                "The course's lectures are very organized and put-together in terms of presentation. What was often frustrating was that the concepts discussed in lecture hardly informed students on how to solve questions on the problem sets and then the exams. I wish the material we spent so much time discussing was more helpful in building the crucial problem solving skills to be successful in the course. It was often insulting, at times, to listen to the professor spend minutes explaining that velocity was indicated by variable 'v' when the problem sets and exams never asked such basic questions. \r\n\r\nThe TAs for this class were also not good. Students in both sections found discussion sections frustrating and largely unhelpful. The TAs were nice people and genuinely seemed to want to assist their students - they simply were not adequately prepared to do so. Often, they would face the blackboard for almost the entire period, would be flustered when trying to answer a basic question from a student, and struggled to methodically walk through problems in a way that students could understand. I don't think this problem is the fault of these TAs, but rather the selection process through which they were chosen. If a department/professor is going to hire students who have never taught before to teach, there should be some vetting process or training to ensure each TA is competent for the job. Students from previous years who took the class explained how helpful a good TA could be in this class. It is a shame no one in this class had such help available. On the other hand, the peer tutors were excellent and a better resource for the entire class than the TAs. \r\n\r\nFinally, the fact that students had no choice in ABXing the final exam was a poor decision. All of the time students spent preparing for this final went to waste. Students should not be robbed of their choice to take an exam when they were guaranteed to take it. Now, every student in this course has the distress of awaiting a final exam weeks after they were initially prepared to take it. The exam hangs over every student during what is meant to be a break with no stress from this class nor this university. \r\n\r\nOne last thing: the problem sets. Extra credit on these became the expectation as students quickly realized every average homework score was over 100%. I am not sure how to change this culture, but for a class so labor intensive, extra credit should not be the expectation to be able to stay average in this class. Extra credit should be what it say it is: extra.",
                "Professor Vaccaro is a huge strength of the course, as his approachability both after class and during office hours encouraged students to ask questions. Weaknesses included the three-day-a-week early morning schedule, which left students tired for significant portions of the lecture time, and the test grading, which was unclear and Professor Vaccaro often had to manually correct.",
                "This class was well-organized, and it's clear that Professor Vacarro is great at teaching this subject material. I think it could be improved by making more accommodations, like recording lectures. I went to lecture sick several times, when I could have gotten the same content in a safer manner. I understand pre-COVID not wanting to make these accommodations, but it's clear that a lot has changed and I wish the structure of this course could change as well.",
                "The course was well constructed, as it demanded attention during lectures with all the information being provided. The test questions were also well made as they demanded a certain study style.",
                "Strengths: Whatever past reviews have said, Vaccaro is a good lecturer. Lectures can get rather dry and go through some concepts rather quickly, but he does explain everything well in-depth and thoroughly. Vaccaro is also extremely kind and helpful if you talk to him outside of class/during office hours. He genuinely wants his students to succeed. The class can feel very difficult and tedious, but it is definitely not impossible. Nothing on the psets or the exams were impossible to solve or well beyond the scope of what we learned. Side note: the textbook is also a good resource if people are confused -- the course honestly follows the textbook pretty closely. Weaknesses: The TAs were horrendous. Sometimes, section just felt ridiculous because my TA was so all over the place. He clearly never prepared enough to teach and kept making mistakes throughout the section. I gained nothing from my TA, and many people stopped coming because none of us felt he was helpful. Additionally, some psets felt unnecessarily long and tedious. I don't think I gained anything from doing the same mindless calculation 16 times with slight variations each time. Having to produce \"nice\" graphs using software often created unnecessary headaches as well. \r\nAnother side note: Vaccaro's decision to postpone the class's final exam to the beginning of the following semester was absolutely ridiculous. When Yale College moved to online exams, he essentially forced the entire class to request an ABX and take the final in January. It just did not make sense that a professor could force students to complete work for a class outside of the term against their will. This was a clear abuse of an ABX (its purpose is to allow individual students with extenuating circumstances who cannot take final exams during the regular period to postpone their final, not for professors to postpone the entire class's exam). I hope he recognizes the stress and chaos this decision caused and tries to be more understanding of students in future."

This class has made me feel more miserable than any other class I have taken at Yale, and I have taken a number of classes with a very high workload ratings such as Orgo, MATH 120, ENAS, Japanese, and upper-level CENG classes. Before the semester started, I was actually excited about this class because I had taken CENG Thermodynamics and enjoyed it, and thermo had always been one of my favorite topics in chemistry. This class class all but ruined that.",
                "Lol what??? What a question no comment. If you do have to take it make use of office hours and try to form a study group early on.",
                "Yeah! It's really quite manageable. The material is interesting to me, but I can understand how, if it's not interesting to you, the class would feel like a mountain. Don't be too scared by the course reviews. Yeah, you have to do the work, but I think a lot of people take out their frustration with the material on the professor and on the course. Vaccaro takes the time to make detailed handouts explaining topics he thinks are particularly difficult. He will sit down and go over material with you. The TAs and peer tutors are also such great resources. The class is big enough that if you find yourself struggling, there's a lot of resources to help.",
                "no, unless you have to. while the psets are oftentimes fun to do the workload is a lot.",
                "Haha. I guess if you have to take physical chemistry, you must take it. Don't take this as an elective. If you're an MB&B major deciding between CHEM 332 or 328, there is no right answer. In 332, you can really understand the content if you dedicate an enormous amount of time. On the other hand, I've heard other students say that CHEM 328 is easier but you might not understand what is happening at all. This class is quite painful and possibly destroyed my love for learning.\r\n\r\nI don't think I had a single Thursday night this past semester without staying up far later than expected working on the problem sets that would take 10+ hours each for me. Oh yeah, I totally forgot about all of the huge problem sets we had due after a break or one due at the end of reading period. Don't forget, class meets during reading period!!\r\n\r\nAlso, to put it here, our final exam was moved to January. This is probably the ugliest decision I have ever seen and is going to make my Winter Break 2021-22 a huge [explitive].",
                "Yes, I'd recommend it. It's an interesting and thorough exploration of the physical chemistry of bulk matter, and you'll probably learn a lot unless you've already taken a thermodynamics course. Keep in mind that there is heavy emphasis on math, but Professor Vaccaro goes over every technique that you'll need to know. The problem sets are pretty reasonable (a few hours every week). The two midterm exams (I haven't taken the final yet) were both fair - it was somewhat difficult for me to finish all the questions in time, but I may have just been working slowly.",
                "ABSOLUTELY NOT. As an MB&B major: I know that people say CHEM 328 and 332 are just two sides of the same, bad coin and that they're terrible in different ways. I'm happy to tell you that in Fall 2021, CHEM 332 has finally proved itself the GREATER of the two evils. As you likely remember, Yale moved its finals online halfway through finals period this year. The response of this professor was to give students complete radio silence for 24 hours, and then announce that the exam was being postponed until the spring semester. WHY? His reasoning was the difficult of proctoring, and yet the entire econ department found proctors for its intro and intermediate classes, both of which have far more students than CHEM 332. \r\n\r\nThe thing about this professor is that he truly, 100% believes that physical chemistry is and must be the most important class you take at Yale. Newsflash: it's not. His ego, self-importance, and demonstrated lack of empathy for students led him to make a choice in terms of the final exam which no other professor at this university even considered: postponing the final, without giving students an option, simply because he believes that the exam is SO important that it must be held in person, even to the detriment of student's mental health. He has decided to ruin 50 individual vacations, the ONLY time we have to rest and recuperate from the stress of attending school during a global pandemic, because in his mind, physical chemistry overrides mental health and overall wellness. \r\n\r\nThis year was an extenuating circumstance, and I doubt you'll have to go through the same circumstances again, but be warned, future MB&B student reading this: this professor will sacrifice your well-being at every turn because of how important he believes his class to be. If there is a choice to be made which will accommodate students and maybe give them a break, he WILL and DOES choose the exact opposite. There is no such thing as grace in CHEM 332. If given the chance, he will absolutely, 100% make your life harder. I'm certain that the CHEM 328 professor will not do the same. For the sake of your mental health and your Christmas break, you must take that class instead.",
                "If a student is interested in thermodynamics, I would recommend the course.",
                "Most take it because they have to but you will learn a lot if you put the time and energy into it.",
                "This course is really boring. It is hard to get excited about things like phase transitions, and I can't see anyone caring about it other than an industrial chemist. The workload is not high, but please save yourself the boredom and take a more interesting class.",
                "Unless this course is required, I would strongly advise against taking the course. This was the worst class I have taken at yale. Due to finals being moved online, Professor Vaccaro forced to take the final after break. This is completely unacceptable and disrupted everyone's break.",
                "not unless it is a requirement",
                "No, do not take this course unless required for higher coursework.",
                "I would recommend this course to students that truly love chemistry (would enjoy doing chemistry in their free time of their own volition).",
                "No but everyone who takes it has to take it so my recommendation doesnt mean much",
                "No. Most people who take this course must take it. Still, so many improvements could happen in how this course is taught that would make it a more productive class for students. One learns a lot in this very challenging course. It is so ridiculously constructed, though, that it doesn't feel like an accomplishment to get through the course, but a relief. People don't feel proud about completing this course. They feel stressed, haunted by the exams and out-of-left-field problem set questions, frustrated by the disconnect between the taught and tested material. This is not what learning is supposed to feel like, and this is not what a difficult class has to result in. This was not the first very difficult course I have taken in college, but it was the most poorly taught. I have never left a course feeling so dissatisfied, defeated, and upset.",
                "I would recommend this course if your interest is in a zoomed-out view of thermodynamics, explaining engines and large-scale chemical phenomena, which necessitates a fair bit of approximations. If you are looking for a rigorous microscopic-level explanation of thermodynamics, you might want to take a statistical mechanics course instead.",
                "If you're looking to take this class, you are probably required to for your major. It's well-conducted and super informative, so it will probably be a mostly good experience. It's also a ton of work and super confusing at times, so be prepared for that going in.",
                "I wouldnt necessarily recommend it because the intellectual challenge is far greater than any class I have taken; consequently, I would only recommend it for those seeking the major."
