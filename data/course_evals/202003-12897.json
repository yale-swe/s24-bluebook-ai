                "A strength would be the repetition and immersion of the class in that it makes you really think in Spanish. I also really enjoyed the tie-ins with Spanish culture, such as the movies, short stories, and novels we read. Perhaps one weakness is that many of the major assignments were often clustered together and it sometimes felt there wasn't enough room to breathe in between.",
                "I felt this class really does force you to learn Spanish, but the amount of work, even for a 1.5 credit course seemed excessive, even unnecessary, especially considering we were learning in a fully virtual\/stressful covid semester.",
                "The course did a great job adjusting to COVID. I really liked the assignments as it had a great variety and the conversations in class were fun.",
                "Strengths: a wonderful professor. Very kind and responsive, and she cares a lot. Also your Spanish skills really do improve quite a bit.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the virtual format meant that it was harder to get to know people and build a community, although I think we did about as well as we could have given the circumstances."

                "Yes, I would recommend this course because it really does help improve your Spanish skills over the course of the term, and I definitely gained confidence in my own Spanish-speaking abilities after taking this course. The feedback is also helpful, such as feedback from your compositions.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in Spanish or need to fulfill the language requirement.",

                "I would recommend this course because it improves your speaking and writing and the assignments are fun.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course, for a few reasons. First, you really do improve your Spanish skills quite a bit. I went into the class without a very expert knowledge of grammar, and by the end I knew a ton more. Second, although this class has a decent amount of work, grading is very fair (and your grade seems to get better as the semester goes on, probably because you're improving, so don't be intimidated at first). There are a lot of assignments, tests and quizzes, but not an overwhelming amount, and this made it so that your entire grade isn't riding on one test grade, which is nice. Lastly, and maybe most importantly, Prof. Cividanes is absolutely excellent. She will make you work hard, but she is incredibly kind and understanding, and you can tell how much she cares about the class and her students. If you are taking Spanish, please choose Prof. Cividanes! You won't regret it."
