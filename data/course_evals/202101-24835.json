Perhaps most importantly, I learned what a truly community-oriented class felt like. This class expanded the possibilities of what a Yale course could be! I learned a lot about creating / being in community with others, and about what collaboration and mutual support can look like in an art space."

                "This course was one of my favorite that I've taken at Yale in that I never felt like I was being forced to do anything. Everything we did felt like it was on our own terms and like we were able to choose our level of work so long as we were honest and engaged. It was extremely refreshing and a lot of fun to meet each week in this way.",
                "The community-oriented nature of the course is the primary strength of the coursethe trust, warmth, and support that we fostered together was the reason that I think we all felt able to share and be vulnerable as we were. The performance response structure was also a major strength of the courseI loved that we could respond to our readings that way. And the readings were really fantastic! So much food for thought. \r\n\r\nI wish that the syllabus could be a little less white and a bit more well-rounded in terms of the performers it centers (more POC and queer folks). I understand that historically, \"Performance Art\" was very white for a long time, and the syllabus is the way it is because this class seeks to provide a background in the history of the practice. That said, I wonder if there could be creative ways of incorporating the work of more contemporary and diverse artists as well."

Obviously, I would have loved to have discussion in-person as well, but given the circumstances it was the best case scenario. \r\n\r\nHaving Anisa on zoom all the time was difficult in the sense that it sometimes made me feel less present in the space, and having a phone held up was sometimes disruptive to performances. Ideally, everyone would be able to come in person for a class that involves live sharing and bodies in space. That said, it was obviously all worthwhile to have Anisa there, and totally necessary given the circumstances!"
