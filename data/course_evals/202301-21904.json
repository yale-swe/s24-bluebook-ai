                "I appreciate the freedom given to students to persue their scientific topic of interest and conduct research at their own pace.\r\n\r\nIt would have been better if there was a more organized Canvas page with all the info and deadlines clearly listed so students wouldn't have to dig into the documents. I also wished the department would communicate about the dates of presentation / poster session earlier in the spring so that I could have a good sense of my schedule earlier on.",
                "This is entirely dependent on your lab. Outside of the lab, there is largely no support to help you troubleshoot issues you may have, so if that support is also lacking in your lab and/or there are major issues in your lab, you are completely on your own.",

                "This course is disorganized and the MCDB department offers little to no guidance to the students in the class. It is great to get real world lab experience but I felt so lost all the time.",
                "Being able to work on exactly what you want to work on is a great strength of this course. Another strength is making your own schedule and sticking to it, as it allows you to work when you feel that you will be most efficient.",
                "more transparency and communication regarding deadlines, and also more flexibility since everyone's research timeline is very different",
                "not much guidance from the instructors of the course, just a syllabus to go off of",
                "There could have been more communication between admin and students.",
                "Strengths - working with my PI that I have known for multiple years on a novel and unique research project and having the opportunity to present at lab meeting made this experience very special. Course communication between the DUS/course managers was also timely and helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - assignments (like the final senior essay guidelines, poster guidelines, and oral presentation guidelines) were not posted in final revised form to Canvas until April. It would have been very helpful to see these in January or at the start of the semester to get a head start on the written components of the majors research requirements. Additionally, I would have preferred that extra funding in MCDB be directed toward covering the cost of printing student posters rather than the MCDB gift. While the gift was appreciated, printing high quality posters is quiet expensive and anything available in the departments budget to help defray this cost would have been great.",
                "Offers students the opportunity to have ownership over a research project. Would have benefited from some additional guidance from the course directos through lectures or other resources.",
                "For folks who arent published/havent worked on putting together a scientific paper before, it would have been extremely helpful to include more resources and specific guidelines for how to write the final research report. There was literally one example uploaded to Canvas and it was not useful. Assignment descriptions were vague and seemed to imply we should be relying on our PI for guidelines, but if your PI wants to know what guidelines the MCDB department wants you to follow (as mine did), it turns into a vicious cycle of no one knowing what instructions to give.",
                "A weakness was having a PowerPoint presentation, written paper, and poster presentation due during the last week of classes. Please spread out the assignments so they do not overlap with other courses.",
                "Your experience mostly depends on the lab and mentor that you have. In terms of assignments, they are heavier during the spring semester and the oral presentation could probably be done before the final report and poster to reduce the amount of stress during the final week of semester.",
