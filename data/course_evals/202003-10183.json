I enjoyed the ethical insights we also looked at and weighed with each of the possible options\/routes as well. I think the course excelled when it looked at specific case studies.

                "Strengths- good mix of assignments; broad overview of the field; readings were varied and interesting. \r\nWeaknesses- at least in the beginning, many of us felt the exams were too long for time allotted; sometimes exam questions did not directly relate to what we learned in class.",
                "The lecture itself was very minimally interactive and could be difficult to pay attention to, but the discussion section entailed a large amount of participation, which helped make the class more interesting. The exams were much more difficult than the material presented in class, meaning that they were confusing at points.",
                "The course provided a broad range of generally interesting assignments, which was good. In terms of topics covered, it felt like we were given an extremely broad overview of many different things such that I feel as if I have not learned much about any specific thing. It might be helpful in the future to go a bit more in-depth on a few topics. Even though this is an introductory course, I feel that it could benefit from being slightly less elementary.",
                "Strengths: discussion sections were very helpful \r\nWeaknesses: too many big assignments",
                "strengths: Professor Puth and all the TA's are phenomenal. And this course has some of the best-structured tests I've ever taken. They did a very good job making sure that test questions left room for our own creativity re: conservation strategies while making sure we incorporated the big ideas of each unit. Creative assignments like the debate also helped. The writing assignments were good alternatives to labs, for example, for a non-stem major like me. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: none I can think of. great course",
                "This course had many interesting and engaging assignments outside of the class time, which I enjoyed. However, there was also a lot of work outside of the class (especially with readings), and I found them difficult to complete in time for class.",

                "Overall, the course was structured pretty well with the combination of lectures and the discussion sections. I think that the zoom recordings of the lectures allowed students to be able to fit it in with their own schedule, especially when accounting for the weirdness of this zoom year. Overall, the structure of the course was strong, and the assignments made sense. I think it would be beneficial to restructure the scheduling of the position piece and debate, as these two assignments were too close to each other considering their importance.",

I also thought the discussion sections were extremely engaging; more so than many discussion sections I've been a part of in previous semesters.",

                "Strengths: Clear delivery of information, necessary for learning about conservation biology. A good introduction to other ecology classes.\r\n\r\nNegatives: The format felt too similar throughout the virtual lectures. I wish there was more variation in the lectures.",

                "This class is a lot of work. At some point, we had a few major assignments (debate, midterm, paper) stacked within a week, and it felt like I was using disproportionate time on this class compared to others. The three exams were also (not necessarily difficult but) somewhat tediously long for how much time we were given (4+ parts to 7+ writing questions each time). Overall it felt like I had to give this course a lot more time and work than my other courses.",
                "I'm not saying that this class was a piece of cake... but I do feel like a lot of the material in the lecture was very common sense-oriented, and yet the tests were much more applied and required making that intellectual jump that wasn't really pushed in class.",

Weaknesses included unclear exam expectations and assignments\/readings that often felt like busy work (specifically the weekly research papers!). These research papers were supposed to showcase examples of what we were studying, but almost always felt very superfluous and unnecessary, especially since it ate into the time we would otherwise use in section to go over concepts from class and prepare for future exams, etc. I also would have liked to see Professor Puth engage more with students during class, like asking more questions or making the lectures a bit more interactive. although I'm certain this was made more difficult due to the transition to virtual."

                "Yes, great interdisciplinary class for anybody who likes animals",
                "Yes, particularly for non-STEM majors. The material was, for the most part, accessible regardless of previous knowledge and very pertinent to our everyday lives (e.g. the discussions about the impact of climate change).",
                "Yes. It provides a good introduction into conservation biology and Professor Puth and the TFs were well-informed and knowledgeable. Online, the course was not too engaging, but the material itself, as well as the debate, made it worth it.",
                "If you're looking for a somewhat interesting, relatively easy science credit, this course is a pretty good choice. The topics covered are very relevant. However, the course did seem extremely elementary in terms of content and pace, and there are other non-major science courses at Yale that you can take for SC credit that teach you something much more in-depth. This course gave a decent, (very) broad overview of conservation biology though. It was also very easy to do well given the large number of assignments.",
                "Yes! It was a good Science credit that felt relevant and manageable.",
                "absolutely would recommend, especially to plsc majors -- this course is a great overview of issues that are important to political debates, like the Dakota Access Pipeline or Bristol Bay mine.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class, especially for non-science majors because it is very interesting and relevant, but you do not need to be super invested in the material as a career or have any prerequisites.",
                "Yes, I believe Professor Puth is a great teacher and her class is very informative.",
                "Yes, 100%. Really interesting and pertinent material paired with an easier class workload.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, its very manageable to do well.",
                "Yes! Very well taught and informative class, never too easy but also not too difficult for a non-STEM major.",
                "Yes! This course is great for anyone interested in conservation or sustainability and is definitely accesible to students who are not science majors. The workload is manageable, and the professors and TFs are all very knowledgable, helpful, and caring!",
                "Yes! Definitely take the class if you have an interest in biodiversity conservation (be it from a science, policy, management or economic standpoint)",
                "Yes! It's a good science credit for non-science majors.",
                "Yes! Very much so",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this to non-science majors who need an SC credit or to underclassmen thinking about E&EB.",
                "Yes, great as a SC credit for non-majors, but I enjoyed it as a less strenuous introduction to the field alongside more considerable workload courses.",
                "Yes, I think it is incredibly valuable to have an understanding of the world's biodiversity.",
                "Yes, a good science credit for a non-STEM major. Interesting connections can be made with other fields of study.",
                "Yes, I would recommend to a student who is interested in studying environmental studies or ecology for a basic introduction.",
                "Take it if you need the science credit. It's not a complete gut, but it's not super difficult either. The class is honestly kind of boring. But you'll be hard-pressed to find a science credit (for non-science majors) with actually interesting and engaging course content. Most difficult part of the class for me was sitting through discussion section each week, listening to some rote variation of \"humans are bad for the environment and here's why!\" or \"we should all be vegans.\" \r\n\r\nExams were fair and tested concepts covered in lecture. The non-exam assignment grading was honestly ridiculous at times, and grades on these assignments seemed to depend significantly on the whims and personality of your assigned TF. The professor clearly knows what she's talking about, her lectures were clear, and she was very nice and understanding throughout the semester. \r\n\r\nAs science credits go, this isn't a bad one to take if you have few other options. I mean, what else is there to take? Plants and People?",
                "I'd recommend this to a student that might not be a biology major, but is still interested in environmental biology.",
                "Yes- pretty interesting material, really solid instructor, won't kill you with the work load.",
                "Yes! I have already recommended this course to various non science majors because the material is important for everyone to have a baseline understanding.",
                "Yes. This course provides a general overview of ecology and evolutionary biology without being too technical. Grading is fair and there are numerous resources available to help with studying.",
                "Absolutely.",
                "If you're interested in environmentalism and conservation, then sure, but know that it might not be as comprehensive or novel as you may want. The concepts were not difficult and the reading loads were pretty light most weeks, but also don't expect the class to be a breeze, since the examinations were very challenging and there was also a fair amount of other assignments & busywork."
