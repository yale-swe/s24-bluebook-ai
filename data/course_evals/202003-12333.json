Along the way, we learned several classical results\/techniques in this field, such as Kleenes Theorem, the Pumping Lemma, the Myhill-Nerode Theorem, the CYK Parsing Algorithm, Rices Theorem, and the Post Correspondence Problem. More generally, the applied\/technical focus of the course greatly developed my ability to manipulate and model formal languages using various automata and machines, something I had never done before. It really opened my eyes about how things like compilers and NLP work, without going greatly in depth about these applications. Meanwhile, I also built my ability to prove results regarding these topics, though not many of these proofs were very formal or intense. Overall, even with a substantial mathematical and computer science proof background, this course exposed me to an entirely new field and way of thinking."

The mid-term was quite reasonable, though take home due to COIVD, so we have 4 days to work on it. Assignments were weekly and didn't take too much time (3-4 hours each), though were at times a bit tedious to complete",
                "This class was really engaging for me. Prof. Bridy introduced the topics well and his lectures were easy to follow. I wish we learned more about how it translated to real world machines, though, especially when we got into our Turing Machine unit.",
                "This is a decent course. The content is not very difficult, but the lectures are clear and the workload is low but sufficient. I found the first two thirds of the course interesting and fun, while turing machines were confusing and not that fun.",
                "The course presented really well. Professor Bridy did a really good job balancing definitions and proofs with examples, and I was always able to follow along even through Zoom. The material was paced pretty well too, and the homeworks did an accurate job of covering everything that was presented in class.",
                "This was a great organized course providing a clear introduction to automata theory.",

                "Professor Bridy does a great job explaining the material and he presents the material in a very organized way. He goes through a good number of example which helps a lot. No weaknesses.",
                "The subject matter is extremely interesting and its very well organized. We examined different computational models in order of their computational power. Also, the problem sets were really fun and never felt tedious. There couldve been more individual feedback given.",
                "The lecture slides were very clear, and Professor Bridy gave lots of examples on the virtual whiteboard. I think more information could have been covered, as some days the class was just review or we ended early.",
                "The course content is very interesting and fun in a way, as most of the problems we solve in the class feel like you're solving a sort of logic puzzle. Professor Bridy is also great -- he's a clear lecturer, knows the material well, and is available to students. The problem sets and exams are all very fair and pretty easy. You should never expect to spend more than 5 hours on a problem set.",
                "The material was presented in a very straightforward manner and easy to follow. Professor Bridy did a great job organizing the material and providing helpful examples to clarify concepts. However, I was wondering throughout the course what the significance of the material we were learning was, and how it is applied in the general scope of computer science.",
                "I really enjoyed this course! I thought it covered very interesting topics, that the lectures were clear and informative, and that the instructor was devoted to student learning. Examples in class were very helpful, although it was sometimes frustrating when there seemed to be a disconnect between how the examples were presented in class and how the psets and exams were graded.",
                "The teaching was exceedingly clear, which was great, but the course material is inherently challenging. We should have more office hours",
                "This class is very well-structured. The course material builds on itself nicely, and is very interesting. The only way it might be improved is moving faster and covering more material.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Bridy was an amazing and chill instructor, didn't make the course stressful at all when it comes to learnability and workload.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the grading\/hw difficulty were very unpredictable and random. You could go from a 100 to a failing grade and back to a 100 on a problem set and not even realize.",
                "The main strengths of the course were the overall curriculum, the interesting problem sets, the reasonable exams, and the strong instruction. The course was very well organized, with nicely-typed notes slides and carefully-planned examples to illustrate the theoretical concepts. It provided a thorough yet broad introduction to theoretical computer science, which is a field not often covered in detail in earlier (lower-numbered) courses. Even with a more theoretical\/mathematical background, I found the proofs and thought-processes from this class to be eye-opening and very thought-provoking. Along those lines, I always loved doing the problem sets, which often felt somewhere between logic puzzles and formal proofs. They perfectly reinforced concepts from class, with most of the problems being extensions of examples from class that were still relatively challenging. Meanwhile, while weekly, they were not very long, only taking somewhere between 4 and 8 hours each week. Similarly, since the class was virtual, the exams were a take-home format in which we had 48-72 hours to complete them; however, they were only meant to take 2-3 hours, a far more generous and reasonable approach to virtual exams than many other courses. Finally, Professor Bridy himself was exceptional, providing an amusing and relaxed atmosphere and being very open to questions, whether live in class or via email. Unlike most classes which are scrambling to finish in time, he usually finished a few minutes early, and the problem sets related to the previous week of class, so they could be finished as soon as they were released. Meanwhile, his actual teaching style was excellent, with theoretical explanations followed by clarifying examples that related directly to the homework. It was honestly a breath of fresh air compared to the normal confused lectures followed by partially unrelated homeworks of many STEM classes. Furthermore, Professor Bridy taught in a very calm yet engaging way, so class always felt like a nice reprieve from the stresses of life (and 2020). The main weakness of the class was spotty grading, as people with very similar answers received drastically different grades depending on how they explained it. The desired level of detail was very unclear, and overall it seemed quite random. Maybe the rubrics could have been improved, or more grading could have been done by the professor, but this was definitely a source of stress for a lot of people."

It's rather difficult to adjust to exams online to prevent cheating, but this seemed like a good solution, especially since students could still email the professor with questions. \r\nI also appreciated that Prof. Bridy stayed on the zoom link after class for questions -- I've had some professors end the zoom before I do, and it's always extremely jarring to be ejected from the classroom into your physical surroundings.",
                "The lecturer used a mixture of slides and drawing on a virtual whiteboard. The slides were great for covering conceptual material, while the whiteboard was used to practice problem-solving related to the concepts. Both made for great review materials.",
                "The flexibility Prof. Bridy offered with the workload and deadlines was unmatched. Really nothing more to say on that, I was just so grateful for his open mindedness.",
                "Overall, the live online lectures were very effective, with clear instruction, feedback, and engagement via questions and examples. I also thought Professor Bridys willingness to answer emails quickly and thoroughly greatly improved the virtual experience, as you always felt connected to the class. As mentioned before, having 2-3 days to complete the virtual exams was much less complicated and stressful than classes that tried to make them synchronous, while not really affecting learning very much. On the other hand, while I did not attend any office hours, they did seem pretty lightly attended, even though I often collaborated with peers in a way that felt like office hours. This is mostly on the students, but some way to encourage virtual office hours just for casual collaboration might be helpful to students who did not already have friends in the class to work with. These problems lend themselves to collaboration, so office hours collaboration should be a great learning tool."

                "Yes, great CS elective and Professor Bridy is one of the most through, passionate, clear and effective professors I have found at Yale.",
                "You have to be interested in the topic.",
                "Absolutely! This course covers some really interesting material and the professor does an amazing job explaining it.",
                "Absolutely. From cpsc 201, I thought that I wouldnt enjoy formal languages and autometa theory, but I decided to give the course a shot because it was pretty highly rated. If you have any concerns about the content of the course being interesting, dont be concerned. This was really an amazing class and Id recommend it to anyone.",
                "This course was amazing. Theoretical computer science is extremely interesting, and Professor Bridy did a great job of explaining it.",
                "Yes, I would strongly recommend this course, especially if it is taught with Professor Bridy. He's a great lecturer and a fair instructor -- he always communicated the material very well, was very available to students, and was a very helpful resource. The course material is fun and not too hard -- if you took 201 and enjoyed the back half of the class, it's basically a more in depth version of that, exploring DFAs, CFGs, and Turing Machines. The problem sets are easy and the midterms very straight forward too. I genuinely enjoyed the class, as solving all the problems are like mini logic puzzles. Would definitely recommend.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. Professor Bridy makes the material extremely approachable and enjoyable, even to students without as much of a theoretical\/math background. I found the material really interesting and even coming up with proofs for the problems sets felt like a fun puzzle. If you are a CS major and enjoyed learning about DFAs\/CFGs\/Turing machines in 201, you should definitely take this class.",
                "Yes. This is one of my favorite classes I took at Yale, and I would highly recommend it for anybody interested in Computer Science and Mathematics and their overlap.",
                "If youre taking this for the CS major, it is a nice class because the workload is pretty low and the problems are fun. You will spend a lot of time working through logic problems and drawing diagrams, which I enjoyed. The content is pretty interesting and gives you an idea of the history of the invention of computers as we work through the simpler computational ideas that led there.",
                "Highly reccomend! Professor Bridy was great and engaging and this was certainly the best CS course I've taken at Yale.",
                "If they are interested in theoretical concepts in computer science, yes. However, if they are looking for more applicable, hands on courses, then no.",
                "Yes, I think the content is very interesting! I would tell interested students however to be more careful in their psets and on their exams than they think they have to be, because it often felt like the grading did not fully reflect how the examples were presented in class.",
                "Yes, for a higher level CS course",
                "This class is an example of how Yale excels in theory -- there are some practical applications in the course, but mainly it's about the title: automata theory. If you interested in math, want to get some more practice writing proofs, or need a good CS elective that doesn't require programming, 10\/10 would recommend this course. There are weekly psets which can get to be a little much at times, but they really aren't that difficult and do a good job of illustrating the concepts in class.",
                "I would recommend this to any student interested in the crossover between computer science and mathematics. This class blurs the line between the two more satisfyingly than any other I've taken. I would recommend this to any computer science student interesting in the theoretical side of the field. This class won't improve your programming in a very meaningful way, but I am left with a better understanding of what computers are capable of. If you've ever wondered about the absolute theoretical problem-solving capacity of a computer, or loved the Turing machine problem set in CPSC 201, or thought the halting problem was interesting to think about, this is the class for you. This class is very low-workload - none of the weekly problem sets took me longer than 90 minutes or so to complete. This is honestly perhaps a negative of the course - it definitely could afford to go a bit faster and cover more material.",
                "Absolutely recommend this course to anyone in the CS major, but especially those who enjoyed the parsing\/grammar\/turing machine sections of CS 201, or are generally interested in programming languages, low level computer architecture, etc. The class doesn't get super practical or technical about these, but the concepts taught are enjoyable and really cool.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student looking for an introduction to theoretical computer science and formal languages, or really to anyone looking for a fun and approachable mathy and\/or logicy computer science class. It is not incredibly difficult or time-consuming, but it is definitely very engaging and interesting. It is certainly a good choice if you want something different from traditional computer science classes, yet it is not anything like most math courses either. Its really a unique and fulfilling experience. Meanwhile, due to its reasonable workload, it is a good choice for pairing with an intense programming course like 323. Furthermore, I think it provides a good entry to a more in-depth study of the field. However, I would not recommend it to someone with a lot of experience in these topics, as it is not super rigorous or formal. On the other hand, it is definitely useful to have some previous exposure to proofs and theoretical reasoning, but it does not have to be from the direct prerequisites (just ask Professor Bridy if you are unsureI almost didnt take it for this reason until I sent him an email). But as an introduction to a new field of computer science, as it was for me, I would highly recommend it!"
