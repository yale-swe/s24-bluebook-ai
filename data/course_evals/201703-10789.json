    "In addition to learn a lot of new vocabulary words, I also learnt how to integrate them when having a conversation with someone (so the application of the word in real-life context).",
    "My Chinese has improved in terms of vocabulary and I now have a deeper understanding of Chinese society and culture. I would also that my listening skill has improved, although my speaking not so much.",
    "This course really improved my Chinese abilities as well as my understanding of Chinese culture and politics.",
    "I learned more about the Chinese culture and language. My grammar, vocab, an speaking skills were also expanded upon.",
    "I developed my ability to use formal Chinese grammar structures and vocabulary and additionally enhanced my understanding of Chinese culture.",
    "The class greatly improved my listening, speaking and reading abilities. Moreover, I learned a great deal about Chinese culture, history, and current affairs.",

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the course were that it did introduce a lot of new words. However, the learning would have been better if more time were spent on a set of words so as to make sure that the students truly know how to use them.",
    "The course is enjoyable and avoids some of the pitfalls of Chinese courses by not hammering down too much work. It helped me broaden my vocabulary and develop a good understanding fo contemporary China.",
    "This class was fantastic and I would not change it.  I appreciated the text book which was interesting and included important information about China's history and culture.  Our professors were engaging and caring and the class was a lot of fun.",
    "The grammar could have been taught a little differently to ensure that it sticks. Otherwise, the classes were taught very well.",
    "The course does a great job forcing students to engage with new vocabulary and grammar. I also appreciate that assignments require students to hone every aspect of learning a foreign language: speaking, listening, reading, and writing. I would have preferred, however, if the course had given more time for students to engage in discussion.",
    "I thought that the class was most engaging when we had discussions and insight into the origin of words and phrases, but could get a bit tedious when we focused too much on repeating grammar structures, although I do see how that too is important for memorisation.",
    "The overall structure is very strong. The fact that the assignments are dispersed between hard-copy homework and online homework was a bit confusing. Otherwise, teaching was very clear and structured."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! It is a great way of gaining a better understanding of both the culture and the language.",
    "Take this course if you want to learn Chinese, you don't really have another option. It's not terrible and if you manage well isn't a terrible workload. That being said, it could be organized a little better and I do feel like my pronunciation has gotten worse.",
    "Take this course!  The material is more interesting than previous Chinese classes but the instructors are of the same caliber as the other Chinese professors.  They are caring and go out of their way to help every student succeed.   Your Chinese will improve a lot.",
    "Yes, because the course was very interactive and enjoyable.",
    "For students trying to improve their formal Chinese speaking and writing, I would certainly recommend this course.",
    "For a student who wants to study Chinese at college I certainly would recommend this course.",
    "Yes, CHNS 150 is great and you can feel your Chinese improving!"
