                "This class completely changed how I read novels. There is a whole world of narrative techniques that mimic the way the mind works that I have never really paid attention to before and now I can't unsee it. I had so many random interesting thoughts that were prompted by this class.",
                "I learned so much about narrative theory (including that narrative theory can be interesting and also fairly difficult). I also got the chance to read some incredible novels, which I enjoyed.",
                "I learned about narrative theory and its use in modernist novels to represent consciousness. Prof Yeazell assigns a lot of secondary sources, which forces you to engage with criticism both in class and in writing essays.",
                "I gained familiarity with several wonderful novels, and was also introduced to literary criticism that provided ways of understanding how aspects of these novels functioned, such as free indirect discourse and theory of mind. I also strengthened my writing skills through the short passage analysis and two papers, on which Professor Yeazell provided incisive and thorough feedback.",
                "In this course, we read many of the important Victorian and modern English novels, including Middlemarch and The Portrait of a Lady. The course also included heavy treatment of narrative theory and free indirect discourse.",
                "I read many of the greatest novels in English literature and gained a deeper understanding of how consciousness is represented in third person narration.",
                "I learned more about narrative theory, about secondary criticism related to Henry James, George Eliot, Virginia Woolf, and Jane Austen. I also read a bunch of novels."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this class are its syllabus. The book are all fantastic and I'm really glad I got to read them. I think a weakness however is the once-a-week seminar format. The class was sometimes not engaging and it was hard to pay attention for almost 2 hours.",
                "The greatest strength of the course was probably its incredibly strong syllabus. I found all of the readings to be very interesting. Professor Yeazell was also great! She always had incredibly intelligent observations about the texts that we were reading. \r\n\r\nThe class did sometimes lack energy (which I find helpful in seminars), but I think that could be due to its late-ish time.",
                "A strength is the curriculum, though the high volume of reading can be overwhelming at first. A weakness is that Professor Yeazell has high expectations for essays, but writing only two essays during the course doesn't give one much opportunity to improve. Her availability is also low because there is only one general slot of office hours during the week and it gets very crowded.",
                "The strength of this class, in addition to the selection of novels, was Professor Yeazell herself. She was highly skilled in facilitating group discussions, in pointing to and illuminating parts of the text, and in offering contextual information about the novels and criticism that we read. I consistently left class discussions feeling enlivened and engaged. The course's weakness would probably be that some of the criticism felt less interesting than the novels themselves, and we didn't always discuss all of the criticism.",
                "The works taught in the class are really incredible. I took it because I really wanted to read the novels taught on the syllabus. However, because there is so much reading, it can be difficult to keep up if one falls behind or does not plan things out.",
                "The selection of novels for this course was superb. I especially appreciated tracing the themes of representation of consciousness in fiction and the problem of other minds throughout novels written in such different time periods. One suggestion I have would be to have the course meet two times per week rather than once per week. I did not find one meeting sufficient to discuss such complex and long readings. Additionally, I think two meetings would make our discussions more focused. I found that after about an hour and a half I had a hard time paying attention to the same degree that I was able to in the beginning. I strongly recommend making this course (and courses similar to this one) meet twice per week.",
                "Everything was great, no weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: The books were amazing, of course. Great novels! Professor Yeazell is super smart and an expert in the field. It is enlightening to talk to her during office hours.\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Yeazell always came to class with interesting quotes to point us towards that were illuminating. But sometimes class discussion felt a bit unfocused and it felt like we students were unsure of how to contribute."

            "comments": [
                "Yes absolutely, but only if you are going to do the reading. There is absolutely no point in taking this class if you aren't making it a priority. You will get nothing out of the seminars without hours of outside of class work.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. The workload can be heavy at times, so if you are considering taking this class, you should double-check the syllabus just to see if the reading will be manageable for you. That being said, I learned so much about narratology, got the chance to learn from a great professor, and read some wonderful novels. So yes, I would recommend it.",
                "I would because Professor Yeazell is a staple of the English department. I think it's rather important to read old school criticism and be able to bring it into your own understanding of novels. I think discussion in class was usually pretty high and the professor did a good job moderating.",
                "Yes! This is a great course - a highlight of my semester. It requires a fair amount of time to do the readings, so be prepared for that, but it is worth it.",
                "I would absolutely. Ruth Yeazell is a gem and honestly an amazing person to work with. I also think it is wonderful to walk through these works of literature with other students in a careful and attentive way. Furthermore, narratology is a subject that all serious students of literature need taught to them at some point.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who likes reading novels and\/or has an interest in fictional representation of consciousness. One thing to keep in mind though is the course does require that you read and write about literary theory; so if you would rather avoid theory, I would not take the course.",
                "Yes! Wednesdays were always my favorite days because of this class. I enjoyed all the books on the reading list and our discussions were always lively and dynamic. I would say that some of our discussions were the best I have had at Yale, especially our discussions on Middlemarch and The Portrait of a Lady. Our focus on consciousness was also incredibly fascinating and it changed the way I read and understand fiction. If you have the chance to take this course, you are very lucky!",
                "Yes, I would, if the student is interested and committed to reading the books on a syllabus. Warning, this reading load is not for the faint of heart! The reading could be 200-300 dense pages a week, if not more. But if you are truly interested in the novels on the syllabus, it is worth it. I would recommend this course to a student looking to get to know Professor Yeazell's thinking on the books we studied."
