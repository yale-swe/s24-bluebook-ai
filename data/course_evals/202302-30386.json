We covered a great deal of material in a short time. The one thing I wish we'd talked about a bit more was locating stars and planets, as in learning to find where they are by looking up at our sky.",

He's got the propensity to be a bit Rude and Condescending when you least expect it. He's book-smart but CANNOT read the room when it comes to students' human emotions.\r\n\r\nExpect heavy passive-aggressive condescension from him if you're less than perfect. If you give an answer in class that's not on the right track, he's known to go \"Woahhh, I only gave you One sig fig and somehow your answer has EIGHT! How'd you get THAT level of precision?\". He said things like that to multiple students, multiple times, in front of the WHOLE class.\r\n\r\n...Also, future students  DON'T submit anything late; there's a solid likelihood he'll unexpectedly tank your grade.\r\n\r\nUnironically, I should've listened to other students' past CourseTable entries about his bits of unexpected rudeness.\r\nDecent class, weakened by an unexpectedly-patronizing professor. Emotionally TAXING."

I think everyone should have a basic understanding for why the earth is the way it is, and how celestial objects function and interact. I also think that this course was manageable over zoom, and I think it is a good way to earn science credit if you need it.",
