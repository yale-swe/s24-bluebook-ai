I learned about a lot of different atrocities throughout history, what international law says about atrocity, and how states act in practice.",
                "I learned what constitutes a mass atrocity and the different mechanisms local, national, and international stakeholders have in its prevention and punishment.",

                "I learned about the development of the responsibility to protect, early warning signs of genocide, and about the significance of the Genocide Convention.",
                "I learned about various topics in the field of genocide prevention, including early warning, responsibility to protect, etc. I also learned how to prepare a report for a specific client (the UN OSAPG) and balance their interests with the things I wanted to say. I also learned how to write various different kinds of papers, including traditional essays, op-eds, and policy briefs."

                "The readings for this course are very informative and the assignments are well spaced out while still frequent. I also feel I was able to improve throughout the course which I was very appreciative for. I learned a lot both content and skill wise!",
                "Overall a very good and comprehensive class. I wish there were greater emphasis on all the different kinds of codifications concerning mass atrocities. We mostly talked about R2P and the Genocide Convention.",
                "The primary strength is Professor Simon, who is extremely knowledgable and passionate about this topic. His expertise made our discussions more valuable and educational. The course also had extremely good guest speakers, and I learned a lot from them about atrocity prevention from a number of perspectives, ranging from domestic to multilateral. Finally, the readings were excellent, and they had a good blend of theory and practical/historical examples. The main weakness was the writing assignments, which were never really connected to anything we did in class and also had very vague and unhelpful instructions. I think the course could be improved by providing more specific assignment details and guidelines, and more broadly by increasing the organization of how topics were covered over the course of the class.",
                "Strengths: great discussions, assignments are interesting and worthwhile \r\nWeaknesses: deadlines for assignments were often unclear or not communicated well",
                "Strengths: There was lots of room for class discussion and for students to share ideas. The papers were really interesting to write, and the final two papers ended up being replaced by a group project to then present at the UN. Very cool! Weaknesses: many of the readings were repetitive (they could be cut down by half and still communicate the same amount of information), and they were never referenced in class, which I think was a missed opportunity.",
                "This course was extremely flexible, such that when the class received an invitation to come to the UN at the end of the semester, Prof. Simon rerouted the entire course to focus on writing an essay for the OSAPG and attending the Conference. I really appreciated this adaptation to real life events, as that trip to the UN was truly an opportunity of a lifetime. I also really appreciated that the readings focused on lots of different aspects of genocide prevention. I also really enjoyed the different speakers we had visit the class. Finally, I liked that we got opportunities to revise assignments to get points back, as I feel that this improved my writing skills in general."

It is a very standard introduction, so if you are already knowledgable or are not that interested I would recommend something more niche. However, those looking for an informative class with an expert professor should take this one!",

You will learn a lot and have great discussions along the way. Just be prepared to be frustrated by assignments that are unclear or vague.",
                "Yes! I think the topic matter is incredibly interesting and you learn a lot throughout the semester.",
                "Yes! It's a good introduction to the field of atrocity prevention. The papers are fun to write, and class discussion was very open.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is fascinating to learn about atrocity prevention and hear from various experts in the field. It was also great to be able to write about case studies that interested me personally and connect them to the content of the course. Overall, it's definitely not a course to miss!"
