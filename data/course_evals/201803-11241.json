    "I learned more about US policy in Africa and what it takes to work on a team for a common end goal.",
    "I've gained so many insights and experiences throughout this course. It was a unique and special experience that I've grown and learned so much from First, the chance to interface with U.S. Special Forces was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and the weekend we spent down at their military base really humbled me, and made me rethink my stance of the U.S. military, and their role in the bureaucracy. I also loved the opportunities to speak to so many ambassadors, former and current, a former Secretary of State, and various other policy officials, and to glean their insights from personal experience and relay them to Special Forces was a fun and special learning opportunity. The capstone is a class like no other, because it creates the space to take the theory and literature we've been reading in the major into an actionable problem and practice, and to tailor a feasible solution towards the client. This experience was a tough academic challenge in many ways, because it is real and has the potential to affect real lives and an established government organization, but it was worth every single second."

   "comments": [
    "The course involves a lot of time outside of class and does not provide sufficient channels for all voices to be heard. The course allows students to practice collaboration with peers on a real-world project.",
    "Strengths: Freeform, and the onus is on the students to step up to the plate and create a working schedule, which could be a weakness but for us it was a strength. Even when unexpected obstacles arose, it was a good learning experience and valuable. Life-changing, because the product at the end has real and true impact. And the potential of the project is unlimited, as long as you have unlimited aspirations. And our capstone with Professor King really did.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
    "Strengths: Client-driven work can be much more interesting than purely academic endeavors.\r\nWeaknesses: There was minimal structure to the capstone and little guidance throughout."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course, because it involves an inordinate amount of work and exposure to other personalities that inhibit student learning.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the capstone is honestly so unique and unforgettable. Especially with Professor King--he really made us aware of the fact that the sky was the limit with our capstone project and what we could create, and because of that, we spent our semester talking to very senior level officials in the U.S. Government about the military in Africa; visited Special Forces at their military base; and really explored a number of different topics that were catered to our different academic interests. Every step of the way was a challenge, and definitely required work, but it was worth it knowing that our deliverable had impact and carried weight to 3rd Special Forces Group. And that feeling was very special.",
    "My capstone was the perfect culmination of my Global Affairs experience. As a Global Affairs major, my classes have focused on hypothetical applications of theory. The capstone gave us the opportunity to evaluate and apply the theories we have learned over the years to real world situations. Briefing an actual client made the project so much more meaningful and made us really consider the full implications of our suggestions. As someone interested in United States military policy and security policy more broadly, Special Forces provided the perfect client. The opportunities that we had during the capstone were incredible for their own sake and for the knowledge that we could never have gained through research into the literature alone. Meeting with former ambassadors and Secretary Kerry provided invaluable insights into the thinking of policymakers. While the capstone was a lot of work, perhaps more than any other class, it was well worth the effort.",
    "The capstone program has the potential to be one of the best opportunities for undergraduates. At its current state, Jackson has found incredible partner organizations who are willing -- and excited! -- to work with Yale undergrads. Yet much needs to be improved & standardized in each of these client engagements. Given the sheer breadth and depth of work that needs to be done in a three month period, clear guidance from professors is essential. Additionally, midterm feedback forms could have been incorporated to facilitate team communication."
