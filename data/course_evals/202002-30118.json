   "comments": [
    "I have learnt many useful depoliticized approaches to better understand human rights issues, such as human rights-based approches and governance approaches. Also, we learnt a lot about the heated human  rights issues, and strengthened our understanding over the human rights conditions in our own countries.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of various concepts such as the Human Rights Based Approach to Development. I was informed of how to incorporate human rights into all aspects of governance. This was the first college level class I had taken, I am a rising senior in high school.",
    "I really loved this class and wish it was offered during the semester!! You definitely get a good understanding of the human rights field and the professor does a good job of relating the subject to current world issues. I am personally very interested in immigration so I really enjoyed focusing on that subject in class.",
    "I gained a solid background in the role of the UNited Nations and the mechanisms of international law",
    "I was able to gain a great insight into the human rights situation not only of my country of origin but worldwide.",
    "Through this course, I learned how human rights emerged, how they are used, and how good governance works to implement them. Additionally, through the three guest speakers, I got more insight into how organizations work to protect and expand human rights.",
    "He gave us access to great people who work in international law and nonprofits, we would probably never had the opportunity to meet and ask the questions that we did unless Professor Zavala would have facilitated it.",
    "I learned a lot about human rights and international law. I had never taken a human rights-based class at Yale before and this was all very informative.",
    "This course has truly provided me several tools which I could use to analyze human right issues, and all the concepts that Professor mentioned during the course really help me maintain an objective stance regarding human right issues.",
    "This course has been very very helpful to me for developing my knowledge regarding International Human Rights. Professor Zavala had a detailed knowledge of the subject and was very keen to teach me. Additionally, he even provided a personal touch to his teachings which seemed a little bit tough during such times. However, this experience as whole has been wonderful for me."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "If this course is going to be given online in the future, I would recommend to use Zoom's mechanics to make it easier for students to participate without feeling like they were interrupting rudely. There was obvious strengths in how informed Professor Zavala and our numerous guest speakers were.",
    "Strengths: You get a pretty good understanding of human rights for the short amount of time you get to study. My favorite part of the course was when Professor Zavala brought guest speakers for the whole class time to speak on their experiences and opinions. I really liked how the class touched on various disciplines including morality, philosophy, internationa law, public policy, etc. Also, I really appreciate how organzied Canvas was; it super easy to navigate and made it way eaiser to find our reading material! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we could have gotten a detailed explanation or rubric for our final paper. Before this class, I never had any expereince writing a policy memo so I didn't have any idea what to do. I don't think this was the professor's fault, but it sometimes felt as if our discussions were lacking. Half of the class was Yale students and the other was high school students who didn't have a lot of experience in dicussions.",
    "Strengths: Professor Zavala is be very knowledgeable and passionate, slides are posted after classes, discussion posts help hold you accountable for reading, the midterm forces you to go back and make sure you understand things, guest speakers were really cool\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class time couldve been more structured, rubrics for assignments could be helpful, online format made discussion difficult at times",
    "The course was very well structured and highly informative \r\nAlthough the classes were held via Zoom, they were very interactive. \r\nEspecially the guest speakers gave a unique perspective on this important subject.",
    "Great introduction into human rights, its approaches and the human rights situation of other nations. \r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes it was confusing if there was any reading for the days in which the class did not stick to the lesson plan (for example when we added another class for UPR presentations). \r\nI would have also liked to have more of an introduction of how to write a policy memo. I also think that the presentation should weigh more in terms of grading. \r\nSometimes the discussion lacked a bitt and during discussions the students did not have adequate time to speak. \r\nThere was also no way to contact other students and discuss things with them outside of class.",
    "Strengths: the course offers students an amazing insight into the world of human rights through the relevant readings and videos, class discussions, and guest speakers. Additionally, students are able to apply their knowledge of human rights to their country of origin or country of interest through assignments such as the presentation and final paper-- I feel that this was an important aspect that allowed students to dive deeper into how human rights are relevant to their individual communities.\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked to receive more feedback about certain assignments such as the midterm exam and presentation.",
    "I was not so happy on the direction we received for the policy memo, since I'm new to taking on political science courses I was unsure of how to go about it.",
    "Strengths: provides so much background on human rights issues, relates it to current events, and overall helps build skills in reading legal documents and such. Great organization on canvas and I found the discussion posts before each class to be very important\/helpful for keeping up with my work and for seeing other students perspectives\r\nWeaknesses: this may just be a fault of online learning, but sometimes it was difficult to jump in discussions during lecture. Also there are a ton of readings and a lot of topics which can be a little overwhelming - I would recommend keeping one topic to one day if possible, but I know thats difficult given the short time frame and the amount of info there is!",
    "I learned a lot of legal technical norms and practices in the internatinal arena.",
    "This course itself is excellent, but I don't really prefer the remote learning mothed.",
    "I found this course to be very interesting. the kind of meticulous readings that the teachers gave us was very helpful to us. I don't think any changes are required for the same."

    "Yes. Students will learn a lot about how to deal with human rights issues in a depoliticized approach. Also, the professor and TA were very nice, always willing to give instructions.",
    "I would undoubtedly recommend this course to another student. The concepts taught in this class are vital to establishing a more equitable society. Plus, Professor Zavala's lectures, though lengthy, are very informative.",
    "If you're interested in human rights this course is a must!! Being a polisci major, I had never even taken a course that focused on human rights a lot. Even though this class is 5 weeks long, you get to learn so much about the human rights field and the human rights violations that occur throughout the world. Professor Zavala was also a great professor who took time to explain any ideas that were confusing, whether it be in class or office hours.",
    "Yes- its a cool intro to international law and human rights issues (especially regarding migration)",
    "This course was one of the best I have ever taken part in, I would most certainly recommend it to any student who wants to learn more about this interesting topic.",

    "I would definitely suggest this course to my fellow-mates who have interest in international affairs specifically for Human Rights."
