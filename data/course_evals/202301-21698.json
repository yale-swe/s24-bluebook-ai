It was very, very good preparation for my summer research, especially since I had never even stepped foot in a professional biology laboratory before.",

            "comments": [
                "Strength is that the work is very engaging and interesting. The main weakness is that the professor is sometimes vague in the assignments, and sometimes doesn't explain the science/biology behind the procedures and project that we work on. This makes it difficult to truly understand what is going on in the class.",
                "Prof. Moreno was great and very knowledgeable. She was definitely the strength of the class. I wish there was a little more structure but that is partially just the design of the class.",
                "Strength: Professor Moreno is very kind and genuinely cares about the well-being of her students and I really appreciate that. The techniques that we were taught are useful in a variety of laboratory situations outside of the classroom. \r\n\r\nWeakness: This class is the most disorganized class I've taken at Yale so far. We received feedback on our rough drafts for our final paper 2 days before the final draft was due. For most of the semester, I did not 100% understand the end goal of the project we were working on because the class was so all over the place.",
                "This class was generally well taught, but a little confusing at times. Professor and TFs were very accessible and always clarified if there were questions.",
                "Strengths: Teaching staff were kind, low workload, good introduction to molec. bio techniques if you have little/no experience in research. Weaknesses: Classes ran overtime often (up to 1 hour), overall course felt disorganized, many assignments were posted the day before they were due, grading was slow.",
                "I loved the experimental side of the course and performing typical assays, but I think the theoretical side of the overall carrot project was not explained very well.",
                "weakness: very unorganized\r\nstrength: moreno is easy to talk to",
                "Overall, I think the biggest strength of this course was the community and the skills I developed. My peers, my teaching fellows, and Dr. Moreno were all very enthusiastic and engaged, and I think all of us were able to work together to further our progress. At the same time, I learned many important laboratory techniques and procedures, figured out how to multitask and work independently, and how to be a member of a laboratory.",
                "Nearly everything about this course was excellent - it was based around a very interesting project, there was a lot of hands-on lab work, the TAs were great, and I got to improve my scientific writing. \r\n\r\nThe one big flaw was that assignments often weren't communicated clearly. Assignments typically weren't posted on canvas until the last minute (maybe on Friday or Saturday, when class was on the upcoming Monday), which made it difficult to keep track of what we were supposed to do each week. In addition, the details of assignments were often unclear.",
                "Strengths: excellent introduction to molecular biology lab research. Students are immersed in a term-long project, so the activities follow-up from one week to the next. Dr. Moreno places as much emphasis on background information as she does on the weekly activities themselves and ensures that all of her students are on the same page.\r\nWeaknesses: waiting time in between lab activities. We also, unfortunately, did not have enough time to perform CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing."

                "Yes and no. If you can find another biology lab to take that would help you develop the same skillset as this class would, I say to take that instead. But if this is the only biology lab offered, then take this one but understand that it will be very disorganized.",
                "I would. Dr. Moreno is a good instructor.",
                "Yes! I developed so many basic laboratory skills and I now feel confident while doing research.",
                "This course was very disorganized. It was hard to follow along and truly understand what we were doing and why we were doing it. I got all my main directions and questions answered by the teaching fellows. They helped guide me and they were the ones that gave me feedback on assignments, but I received little to no directions, feedback, or questions answered from the instructor. We barely got through the very first steps of our proposed project. You can count on being in the lab the entire time allotted and you can count on the lab going overtime too.",
                "no, it was disorganized and could be learned through a lab",
                "Yes, 100%! I think this course was such a worthwhile commitment for me, and I highly recommend it for anyone who needs experience and/or is planning to work in a laboratory environment in the near future. It also helps you develop more interpersonal skills, as well as increased independence.",
                "I highly recommend this course to anyone wanting to get experience with hands-on molecular biology lab work (specifically genetics), to do original research, or to improve their scientific writing skills. Dr Moreno is an amazing mentor and this class is a great opportunity!\r\n\r\nIf you plan to take this project-based course, be aware that much of the \"deliverables\" are due quite late in the semester, so it's important to make sure you understand the steps you're taking each week - it will be difficult to write your final report during reading week if you can't remember the purpose of something you did in the 3rd week of the semester. In addition, assignments probably won't be communicated very clearly; know that Dr Moreno is very flexible with deadlines, so hopefully this will remove some pressure / stress. Just email her if you need an extension or if you have questions!",
                "Yes! Dr. Moreno is a wonderful professor, and the skills you learn in this class are very practical and applicable to any of your future research endeavors."
