            "comments": [
                "The course was fairly unorganized and had quite a bit of stress attached to it. It was difficult to know when things were due and instructions about what exactly we needed to do were unclear. The classes in this course seemed to mostly be filled with busy work. In L1, classes were usually spent practicing conversation and going over material and new concepts, but this class spent most time going over drills that we had already completed for homework, instead of talking about actual content.",
                "The structure of the class was a little confusing at times but overall it was great.",
                "In terms of weaknesses, the course is very disorganized. Lectures are very disorganized and hard to follow; they also aren't directly synchronized with the book, so we just start learning random grammar topics and are expected to internalize it without feedback in real time. Asynchronous assignments were graded too harshly and didn't help me use the relevant vocabulary until late in the semester. We are tested on the Shami dialect but we never use it in class or in assignments. Most of the time when I ask questions about concepts I was more confused or dissatisfied with the answers. Communication about which assignments were due and when was lackluster, and we never talked about them in class or received real feedback on homework, so basically all of our learning was decided based upon confusing lectures and reading the book on our own (or going to office hours if we have time outside of the lengthy homework and studying for exams\/quizzes).\r\n\r\nIn terms of strengths, grading was rather lenient and we have opportunities for extra credit. Moreover, the instructor and TA are both really kind and willing to help if you ask for it outside of class. Though explanations\/lectures didn't always help.",
                "This course is strong on grammar and vocabulary, and if you study you gain a lot. I think this course's weakness is spontaneous conversation because it is not something we did often.",
                "I think this course's main area for improvement is in its organization. While most students (including myself) adored Dr. Aziz as a lighthearted and passionate person, his class structure allowed for miscommunication and disengagement. I consider myself to be a dedicated student of Arabic, but even I found myself skipping on the textbook's readings in order to complete the high number of drills assigned. I think the class would be greatly improved by a slight alteration to its structure. If Dr. Aziz assigned daily textbook readings along with ~1 relevant drill per day (without students needing to complete all drills in the units), the students would be more likely to stay on track and value their learning over a completion checkmark on the companion website. I also believe that spending more of the class time on reviewing errors students frequently make on tests and less time on translating from English to Arabic would cultivate a more intellectually challenging but rewarding class environment. \r\n\r\nStill, Dr. Aziz is a kind and approachable professor who is always understanding of his students' external circumstances (and sometimes probably a bit too forgiving).",
                "Strengths: The class incorporates lots of different types of activities, the al-Kitaab book is well structured and if you follow along with it closely you'll learn a lot, Professor Aziz is super understanding and flexible, he helps make the classroom environment fun.\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Aziz is not always the best at explaining grammatical concepts. We theoretically covered a lot of different ones (verbal sentences, the subjunctive vs. the nominative, the future and past tense, etc...) but a lot of the students never grasped them because of unclear explanations.",
                "Weaknesses: This course lacked the necessary regular engagement needed for students so early in their Arabic journey. During lessons, I often felt like the professors classes made the material in the book much more complicated than I thought. Similarly, when I asked questions the answers did not improve my understanding. The only students who I saw succeed were ones who were very independent in their Arabic learning and taught themselves from the book on their own.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Doctor Aziz is extremely kind. I have the feeling that he wanted us to succeed and did the best he could. This created a fun and happy environment in each class which included fun elements like Youtube videos, Kahoot, and Interactive communication. However, I often felt like I was smiling through the pain of my language learnings atrophy.",
                "Strenghths: Grading was generous \r\nWeakness: hard to learn anything\/ difficult course overall"

                "This is not a bad course, but Professor Aziz's teaching style definitely takes some time to get used to. The workload is not bad, but is very unorganized so it is very important to stay on top of things. He is pretty generous and is willing to help students when needed. However, he is not entirely clear when explaining grammatical concepts so it is difficult to fully understand. Much of the learning will be done outside the classroom.",
                "Yes if they are interested in the Arabic language.",
                "No, I wouldn't recommend even taking Arabic at Yale unless you vet the professors you can choose from. The classes, at least at the beginning levels, are not organized or taught well with certain professors and sometimes you don't have a choice about which professor you get depending on your schedule and if you are a heritage speaker. Honestly the professors are really kind, but I just didn't enjoy my experience taking Arabic at Yale and I actually felt demotivated to continue learning Arabic due to the disorganization. If you want to learn Arabic, genuinely consider the professors and ask previous students what their experience was like with any given experience because that will probably make or break your learning if you don't have any previous experience with Arabic.",
                "Yes! If you enjoy Arabic, then this is a great course.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student pursuing the Arabic language. In many ways, it is just a stepping stone to the higher levels---I don't want anyone to be discouraged from learning the language just because Yale's program is not the highest regarded. I have found Arabic to be a very rewarding language, and the structural problems of the course did not reduce my desire to continue learning it. Also, the program is much easier than some other language programs at Yale, so if they're looking to just get rid of their language requirement, Arabic is not a bad choice.",
                "Yes, Arabic is a great language to learn! Make sure to choose your professor based on your learning style, though. If you want a relaxed classroom environment and are willing to do a lot of self directed study, Professor Aziz is great, but if you need more formal structure to help you learn a language, you should probably opt for one of the different sections if they're available.",
                "No. I would recommend looking into the other L2 arabic instructors",
                "If you are really passionate about arabic and have a solid foundational knowledge base set up then yes, for funsies? no"
