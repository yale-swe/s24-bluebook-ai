                "My writing improved tremendously in this class, especially my ability to properly edit a paper stylistically. I also learned how to analyze philosophical texts in ways that my previous classes did not.",
                "I gained confidence in reading, discussing, and writing about philosophical texts. We studied a variety of feminist theories and I found myself applying these theories to other classes and my day to day life. I also think I developed a much healthier approach to writing. We spent a lot of time discussing style and process for academic writing, which has helped me immensely.",
                "This course dives deeply into feminist perspectives on philosophy. That includes questioning objectivity in journalism (and in philosophy), feminist standpoint epistemology, different philosophical arguments for and against anger and so so much more. We also focused a lot on writing including workshops on titles, micro essays, and retrieval practices.  \r\n\r\nI think the biggest thing in terms of insights that I took from this course were that my thoughts and feelings about philosophy aren't completely crazy. Maybe they are a little out there but this class gave me to tools to articulate my issues with how philosophy is often done, especially at older, more traditional institutions like Yale.",
                "I learned a great deal about different approaches to feminist moral theorizing. We tackled such questions as: What does it mean to philosophize in theory versus in practice? Is \"objectivity\" possible or even desirable? Is an ethics of care \"feminine,\" feminist, or anti-feminist? Is emotion useful or harmful when you're making moral judgments?\r\n\r\nAs for skills, I learned how to write. How to REALLY write. I've taken dozens of WR classes and none of them taught me how to write clear, concise, and engaging prose like this class has. Other WR say vague things about topic sentences and passive voice; this class really gets into the nitty-gritty of word choice and sentence\/paragraph\/paper structure. We even learned how to psychologically approach writing so that papers didn't feel like pulling teeth. The things I learned about writing in this class are things every Yale student should learn, whether they're in the humanities or in STEM.",
                "I learned how to critically think and analyze the readings. I genuinely learned so much over the course of this semester and have been thinking about each text I've read in light of new experiences and other classes, especially about anger, virtue ethics, and care ethics. Moya's class gave us the space to develop our writing and be a little more experimental with our writing style, their willingness to let us critique the work and work through texts and problems we had with each of them, and their ability to make the class feel like such a safe space for personal and academic thoughts made it one of the best courses I've ever taken at Yale.",
                "I LEARNED SO MUCH!!! I learned a lot about different debates in Feminist Philosophy around topics such as anger, or empathy, but more importantly I learned how to think critically about the world around me, question people's roles in it, and just think about what it means to be a fully alive human altogether. I also improved my writing SO MUCH. Moya had us read many readings on how to write, and we did lots of little editing exercises, and ultimately I came away a MUCH better writer. This was literally the best class and I learned a huge amount!!",
                "This course taught two main things extremely well. The first is how to improve your writing process: we did freewriting exercises, had three classes focused on peer editing, and finally we were allowed to submit another draft of our essays after they had already been graded. This is the first class that I've had at Yale that focused so much on improving clarity of writing style while also questioning what exactly it means to be a \"good academic writer\" in the first place. These are super valuable skills that I am glad I've had a chance to work on. Second, as in any philosophy class, we learned how to critically engage with texts and with each other and got some insight on topics in feminist philosophy!",
                "This has, hands down, been the best writing course I've taken in my entire career as a student. Moya has been so incredibly helpful in further developing my skills as a writer, both stylistically, argumentatively, and grammatically. Through taking this course, I feel as if I have finally found my own voice, and it has shined through in everything that I have written this semester, both in this class and out. Not only has this class been monumental for my writing, but it has been instrumental in my development as a critical thinker. Moya has created a space in which students have been able to come as they are and think through very potent questions about the ethics of how we produce knowledge, and it's been a pleasure taking this course!"

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Moya is an amazing professor and discussion facilitator. The readings are incredibly edifying and the discussions were always challenging and exciting. The writing workshops were really helpful and measurably improved my writing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course was a lot of work and I think in the future, it should count as 1.5 credits. The grading is also pretty tough, which is a bit discouraging after having put more work into this class than any other class by a large margin.",
                "Strengths: The readings about writing, the discussion based format, the writing activities we do, the community we build through the daily check ins, the professor's receptibility to student feedback \r\nWeaknesses: I think that the discussions are always cut short unfortunately due to the incredibly interesting readings we are assigned. Maybe if the class were longer, or the readings were shorter it would provide for more fruitful discussion. Additionally, while I do acknowledge that this class is a writing credit, I think that the twice a week reading responses, in class writing assignments, three short papers and three long paper requirement is too heavy of a workload.",
                "The course was generally fantastic and Moya created a truly special space where we were able to bond, learn from each other, and challenge our opinions on empathy, objectivity, and more. The workload was fairly intense, especially the amount of writing we had to do. I think the course would benefit from slightly less required writing, particularly the short papers which I did not find as exciting to work on as the long papers. Also, I think the course could be improved by being once a week for a longer period of time, rather than twice a week, since our discussions always felt cut short.",
                "Strengths were definitely the teaching style: Proff Mapps clearly cares a lot about their subject and students and it was very inspiring to get to be a part of that. They opened every class with a check in which I really think helped connect everyone in the class. I think this also helped shatter the illusion of the overly serious academic space which I think helped more member of the class actively participate without being too intimidated or afraid. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I think could be improved was honestly the length of the class... I wish we would have had more time to get into some of the discussions.",
                "Their selections of readings were picked with care, and the readings that were focused on how to improve our writing were genuinely life-changing for me. I thought the reading notes were really helpful, as they provided me with the space to outline the text, as well as write down any questions, challenges, or general thoughts that I had. I absolutely loved the feedback that I got on my papers, and it really showed how much Moya cared about our writing and how much time they spent reviewing our papers and thinking through our arguments. \r\n\r\nThe workload was a bit high, but it was definitely manageable. I didn't really see any of the assignments as \"busy work\", as each assignment was focused on either improving our writing or working through the text, so they definitely were worth the time and energy.",
                "Strengths -- MOYA!! And the topics! And the writing guidance (my writing got a lot better). Each class was a fun combination of discussing the papers, doing paper recall, and doing writing exercises. All the topics felt related even when they weren't obviously so, showing how critically Moya had made the syllabus. We were able to connect concepts from the beginning of the semester with those at the end, and I gained a lot of tools about how to think critically and philosophically with the world around me. The little check ins at the beginning of class but us all so much closer with one another, and we clearly knew each other well by the end. This helped us have even more enjoyable conversations. The organization of the papers was really good as well. Having 3 long papers evenly dispersed kept us writing but I was never overwhelmed all at one time. yes it was work, but It's not like the exam time came around and I was dying. We had another long paper due but that was okay and we'd been working up to it so it felt natural and good!! \r\nWeakness \/ How be improved - we already talked to Moya about this but sometimes the readings + reading notes felt like too much and we wanted to cut down a little on the volume of work due EVERY class. And they heard us out and cut some of the short papers. Bascially the volume of work just felt like too much occasionally.",
                "Strengths: Moya fostered a safe, engaging classroom environment through doing check-ins for every class; even if I didn't agree with the papers we read, I found them super interesting; lots of clarity about what was expected of us \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The workload was a bit high, but I think that's because this class structure was ambitious in having us hone both our critical and writing skills. It's hard to say what I would have taken out because I found all of the exercises and assignments to be useful. Perhaps Moya can just allow us more skips.",
                "This course is divided into two paths that, at times, converge very beautifully: writing and philosophy. This is one of the major strengths of the class--the ability for these seemingly disparate focuses (the writing portion was extremely technical while the philosophy was, by nature, very theoretical) to not seem so disjointed was a major plus. Additionally, the course readings were extremely interesting and went down smoothly. The emotional check-ins that we did at the beginning of every class was also a strength--it cultivated a bond between us classmates and helped create a fruitful learning community where people weren't afraid to ask questions or contribute. I think this class has little weaknesses--it has a pretty sizable work load, but Moya is extremely understanding and considerate + the contents of the course made it so that it never seemed as if we were doing the amount of work that we were!"

                "Absolutely. I learned SOOO much in this class and genuinely looked forward to attending. The readings are expertly curated and the discussions were always illuminating and engaging. Moya knows exactly how to strike the balance of letting the class discussion flow organically, while knowing when to interject to clarify an idea or give us more helpful structure. I felt like my learning extended beyond the classroom and into my personal life; the ideas discussed have radically changed my view of how to present in the world and helped me become a more thoughtful journalist, scientist and critical thinker at large. Even my close friends have noticed how much this class has restructured my sense of self and manner of thinking in such an empowering way. Also, I emerged with a group of incredible friends who challenged me to think deeper and allowed me to be vulnerable in the classroom. So grateful.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students because the readings are incredibly impactful and relevant, the professor is kind and passionate, and the skills I gained in just one semester are unmatched. I enjoyed writing all of my papers because, while very challenging, the prompts were flexible and personal. The professor is really good at leading conversation and ensuring a safe space for all members of the class. The professor is also very obviously passionate about the subject material and it really helps with class engagement.",
                "This is by far the best course I have taken at Yale so far, and I would recommend it to anyone who has felt frustrated with traditional philosophy courses, wants to improve their academic writing, or wants to ground their feminist political views in theory. The course was a lot of work, but all of the work felt meaningful. Moya is absolutely brilliant and gives great, detailed feedback on all of your work.",
                "Absolutely yes! I think everyone, especially other philosophy students should take this class!",
                "A thousand times yes. This was easily one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale. And out of all the classes I took this semester, this is the one I found myself excitedly telling my friends about. First, the texts we were looking at were great - when the professor wasn't around, we (no joke) talked about how we wished the class was LONGER so that we could keep discussing the class material. I still think the class would be best if it was one and a half to two hours! Regardless, the professor managed their limited class time with aplomb. Second, I learned how to ACTUALLY write in a way that no other WR class I've taken has managed. Take this class if you want to be a good writer. Don't take this class if you despise writing, since you'll be doing a lot of it!",
                "YES ABSOLUTELY! This course was life-changing in every sense of the word. I found myself leaving class and going to my friends and talking about the readings, thinking about how the things we learned applied to other classes, and just moving through life differently in light of the topics we talked about. The readings about ideal theory, care ethics, and anger have stuck with me the most, and I am so, so, so glad I had the opportunity to take the class.",
                "YES A MILLION TIMES! DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE! (if you're willing to work hard). I learned so much, the class ethos was the best I've ever had, my writing got so much better, AND it is a lot of work. Multiple readings and reading notes every night, 3 long papers and some short papers, little writing exercises etc etc. but Moya is soooo fair about it all and gave us good time to work on every assignment. They set us up to succeed in terms of opening themself up to office hours, doing peer editing workshops etc. And I am so infinitely glad that I took this course!! TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. \r\nYou learn so much just about how people and feelings and the world can operate in a way that is helpful to understand as you yourself move through the world. You question how we know what we know in a way that ultimately questions the white ablist patriarchy and emphasizes giving voice and power to everyone else and I honestly can't stress enough how much good stuff you learn in this course.",
