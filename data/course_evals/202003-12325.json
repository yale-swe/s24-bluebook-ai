The lectures are classical lectures that go through concepts that will be used on the problem sets, and can be unengaging, but he does ask if we have questions as we go over the concepts.",

They were easy to attend, and an integral part of my experience in this class. I could share my screen on Zoom and we could look at code together and break it down until I understood it well.",
