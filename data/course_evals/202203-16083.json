The syllabus was excellent and we covered a broad range of ways of writing about the self, which have interested me more in varieties of lyric essay that can blend genres together. I was introduced to theorists that write about what I'm interested in, and the theoretical readings paired well with the \"literary\" texts we read."

If clearer prompts, questions, or focus points were offered at the beginning of class or even in the week prior while reading the texts, I think we could have had even better discussions.\r\n\r\nThe flexibility on assignment deadlines was nice, but I do think that firmer deadlines would have been helpful. I ended up saving everything until the end of the semester and think I would have engaged more deeply with the texts if I was forced to write a little earlier on."

The readings were excellent: diverse enough to have challenging discussions regarding their connections and differences, but always clearly related to the overall theme of the class.  There was space for multiple identities in this class, which I really appreciated. Careful nuances were always observed when discussing the lived experiences of others and what the limits and possibilities of understanding those experiences are."
