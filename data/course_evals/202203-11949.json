                "Not many strengths. Main weakness is that the curve is bad and theres a great chance of getting a D if youre intention going in is to Credit D. If you are a Psych major or are genuinely interested you can do well in the class.",

                "Wish slides were posted before class.",
                "I think that the biggest strength of the course was that it was taught by Professor John Bargh, who is a pioneer in the field of the unconscious. He is very knowledgeable about and comfortable with the course material, which allows him to explain concepts very clearly. I also greatly appreciated the speed with which our tests were graded. I got my final grade back before the credit\/D\/fail deadline, which was very helpful to have. To my understanding, they also prioritized grading the midterm of those who were considering dropping the class so they could have the information necessary to make the correct decision. I also love that the tests were not cumulative. As much as I enjoyed this class, it did have its fair share of weaknesses. My biggest issue was how disorganized the slides were (they were all taken from different presentations and stitched into one). However, the clarity with which Professor John Bargh taught with helped with this issue. Another issue is that the grade is entirely determined by tests. I wish there was at least another component that would contribute to our grade, such attendance.",
                "I liked the simple 3 exam structure but only as I received marks that I was happy with. I imagine has a had a bad result the 3 exam structure would have been very stressful.",
                "It was a lot of information and sometimes we went through slides faster than was necessary. I think it was sometimes to quick to digest.",
                "Exams had strange wording and sometimes asked questions that were almost entirely glossed over in lecture and were not present in the slides.",
                "Lectures are amazing, course content is interesting.\r\n\r\nOnly three exams make it a kind of \"make-it-or-break-it\" class.",

                "Course materials in the form of slides and readings were very helpful. I felt like there were times where the lecture didn't feel super engaging and not because of the content.",
                "Interesting content. Decently engaging presentation. Sometimes a bit repetitive",
                "I LOVED this course. This is the first cogsci class I took that wasn't just theoretical. Everything was backed up by facts, and I loved Prof Bargh's presentations. It was super easy to take notes and learn in his class. He is also beyond impressivejust about everything we learned about, he pioneered in the field. He is so humble about that, which is rare.",
                "This course was solid but could be improved through more interactive teaching.",
                "I think this course is excellent. The lectures were engaging and extremely informative and the readings supplemented the lectures nicely. The TFs and Professor Bargh made themselves available if students had any questions or needed help. While having only three exams means there is more pressure on each one, I wouldn't change the format of the course. I thought each exam adequately covered the material in lecture and they were not unreasonably challenging.",
                "Professor Bargh kept coming back to the same main ideas which was helpful in helping to solidify the topics.",
                "I liked how the course was split into past\/present\/future, and we circled back to some of the same studies throughout the course looking at them through different lenses which was interesting as we started to understand them more. The notes posted online were formatted strangely with backgrounds that made slides hard to read, and the grading scheme is apparently 25% As, which I understand as a rough guideline, but I feel that it should be flexible in the case of the class doing better than normal. Despite doing very well on two midterms and above average on the last midterm (our final), I still don't know what my grade will be, and it was somewhat stressful not to have a clear idea of how well you need to do to get certain grades.",
                "Weaknesses - professor talks very quickly or moves very quickly through the slides, can talk quietly sometimes\r\nStrengths - slides posted on Canvas, only 3 exams and they are not cumulative",

                "The course has a lot of readings, and every class has multiple studies where we need to understand before the class. The exams have lots of concept on different names of the psychologists who conducted the research. For a non-Psych major student like me, I don't think it's necessary for me to know those names.",
                "The strengths were that it was interesting and the exams were not unrealistic. The material covered mostly all aspects of the unconscious. I think a weakness is that there is little engagement and there are no review sessions to get a better sense of what will be on the exam. Another strength was that it was very manageable.",
                "The content is quite interesting and its a super low workload and exams are fair. But day to day lecture can be a bit dry because there is a lot of repetition. I feel like we could have fit more content in if the lectures a were not as repetitive and circular",
                "Strengths: Engaging content, interesting material to learn, and Professor Bargh is not only a great lecturer but also lead many of the studies we learn about in the class!\r\nWeakness: The structure of the lectures can sometimes be hard to follow\/repetitive, especially the lectures leading up to the first exam.",

                "Strengths: interesting lectures, low workload, learned a lot about a subject I wouldn't have otherwise known about! \r\nWeaknesses: the curve for grading isn't very generous. only around the top 15% of the class get an A, so I'd recommend C\/D\/F if you're taking it as a 5th or 6th class",
                "Interesting material but not a very engaging class. Consists of just lectures and 3 exmas",
                "Good organization and the material is clear. However, having only three tests, of which most are multiple-choice questions is not great. All tests are super high stakes and I did not like that.",
                "I think it was overall a good class. I think there were 2 main issues I had with the class: consistency with the slides as well as repetitive material. This course was engaging yes but I had a very difficult time following the class always as there was a circling back to many different topics and going back and forth I think is the best description. AS for the consistency of the slides, it felt as if there were many different slides compiled together to make a half thought out course. The combination of the two made it that much more unbearable to understand and follow slides, especially when I was sick and attempted to go back and go through old materials.",
                "Long lectures, could be more engaging.",
                "The materials in lecture are very engaging. Though, there are few opportunities to course-correct your grade if something goes wrong, because the final grade is only produced by 3 exams.",
                "I think this course does a good job at giving explanations\/proof to certain theories through the use of lots of examples and studies. However, the course itself is fairly disorganized. A lot of concepts and studies are repeated multiple times and it is hard to follow what point of the course we are in even though the information 'builds' on itself. It is very hard to see the overall point of a lecture or section of the course sometimes.",

I cannot sing the praises of this class more highly because: 1) it is so interesting and Prof. Bargh is an amazing lecturer. He's truly a wealth of knowledge, and he's contributed greatly to the field that is the subject of this class. It's really cool to have your professor be someone who is so influential. 2) The workload is so low, literally just the three exams. There are readings, but I realized after the first exam that the exam content is entirely contained in the lecture notes. 3) It's so easy to do well. The course is literally set up for your success. If you Cr\/D\/F and you just took the three exams completely raw, you could get a C. If you go to lectures and study just a tiny bit, you could easily get an A. The teaching staff and Bargh are SO available if you don't get anything. There's no reason to not get what you want out of this class.",

                "I would - I think it's a good elective for psyc majors and non-psyc majors can take it, although it may be a better credit\/d option if you're in the latter group",
                "YES YES YES!! I loved this course. You learn a lot of really cool things, and the work is manageable.",
                "No, the professor is not clear about grading and it is designed to give you a worse grade than what you earned. Often curves down your grade.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It's not a blow-off course, but if you're interested in the material and willing to engage by taking notes and studying, you'll do well. Beyond the grade, it was a fascinating course which has strongly influenced the way I think about my own life and my relationships. Some of what I learned in the course has helped me immensely in my personal life as I work to understand myself and others better. If you're interested in how and why we think, consciously and unconsciously, understanding the human condition in new ways, and want to be up-to-date with the latest research and theories on consciousness and unconsciousness in psychology, I 10\/10 recommend this course!",
                "Yes I would",
                "Yes, I would. The subject matter is fascinating and Professor Bargh is extremely knowledgeable. His enthusiasm for the subject really facilitates our learning in my opinion.",
                "Yes; it's an interesting elective with good lectures and a pretty low worlkload so it does not feel overwhelming. However, you do need to make sure to attend lecture consistently and pay attention. If you do that, the exams are fine without too much studying, but if you don't, it would be hard to understand everything from just the slides. The exams are mostly multiple choice with a few short answers and the only form of assessment, which does mean a lot depends on them but also makes the class a pretty low workload, and the exams are not very difficult, so the only worry is really just where you will fall in the class distribution since Prof. Bargh aims for 25% of students getting As.This also may be specific to this semester, but while the slides looked normal in class, they were posted with strange backgrounds on Canvas that made them really hard to read\/study from, so it's more difficult to rely on them than it is to just pay close attention in class.",
                "Yes",
                "yes very interesting",
                "I'd recommend this as a relatively low-workload social science credit, but if you want a super engaging and deep psychology course, another course might be better.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes I would especially for someone who has not taken a psychology class and is interested in learning more about it.",
                "No",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who has ever been interested in the unconscious mind!",
                "Yes! I genuinely enjoyed this class, even after having taking 2 social science courses that cover similar content. I would recommend this class even for people who haven't been particularly interested in social science studies, as this course covers a lot of practical life advice that was really fun to learn about and can be applied to every individual with an unconscious and conscious mind.",
                "I would recommend this course if they are interested in the course material.",
                "Yes! Really interesting and not too difficult.",
                "yes! It was very interesting content and does not require very much out of class work b\/c Prof. Bargh teaches so much during lecture,",
                "Yes. It is interesting and the work isnt too bad.",
                "The course material was very interesting, and Professor Bargh is clearly an expert in the field! The course slides could benefit from being updated and streamlined in order to make things easier to follow. Additionally, posting the recordings for such a large course would be very helpful given that going to lecture when ill presents a health risk to others.",
                "Yes - the course provides interesting perspectives on our unconscious mind and it's at the frontier of psychology.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes I would recommend this course because it was very interesting and presented studies to me about our life experiences that I would not have known before. It is a manageable class that teaches important information about being aware how your mind or outside experiences could impact your behavior.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in psychology and learning about specific experiments and findings. Its a great low time commitment class, but dont expect it to be super rigorous or the most engaging class.",
                "YES! I learned so much and it was really engaging.",
                "no, it was terrible and I didn't learn anything",
                "yes; interesting material; not the most engaging lecturer; easy class if you study the material",
                "Yes, for a 5th\/6th class!",
                "yeah interesting material and the class has a low work-load",
                "I would, I thought it was really interesting. A nice gut for anyone, but you have to be great at cramming for the tests.",
                "I think I would for the content but not for the course structure. Having 3 exams made the stress around each test that much more stressful and again there was a distance between people during the course for me just in understanding what we were supposed to know and understand.",
                "Yes, it was very interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are accountable to come to lecture and memorize things.",
                "Yes, if you are a Psych major.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in psychology and the unconscious. You learn a lot of new information that can be very helpful and interesting to know.",
                "Yes. It was honestly a really interesting class and so refreshing from the rest of the courseload i had. It brought up concepts\/ideas about things that we can all relate to and learn from which i thought was really nice."
