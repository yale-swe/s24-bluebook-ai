                "I gained knowledge of architectural terms, an introduction on how to begin studying architectural history, main attractions in landscape architecture in Europe, the different movements in landscape architecture, and famous landscape architects. I also learned about art historical representations of landscape and the different ways gardens are portrayed/drawn through architectural plans and paintings/drawings.",
                "This course teaches a collection of landscape motifs, particularly in the careful planning of Renaissance gardens and the emphasis on natural appearance in the English garden movement. Aside from a brief overview in the beginning of the course, lesson plans focus somewhat on Italian and western European landscapes, and primarily on the English landscape. Lectures are typically focused on specific sites (such as the Blenheim estate in England) and go through the elements of these sites in order. Readings can be slightly broader but time in the classroom is spent learning about specific locations."

            "comments": [
                "Strength: every landscape is very interesting to learn since everything has significance, professor always stops to ask if there are questions and always answers questions from students\r\nWeakness: theres a lot of information given at once",
                "The long seminar-style lectures were interesting but not very conducive to conversation. More discussions would have made the course more engaging!",
                "There was no student participation in the course. The lectures were monologues. The lessons were not particularly well described beforehand. It would have been helpful for there to be a table-of-contents style overview of what we were going to learn in the class and why it was important.",
                "The strengths of this course is it presents many examples in great detail of gardens, villas and other landscape architectural features. This course is a lecture, essentially, which probably could have used a little more participatory activities since it was 1 hour and 50 minutes. The material is really interesting and Professor Fuermann held regular office hours, was really understanding with extenuating circumstances, and provided exceptionally clear feedback and assistance with improving the midterm paper for a longer term paper. While I liked the course and learned a lot about landscape architecture from not knowing anything before, I don't know that I retained the information of the course in its entirety so maybe some shorter writing assignments on important themes or landscape sites throughout the semester would be helpful to increase engagement.",
                "Strengths: Kind and incredibly knowledgeable professor, many chances to ask questions, lots of new things learned about garden design and motifs, time spent looking directly at sources in the British Art Center.\r\nWeaknesses: Readings were required but we almost never discussed them and a good portion of the class did not complete them due to this lack of incentive. Lectures were interesting but relatively long considering their narrow focus on elements of each garden rather than broader themes and dynamics of landscape through history."

                "Yes, only if you need to take as an elective for Architecture or serious interest in landscaping architecture. More so for the professor who really wants you to learn and is very approachable.",
                "Yes, it was really fun to learn about the different types of vocab for each object in the gardens and see the artworks in person at the art gallery at the end of the year",
                "For more well-rounded understanding of the landscape, yes.",
                "If someone wants a super easy course where you suffer through the boring classes I would recommend the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if you have some background in architecture. You should be aware that it is essentially a seminar-sized lecture. Some of the terms, architects' names and references might go over your head a little bit if you have never taken an architecture course. I'm not an ARCH major and this was the case for me, although this course really presented a great entrypoint if you have interests lying at the intersection of architecture, art history, and gardens. The term paper is basically a topic of your choosing which allows you to tailor the course to your interests and really get a lot out of the course if you choose. It definitely left me wanting to travel around Europe and see/study the works that we covered in person and continue to study architectural history.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in landscape design and in the aristocracy of western Europe during the Renaissance and Romantic periods. Professor Fuermann is a wealth of knowledge on everything covered in the class and it is great to be able to ask questions and learn more about specific design decisions and movements. Lectures can be a bit dry because they focus pretty narrowly on the elements of individual gardens and don't touch quite as much on the broader trends or meanings of these sites in connection with one another. Readings are interesting but rarely discussed, so this class might be improved if readings were more integrated into lecture and discussion content. This is an interesting class in terms of the amazing sites you learn about, the workload is quite low (the only things turned in are a three-page midterm paper and ten-page final paper), and I am happy to have learned all of the interesting things that I did, but this course will not be for everyone due to its pretty specific focus."
