There is no mistaking that. I find it enjoybale, but it takes up a LOT of my time. Everyday."

                "strengths: SARAB is amazing and understanding and just wants to teach you Arabic \r\nweaknesses: i liked that fridays were asynchronous but didnt feel like i learned anything on fridays",
                "This was a wonderful course and Sarab specifically is a great prof!",
                "The course is structured really well to help lessons sink in and learn a lot of content! We do a variety of exercises, each improving a different skill. That being said, it'd be really cool if we got to learn some dialectic Arabic as well, like Levantine or Egyptian, because people speak those far more often. We learned a few expressions, which was nice, but most of the time it happened randomly in class; it'd be nice if we learned more idiomatic expressions.",
                "Strengths: intensive dive into the language, well-explained concepts, good applications and practice\r\nWeaknesses: Spending too much time on the same questions about our day in Arabic, almost regardless of what we were learning. I know it's good practice, but it sometimes felt too repetitive.",
                "Great course, great vibe, impressively productive, and of course Professor Al Ani is simply the bestshe makes every class a blast to be in and facilitates learning in a way that fosters curiosity and excitement always. Daily homework is tough but worth it, and asynchronous Fridays were a big plus.",
                "Strengths: language learning is always fun, and Professor Al Ani is extremely knowledgeable and always tries to make things easier for us.\r\nWeaknesses: Having taken L2 right after L1, I have to say that the teaching methods in this class seemed a bit repetitive to me, because we always used the same method of asking questions and responding them every morning. Moreover, feedback on homeworks is practically nonexistent (unless it is a graded homework, and the feedback there is quite short) so you don't really know if you're doing things right or wrong; homeworks take at least 2 hs to complete everyday if you do them properly; the pace is extremely fast. I think the biggest weakness is that we mostly don't go over grammar lessons in class: we are expected to read these extremely important pieces of information home, and then expected to have understood and have learned everything by the next day in class, and on to the next topic. I think it would be much more helpful and conducive for proper, consolidated learning if we had slowed down a bit, discussed grammar lessons during classtime, and had any questions we had answered by the instructor. Arabic is such a beautiful and organized language, and I think that this beauty is not being exploited in class. I did learn a lot and made incredible progress, though. It just wasn't always enjoyable, and I think this is a very important aspect of learning languages that can serve you for the rest of your life.",
                "Strengths: very well-organized with a daily HW schedule given at start of semester, Prof. Al-Ani is masterful in her language teaching, and so supportive.\r\nWeaknesses: not many...homework every day is rough but what can you do.",
                "Strengths: you will learn Arabic; good support from Sarab, who is so kind; enjoyable classes; struggling together with your classmates\r\nWeaknesses: the gramar could be taught much better. We basically learn grammar from the textbook and have to ask Sarab to review it with us. Otherwise, she won't. We have lots of assessments and some of the homework is unnecessarily tedious."

                "If you are willing to put in the time and do the work and study for tests and quizzes you will learn a lot. However, because Sarab is so nice you can skate by and then you will not learn so much and not do so well. However, if you are prepared to take a lot of time in class and out of class to put effort in and you WANT to learn arabic, take it. Especially if Sarab is teaching it. She is one of the most understanding and kind professors ive ever had.",
                "Yes - take it with Sarab!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to learn Arabic! It's an incredibly tough language to learn, but Sarab teaches really well. Even though it's a hard class with a lot of work, the work really cements what we're learning and helped me improve a ton as an Arabic speaker.",
                "YES. If you want to take Arabic, Sarab is an excellent teacher. You'll learn so much in this class if you dedicate the time to it: usually 1-2 hours per day of work.",
                "Yes!!! So fun and so worth it, though do make sure you'll have 30 min to 1 hour to do the homework before each class. And make friends in the class! If they're taking Arabic they're cool. The class was a fun way to start the day and Prof Al Ani always brought amazing energy",
                "Yes, Arabic is such a beautiful language, and Professor Sarab is extremely knowledgeable. I'd make sure you give your input on what works best for you as a learner, because I did not always found the methods effective.",
                "Yes",
                "If you are passionate about really learning a language at Yale and are willing to put in a lot of time and effort, then yes. Otherwise, no. I spent the most time on this class by far. Which can be a great thing. But if your interests lie elsewhere, this class will hinder you. It is a nonstop firehose to the face. But if you're not going to try very hard, it will be easier, but also totally not worth it in my opinion. Homework consistently took me two hours every night and before quizzes and tests, I would spend an entire day or more studying."
