If you did geometry in high school, you'll remember we had to write a lot of proofs  logic is essentially that, constructing derivations\/proofs of conclusions given a certain set of premises. There's no arithmetic, but it definitely exercised the math-y part of my brain which has been relatively dormant at Yale. In the course, I learned the basics of validity and soundness, constructing and evaluating logical arguments, deriving conclusions from premises using a certain set of rules, and constructing counter-models to show a certain logical argument is invalid. I think this course speeds up towards the end  the first exam is a lot easier than the second, and the second is easier than the final  so be sure to do well at the beginning of the course when things are easier, and keep up with the material towards the end when it's getting more tricky. Overall, though, I'm not extremely mathematical but I found this course doable and even fun. There were challenging moments, but I actually found myself enjoying the tricky problems. It's fun to finish a proof and I found that logic was pretty rewarding for me..",

                "I think the class is fine as is.",
                "Strengths: The course is well taught with plenty of time to go over examples\r\nWeaknesses: Some elements of the course were went through pretty quickly, and this was especially weird because these were often the harder topics",
                "strengths: well-organized, clear homework assignments, manageable exam difficulty, good TA feedback and help",
                "Strengths would include the homeworks; we used this new program eLogic that was honestly fun. It made the homework seem like a game  it was instant serotonin when getting a problem right. Also, the online format really helped streamline the process of working through derivations; I imagine my review of this course would not be so positive if the homeworks were on paper, and eLogic did not exist. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses would include the midterms. The professor would include \"challenge material\" on the exams, which was intended to \"push\" our knowledge. However, I don't find that an exam is the appropriate time to do this. I don't know why we were not solely tested on the level of difficulty that we practiced in class and in our homeworks; it was as though the professor wanted to ensure that nobody did TOO well in this course. (Particularly since the homeworks were graded on completion).",
                "Great course. Good material and work.",
                "I thought that Professor Meehan's lectures were very well-organized, and sections really helped me understand the material. I also particularly enjoyed the homework assignments, as ELogic was a very useful software tool through which I was able to fully comprehend the new languages and rules we had covered in lecture. To improve the course, however, I think that lecture went a bit slow at times, and while I appreciate taking questions from other students, I think that some of the lecture practice could have been done in section.",
                "This course being taught as a lecture, though not an enormous lecture, was a strength of the course. The material, I feel, is best taught in the structure of biweekly lectures with a discussion section. \r\n\r\nThe course might be improved by having more structure\/guidance to the discussion sections, as I sometimes felt that there was lack of direction and\/or clarity to the work we went over in discussion section.",
                "E-Logic made this course infinitely better and more manageable",
                "Alex made a class that I took merely to fulfill a QR a deeply engaging and fun logical puzzle. He was so methodical in his teaching, which was amazing because then we were never blindsided by material, and he always planted the seeds for a new module in earlier classes so that the sequence would be logical. Alex also employed humor and activities into his classes in a way that ensured that we as students were always engaged.",
                "Strengths: engaging lessons and \"puzzles,\" student-participation even in lecture format, consistently felt well-prepared for exams, intellectually challenging problems\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes felt very convoluted, difficult to see the real-world application",
                "It is probably one of the most interesting classes at Yale. It's a cool way to earn a QR credit and the material is fun. But the course grading is tough since there are only 3 exams and 9 p sets",
                "The course is solid overall. I feel like the pace is somewhat slow. The homework used a platform called Elogic, which was great to work with but left me less prepared than I would have liked for the written exams (because they were handwritten). \r\nOne thing the course is lacking is much individual feedback. Elogic is helpful to getting to the final solution but gives you feedback at every step, preventing your from created a solution and committing to it altogether. The exams are the only other place where you get to understand where you went wrong.",
                "Strengths-- the material is \/very\/ well explained both in class and in section. The p-sets are done on Logic, which allows you to check your answer and retry questions as many times as you want, so you should do very well on the p-set grades PLUS if you miss a p-set you can continue to try those questions on your own time. The retry system was also quite good for comprehension and made the p-sets not at all intimidating. The textbook is quite in-depth, so its helpful but don't be overwhelmed if you don't understand absolutely everything.\r\nWeaknesses-- honestly none. would have appreciated more difficult symbolization problems before the first midterm since we somewhat undercovered those in my opinion.",
                "The lectures were highly engaging and informative, motivating students to apply the information learned in lecture to analyze the validity of everyday arguments. The class was unlike any course I have taken at Yale due to the way in which it combined quantitative systems with philosophical thought in order to create a comprehensive perspective that was both analytical and creative.",
                "I think there needs to be more framing in terms of the history of philosophy as to how this discipline came about and why it is important (I.e., what questions it was created to solve. And there should be discussion about how and when it might be useful, and when not. But the course material was clear, the lectures were good, and the elogic software helped a lot.",
                "Very few weaknesses. Loved the instructor and the clear way he presented everything. Sections were extremely helpful and low stakes (not mandatory).",
                "It is very clear that Professor Meehan knows what he's doing in terms of teaching. He put the recorded lectures online promptly as well as the lecture slides, held weekly office hours and review sessions before exams, made fair exams and PSETs, had a very complete syllabus, and integrated material at an appropriate pace. I liked how he would harken back to previous concepts and foreshadow the coming topics. THIS COURSE IS VERY WELL ORGANIZED. As for QRs, this is probably one of the best you can take as it's fair, the TAs actually help you learn, and it's actually pretty fun. THIS IS A VERY STRONG COURSE and I commend Prof. Meehan for his organization and clarity. He made an effort to learn people's names despite the size of the course which I thought was fantastic. Yale needs more professors like him..",
                "Strengths: Most homeworks and exams are genuinely engaging and interesting; the problems are like puzzles. The Elogic software we used this semester made the coursework even more fun, and allowed me to learn at my own pace and find more challenging problems when I wanted them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I really appreciated the argument analysis problems we did in the last week of the semester (turning arguments from English into L1-4 and then analyzing them for validity), but I wondered why we didn't do these earlier in the semester. This seemed like the part of the course that might be most applicable outside of the course, and it was the most challenging type of problem--I would have loved to see this integrated in earlier weeks.",
                "The lecture format made collaboration with peers (in class) rare. We did collaborate once during a Zoom class, using shared, online whiteboards, and this helped solidify the content.",
                "I really appreciate how organized the class was. All of the resources that I needed were readily available for me, including lecture slides, recorded lectures and meetings, and tests for me to review. I really enjoyed working in Elogic.",
                "This course was very well-organized and the instructors were extremely receptive and flexible this semester.",
                "One strength of this class is that it is very thorough. Part of the premise of logic is that it's totally sound, so it can be quite technical and precise -- there's not a lot of wiggle room, and you have to do things the one specific way, and the lectures reflected that thoroughness.\r\n\r\nHonestly the main weakness for me was that it was too thorough -- I wished we had gotten through a lot more material instead of spending so much time on small details that could be figured out while doing the psets or the required reading or during sections.",
                "Strengths: 1) Lectures are very well-structured. Dr Meehan explained things very clearly. 2) We worked through various practice questions together in lectures.",
                "It was very well taught and thorough! It was clear how and when to get extra help as well.",
                "Interesting material. Elogic was very helpful and a great way piece of software!\r\n\r\nThe final was much more difficult than the other exams unfortunately. Also, the lectures were a bit slow, but understandably so given my background.",
                "I loved the content of this course, though think it could be improved by having more work through of problems during class time.",
                "The lectures were very straightforward and easy to follow and also involved a lot of review which was really helpful, but I think there could have been more practice with derivations and symbolization.",
                "hard enough to be useful but not super hard at all. a little boring but thats more the material than the course. pretty useful sections go to them!",
                "The ELogic platform was great and incredibly helpful. Some of the material covered in lectures felt like it had already been covered in textbook readings and I would have loved if it was an explanation in a different way, or giving more examples, instead of feeling like a repetition of the same material.",
                "I really enjoyed the logic puzzles at the beginning of each class. They were fun to try to solve and a great way to expand our thinking about the concepts we were learning.",
                "more practice problems",
                "More material - would have loved to see less probability and more many-valued logics, modal logic, etc.",
                "I think there can be more organized practice problems.",
                "This course was very straightforward and interesting. I liked how it maintained a clear focus throughout but also mentioned other applications of the material we were learning, and it was very clear how each new component of the curriculum built off of the previous material. It did feel very abstract, and I felt like the textbook was hard to follow, which was especially difficult considering that there is very little external resources about logic online in the way that there would be for a math or science course.",
                "I really loved this course. The strengths were the professor, Prof. Meehan, who was an extremely clear and effective instructor in my opinion, the clear structure of the course and the way it built upon itself, and the fascinating nature of the course itself which is sort of like math but having nothing to do with numbers whatsoever. The only weakness I can think of was that it times it almost felt like there was too little homework, and there could've been more opportunity to engage with the class topics through more outside-of-class assignments, but I really won't complain about that.",
                "A great strength of the class was that the lectures were extremely thorough and the homeworks were really fair for the class and course material taught. A weakness was the applicability of the material to other areas: there were a few times where the professor pointed out applicability but it wasn't often enough where I felt like I was learning logic aside from the point of learning logic and to do puzzles. With that being said, the puzzles were really engaging and Professor Meehan learned most of the names of the students which was something I'd never seen a professor do, which made him seem really approachable and loosened up the learning environment and made it more enjoyable. There were dozens of times where there were interactive class activities involving cards where volunteers went up and did demonstrations, which was really fun and unusually interactive for a lecture.",
                "The weekly pset + lecture + section structure was very standard, and worked well for the material. Nothing about the course itself particularly stood out as being uniquely strong or weak."

It builds upon itself and moves fast, and anything short of total focus will cause problems.",

It was difficult enough to make the course interesting, but also I felt that I actually was mastering the material I learned  which was satisfying. Overall, if you are looking for a QR, look into this course. I found that some people \"took to\" the material faster than other. Hopefully, if you are one of them, this class can be a gut for you.",

I found learning logic and doing the derivations and models on the homework in different languages to be challenging but ultimately very satisfying. I do not know how practical of a tool this will be in my studies going forward, but I enjoyed having this class this semester and would recommend it to someone looking for something interesting but not too challenging.",

                "YES! Great math credit, very fun material, this is not a super challenging class but it is very satisfying when you understand how the problems work.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student looking for a new approach to philosophical analysis. The homework assignments are engaging and practical, helping students develop their skills in quantitative analysis, and each lecture equipped students with fresh perspectives on logical reasoning and argument validity.",
                "No, but not because of the particular professor, rather because of the overall feeling of a lack of context. I dont understand, for example, why this is a required class.",
                "Yes! If you're interested in having a bit of fun messing around with logical statements, this is the class for you! I found the homeworks for the class a good break from all my papers.",
                "I would recommend the class. Workload-wise it was very manageable, and I found the content of the course really interesting. I had had no experience with logic before, but the class was a good introduction that has gotten me interested in the field.",
                "THIS IS A VERY GOOD OPTION FOR YOUR QR if you're taking it with Prof. Meehan. This class was required for me as a philosophy major, but I'd recommend it to anyone, really. Prof. Meehan is VERY organized, in a way that many Yale professors are not; he makes it easy to learn by reviewing information and integrating new information at an appropriate pace. I liked the little brain-teaser challenge problems we did at the start of each class. This course was actually very fun, solving each problem was rewarding and I liked Elogic, the online application we used. My TA, Marissa, was also very good, so if she's teaching the course again, you can't go wrong with her as your TA. This class has very fair grading. It challenged me at times but it was 100% worth it. This is how QR classes at Yale should be taught..",
                "It's great for a moderately challenging and engaging QR credit, but the applications outside of further study in Logic aren't clear.",
                "I would recommend this course for honing one's precision in argumentation.",
                "Yes. This class was very different from many of the other classes that I've taken in the past. It was really fun, and an interesting way to view quantitative reasoning outside of math.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other non-STEM students to receive their QR requirement. I was well supported in class and in section.",
                "Yes I would. It was very interesting and a good QR.",
                "Yes. The course materials are not very difficult, and derivation and meaning problems can be quite interesting to work on.",
                "Definitely! I think its a great QR credit!",
                "If you are a math major, this class is a very gentle (maybe almost trivial) introduction to formal systems. Probably most stem majors would say the same or at least feel similar. \r\n\r\nAll the students I know who actually struggled with this class were humanities majors. Just know that some students will have a natural significant advantage over you, but don't be discouraged! There's a lot of interesting material to learn, and this class helps develop quantitative reasoning.",
                "Yes, I think this course is both interesting and useful.",
                "Yes, because I think everyone should learn about the mathematical aspect of logic and argumentation.",
                "if youre looking for something that ranks high on both guttiness and usefulness, do this course. there are better QR courses for either metric, but this has a good ratio of the two",
                "Yesit's a good QR credit and the material is interesting. ELogic can be really fun and this course pretty much falls into a pattern that it sticks to over the course of the semester, which is good or bad depending on what you're looking for.",
                "Yes! Loved professor meehan",
                "An excellent, pure quantitative reasoning course, taught splendidly by Prof. Meehan",
                "I am neutral about this, I wouldn't say its a class for everyone.",
                "I would recommend this course if it seems interesting, but it is very abstract and sometimes feels frustrating to be putting in a lot of work in a subject with ambiguous payoffs or applications. It complimented a more reading and writing-based philosophy course that I was taking at the same time, and it was also interesting to apply mathematical concepts to a new medium. I did feel like the course became significantly more challenging towards the middle, and I wasn't entirely anticipating it becoming far more complicated and fast-paced compared to the first few weeks.",
                "Absolutely. Favorite class I've taken at Yale. I took it because I had a passing interest in what formal logic was. If you're someone who is really into stuff like philosophy and analytical thinking, or you enjoy the straightforwardness of math but maybe are not the strongest at numbers, I think you will really like logic. Even if you don't fit that, the class in my opinion is set up to teach students effectively, is not a lot of work, and is just overall an enjoyable experience for students.",
                "YES! It was so interesting, so well taught, and just simply entertaining a lot of the time. Not a gut, but great for a QR if you struggle with QR.",
                "Whats great about Logic is thats its a fully enclosed system, so you dont need to have any sort of background in math or philosophyand by the end, you have a pretty good grasp. Its worth taking as a QR for humanities majorsit definitely sold me on some of the merits of the distributional requirements. Its definitely not a gut, but if you put in the work, you can be successful and walk away having learned a lot.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, and, whenever a friend of mine peered over my shoulder in a library to see what I was working on and saw what we were doing in Logic, they seemed really interested. The final exam was unusually hard, though, which definitely hampered my experience.",
                "Only if they absolutely needed it for a requirement (distributional or major).",
                "Yes, I really really enjoyed it and it's a great base for any sort of philosophy or other areas of study that require logical rigor (most areas, really)."
