                "I obtained a familiarity with several foundational English poetry works and how to better read and analyze the texts. Part of the course was a general history of English literature, which I found compelling and interesting, even if a background focus. Additionally, I learned how each text interacted with its predecessors and the kind of influence they left for successors."

            "comments": [
                "The course is heavy on reading and interpreting poetry on your own. I think this structure works in the favor of both the student and the instructor. Students feel more engaged with the class because they have the time and ability to formulate ideas and thoughts before discussions begin. This assists with how in-class conversations develop and how our essays become more evolved when we dive deeper and deeper into the material.",
                "The essay meetings are very surface level, as we rarely got out of the first paragraph. I think it would be more helpful to have longer sessions in which we moved through the entire essay more quickly. I also think that reasons for grades could be explained more.",
                "I think a significant strength of this course was the writing conferences, as they allowed me to receive very direct feedback for my writing and my approach to writing. I also enjoyed the selection of texts, as the syllabus felt intentional and interrelated. Additionally, only focusing on a smaller quantity of texts gave us more time to explore each work. Something I felt could be improved were the few in-class assignments, as I did not feel like I received a lot of feedback on those and was a little confused on their overall role, especially since it seemed like they decreased as the semester continued."

                "Yes, I feel that the class was taught well and I learned a fair share about writing.",
                "I personally didn't love the reading material and felt really pressured when writing the papers, therefore I wouldn't recommend the course to a non-English major.",

I think this course is a great introduction for anyone interested in English literature, regardless if they had read the texts before, as every time you revisit a text I feel you are certain to find new insights from new perspectives."
