I learned about commonly-used methods for detecting exoplanets, renewable energy technologies and their advantages\/disadvantages, GMO crops, and anti-malarial drugs. By working through the assignments, I also acquired greater fluency in reading scientific papers. Finally, the class projects allowed me to practice my presentational skills.",

                "I think this course had a very good idea, but it was not executed to its fullest potential. For example, I was very interested in the topic about genetically modified organisms, but found that module to be a little bit boring and not engaging. I think that if each professor was given an outline or a more concrete path to follow, the course could be made better.",
                "I like that the course changes modules every three weeks, so that we get to learn and discuss a few different topics. Additionally, it's cool that each module is taught by a different professor or expert. However, we don't learn anything very in-depth due to the short modules. Also, the class organization was sometimes suspect.",
                "The course presents some extremely interesting information but can feel a bit repetitive after awhile because the class is longer than most.",

                "The structure of this course was definitely the biggest strength because it offered significant amounts of varied, helpful information in a balanced timeframe throughout the semester.",
                "I appreciated the variety of topics that were covered in the class. The two days we spent on each topic was just enough to gather meaningful insight without going too far into the specifics of a particular field. Most topics were presented in a way that made them legible to a person without too much prior knowledge of chemistry, biology, or physics. The only minor exception to this was the seminar on GMO foods, which was more biology-intensive than the rest. One other improvement I would suggest would be more frequent feedback on assignments, as this would help me identify areas in which I need to improve. On the whole, though, I really enjoyed this course.",
                "The course was extremely disorganized. This may be a one-off occurrence, but for the first few lectures, the professor wasn't available and the class wasn't held. Later on, our assignment groups were often left up to us to organize, without any pre-established method of communicating. While the professors and lecturers were often responsive to emails, emailing was often a necessity as details were often left out in our assignments. As of writing this evaluation, we still do not have any grades from the semester. The course is year long, which may be the reason for the lack of grades, but it is still quite frustrating and inconvenient."

By meeting with group members to discuss project ideas, I had a chance to get to know them a little better than I could by merely seeing them in class. The assignments were also well-geared towards a virtual learning environment. I appreciate that the quizzes\/tests were replaced by PSETS and presentations, as the latter are not significantly altered by the need to work online. On occasion, the video connection would freeze, making it hard to understand the lecturer. This, however, did not happen too often and so did not pose a great problem.",

Also, anyone who wants a relatively easy science credit or a fifth class that isn't too time consuming would be well served to take this class.

The lectures don't assume prior knowledge of any scientific discipline. The modules covered in the course are thus accessible to anybody who is even remotely interested in science, regardless of their skill level.",
