    "This was an excellent class taught by an extremely knowledgeable and insightful professor (Adam Stern). I loved how class each week was dominated by discussion rather than lecture. If I could change something, I wouldve loved to have a few guiding questions prior to reading some of the more difficult texts."

    "If you have the chance to take this class with Adam Stern, take it. This is a new look at antisemitism far beyond what the news covers, and it goes much deeper into providing readings from multiple disciplines within the humanities and social sciences than most classes at Yale. The readings were all SO GOOD (Ive even forwarded them to some friends Ive been so interested). The class is mostly discussion, so be prepared to speak, and DEFINITELY do the readings because it will be very obvious if you dont.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student; it was interesting and engaging, and I grew as a writer and a thinker.",
    "Definitely, you really read great material on antisemitism."
