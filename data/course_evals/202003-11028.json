It's super hard to do, and there will be times you do it at a level that just isn't acceptable to him. But you'll definitely get better at it. I definitely got much, much better at it. Secondly, it will make you better at talking about philosophy. So many people who are good at writing and thinking philosophy are just impossible to listen to. Shelly is so good at talking philosophy that it bleeds into all of the class, especially given his free-flowing seminar style. Lastly, I learned some interesting things about moral philosophy, and the class did a lot for helping solidify the various distinctions and categories in normative ethics.

                "Strengths: Shelly is an incredible teacher, and nobody has pushed me to critically evaluate my own moral beliefs like he has. Further, Shelly leaves incredibly detailed feedback for essays. Weaknesses: Seminars were often dominated by the same 2 or 3 people, oftentimes turning the class into a type of back-and-forth Q&A session between those people, or between other students who would jump in and those same 2-3 people. This made it somewhat uncomfortable for those of us who were not in that group to jump in. Shelly did this once or twice, but it would have been nice if he told those who'd been dominating the conversation to be more conscientious of, giving more students a chance to contribute instead of allowing the same group to dominate our conversations, especially when all of our participation grade comes from our seminars. I also think the \"jump into the discussion\" approach, while I understand where it comes from, is not optimal for zoom. I know Shelly is opposed to this, but I genuinely think raising hands for when we want to speak would improve the discussion aspect of this course. I also thought that having an essay due during election week, without any adjustments to accommodate students' wellbeing, was not the most effective decision. For those of us who are members of marginalized communities and for whom politics is more than just a debate\/conversation, this was a legitimately stress-inducing time. Coupled with the fact that we are in a literal pandemic, I felt like even slightly adjusting the due date would have greatly helped us.",
                "On Grading: it's harsh but fair. I don't think you'll be super ~surprised by any grade you get. But yes those bad ones can come as a shock for sure. Make appointments with him. If your ideas get totally destroyed in the first one, book another appointment with him. If your argument is \"approved of\" by him, you'll do fine. Besides, you'll also get the best feedback you could ever hope for in a class. He wrote me 2100 words of feedback on my 2200 word paper. In terms of weaknesses, the flowing discussion in seminars is nice some of the time, but it's also very susceptible to being taken advantage of. Some people will certainly talk a little bit too much because of the way the conversation is totally open. I don't know if the drawbacks outweigh the strengths of the \"talk at will\" approach, but there certainly ARE drawbacks.",
                "Improve by: actually discussing the secondary readings.",
                "Shelly's feedback is incredibly deep and engages with your idea, actually seriously responding to the paper and your arguments. Discussions touched on a wide variety of topics most of which were interesting, but at the same time sometimes those discussions felt a little bit too surface level and could have benefited from everyone more carefully reflecting beforehand.",
                "Excellent seminar discussion format led by a capable and engaged Professor Kagan.",
                "This class works very well as a seminar. However, I wish there was more engagement and collaboration among students outside of the seminar. Of course, some of that would happen naturally in-person, but the instructor might consider including assignments that are more interactive than readings and essays. For example, Perusall has worked well in another class of mine as an alternative to solitary reading.",
                "I really liked the critical and engaging discursive style of the course, and how driven by student contributions it was. That said, the fact that participation was a large portion of the grade, along with the large number of students in the class, meant that there were always multiple people jumping in very quickly after someone would stop talking. I found this very difficult personally, as a person not comfortable talking over others. The result was that, although our discussions were scintillating and engaging, the small group of people who were more assertive in starting to talk ended up talking much more than others who were less comfortable talking over others. I think this class could be improved by a little more structure to guide the discussion - maybe Shelly could call on people so that those who aren't as comfortable talking over others would still be able to comfortably contribute.",
                "Discussion is amazing. Perhaps to favor one person less would have opened the discussion more; but then again, they favored themselves.",
                "Strengths: clarity of explanations, a lot of feedback. Weaknesses: pressure to speak in seminar led to common subpar contributions, priority of breadth of subject matter sometimes led to unfortunate deprioritization of depth.",
                "Shelly assigns interesting readings that dont take years to comb through, as they display the same clarity hes looking for in a student paper. Relatively short in comparison with many other classes at Yale, in my opinion theyre the perfect length to keep all students engaged throughout the semester, which in turn helps facilitate a strong seminar discussion. More often that not, students previously unfamiliar with complex philosophical concepts came to class with an understanding of them rare to see people gain so quickly an undergraduate course."

                "I addressed this in my answer above. Except for a class email list, there was no change, as far as I could tell, to adapt to an online setting. The course was engaging nonetheless -- but it could have been better.",
                "The fact that the seminar was over Zoom definitely made discussion more difficult. There was always at least a slight delay, so that people would start talking without realizing someone already had. Also, since we were all supposed to be unmuted all the time, we couldn't see that someone had unmuted themselves as a sign that they were about to start talking, as happens in other meetings at times. The seminar still functioned pretty well, but these issues made it more difficult to have smooth transitions between speakers.",

                "Yes, but this is a highly qualified yes. This class is difficult, and I have never left seminar and essay meetings feeling more demoralized and disappointed in myself than in this class. Shelly can be quite tough, and he isn't always the most encouraging person. For all that, though, it is an incredible privilege to learn from Shelly and to discuss the construction of commonsense morality with your peers.",
                "100%. take this class, and take advantage of Shelly's attention. No other prof will care about the stuff you write as much. You should be interested in moral philosophy, of course, but it doesn't have to be your main thing for you to get something out of the class. Bc you can't see the instructor remarks on course table, I'm pasting mine here: Shelly will give you outstanding feedback on your papers. I remember being worried because I thought I didn't properly address an objection in my paper. Shelly thought of like 12 more objections that never would've ever popped into my head; turns out the one I had thought of was the LEAST worrying. Enjoy the feedback. Also, he's very attentive with appointments and in office hours. In terms of drawbacks, sometimes he doesn't do enough to move the flow of the conversation in seminar. He also sometimes doesn't realize how intimidating he can be in appointments, but this isn't a frequent thing. You just learn not to take it personally when your argument gets absolutely totalled.",
                "Yes. Be prepared to fail and then learn.",
                "Yes. This course only has 3 reasonable length papers, but don't let this deceive you: I spent more time thinking about those papers than any other assignments this semester. This work, though, is re-payed in Shelly's feedback where your ideas are really taken to task and this means that if you really believe what you are writing this feedback can substantially change how you think about the topic. Seminars I didn't always find incredibly engaging, but they did, in conjunction with the readings, help clarify my thoughts about many questions in normative ethics which I hadn't even considered.",
                "Yes. Prof Kagan will sharpen your thinking and make you a better writer. He gives pages and pages of feedback for every essay that genuinely challenges you to think critically about your ideas.",
                "YES! Without question. Shelly Kagan is the most brilliant person you will ever have the opportunity to interact with and learn from in your life. Taking a seminar where you are expected to present your own ideas in front of him, and having him actually analyze and give feedback on your papers, is both insanely intimidating (not because he makes it that way, just the fact that he is the one doing it!) and incredibly rewarding. However, I would make sure that you will have considerable time to invest for writing the papers and, even if you do, go in expecting this class to drastically damage your GPA. If you can take it Credit\/D, absolutely do that, but even if you can't I wouldn't pass up the opportunity to take this or another seminar with Shelly. It is certainly rational to be concerned that your grade in this class may hinder graduate school opportunities. Still, I would say it's worth it. Classes like this are what Yale is for.",
                "I would, though not without qualifications. If you want to seriously work on your philosophical writing -- especially if you're interested in ethics -- then certainly. I learned a lot this semester. But it is not an easy course, and no idea of yours (in seminar or in papers) will be left unscrutinized.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in ethics with a few warnings. The student has to be prepared to fight a bit to speak, to receive harsh criticism of their work in written and grade form from Shelly, and to participate in discussions that will never feel entirely complete. That said, despite all that, this is a great course that caused me to think and talk about ethical questions in a comprehensive way I had never before experienced. The rigor of the course is high, but for me that led to the growth of a supportive friend group within the class - we discussed the material, talked over paper topics, and vented about ethics and the world. Overall, if you are interested, it is a course worth taking. Just be prepared to take a GPA hit at the end of the semester.",
                "It is a life-changer. Please take it. You will fail, but it is worth every second.",
                "Maybe. Only take it if highly interested in subject matter. Be ready for a philosophy class with a different approach, in that it de-emphasizes referencing (or even reading) papers on whatever topics you want to learn about\/write about for papers.",
