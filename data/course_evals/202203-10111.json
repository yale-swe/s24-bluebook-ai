                "great class",
                "Strengths: Professor Geha. He was a fantastic lecturer. The lectures were so engaging and went by so quickly. The assignments were relevant to class and weren't difficult, while also promoting student learning. Fantastic course.",
                "Strengths: The material and the professor! Astrophysics is so interesting and Professor Geha makes it understandable for students who aren't in STEM. The problem sets were also a great way to have us apply the knowledge and do some of the math ourselves.\r\nWeaknesses: No syllabus  I understand that professors can change deadlines and policies throughout the semester, but it was extremely disorienting having these changes made regularly with no central, continually updated syllabus to refer back to. The grading for the topic papers felt highly arbitrary and harsh  most of the points that I had taken off weren't tied directly to the guidelines laid out in the rubric. Many of the responses given on Ed Discussion didn't really answer the question asked.",
                "Strengths: manageable workload; accessible to non-STEM majors; engaging lectures; fair grading policies; assignments were interesting\r\nWeaknesses: discussion questions in the lecture weren't very productive; could have allowed for an online lecture option without missing out on lecture quiz points",
                "The course was an effective basic introduction to a few popular/interesting astrophysics concepts. The teaching staff had a very clear purpose with the course, and they did a good job keeping that in mind throughout the entire semester, I think. Communication over the course of the semester was typically very clear and efficient. I think the course suffered from differing levels of engagement amongst students. Some students were very engaged, but it also seemed like a very substantial portion of the class was not paying attention at all in lecture, because you didn't really need to do get a good grade in the class. Basically, this class sometimes fell prey to the double-edged sword: it is a very accessible, low-workload, usually low-stress class, but as is often the case with classes like this, it suffered from low levels of engagement from a lot of its students.",
                "The strengths of this course are mainly the access to TFs and ULAs and the interactive lectures.",
                "Strength: The expectations were straightforward and well-defined for quizzes, and psets\r\nWeakness: They sometimes decided to be \"more strict\" on random assignments, and it would've been helpful to have a rubric for the first essay",
                "Strengths: NO TESTS! Prof. Geha is an engaging lecturer and there are plenty of office hours.",
                "Strength: course was based around active participation, nearly 25% of the final grade was based on showing up and taking a short lecture attendance quiz. Concepts were presented in interesting ways and never felt boring. Teaching staff was accessible during sections / office hours to help re-explain content as needed or review math. (You won't need more than basic algebra for this course! Further math is helpful but everything is explained).\r\n\r\nWeakness: Grading was on a delay, especially towards the end of the semester. Problem set feedback was minimal at times unless you reached out over edstem to request clarifications.",
                "The strengths of the course include a very engaging and interesting subject matter which allowed for fun discussions and learning. Also, the Ed Discussion platform allowed students to ask questions in an open forum setting which was very helpful throughout the course of the class.",
                "I think the wording on some of the assignments (psets and projects) can be vague or unclear but otherwise good class.",
                "wow this class is easy and boring. I do not think I learned a single thing.",
                "The strengths of this course are the extremely kind, understanding, and brilliant professor. She makes every class a joy to attend, and I always walk out having learned something fascinating. The assignments are fun to complete, and the problem sets are challenging but manageable. There are truly no weaknesses of this course.",
                "This course was taught very well and very clear for the students. It was helpful that the science started at base one with no previous background in the topics we were talking about. It was very engaging with videos and demonstrations.",
                "The strength of this course was the engaging instructor. Lectures were interesting and the invited guest speaker was phenomenal. Students were supported by TAs and all questions were able to be answered.",
                "strengths: the professor has a knack of explaining things in a very clear and accessible way. There are many good analogies and visual aids used during the glass so that I could grasp the abstract concepts better; the class was structured pretty clearly so that we know what to expect; the assignments had a good variety which made it fun\r\n\r\nweakness: it would be great if we can introduce the significance of the content first before delving into the specific mechanisms or details. sometimes I found myself a little lost as to why a certain discussion is important",
                "Very fun class. I would not really have weaknesses.",
                "I think this was a great course but think there should be a bit more clarity on how to properly answer quiz problems",
                "Strengths: you are actually learning things and then applying them. The workload is definitely higher than what I expected, but certainly manageable. You should put in your best effort to this class, and if you do that, you'll do fine and get a lot out of it. Others who slacked off definitely got less out of it.",
                "This course is not bad and it is pretty easy overall. However, the instructors do not want this class to be too easy, so they made it a bit harder. But overall, it is a pretty easy gut science class.",
                "Strengths: Interesting material well explained. Difficult scientific concepts made accessible. I really appreciated how Prof. Geha tried to craft the course for humanities students  there were lots of opportunities to be creative in class assignments. Weaknesses: None",
                "The post-lecture quizzes definitely add incentive to attend lecture, but are not always easy to answer even if you were present and taking notes.",
                "Strengths: Professor Geha is an excellent lecturer and I was consistently engaged during the classes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Grading on the problem sets can be picky and very inconsistent (I got As on every problem set, so this is not me being resentful). Grading on the topic papers, which make up a huge percentage of your grade, is extremely difficult. The average grade on this paper, which the class did not adequately prepare students for, was too low. Most of the grading was on the basis of things not really addressed by the course (e.g. writing style). Prepare to spend a lot of time on these papers if you want to get a good grade; your knowledge of course concepts will not be tested in them, just your ability to craft something vaguely that the TAs want. The rubric by which these papers are graded is unfair and far too ambiguous. The worst part about the papers is that the TAs and Professor Geha refused to provide actual feedback on your paper and how you could improve for future topic papers unless you were significantly below the average. This is unfair, and not how a Yale course should be run, let alone a science credit. These papers should be removed from the course and replaced with 2 midterms and a short final. Until that happens, this course should not be considered a Science credit.",
                "Strengths: Organized well, fair grading process, lectures were engaging, Psets related to course content, Topic papers were challenging but fun.",
                "It was pretty fun. Marla is a great lecturer. It could have been improved if the topic papers weren't graded so harshly or even if they didn't exist. They didn't align super well with what we were learning in class, especially the first one. The problem sets were often really long because they would require watching an entire 30 minute video lecture to answer one multiple choice question. All in all, I found the course material interesting but the setup of the class very frustrating.",
                "Easy class but still learn quite a bit b",
                "I wished it had involved more mathematical grounding for what we were learning. I thought it was a well-designed course for what it aimed to achieve, though.",
                "Professor Geha is the biggest strength. She focuses the class to foster understanding and provides ample opportunities to help students with assignments and with their learning. The only weakness is that I wish it had gone deeper in multiple subjects. Things could feel too easy and almost mindless.",
                "Only strengths! Prof. Geha is a FABULOUS lecturer, and she designed the class for non-STEM majors, so it was easy to follow. If I wasn't already a junior and had taken this class as a first-year, I might've seriously considered looking into astrophysics or astronomy as a major!",
                "Strength: Designed so that non-science majors could still get a good grade. A great class structure that worked! And consistent help if needed\r\nWeaknesses: We didn't get feedback on major assignments like psets/topic papers",
                "Prof Geha clearly loves teaching astro to her students! I liked the courseit was pretty easy, but the material is actually pretty difficult at times. Definitely be prepared to relearn a lot of material when it comes time to write the topic papers.",
                "The content is interesting and the professor is passionate about the class, but it is structured poorly for student engagement.",
                "Lectures were very well organized; agenda was clear every day.",
                "Very easy but engaging material",
                "A strength of the class was that Prof. Geha is an engaging and efficient lecturer. She covered a lot of ground every class without it ever feeling too fast, and the slides always included figures that were very helpful in visualizing what she was talking about. \r\n\r\nAlso, the class succeeded in its mission. It explained astrophysics in a way that was very accessible to me as a non-STEM major with very little background in it.\r\n\r\nAnother strength of the class was that the workload was very reasonable. The expectations to get an A are very clear and it's easy to see where you stand in the class with your grade. \r\n\r\nMaybe the only weakness was the first topic paper assignment, which I hope changes when the class is offered again (one topic paper can be dropped, so this also isn't that big a deal). We were asked to come up with a proposal for a new satellite mission, and to make a somewhat detailed case that it was both feasible and worth the investment. That is really difficult: most missions that actually are feasible and worth the investment are already in the works, and if no space agency or company is planning a given mission, there's usually a reason why!",
                "I think the major strength of the class that there are no tests. This relieves a lot of anxiety in general, but especially for non-STEM students who are trying to grasp the concepts. Additionally, the course is very accessible. The availability of recorded lectures made it so that it was never too hard to stay on track with the course. Above all, I really appreciated the wide selection of office hours and the readiness and helpfulness of the Teaching staff. They definitely took time with each student to make sure that each concept was explained, and without them the course would have been much more challenging. I also appreciate the opportunities for extra credit in the class.\r\n\r\nWhile I think the grading structure is really well thought out, the participation section was a bit of a hinderance. The lecture quizzes are good in theory but often they were stressful because answers might not be said in class and it's so easy to forget to submit them. I think their weight ended up having too much of a bearing on the final grade given how harsh late deductions were. In the future, I don't think the quizzes should be taken away but rather other opportunities to enhance your participation grade should be offered. For instance, I think it might be useful if going to office hours attributed to your participation grade.",
                "Weakness: having topic papers instead of exams. Similar knowledge is tested but topic papers require much more effort in areas unrelated to astrophysics",
                "Strengths: Professor Geha is absolutely amazing. She explained everything so well and was a really engaging lecturer! The grading system was awesome -- there were so many opportunities for points, and the course is definitely designed to push you, but the professor wants you to succeed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures should have been viewable immediately after class! I don't understand why they would be withheld.",
                "This course has primary strengths.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Each lecture was engaging, funny, straightforward, and easy to follow. The material was interesting and valuable for personal development.",
                "weaknesses: I think the lectures could be boiled down to 20 minutes of actual content. The rest is filler, and it became extremely difficult to remain engaged with the course. The quizzes were fine at first, then became weirdly worded to trick students up. I don't really have any words to describe my feelings about the \"discussion questions\" that were used to force students to attend class; maybe there's a better way to keep up in-person attendance than this. The paper grading was extremely subjective and seemed to be a random number based on how the grader was feeling that day.  \r\n\r\nstrengths: Prof Geha was super passionate and kind. The workload was not stressful and office hours were helpful if you had any struggles.",
                "Strengths: Professor Geha is incredible and makes the course material accessible and assignments low-stakes. Weaknesses: the quizzes for each lecture were sometimes tricky, but given that there are so few assignments and theres a lot of extra credit, I thought these were fine.",
                "Lectures are really entertaining and even though there was some work, it actually felt like a gut.  I don't really see room for improvement.",
                "Strengths: Flexible grading!!! Relatively light workload, engaging lectures, content is easily digestible, Professor Geha is amazing too which helps this course out a lot.\r\nWeaknesses: The only small thing that I would improve in this course is giving a bit more feedback on the topic papers. Other than that, this course is amazing.",
                "Very good course maybe a little too light on math",
                "Strengths -- lectures were engaging, which is especially impressive because most people in this class are not ~science people~ per se. I thought psets were fair and fairly straightforward.\r\nWeaknesses -- with the larger assignments (topic papers,) it felt like grading was harsh to prove some type of point (like \"this is not a gut,\") which is frustrating.",
                "Lecture was super interesting, professor Geha is awesome and cares about her students and the class a lot. The in class quizzes keep you in check with attending class and participating with the lecture material. The topic papers are a great way to demonstrate what you've learned in addition to being creative.",
                "I thought the course was taught well. Professor Geha is clearly passionate about what she teaches and the problem sets and projects make sense in the context of what is taught.",
                "Strengths - low stress and interesting material\r\nWeaknesses - did not receive clear feedback on some assignments/ vague grading. No specific TFs assigned to students so could not discuss papers with anyone before submitting.",
                "The strengths of this course is that the content is inherently exciting - each topic we discussed is fascinating and really pushed my appreciation for sciences' discoveries.",
                "Strengths- very interesting material, simplified enough for non-STEM majors to understand, slides were very clear and had good diagrams, I liked the use of Ed Discussion since I could get my questions answered quickly\r\nWeaknesses- I wish the lecture recordings were made available immediately, the topic papers (especially topic paper 1) were not really based on what I learned in lectures, some parts in lecture slides unclear when Im reviewing them to do problem sets (i.e. graphs with no explanation on the side)",
                "I think the inclass quizzes are important but the style of them can maybe change. I think for the topic papers we weren't graded as much on the material we learned as I think we should have been.",
                "I think the class is a great way to get your science credit without too much work. The daily lecture quizzes are annoying but its a small price to pay for no exams or other difficulties. The psets were a little menial, but the topic papers were actually pretty fun.",
                "Strengths: approachable, clear expectations, good support system, you'll never feel lost or helpless if you attend lecture and office hours.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: people think it's a gut, so they don't treat it seriously. Yes the material is not hard, but it's still pretty interesting. The teaching team does a good job incentivizing people to attend lecture, but it would be nice if the course weren't immediately associated with the word gut.",
                "Strengths  MARLA!! She is a fantastic lecturer. Course is incredibly organized and well taught.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses  nil truly, one of the best courses Ive taken so far at Yale",
                "Class is pretty awesome as is. Great class for non science majors, effectively teaches a well curated amount of content.",
                "LOVE prof Geha!!! take a class with her if you can!! she made this course great for humanities kids",
                "Strengths: grading scheme is pretty lenient, professor is cool, material can be interesting // Weaknesses: would have liked a little more depth in the course material",
                "Strengths: Professor Geha is an engaging lecturer! The lectures were east to follow, and all her slides were posted if you wanted to go back and look. I also appreciated that instead of exams, we had projects  so no memorization was necessary. I especially enjoyed the video project for Black Holes (which invited a lot of creativity!). Weaknesses: sometimes the weekly problem sets had problems that felt like they were trying to trick you a bit (i.e. referencing a part of an article thats hard to find, worded ambiguously, etc.). I also thought the criteria for grading could have been clearer at times.",
                "Geha is a very good lecturer, and the class was very well organized. She explains things in a way that non-STEM students can understand.",
                "The grading for the first term paper was harsh. Of course a bunch of humanities students are going to write a research proposal of lower quality than actual science students. The grading should have been adjusted accordingly. Besides that, however, everything was 10/10. Prof. Geha is so passionate and I loved her. She was so good at explaining everything and making it sound interesting. And the grading, overall, was very fair, except for the first paper.",
                "The class is too big. At times I feel a little disconnected with the professors and the materials.",
                "Strengths: Amazing professor, engaging topic, accessible but still intellectual\r\nWeaknesses: Large lecture, but the course is run in such a way that close engagement with the course is possible",
                "Grading rubric was unclear and reasons for points being taken off were not specified. Also, there was not a lot of willingness to talk to students about what they got wrong, probably because of the large size of the class. Office hours could have been more engaging too. For strengths, I think the introductory level made it very accessible to non-STEM majors.",
                "Strengths: This course is meant to be an easy introduction for non-STEM majors and it lives up to it. The workload and assignments were very light (no tests) and the content was interesting and easy to understand. Grading was super super flexible and fair. Weaknesses: I would have maybe liked more TA/teacher interaction? Not really any weaknesses.",
                "Thought the course was great, no weaknesses.",
                "Strength is that the content is clear",
                "Loved the lectures",
                "Good intro for non-stem students that was engaging",
                "Strengths: Prof. Geha is very fun(ny) and engaging. Also, the Ed Discussions were extremely helpful and questions were answered promptly. Weakness: topic papers will be graded with a rubric but no actual comments from the grader (sometimes I was confused as to why I scored a certain score on the rubric).",
                "Prof. Marla is an engaging lecturer and tailored the topics to our interests. The class was also generously graded but ensured understanding from students",
                "Professor Geha is really great at making the class engaging for non-stem students. I highly recommend.",
                "Lovely course, I would not suggest any changes.",
                "Professor Geha was a great teacher and made the material interesting despite the large lecture format.",
                "Sometimes I found lecture to not be engaging enough especially doing brief discussions in a lecture setting didnt really work well. Id probably prefer actual discussion sections. I did learn a lot though and I liked Professor Geha",
                "The feedback and grading of the course was terrible. Receiving feedback on assignments rarely happened, with points seemingly being taken away at random. Although the information presented was quite interesting, the dis-congruence between what was said in lecture and how assignments were graded was disheartening. Future mistakes could not be prevented because no feedback was given on how to improve. Points were taken off for the same issue on the same assignment as well, likely due to the fact that no one TA reviewed the assignment as a whole.",
                "Well taught with clear expectations",
                "I think this course could be improved by more cooperative exercises in class.",
                "I liked that we had the opportunity to gain points through the lecture quizzes. I thought the goal of some of the topic papers were a little bit vague.",
                "It was very accessible and easy if you go to lectures. However, the TAs and Professor could be kind of rude at times.",
                "Could be more regular assignments outside of the papers",
                "Strengths: class format, assignment types, and professors expectations were very realistic. \r\nWeaknesses: none.",
                "Good class",
                "Accessible and very interesting. Would have liked to see more challenge in some areas.",
                "material is very interesting and there are many opportunities for revision, extra credit and help throughout the course. its really interesting content, as well. lectures are light and fun and there is always help abailable. \r\n\r\nsometimes the lecture quizzes didnt seem to be answerable from just paying attention in lecture, there were a few times i couldnt complete them despite paying full attention in lecture. other than that, there was occasional miscommunication about section times/places/zoom links.",
                "I really liked how slow it was and how it was tailored to non-stem majors. I felt like it was a perfect challenge for me as a non stem major.",
                "Prof Geha is extremely engaging. Idk a weakness",
                "Great lecture course that offers lots of flexibility",
                "This course covers its topics well!",
                "strengths were the team work and collaboration, weaknesses are relative disorganization and lack of transparency. if you don't have friends in the class, it's hard to be successful on your own.",
                "Pedagogically perfect, no notes",
                "Strengths: The problem sets were interesting and fairly challenging but never overwhelmingly difficult. I also found the pace of the class really niceit never seemed like we were spending too much time on a particular topic. Weaknesses: Some of the teaching staff were rude and unapproachable.",
                "Excellent course at communicating advanced physics to non-STEM majors.  I appreciated receiving a functional understanding of space without slogging through advanced math.  Prof Geha was excellent!  Her enthusiasm was infectious and her expertise was apparent.\r\n\r\nThis course could be improved with a little bit more math.  The math we did was elementary and the TFs often took it too slow.  Despite our non-STEM backgrounds, we can set up and plug in simple equations.",
                "This course has a strong structure to it and all the material is presented in an engaging and understandable manner. No weaknesses come to mind.",
                "Marla is very engaging and the second topic paper (Black Holes video) was fun.",
                "This course was one of the most engaging lectures I've ever taken at Yale. I thoroughly enjoyed every class, and the professor was both engaging and clear in her explanations. I thought the assignments and PSETs were all very manageable, and both the instructor and the TA team were very available and very communicative. I wish that detailed feedback on assignments (rather than just letter/rubric grades) had been more readily available.",
                "The professors ensures not to quantitatively strain her students too much and explains topics in a way that is suitable to those of a non-STEM background. The topic papers are fun and engaging. Prof is very dedicated to the course and clearly commits a lot of time."

                "yes",
                "Yes, especially if you are looking for an accessible science credit as a non-science person. It was interesting and engaging, the professor is super nice, and there are so many support systems to help you do well!",
                "Absolutely. Usually, when classes are on the easier side you don't learn much. However, you get the best of both worlds in this course. I learned so much in a stress-free environment, and the assignments promoted learning while not being stressful at all.",
                "Yes! The material was so interesting and a really great way for a non-STEM major to dip their toe into a field they may have otherwise found inaccessible.",
                "Yes! Take it. It's an easy class, you learn interesting things. Although it can be a little disorganized in terms of assignments, Prof. Geha and the TA's are really accommodating and caring. Watching Prof. Geha lecture is a pleasure and her passion is infectious. You won't learn much about the policy of space, but you do get a working knowledge of the scientific concepts and challenges inherent to the three areas explored throughout the course: satellites, black holes, and exoplanets.",
                "I would recommend this course for non-STEM majors looking for a QR credit! If you're slightly interested in learning about space, this course is also for you. Even though the title of this course may sound scary, this class is relatively easy and insightful! Assignments are manageable and there's a lot of support to help complete assignments if needed.",
                "Yes  this class can fit the needs of several different types of students. If you want a low-workload \"gut\" science or QR credit that isn't stressful and doesn't take too much time, this class suits that. You can put in 3-4 hours of work most weeks, including going to lecture, and get a good grade. If you simply have an interest in the topic and want a little survey of some cool topics, this class suits that as well. The material is interesting and Prof. Geha is an engaging professor. If you want a deep, intellectually rigorous dive into some astrophysics concepts, this is not the class for you. Prof. Geha herself describes the course as a \"science for Senators\" course  it's meant to provide some baseline knowledge and skills, not be an intellectually rigorous course. Also, lectures almost always finished 15-20 minutes early, which was nice especially because I had a different class at 1pm and this one technically finished at 12:50.",
                "Yes! It is a really easy and fun class, the professor always makes everything really engaging, and it really is a great class for a science credit!",
                "Absolutely! Every other class I took this semester was boring with lots of heavy work. This class made my life better and more exciting!",
                "Yes, it was a good science credit. Pretty interesting at some points, and there's consistent work, but never a lot.",
                "I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS to non-STEM people looking for a class that will utilize their writing and analytical skills, rather than science credits where you just have to memorize facts. There are no tests and the problem sets are really not that hard.",
                "Would recommend. It's a fun science credit and amazing introduction to demystifying the magic behind common space topics of interest.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to non-science majors. It is a really fun and stimulating class with a lot of flexibility and room for curiosity and questions about the content and beyond.",
                "Yes definitely. This class is not meant for science majors and so it is not too intellectually challenging. Also you get to learn about the new and cool things about space which I doubt you wouldve learned anywhere else",
                "YES 100% TAKE IT!!! If you are even considering it, enroll in this course! By far, the best science/QR credit at Yale. The best professor, genuinely fun assignments, and you learn so much! It is intellectually challenging, but very much manageable in terms of workload. Take this course! You will learn so much.",

The no tests format is great (although you have to do topic papers instead and the grading for those can be stupidly harsh but you should have enough padding from other stuff to keep your grade up). Show up to lectures, do the psets, easy A.",

                "yes! english major who needed a QR here, and it was a great time. made me very existential at times though. I definitely had a bit more of an advantage because I had a friend in the course, so we'd work on psets together and when we'd get stuck we'd just go to the zoom office hours. if we were still confused after that, my roommate is a physics major, so we'd ask him to explain the concept to us again, or go over an example. i usually did my first run through of the psets on Monday, work with my friend on the questions we were lost on together on Tuesday, and then submit on Wednesday a day before they were actually due on Thursday. \r\n\r\ni highly recommend this course. its not too stressful of a time, you feel like you get to exercise that highschool math of yours again, and the midterms and finals weren't intimidating once you started them. and Geha is a wonderful lecturer with some good humor.",
                "Absolutely. This is the course you're looking for.",

I got my science credit and actually learned something valuable in the process. \r\n\r\nThe rocket science was the best part, I really enjoyed it. The other stuff was harder to grasp and not as exciting.",
                "This course is not bad and it is pretty easy overall. However, the instructors do not want this class to be too easy, so they made it a bit harder. But overall, it is a pretty easy gut science class.",

                "I would not recommend this course to another student. As someone who consistently got very good grades in the class, the topic papers are an unfair way of conducting the course, and not a good way of testing students' skills/knowledge. Take another science course.",

                "Sure, it's definitely a reasonable science credit, interesting even if you aren't a science person, and there are no exams but it wasn't as easy as I thought it was going to be. They grade the topic papers really harshly.",
                "Yeah its a gut. You will get an A.",
                "Yes absolutely. If you do the work, an A is very doable. Also, you'll learn something!",

                "Yes, definitely take this course if given the opportunity. I would say this course is probably amongst two or three STEM classes at Yale that are actually accessible to a non-stem major. On top of that, the content is genuinely interesting and it's probably the first time in my life that I've been truly engaged with a STEM class. There's so much built in help and opportunities for learning and success; if you can get in you will not regret taking the class!",

                "Absolutely.",
                "Great science class for non science majors on very interesting topics.",
                "I would recommend this course to any other student. This course will be exciting and fun and teach students many things about space and the future, information that is not popular among people worldwide.",
                "I guess if you're just looking to fulfill your SC/QR reqs. Otherwise, no; this class is 1 of only 36 of your Yale credits.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it can be a class to balance out your workload. There were no exams, which definitely alleviates the stress come exam time both in the middle and at the end of the semester.",
                "Yes!!! A great QR/Sc credit and hidden gem at Yale. Prof. Geha is engaging and keeps the material super up to date. She also knows that most student are not aspiring astrophysicist and makes the assignments fun and engaging. I really enjoyed this course!!! Take it if you can get in.",
                "Yep",
                "Yes. Absolutely. Professor Geha is a gem.",
                "YES! This class is great for non-STEM majors as Professor Geha breaks down problems and makes it simple to learn the equations. The problem sets are not difficult (and going to Office hours helps a lot!!!) and the quizzes are a nice way to review the material. One of the best courses I could've taken.",
                "Yes phenomenal way to get a science credit",
                "Yes, for a science gut. This one was ideal because it is fairly low workload and it is actively interesting!",
                "Yes, everyone should have to take this course at some point! It is not too challenging and is very interesting information about the planet we live on.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student.",
                "Yes! If you are looking for a SC or QR credit, this class is great. I would highly recommend it to humanities majors who are curious about space. I think that if you mildly had a fascination about what a black hole really is, this is the class for you. Plus, the professor is really funny and dumb downs the content to a level where us who struggle with hard equations and just like to copy down and plug in a calculator pass the class.",
                "Yes! Great Science credit for relatively low workload and engaging content. Some interesting assignments",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is not particularly confident in the science and math realms but is super interested in these subject areas from a humanities lens.",
                "Yes- very interesting topic, gives you good sense of important astronomy concepts",
                "Yes as far as a science credit goes its very interesting material in my eyes.",
                "Yes.  Great option for humanities students looking for an interesting science credit.",
                "Yes if you need a science credit",
                "If you're interested in Astro but don't wanna do a ton of math, this is definitely a good class. Also good way to complete science distribution without adding too much work.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, if you need a science credit.",
                "Absolutely",
                "I would recommend this course without reservation for anyone needing a science credit or interested in topics in astrophysics without intensive math.",
                "Yes 100% everyone should take",
                "Yes, good class for non-STEM major! I took it for the QR credit and it was very accessible. Professor Geha and the teaching team were all incredibly helpful, and the class set up students to succeed.",
                "Yes! this course was very informative and made me more interested in science.",
                "Sure, if you know what you are getting yourself into. Works well as a 5th class to get the science credit, and you learn some pretty neat things about astrophysics, but if you are looking for a rigorous QR/SC credit or want a real introduction to astrophysics as a discipline I would encourage you to look elsewhere",
                "I would recommend this course  if you have little-to-no knowledge of astrophysics and are genuinely curious about it, youll have a lot of fun!",
                "Yes, a great great science gut for non-stem majors.",
                "I would. It is so interesting yet digestible for someone without a science background. Its also a lot of fun.",
                "Yes. It's really good if you want to dip your toe in astrophysics",
                "I would.",
                "Yes. I would recommend this to students who are looking for a science credit.",
                "Yes!! This is a great great gut for science or QR. There are no exams just short papers/projects. As a humanities major I am so glad I took this. It also is interesting content so you learn cool stuff/can understand what is going on. Take for a simple introduction to astrophysics!",
                "Yes, its a great way to learn the subject if you dont have as technical a background and also its facilitated to enable learning very well.",
                "Yes, a good science class for non science majors",
                "Yes, easy class",
                "Yes. Good intersting science credit that was low stress and fun",
                "Absolutely, if they want to know some basic knowledge about space.",
                "Wonderful gut for any humanities student.",
                "Yes! Great science credit",
                "Yes! Took this as my last SC credit. Wish I had done it earlier",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to humanities majors who want to engage with science, especially if they like physics or are interested in the universe. It was super accessible and interesting, and I learned a lot about science policy that I didn't know before.",
                "Absolutely. For me, it was a great class to take in order to get a science credit, but I also loved the class and found it extremely interesting.",
                "Yes, if you are looking for an interesting science gut with a low workload and easy grading. The teaching staff are very helpful and the course content is fascinating. By far, my favorite QR/science Ive taken at Yale.",
                "Yes! For non STEM majors this course offers the opportunity to learn about scientific topics in an easily digestible way.",
                "Yes!",
                "Not necessarily. The grading and feedback issues lead to more trouble than I felt the class needed to have or deserved. It often times felt like feedback and grading was so terrible simply to avoid the perception that the class was easy. The information presented in the class was very interesting and provided a great introduction into astrophysics, however receiving no feedback made the class much more stress inducing than it needed to be.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. I would.",
                "Yes, this course was a very interesting and manageable way to fulfill a science credit.",

                "It's great if you need a science credit! The workload was very light, and we covered some really interesting topics. Plus, Prof Geha is a great lecturer!",
                "Yes, it is interesting and a great science credit",
                "Yes!! Great guy but its also super interesting",
                "Yes! You learn a lot of interesting things about astrophysics. Definitley worth taking for a science credit, and the coursework is very straightforward in terms of what needs to be done. Just start ahead on the papers if you can.",
                "Yes, I would. It's a great class to take to be familiar with these topics, and if one is willing to put in the work on the topic papers, especially.",
                "Yes! Absolutely, great workload and level of engagement",
                "yes, a science gut!",
                "Yes! Good class to take for a easier QR/Science credit.",

                "Yes for non-STEM students this class is a really fun and low-stakes way to learn more about astrophysics.",
                "This is an absolutely wonderful course for non-Stem majors who wish to fulfill QR/Science requirements. Prof Geha is an incredible lecturer, the course materials are extremely relevant and up to date with current scientific discoveries, and just fascinating topics to learn about. The class is very well organized, with many office hours and sections available to talk through questions and problem sets.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any humanities major looking for an engaging but manageable science course. I thought the professor and the TA team did an amazing job of making difficult and complex material accessible to students who aren't STEM majors.",
                "This course has a light workload and is accessible to pretty much all students in terms of rigor and necessary background. It's not too intense and some of the material is interesting and fun. Prof is incredibly nice and engaging."
