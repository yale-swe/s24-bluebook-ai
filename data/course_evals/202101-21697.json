                "The strengths of this course are twofold, 1) Professor Kapustin is a really engaging professor. He is good at explaining really hard to read texts in easier terms, and even if you were really bored by the readings, he has an enthusiasm that gets you motivated and super engaged with the material, and 2) the readings are really, really interesting if you take the time to do them. I did not do all the readings, but when I did I found them incredibly intellectually stimulating and enjoyed them. The readings and discussions I had in this class are possibly the most interesting and stimulating that I have had at Yale. Personally, I felt the course had one main weakness, it doesn't have enough time. It can be quite difficult to leap from authors who have such different approaches so quickly, and because they are often hard to compare because of how radically different their approaches are, it doesn't always lend itself to comparative study either. Additionally, you will spend almost all your time in the class working towards understanding what the authors are writing, and why their ideas are robust, thus the focus is not evaluative (whether you believe or are convinced by their claims). So, while all the authors are interesting, it may not feel like a really cohesive set of ideas, and you will not have time to evaluate many of their arguments.",
                "Strengths - Professor Kapustins insights, the way he runs the seminar makes people want to participate and learn the material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - none",
                "The course's biggest strength is in its breadth of content covered. Yet, I think lightening the reading load could be helpful to allow students to more deeply engage in each week's material.",
                "I would say that the biggest strength of this class is the material and Prof. Kapustin's discussions on it. It forces you to look at the reading in many different ways and really understand the text at its core.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kapustin is absolutely wonderful. I have never had a Prof. with so much genuine passion for philosophy in and of itself\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the online format definitely took away from our discussions. Other than that, no obvious weaknesses in the course"

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student at Yale if they were willing to do the reading. The readings can be incredibly stimulating if you enjoy philosophy or enjoy reading political/economic theory, but you have to do them! The discussions in class are very interesting (particularly listening to Kapustin), but the real value in the class comes when you do the readings and then discuss them. There is often a lot of reading (and some of it will definitely feel like it's not worth it), but some of it is seriously fascinating. The heavy reading load is somewhat compensated for by the relatively few assignments, so overall the workload isn't too much. Also, don't expect to evaluate/spend much time criticizing the author's arguments! If you mainly enjoy philosophy because you enjoy disproving or disagreeing with the authors, this class may not be for you will spend the vast majority of your time working towards understanding the authors' arguments, and why they are so compelling.",
