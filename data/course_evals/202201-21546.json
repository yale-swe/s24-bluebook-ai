                "Strengths: Swapna Ji is great. Super accommodating and a fair class. Work load is not too high\r\nWeaknesses: some classes we spend the entire time reading one article so you participate for 5 min the entire class",
                "I liked the emphasis on conversation and trying to discuss our thoughts on readings. I think grammar could be better taught.",
                "The fact that it's all heritage speakers makes the dynamic so fun. I sometimes feel like I'm with desi family friends at home. I also like the variety of the syllabus from movies to poetry.\r\n\r\nBy far the biggest weakness is that there's not enough emphasis on speaking. The conversation sections try to solve this and the premise is that we already can speak but, in reality, speaking is what most of us want to improve and it's easy to get by in the class without really pushing yourself orally.",
                "Overall, I felt really engaged throughout the course and learned a lot of grammar from class lessons. The projects (midterm skit, final magazine, etc.) are both unique and really fulfilling, and Swapna Ji makes practicing oral and writing skills feel enjoyable. We also received individualized feedback on every assignment we turned in, which was really helpful. However, one area of improvement is that it would have been nice to have been given more vocabulary lists throughout the semester in addition to learning grammar concepts.",
                "We have really become close as a class, and I dont ever feel self-conscious about trying to speak Hindi and messing up. One thing would be helpful would be to know what the homework for both Tuesday and Thursday will be at the start of the week. That way, students can plan and work ahead like we can for other classes. When homework was assigned on Wednesday afternoon via email and due Thursday, it made it hard to plan other work. If both Tuesday and Thursday homework assignments could be announced at the same time earlier in the week, it would make a huge difference!"

                "I would recommend this course to other heritage speakers because the Hindi department is an amazing community to be part of!",
                "Yes! The workload is very manageable if you're consistent with it and Swapnaji is very sweet. \r\n\r\nIf you want a really intense language course in which you radically improve your fluency, this might not be the best. It's more for people who want to become more comfortable with Hindi in a relaxed environment.",
                "Yes! You will meet many interesting students with diverse backgrounds and the class almost feels like a close-knit family. Not only have my oral and writing skills improved tremendously throughout the semester, but I've made some amazing memories and friends in the class, and I'm genuinely sad that the class is now over.",
