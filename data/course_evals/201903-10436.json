    "How to think critically about my position as an artist and art-worker, how to talk about my work, how to think about my work in the larger scope of art history.",
    "I learned about different phases in art, theory in modern art, and how to write an artist statement. \r\nI think this class could better serve art majors if it focused less on theory and instead focused on either being a true survey of modern art, or focused on the students getting to know each other and their work (beyond the critique part of the course).",
    "I learned different aspects of viewing and analyzing art throughout time. I mostly learned how to write my own artist statement and emulation project studies, and listened to the professor speak.",
    "Short answer: Absolutely nothing. This class is a complete and utter waste.\r\n\r\nLong answer: Let me preface this course evaluation by explaining that I went in with a positive mindset. I was genuinely enthusiastic to meet and engage with other art majors, mostly because there is so little interdisciplinary mixing. While I met other art majors, we eventually found common ground in how horrible this seminar is. It is completely and utterly a waste of time and designed in a way that does not facilitate learning. Attempting to group the different groups of artists under the same umbrella proved to make this class a true \"jack of all trades, master of none\". I did all of the readings, which were often long-winded and in confusing art jargon that did next to nothing to facilitate learning of what was trying to be conveyed. Rather than preparing the art majors for what is a confusing and hazy career (should it be one that wants to be pursued), Jonathan spent most classes talking over students when they came in with things to say. I never felt as if I had learned anything from previous classes or the readings: whenever something was brought up in class, Jonathan would simply re-explain what was said and then go on a tirade about something tangentially related, not helping student understanding. \r\n\r\nThis is where I want to touch on the next point: the syllabus. I don't know what I expected from \"Junior Seminar\", but as I said before, I expected some sort of class about being an artist. What I got was a few classes on art movements (mostly in painting), a rough art history lesson (about nothing in particular), and presentations of work that didn't actually get anybody to think on their own work. During critiques of other student's work, no new work was asked to be made, which would have been fine if not for the fact that critiques were focused around ONE piece of work. This may work in a painting crit, but certainly not in a graphic design or photography one. All works were treated the same, which is stupid. Graphic design is not the same as painting and should not be treated or evaluated as such. Furthermore, it doesn't do anybody a favor when there are critiques of old work that have discussion centered around tropes not related to their work. \r\n\r\nI learned nothing. This class was a waste of two hours each week.",
    "How to write an artists statement, discussion of larger questions in art history.",
    "I cant say I learned anything from this class.",
    "This class elicited a lot of interesting discussions about contemporary art issues as well as our own art. The final emulation project was extremely exciting and produced a lot of interesting results.",
    "I was taught to think critically about the way in which art is critiqued and valued in academic life."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: fun discussion format, lively energy in a comfortable setting, good community building among juniors.",
    "Strengths: Great readings and if you're willing to try squeezing in between Prof. Weinberg's lecturing, sometimes great discussions. Also that it's only once a week. \r\nWeaknesses: Prof. Weinberg is not a very interesting lecturer to listen to, and tends to push back against questions that students ask as well as not let students participate very often. \r\nWhile this course has a nice structure (artist statement --> critique --> modernism --> emulation project), it does not feel very cohesive. It's also difficult to get to know your classmates, even though I think that should be one of the focal points of the class.",
    "This course has great reading materials and is well-paced In terms of assignments. I also learned a lot about my fellow junior art majors! Weaknesses are that class time is dominated by the professor fishing for correct answers to his lectures; i wish he would consider student opinions and views more, even if he does not agree with them.",
    "There are no strengths to this class. Its mind-numbingly boring and I did not progress my learning of art in the slightest. There are NO strengths to this class other than assembling all of the art majors into a room. These are the classes that cause the perception that the art major is a joke. I could have been more protective if I was told to go into Haas each week and write a report on a book I picked out and studied. Heres how I propose it be improved. \r\n\r\n- Get rid of this class altogether in its current form. Instead, create a weekly class that brings together art majors and allows them to ask questions and speak with current grad students or professors about what a career in art is like. Have each student bring in a few questions to ask. \r\n- Make Critiques actually critiques. Bring in grad students or art majors to critique work, and break up the class so that students can have more time to actually get feedback on their work. Dont have critiques that last for 10 minutes and give the artist no actual feedback.\r\n- Create a system of having each student find books to discuss in class, if there is a formal class. Have them go to Haas or Sterling and find books that relate to their major and have them discuss them, rather than subjecting students to boring readings that are written in hard-to-understand art world jargon. \r\n- Have assignments that encourage students to make work or bond with fellow art majors. Have a painting and a graphic design major work together to find something, or have them switch processes. Just something that isnt once a semester and actually encourages creativity. \r\n- Change the wording on new or existing assignments that clarifies what is expected of the student so that Jonathan cant arbitrarily change the assignment and hand out grades as he sees fit. \r\n- Make the class fun or engaging in some way. \r\n\r\nThese are just a few suggestions. There are many more that address specific problems with certain readings or classes, but these address the major problems with the seminar. This class was absolute garbage and was a waste of a credit at the University. Lisa, if you're reading this, please take these criticisms into consideration. Art majors, if you're reading this, try everything in your power to avoid this class.",
    "Course is not super structured and is mostly the professor rambling. Not really sure why its required for the art major or what the point of it was. Mostly a lot of random discussions and projects that didnt feel super productive.",
    "I like how we covered some interesting discussion topics in the readings such as the difference between camp and kitsch, and queer identity in art. However, usually discussion quickly devolved into Professor Weinberg going on a long-winded monologue for most of class (which would often run ten minutes past the end time). The emulation project was fun and we got to delve into a specific artists work. Overall, I dont really see the point of this class.",
    "The weaknesses of this course was that instead of it being like a seminar it was more like a lecture where the student weren't really able to participate a lot during class. But we received a lot of good feedback about our work and writing which was valuable.",
    "Honestly, this course often felt like a waste of time, and I wish that it wasn't mandatory for all art majors. Even though this class is required for all art majors, including computing in the arts majors, the course itself focused on preparing more traditional art majors for the fine art world. In particular, the course heavily was geared to helping painters, not graphic designers, sculptors, or photographers. The vast majority of the examples of artwork from the art history canon we studied in this class were paintings, the model artist statements we were shown were also of painters, and the critiques were better for the paintings shown. Speaking of critiques, they were for artwork we had created in other art classes, so the critiques in this course did not feel useful and even felt repetitive and redundant at times.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while this course is a seminar and even has \"seminar\" in its course title, we had little discussion in class; instead, most of class time was more in the format of mini lectures. There is nothing wrong with lectures, but because the course was marketed as a seminar, I was let down by the use of our class time, especially as the professor often went on tangents that had nothing to do with the art theory or art history that was the topic of the week. Also, I'm not sure if having this class at night is the best time for learning: students frequently had conflicts with extracurriculars and other class commitments. \r\n\r\nThat said, there were some strengths to the course too. We were assigned some interesting assignments like writing a review of an art exhibition, notes on a MFA student critique, and a final project in which we emulate a contemporary artist; however, I wish we had gotten more guidance and feedback on how to approach these assignments before we read the comments on the graded works.",
    "The strength is that we are exposed to a wide variety of artists and encouraged to be more involved with Yale's own art community. The weakness of the course was its lack of depth. Because we covered so many things in the course, I felt like I was unable to dive into any one topic."

    "Totally. Jonathan is a riot and class is never dull. The major assignments are open-ended and challenging yet flexible.",
    "If you're not an art major, don't even shop this class. \r\nBut if you are an art major, I guess I would recommend this if you're not willing to take Critical Theory. Hopefully you can find friends that will make this class more bearable.",
    "Take it if it is required of you. You will learn more about your own and your classmates practices, and hopefully gain some new knowledge and perspectives from the teacher.",
    "Absolutely not, but this isn't up to me. This is a nonsense course run by a professor who arbitrarily changes assignment descriptions and hands out grades seemingly at random. I will abstain from posting specific examples of my own work in this review to protect my identity, but I will instead talk about some of the frankly stupid and waste of time assignments. \r\n\r\nThe Critique review:\r\n\r\nJonathan changed the assignment after it was turned in, citing that students had to describe the structure of the critique and the atmosphere of the room. The assignment outlined that a student was to \"Sit in on a graduate student critique in the art school and write up some notes (500 words) about what occurred. The schedule of graduate student critiques is issued by the Art School at the beginning of the week\". Rather than simply grading my notes, Jonathan added in random requirements and gave me a poor grade, even though fitting in full notes for a critique into 500 words in obscene. I took 500 words worth of notes within the first half of the review, and opted to cut out words to condense my paper to fit the assignment. Rather than recognizing the flaw of the assignment, Jonathan bullishly enforced his iron will and gave out poor grades. \r\n\r\nJournal: \r\n\r\nFirst of all, expecting students to keep a journal is slightly biased towards painting and graphic design. That's fine. But expecting a comprehensive and word-packed ART JOURNAL is absolute nonsense. Nobody is walking through galleries or reading books and writing essays on what they're finding. We're Yale students, and don't have hours upon hours to do independent research on art processes. I find new artists and collect examples of the work they make. According to Jonathan, that was incomplete, DESPITE the assignment outlining that the journal could be a collection of photographs of work. \r\n\r\nThere are other flaws in this course that I can address, especially within the assignments. Im afraid that nitpicking every single assignment wouldnt be worth my time. This sentiment is only furthered by the fact that the course is required. Art majors are required to take either this or another course with Jonathan that I assume is just as non-directed and unhelpful. I would strongly advise ANY art major to speak with Lisa and see if there is any way around taking Junior Seminar. This class, hands down, was the worst class Ive taken, and I hate that it made me reconsider being an art major.",
    "if Youre an art major you have to take it, but other wise dont bother.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone who doesnt have to take it.",
