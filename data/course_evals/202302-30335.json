It is relevant to the career that I wish to follow, in medicine, because many mechanisms in the body, whether proteins or at a larger scale, can be understood better by viewing our bodies as the latest stage in a long evolutionary process, rather than a single \"still image\" in the present time. I learned that two theses that Darwin posited in The Origin of Species were that all species evolved from a common ancestor, and natural selection. Moreover, I learned about genetic drift, gene flow, and other factors that affect the propagation of genetic traits in a population. Another key piece of information was the use of Yamanaka factors to make pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which was a groundbreaking mechanism.",
