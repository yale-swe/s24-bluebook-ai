I developed a reasonably sound understanding of microeconomic theory and the ability to do important calculations such as maximizing profit, or finding supply and demand equilibria. I also learned important, if basic, economic terminology and how to use it.",
                "I developed the skill of understanding basic economics.",
                "I took AP Microeconomics in high school. We covered the material that took me an entire year in the span of about a month. In this class, I was able to learn about consumer theory, producer theory, and overall supply and demand with a direct focus on mathematics. Professor Koker also took time to ensure that we understood the context that these concepts existed in and how it might apply to our life in hiring employees, being hired, or tackling the stock market.",
                "My understanding of microeconomics was solidified through new mathematical techniques and also a more in-depth discussion of microeconomic concepts. I learned to think critically on a micro-level.",

                "Strengths: Comprehensive problem sets, amazing office hrs with \"TAs\" \r\nWeaknesses: Lack of structure, four problem sets (I would have appreciated more), no teaching of calculus, disorganized, disengaging",
                "Strengths: Clear information, information that is usually difficult to understand was presented in a way that was easy to learn and grasp the concept and connection to economics.",
                "This course is well-organized and provides various examples that help understand the material.",
                "You learn a lot, and very fast. I feel that I have definitely come away understanding how businesses make decisions and how the economy operates. Tolga also keeps lectures engaging and relatively fun. However, I felt that this course, which is intended for beginners, went too quickly and it was very hard to stay on top of a lot of complex concepts (especially in the second half). Tolga sometimes does not explain the mathematical side of the class that well, even though that makes up the bulk of exams, and this means going to office hours is a must - the TAs are fantastic though.",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe professor is the greatest strength of this course. Tolga is a phenomenal teacher and made each and every complex concept easy to understand with complex examples. Also, the office hours were highly helpful in understanding the content.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nNo real weakness",
                "The course teaches content that feels practical. As someone who struggles in math, this course did a very good job of teaching the steps of the math with a connection to why each step is necessary. Every class had material that was deeply connected to content from the last class and classes before then. Sometimes the questions on problem sets would throw very large curveballs that demand you seek help from an instructor. Thankfully, the TA's and the professor were readily available to help.",
                "I felt like some of the mathematical aspects of the course were perhaps not explained too well, and I would have benefited from greater guidance in these aspects."

                "No, I would not recommend this course to another student. I really struggled in this course to understand the material because classes were unorganized and Tolga's 10 minute rants about shoes, girlfriends, etc. where disengaging and disorienting. I also selected this class because I thought it was for students without a calculus background and the expectation was I would learn this calculus during Friday class. However, this calculus was never taught. Instead, our 9am classes on Fridays were rants and reviews of the Tues and Thurs' classes. Every thing I learned in this course was because of the students Tolga enlisted to hold office hours.",
                "Yes. For students who are not strong in math, this course was amazing because Tolga made the math easy to understand and also easy by connecting it to economics.",
                "I would recommend because Tolga is great at explaining and this course is so interactive!",
                "If you want to come away with a genuinely useful and not wildly difficult QR credit, then most certainly take this course. It is fun, engaging and genuinely useful. However, while it is hardly the most difficult course you will take, it is not a gut - be prepared to do a bit of work. This pays off though - at the end of the semester, you will look back and not regret taking it.",
                "Yes, Tolga does a great job at explaining introductory  econ in clearly understandable terms.",
                "Yes, the seminar style of the course I found very engaging, and Tolga was a very good lecturer.",
                "Yes. Quantitative microeconomics, although taken for my major, felt like a course that anyone can take. It eases you into mathematical concepts, covers broad strokes of microeconomic theories, and also goes into detail on certain topics. If I knew anyone who wanted to learn foundational economics for their own good, I would recommend this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it does not involve any difficult calculus concepts, but rather simple algebra which makes this class fun.",
                "I would definitely recommend it to those wanting a foundational level of Economics.",
                "If you need to take Econ 108/110, I highly recommend Tolga. Read the chapters, then read them again. Come to class prepared, and Tolga will put it all in perspective. With multiple TA office hours each week, plus another set of OH with Tolga, there's a lot of availability for you to make sure you know what you're doing."
