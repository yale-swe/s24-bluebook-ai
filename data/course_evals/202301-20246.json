                "I learned a great deal about the political, economic, and cultural forces that shaped many Eastern European countries, especially in terms of how geopolitical tensions led to the formation, dissolution, and annexation of different swaths of land. We started off with the breakup of Austro-Hungarian Empire\/decline of Habsburg monarchy, went through WWI, interwar, WWII, Stalinism, Brezhnev Doctrine, Hungarian Uprising, Prague Spring, Berlin Wall\/Cold War, and ended with the formation of the European Union and Russia's most recent invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",

                "This course completely reshaped my understanding about East European history in the 20th century, but especially from the interwar years and World War II. It helped open my eyes to how American schools teach European history with a western lens, often obscuring the perspectives of East Europeans. I'm so glad that I took this course and gained a more accurate understanding of the events.",

                "Since this was my first lecture-only style class without presentations and slideshows to look over again after each lecture, I had to learn how to be efficient and sift through which information I should be recording as notes versus which information is interesting but unnecessary to take as notes. My hand can only move so fast and can obviously not keep up with talking. Additionally, this course taught me how to skim through and highlight the readings, since I can safely say that I have never had a course with even nearly this much reading.",

I learned how to make arguments about contingency and history as a result of Prof Snyders lecturing styles. I learned about the process of selecting the most important events in historical narrative from the chronology.",
                "I developed a good understanding of historical trends in the region of Eastern Europe from 1914 onwards. I like how Professor Snyder does not treat 1914 as a demarcation and talks about pre-1914 national and imperial histories.\r\nProfessor Snyder likes to open his lectures with acute questions or observations about the lecture topic. They are often thought-provoking and leave me in thought even after lecture.\r\nThere was a considerable amount of reading for this course. I became a better reader.",

                "Fantastic lectures",
                "The lectures were incredible, easily some of my favorite during my time at Yale. The lecture hall would often be silent for a few seconds after the end of class as we all hurried to complete our handwritten notes. I appreciated that people were all taking notes by hand and not distracted by phones -- it helped me stay focused, and I had to be judicious in what material I could take down. That said, beyond the lectures, I didn't feel like I got a ton out of the class in discussion sections or our exams. It felt like the kind of course where you get out what you put in -- the lectures are a great foundation, but I'm not sure how much I'll actually remember in a few years given how dense many of the readings were. I'd prefer a shorter reading list and a consensus in discussion section that we'd all gotten through the readings. Instead, there were so many assigned readings that our conversations stayed surface-level since so few people had done the same selection.",
                "The lectures were truly excellent, engaging and informative, and the readings were mostly very good, though towards the end of the class they began to lack variety and become increasingly irrelevant to the content of lectures. The actual graded content of the class was another story; teaching fellows often seemed to have no idea of what role they were expected to play, and could answer few questions, regarding the content or course logistics more generally, unless those answers had already been provided in class. The lack of clarity regarding graded work consistently left students scrambling at the last minute, whether to study content with which they had limited familiarity or to complete assignments whose parameters they had previously misunderstood.",
                "Prof isn't very accessible but the course is extremely well taught and deeply interesting.",
                "I loved the outline and key terms handouts given at the start of each lecture as they were very helpful in knowing what the important points of the lecture were and made the lecture easier to follow, although Professor Snyder is pretty clear as is. Professor Snyder also makes the course incredibly interesting and is so skillful at tying together main themes and events across time. I also liked the country by country organization of the course as it allowed you to really see what struggles the country went through and its ideological development process over time. A weakness of the course is the sheer amount of reading that is assigned on a weekly basis, which was sometimes uneven across weeks. Some weeks had 400+ pages books plus readings from the course packet which seemed kind of unnecessary. Nevertheless, I think you really only need them for the chronology (which will creep up on you) and the discussion sections, although you should also know a handful so you can name drop them in the exams. They do help your understanding of the lecture material, but often times Professor Snyder fills you in a bit enough so you can follow along. One thing that I disliked, although it sounded nice in theory, was having lectures outside. The weather was nice but it was just so uncomfortable to take notes on the floor and it was quite difficult to hear.",
                "Strength is Professor Snyder. no weakness.",
                "Strenghts - Snyder is a phenomenal lecturer. Every class feels like a movie. Weakness - the chronology is a bit of a pain and feels slightly useless. I think I'd prefer writing a paper that challenged some of the ideas I learned and notions more than simply selecting dates and justifying them",
                "Strengths: Professor Snyders lectures are AMAZING. Theyre jam packed with information, but extremely riveting throughout. Similarly, the course work is doable. There was a midterm and final which were easier than I expected. They arent multiple choice type, so just focus on truly grasping the material.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The only one I can think of is too much reading. But, think about it like this you dont have to do all the reading to do well. So, dont let this stop you from taking the course. Do what you can and you should be fine!",
                "Snyder's lecture style is incredible--at the end of each class, I often felt a needed to take a moment to reflect on the whirlwind of everything that I'd learned. Given his preeminent status though, he was pretty difficult to get in contact with and did not have much of a chance to build a personal rapport with students (not many office hours)\r\n\r\nI liked the chronology assignment, but did not feel that the exam assessment format was the most conducive to understanding the history of this region in the comprehensive way that snyder desired (perhaps essays would be better)",
                "Snyder lectures without presentations and talks somewhat quietly: the difficulty of following him and absorbing the onslaught of information is the only weakness of the course. Everything else is near perfect.",
                "Strengths: very good at keeping me engaged, very energic and interesting lectures.\r\n\r\nCons:sometimes hard to hear",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Professor Synder's lectures were incredible. He does such a good job of covering the material in an interesting way. \r\n- The guest lecturers were amazing as well. I particularly enjoyed the two lectures that Professor Shore covered.\r\n- The material itself is incredibly important. It can be difficult to create a course for a survey class when the subject matter is so broad, but I think that the syllabus was well-curated to gain a good understanding of the entire region. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The readings for certain periods were quite dense while other periods felt light. It was hard to keep up with the readings throughout the semester, especially when some lectures asked us to finish entire books. \r\n- Section was incredibly hit or miss. I heard from some other students with a different section leader that they were able to learn a lot from section, but my section was terrible for most of the semester. My section leader left 2\/3 of the way through the semester, and even the first 2\/3 that she was there for, she gave very little valuable input. We had to rely on ourselves to talk about important dates and events, and she never corrected us even if we said misleading information.",
                "Strengths: all the readings are selected carefully and are really important (please do them!); overall, the material is extremely interesting and important, especially for any humanities\/social science major. Professor Snyder is my best lecturer so far - when he talks, you can't stop listening. Weaknesses: technology:\/\/ PDF reading packet had all the readings without any numeration, making it hard to look for readings every time. Also, I personally lacked writing papers, which I think could add a lot to the experience. There is one big final assignment (chronology) - please start writing it as early as possible!! Trust me. \r\nWorkload is also really high - not necessarily a weakness, but be aware of it.",
                "Lectures, readings, assignments were all strengths. No weakness.",
                "Strengths: extremely relevant topic, very knowledgable professor, topics and ideas that matter for other parts of the world (democracy, freedom of speech, autarky, socialism, foreign policy, etc), interesting lectures. Weaknesses: the reading can be a little overwhelming - but don't look at it as an \"either\/or\" kind of thing; you gain a lot from doing the readings even if you do 70% instead of 100% (and the lectures really are more engaging if you come in prepared) so don't give up. Also, not a weakness in my eyes, but less focus on Russia than I would've thought.",
                "Strengths: Snyder is a brilliant lecturer, by far the best set of survey lectures I had at Yale. There are also handouts given out every lecture outlining the day's material, which are great resources for note-taking + studying for exams. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not a weakness, but this is a survey course covering 100 years of history in a major region of the world, so the bigger picture is usually emphasized over going into depth in any one particular area.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Snyder is an incredible lecturer and the readings were quite interesting. Weaknesses: the exams were poorly structured and required lots of memorization.",
                "Timothy Snyder is an amazing lecturer.\r\n\r\nWay too much reading that is often unenforceable",
                "Amazing course. No faults",

                "strengths: engaging, relevant, thought-provoking, challenging, interesting\r\nweaknesses: n\/a",
                "Amazing class. Snyder is such a fantastic  lecturer. The information was clear and the exams felt very fair. I learned so much and enjoyed going to class.",
                "super interesting course, lectures were phenomenal, readings supplemented lectures well, discussion section was good",
                "The strength of this class is definitely in Professor Snyder--he does a great job of explaining some of the most important events that shape Eastern Europe throughout the last 100 years, and his lectures are always interesting to listen to. Sections are a bit dull overall though.",
                "The lectures are great but the readings are quite long. The course organization wasn't great at the beginning but it got better as the course progressed. It would be good if some of the most important readings were highlighted. Exams are fair and the final chronology is interesting.",
                "The strengths are the professor! The weakness is the amount of reading that is expected of the student.",
                "I though the TAs were a little disconnected from the professor and each other, with different grading policies occasionally",
                "There are paper handouts given before each lecture that have key terms, events, and people, which was useful when studying for exams. However, often times not all of these terms would come up during lecture. Additionally, to people who are not familiar with these Eastern European languages, these names when spoken out loud can be pretty confusing. I think that simply repeating each name slowly a second time would really help some students like myself get it down and find it in the paper handouts.",
                "The course was well-taught and had insightful texts well worth the read, but not a lot of challenging assignments (would have liked an essay or two) and a little too much focus on memorizing dates and people.",
                "Good",
                "Strengths: Prof. Snyder is an incredible lecturer, and he simply feeds you a narrative in a beautiful way that makes lectures fly by. The first half of the course in particular helped me think about this period I thought I was familiar with in a new way. \r\nWeaknesses: the timeline assignment at the end of the semester felt really unnecessary. Some of the readings are unnecessarily dense and don't get discussed in lecture. The second half of the course was not very well organized.",
                "Engaging material, interesting lectures, great professor. Could improve: more specificity on what exam will be beforehand.",
                "Strengths - very interesting lectures and material\r\nWeaknesses - syllabus very unclear",
                "Professor Snyder is an INCREDIBLE lecturer",
                "Professor Snyder's lectures are engaging. However, it can be difficult to hear him if you are not near the front of the lecture hall or someone is talking nearby. If he had a better microphone, this issue would be fixed.",
                "I loved this class. Professor Snyder is an incredible lecturer, super organized and compelling to listen to. The exams were scary to study for, but were a great opportunity to showcase what we had learned and never ended up being too challenging (maybe they were slightly too long for a 50 minute time slot). There was a LOT of reading for this class, and I thought it was a little impossible to actually complete it all, but I never felt that any of it was busy work, which I appreciated.",
                "Strengths: This course is great for anyone wanting to learn more about Eastern Europe's modern history or to expand their knowledge. Background knowledge can be helpful but not necessary. The lectures are great and discussion sections are usually helpful in reviewing content. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are a lot of readings, which aren't necessary for tests but are necessary for the final chronology. It's recommended to start the chronology early because it's a very long assignment.",
                "Strengths: Great professor, engaging and interesting lectures, and assignments that apply knowledge\r\nWeaknesses: Unmanageable reading load",
                "The course material is fascinating, and the subjects described are important to the region. Everything we learned felt important in one way or another. Guest lectures were especially strong, and hearing different perspectives was valuable. The workload in terms of reading, however, felt very high for an introductory course.",
                "Strengths: prof snyders lectures are just phenomenal. The subject matter is fascinating. Weaknesses: too much reading - disincentivizes doing any or much of it. Also prof Snyder - though one of the best lecturers I have had - should give some more advanced thought about lecture organization and signposting. Even with the outlines, it was sometimes difficult to follow the flow of the lecture.",
                "Professor Snyder delivers his lectures in a terse and fluent manner. I am often shocked by the amount of historical detail he covers in a 50 minute lecture when I look at my notes.\r\nHis readings are pretty interesting as well. \r\nI hoped for more readings on the Soviet Union in the post-Stalin era. What were the circumstances in which Kruschchev, Brehznev, and Gorbachev rose to power?",
                "I feel that the teacher knows the material well but for someone just jumping into the subject there's not really a way to be eased in without some prior knowledge.",
                "Professor Snyder is an excellent lecturer, as is Professor Shore, who gave a couple lectures throughout the class. The readings are interesting, but there is quite a lot of it. Almost every aspect of the class is excellent with just one glaring weakness. Having the readings on that one pdf is incredibly inconvenient, and I certainly would have done a larger proportion of the reading if it had been easier to access. Every other class I have taken at Yale has had the readings organized on Canvas and broken down by week. As if it weren't frustrating enough to have to scroll to the exact spot in the packet, the readings are sometimes out of order or don't match the syllabus--it's at least one year out of date. Surely it's worth the effort for somebody to break the reading into separate files and organize them by week on Canvas compared to the time spent by every single student in the class to have to look through the giant packet to find the correct reading every time.",

                "Yes! My favorite class I have taken. Challenging but interesting",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this class if you're excited about fascinating lectures that shed light on present-day political dynamics and are ok with a lot of reading (or with pretending that you've done a lot of reading, which was definitely the route that the majority of my section took!). I might have enjoyed auditing this course because I found the lectures much more interesting than the readings or discussion section, but I'm still glad that I took it.",
                "I would reccomend that a fellow student take this class, meet with their assigned TA before the drop deadline, and switch to auditing if they feel their TA will not be understanding of the challenging logistical situation. The lectures are fascinating and very well delivered, and the content is extremely important for anyone to know, but with so much of the graded work ultimately left in the hands of TAs with no clear roadmap, caution is distinctly warranted.",
                "Yes! It is a lot of reading but I loved it regardless.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student and would say that they should absolutely take it before graduation. It informs you of all the geopolitical tensions that have existed and continue to exist in Eastern Europe and in the world. Students should take advantage of the ability to listen to Professor Snyder's lectures while they have the opportunity.",
                "Yes -- this is the best course I have taken at Yale.",
                "Strongly recommend if you want to learn more about Eastern Europe. The exams are fair and straightforward. Be prepared to do some reading",
                "Yes, it gives you a comprehensive analysis of the area and time period by one of the top historians on it.",
                "yes-be prepared for a substantial amount of work but you will learn a lot",
                "Yes! I learned so much, about some of the most important things to learn and think about.",
                "Absolutely. Amazing overall class, I fell like I learned a lot.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to any other student interested in history. Professor Synder is one of the best lecturers I have ever had and I learned so much through this course. The workload is not that heavy, even though there are a lot of readings, and the tests are not particularly difficult.",
                "Yes! Hundred percent. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale so far. The content is amazing, just like Snyder and (most) TFs.",
                "Absolutely! Snyder is one of the best lectures Ive had.",
                "Yes!! Professor Snyder is so good. Sometimes Marci Shore subs in for the lectures and she is just the best!",
                "I would! It's a great opportunity to study one of today's most important regions under one of the world's most knowledgable professors. That said, it's a very \"traditional\" history lecture; lots of focus on treaties, dates, warfare (to some extent), (male) politicians, and so on, so I'm not sure it is for everyone (long story short: a little dry). Also, it is very much what you make it. You'll get a lot more out of it if you do the readings.",
                "Yes, especially to STEM majors\/people who might not take very many history courses. This is the one to take.",
                "Yes, would recommend - Prof. Snyder is amazing!",
                "Yes, even if just for Timothy Snyder",
                "Yes absolutely. Snyder really knows his stuff and this is history done right. Definitely worth your time.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes!!! Everyone should take this course. I learned so much and was left feeling shocked that I had not known all of this important history before the class. Definitely take it, it was my favorite class I have ever taken and Snyder is a very articulate and great lecture.",
                "Yes because it s a great survey introduction course to the Eastern Europe region",
                "Yes, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale because of the curriculum and professor's teaching",
                "Yes! I loved the course. One of my favorites at Yale.",
                "YES. this course was awesome so so so interesting going to lecture was like going to story time",
                "I would because I think it is worth taking at least one class from Professor Snyder, especially considering the current situation with Ukraine. There are a lot of readings assigned in the course, but you can still do well on the exams without doing many of them, as long as you take good notes. The chronology is definitely a pain to complete at the end, but it this relatively straightforward (although it is still open-ended, so it is unclear as to what the grading is actually based on). Sections (like other classes) aren't the most engaging, but even so I think the class is worth taking if you have an interest in the time period and \/ or geographical region!",
                "Yes! Great lectures -  you learn so much. Prof Snyder is great and the TFs are also very knowledgeable and interested in the topics. Would recommend (the readings are a lot though).",
                "Yes! It's very well taught and the professor is very engaging!",
                "Yes, this is an understatedly important topic and professor Snyder is an excellent historian, which translates to his teaching",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to students interested in history, regardless of their particular focus. This course taught me a lot about summarizing the main points of large amounts of readings, as well as taught me to focus less on the dates and more on the shifts in ideology, culture, events, and the cause and effects of each of them. I am certain any history major will gain valuable skills that will help them with their other courses.",
                "Yes. Snyder is for better or for worse a leading global voice in this subject, and you will come out of this with a solid understanding of everything between Berlin and Moscow from the past hundred years. Its also a relatively easy class and one with streamlined lectures that are still very lively.",
                "Yes",
                "If you take one history class at Yale, this should be it. Do not miss out on this tour de force that will leave you with so much food for thought about contemporary politics and society.",
                "Yes, coming from someone who was always taught history from a Western point of view, it is interesting to see how the same events unfolded in the East.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in history. It is a key region and time period",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes, the importance of contemporary Eastern European history cannot be understated amidst current events. This course is very accessible to students who have yet to take a history course at Yale.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class. Everyone should take a Snyder class at Yaleone of the best speakers I've ever had the privilege of listening to, and I learned a ton.",
                "Yes, Professor Snyder is a fabulous lecturer and you will learn a lot about how Eastern Europe has facilitated the course of world history",
                "Yes but theres lots of reading but the readings are interesting",
                "I  1000% recommend this class to other students. Professor Snyder is very knowledgeable and makes lectures engaging. I recommend taking notes and following along with the lecture outlines. There are a lot of readings on the syllabus but they aren't essential to understanding the material, though they are very useful for the final chronology.",
                "Yes! It is is a great survey course in Eastern European history. The professor is amazing and the class is well-structured. Be wary of the reading load, and don't get behind. If you do these things, it is not difficult to excel.",
                "Yes, any student interested in the history of the region or during this time period would be well served by taking this course.",
                "Yes. Prof Snyder is amazing and this is a wonderful survey course. You will also learn about some of the most influential events of the 20th century - just through a non U.S. centered lens (a good thing).",
                "Absolutely - a comprehensive look at Eastern Europe made simple and digestible. I walked in knowing nothing, and came out with a richer understanding of the Bloodlands that have been Eastern Europe, and the peace it is longing to attain for itself.",
                "Yes. It is a great history course that one can get plenty out of if they put in the time and effort.",
                "Yes, I feel that this is a class that would required interest in the subject along with some prior knowledge to really have a full grasp on it but if someone were to be lacking in those things or available time to complete the readings then I would not.",
                "This is a must-take at Yale if you're thinking about majoring in history or something similar, or if you aren't but just want a taste. I don't mean this just because Timothy Snyder is so well-known, but because his lectures are excellent and the subject material is very important to understanding crucial events in world history. It's a survey class that feels mostly targeted at first years or sophomores, or anyone who hasn't taken many history classes, but that doesn't mean it's not worth it if you are already taking advanced history classes.\r\n\r\nThe one hesitation is that most of the readings are organized in one pdf that goes on for hundreds of pages, which needless to say is incredibly inconvenient. If you do take the class, you should rent or buy or check out from the library as much as possible at the beginning so you don't have to use the pdf, which by the way, doesn't entirely match the syllabus. The class is so good that it's worth the frustration of the pdf, but be prepared.",
