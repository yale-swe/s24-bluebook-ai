This class does an incredible job of balancing skills work (literally learning how to use a new tool, printing, toning, etc.) with conceptual work that allows you to leave with a body of work that is grounded in both technical form and creative/personal content.",

Benjamin is a great lecturer, so it would've been great to have enough time to learn everything he had to offer. Guest visits were a huge strength of this course as well and it would be great to have one or two more.",
                "A more concrete syllabus with explicit due dates would have been helpful. I also think it would have been nice to be able to travel outside of the classroom to see artist portfolios. However, I did learn so much in such a short period of time that the professor succeeded largely in this way.",

This class is not for the faint of heart, you should expect to spend a lot of time with the camera. I would suggest you take other photography classes before so that you have experiencing developing/printing.",
