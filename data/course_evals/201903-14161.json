   "comments": [
    "There were many things that I learned from this course. The first and highly important skill is the writing. The feedback to each of the assignments was very clear, and I think this allowed for continuous improvement in each assignment. The second and most important skills is teaching you how to think beyond a superficial perspective about this important issue. It is more complicated than saying \"prisons are bad for health.\" There are many ways to dissect this statement, and we evaluate exactly what are the good and the bad of different methodologies we read. I learned so much about the issue of prisons and health. This topic is very diverse, and we cover a lot during the course. If it were up to me, I would make this a one year course and continue to learn about different themes of the class. Lastly, this course made me realize the importance of history. It is not as simple as saying \"we should get rid of all prisons\"; there are different historical frameworks by which we can evaluate this. As someone who claims to be data-driven, this course made me realize the importance of seeing above and beyond data, particularly looking at both the history of the issue and the impact to individuals. Overall, it was an excellent learning experience.",
    "I gained insight into the early history of the United States prison system (post-Revolutionary War) and how its purported motives and design have evolved with the rise of mass incarceration (as well as other historic events, such as the eugenics movement, the criminalization of mental illness, and more.) I learned how to effectively choose and analyze a primary source within its historical context, and how to build a nuanced argument for a larger thesis.",
    "I strengthened my critical and analytic literature reading skills.",
    "Though I knew that incarceration was a problem in modern times, it was great to have nuanced views and perspectives of the development and progression of the carceral state. I though examining various issues that affected various people who were incarcerated throughout history was really interesting and eye-opening (e.g. the chaining of pregnant women during childbirth, for instance). Though there it was a seminar style, the readings gave an in-depth look at all of these issues and are worth paying close attention to.",
    "I think it gave me a lot of insight into incarceration pretty generally. I'm more aware of the histories of the penitentiary, the reasons for their establishments, and how the transformed into modern day prison and jail systems. There was also a good chunk of sociological theory in there regarding incarceration which was fun. Trained skills on how to analyze primary documents and how to create connections between disparate themes.",
    "I enhanced my analysis skills and learned a lot about the history of incarceration in the United States and how health intersects",
    "I developed a rich knowledge base of case studies and key issues\/tensions and historical events\/processes throughout the history of health in U.S. carceral institutions. I appreciate how the course proposed a 'deeper dive' at a distinct issue each week rather than a comprehensive chronological survey of the field and the resulting feeling of emphasis on understanding and engaging with analytical frameworks, scholarly methodologies, and enduring issues\/tensions. I also loved how the course facilitated (and provided examples of) engagement with and integration of interdisciplinary scholarship and diverse scholarly forms; our sources spanned history (including secondary scholarship and primary sources such as historical journal and newspaper articles, reports) medical anthropology, medical ethics, legal studies, public health, etc.",
    "Engaging with different types of text and sources."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class had very interesting topics, but I feel like the selected readings could have been better. Many of them would just repeat the same information over and over again.",
    "The strengths of the course are professor Rich and the carefully curated list of readings and topics covered in class. The readings were always engaging and filled with immense knowledge. Professor Rich also was great at being able to dissect a statement, when the room went quite at times. I do not think there are many weaknesses. It would be amazing to be able to cover more in depth the ethics and philosophy of this issue; however, this is beyond the scope of the course. Additionally, a two hour seminar might not be enough time to cover these additional topics. I think the course is very well organized, and highly conducive of learning. The last strengths were some of my classmates, who were very passionate about the topic. It was incredible to hear how much they cared and their thought processes on some of the issues.",
    "Strengths are definitely Dr. Rich's engaging and thoughtful teaching style, diverse syllabi, and assignments that help you develop writing and research skills that are useful for the final research paper. We had an opportunity to visit the Medical Humanities Library & peruse special collections, as well as present our own research topics to our classmates. Dr. Rich provided a series of different working environments, helpful particularly for students who might be more comfortable working in smaller groups.\r\n\r\nThere are no weaknesses. However, it would have been interesting to read more Foucalt or original texts by theorists instead of their current applications.",
    "I was kind of in the dark for most of the semester about what my final grade was going to be as there were no numerical grades on Canvas. I also really liked in the last seminar when we broke off into small groups to read and talk about the questions we submitted the day before and then discussed as a class.",
    "I enjoyed the initial group work before and during class that enabled all students to speak in class. But I wish we could have done more work and discussion focused on the content of the readings. I liked the structure of the class though, because it kept people fairly engaged.",
    "Strengths: I mean, wildly interesting. The subject matter grapples with a lot of heavy stuff, and I think Professor Rich does a good job of listening to people (but also she's not afraid to push back on ideas, which is good!) \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think it might've been fun to work with pieces that are more boldly prison abolitionist.",
    "Strengths: interesting topic, prof rich is great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: got monotonous, discussion lagged sometimes",
    "I think this course has too much reading assigned and not enough critical analysis to go along with it.",
    "The course's strengths include great, diverse readings and writing assignments. As for weaknesses, our long seminar meetings sometimes felt unorganized or like we struggled to maintain class engagement and student-student discourse, although I liked the small group discussions with concrete activities\/products to bring back to the full group.",
    "Very interesting topic area. Class discussion could be more structured around reading responses etc."

   "comments": [
    "I think you should definitely take this course if you care about the issue of prisons and health. It is a very complicated subject, yet the course does a great job of being able to dissect this subject. If at all interested, you should take it. The readings have been my favorite readings at my time at Yale. You simply learn so much! Also, Professor Rich is excellent. I think she manage to curate one of the best classes on campus.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to students who want to learn more about the history of prisons and use this history to inform their own opinions on current reform\/abolition\/working from the inside movements.",
    "Yes if you are interested in this very niche topic or are willing to branch out intellectually.",
    "I would! Though the style is a seminar style, there is a lot of room for learning about the carceral system and carceral state even if you don't know much about its history. Readings are very good and I recommend that you actually delve into those in order to take full advantage of the class. Professor Rich is very understanding and very kind and willing to engage in a lot of conversation around any and all topics we discussed in class.",
    "Yes! I had a lot of fun, it was definitely my favorite course that I took this semester.",
    "Def recommend, I really liked prof Rich and the course is interesting and engaging. Topic is really important and its generally a typical hshm seminar, work-load wise.",
    "Yes! Even if you're not a hshm or history major, this topic is important for every citizen involved in social and legal policy (ie everyone). The course itself has wonderful readings and essays, a supportive and warm professor (who organizes course content well), and a more manageable workload than many other high-level history seminars. It felt accessible, enriching for my own interdisciplinary intellectual interests, and richly foundational",
    "Yes, interesting topic."
