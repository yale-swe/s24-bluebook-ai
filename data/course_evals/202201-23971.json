                "This was a great course! I learned so much about the trends of western philosophical thought starting with Descartes and ending in the present day. I think I have gained some new skill in writing and thinking about these texts, as well as considering them critically with regard to my own beliefs.",
                "By receiving and considering the professor's feedback, I developed my own ability to dissect and criticize my philosophical arguments/responses to the philosophers we read about.",

This class provided foundations in Western philosophical thought by exploring various authors, texts, and schools of thought."

                "This course was excellent. I appreciated how the professor managed to balance both allowing for complex back and forth discussions while also helping to steer us towards the right answer (if any such thing exists!). This did wonders in helping me construct a greater understanding of the texts.",
                "I believe that this course could have taken more time to dissect the ideas of certain individuals and be more structured to cover certain areas which could be neglected during discussion. Other than that, the interactive aspect of this class was thoroughly enjoyable and I have nothing but praise for this class.",
                "I think this is a very strong courseperhaps there was too much Kant for my tastes, but I think thats probably just a personal preference.",
                "Some philosophers who were left out of DRST 004/moved to other DS courses (i.e. Hegel, Freud) might have paired well with the Philosophy track while bolstering understanding in other tracks. Freud came up OFTEN in Literature, for example, but I had little experience reading his work directly. Hegel would've been especially helpful for relating to Beauvoir and Kant/Fichte/German idealism in general. Of course, it's also difficult to fit in so much in one year.",
                "Strengths: Covers a wide breadth of thought, provides strong foundation for further study, and is able to appeal to a diverse array of people\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The texts can be overwhelmingboth in terms of individual complexity as well the total amount that is covered over the course of the semester"

            "comments": [
                "Yes I would recommend this class to another student. The texts we read and discussions we had were enlightening, anyone with an interest in philosophy or thinking critically about the world around them would greatly benefit from this class. While I theoretically love the idea of not receiving grades on ones papers, I wish this was complimented by more direct/relevant feedback on how we were doing within the class. Perhaps that would defeat the point of distancing from grades, but I ironically believe the lack of grades brings their importance more to mind.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think my understanding of modern philosophical thought is much improved, and the course allowed me to think more critically about how I understand the world and my place in it.",
                "I would highly recommend DS philosophy to anyone curious about philosophy and the humanities. taking this class has made me a well-rounded and well-read scholar and the insights I have gained in this class will help me in my academic life at Yale and beyond!",
                "This is a DS class, so I cant really recommend it individually, but I do recommend taking DS to other students who love to read and are interested in understanding the fundamentals of the western canon and how they have shaped our values and thoughts today.",
                "I would recommend spring semester DS to anyone, but in my experience, philosophy was the most frustrating and least fulfilling of the three DS courses. The first semester texts are much more accessible and literary, so they're easier to deal with if you're more drawn to Literature/H&P; most of the second semester texts are both harder to understand and (in my opinion) less insightful than the Greek and Roman ones. Also, unless you are admirably confident and outgoing (and don't care about your grades), I would particularly recommend avoiding Mordechai's class. He is a very kind person to speak to individually, but he has a tendency to speak over/interrupt students in a way that really bothered me, and we got very little written feedback throughout the semester.",
                "I'd recommend this course to someone else. At times, \"modern philosophy\" generally (emphasize generally) seemed much less grounding and applicable than the ancient philosophy from first semester, but the seminars and lectures helped connect modern philosophers to our personal formation of ethical codes and the development of modern societies/topics of study found worthwhile.",
                "Yes, yes, yes!! Especially with Professor Levy-Eichel. Mordechai is unrelenting when it comes to asking questions to get you to dive deeper into the text and to think. By the end of the semester, you'll be able to answer questions before the Supreme Court! Class was super fun, too."
