   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Active thinking, reading complex academic biology papers, being able to critical think through real life biological experiments and apply concepts learned in class.",
    "I developed a better overall understanding of biology and the experimental procedures that led to many biological discoveries.",
    "The basics of cell biology.",
    "Basic bio info",
    "This course heavily focused on experimental strategies and how to evaluate data. From the beginning of the course to the end, I was really able to see improvement in problem solving on the problem sets. S105A was a good introduction to information and how proteins interact with each other and why cells need proteins. S105B required much more thinking about the information presented in class, but allowed for much quicker learning of the material.",
    "This biology course was a greatly detailed look into the biological systems and laboratory techniques and was very engaging!  It wasn't just rote memorization; every question in the quizzes and problem sets required thinking.",
    "This course was an incredible introduction to the world of biological sciences. I learned about different ways to test hypotheses and how to be a scientist in general.",
    "-basic principles of biochemistry, biophysics, and cell biology \r\n-how to read research papers\r\n-how to analyze\/interpret scientific data\r\n-experimental approaches to studying biology",
    "I gained a solid foundation of cell biology and DNA replication\/expression. Additionally, I learned how to read several scientific papers and now understand some important experimental methods used in the field of molecular and cellular biology\/ biochemistry.",
    "I learned problem solving skills and am now better able to connect the physiological aspects of biology with real world scenarios.",
    "Learned basic AP bio again.",
    "I learned a lot about molecular and cell biology, as well as thought processes involved in creating and analyzing experiments in those fields. Altogether, it was a huge amount of information for such a short class, and I loved it.",
    "In the first part of Bio S105 we learned about various macromolecules, including proteins, carbohydrates, DNA, and RNA. We also interpreted data regarding the information we learned about in order to get a deeper understanding. In 105B we learned about functions of the cell membrane and other parts of the cell, and covered the many approaches to studying biology.",
    "A good understanding of biochem, biophysics, and cell bio through research.",
    "I was able to develop a strong understanding and appreciation of applying biological concepts rather than memorization. As I am a high school student, this course provided an insight of the college learning experience. This course gave me an introduction in new methods of studying, approaching problem sets, etc.",
    "In the first half, I learned about the foundations of biology, including biochemical and biophysical fundamentals. In the second half, I learned about cell biology and developed a thorough understanding of various experimental procedures. Both halves of the course were exceptionally well taught and helped me develop a strong enough foundation of biology to not only read and understand high-level biology papers, but also design my own experiments.",
    "Basic biological systems and their mechanics.",
    "I learned about the fundamental reactions that take place within biological systems and how they apply to general survival."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths are the active learning aspect (question and answer portion of the class), you are put on the spot to quickly apply concepts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses are the hefty slides that maybe could be made more brief.",
    "The psets were great for applying what you learned to real world problems. The class was a bit long because it was every day.",
    "In the second half, the psets were only a couple questions but they took soo many points off for smaller mistakes making it very hard to do well",
    "I really appreciated the fact that we read actual scientific papers in the latter half of the class. I feel much more confidence in my ability to make heads or tails of scientific communication, at least at a cursory level. It was also an incredible boon that all exams\/problem sets were open book. I don't think I would have succeeded in this course or gained the level of understanding that I did were the exams not open book. The online format also made it easy to ask many clarifying questions, which greatly enhanced my learning.",
    "The TAs and Professors from both sections were especially valuable. The constant availability of office hours and TA sessions really helped me focus on learning information on my own, and seeking help when needed. At times, I felt as though 105A could have used more data interpretation or critical thinking beyond what was presented in the textbook. On the flip side, there were times in 105B where the information could have been presented a little slower. Then again, we were able to clarify any misunderstandings or extra material needed through office hours.",
    "Strengths included the wonderful support of the professors and teaching assistants and a good amount of rigor in what and how we learned.  Weaknesses include the extremely fast-paced nature of the course.",
    "This course was incredible. That's it.",
    "Especially over the summer, it's a lot of information to get through in a short period of time, but the teaching staff were very accommodating and helpful with making this information accessible (even online).",
    "The courses encouraged lots of student engagement and participation, including many opportunities to ask questions and focus in on especially interesting topics. However, with how fast-paced and short the course is, I feel that a lot of topics that 101\/102 students learn were never able to be covered. On the other hand, with such a small group of students, I felt the professors and TAs were able to give more individual guidance and feedback.",
    "Strengths were that I really understood the content; weaknesses were that we didnt get through all the content and I wish there were more breakout rooms.",
    "It was well taught, and the assignments were fair.",
    "Despite the course being very condensed and fast, I felt that there were many resources to help, including homework help, reviews before quizzes, accessible power points and recordings, and helpful TAs. Since the lectures were so long, I think more breakout rooms would have been helpful to clarify certain concepts during class.",
    "The first half was taught differently than the second half. Lots of things were rushed.",
    "Strengths: From the beginning, the course expectations were explained and consistent throughout. I understood the questions asked on the problem set and the content of the lectures was challenging, but straightforward. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wasn't completely too  sure on where part B  of this course was going. Each day seemed like there  was more information presented in  terms of bullet point here and there. It took me a few days to determine how this part of the course was structured. Perhaps there could be more clarity in the introduction class. Besides this, I thought that the  class was very well designed and functioned smoothly.",
    "The strengths are the (1) professors, incredible lecturers who really care about their students; (2) the (interesting!) content was well-prepared ahead of class, and the classes ran very smoothly for online classes; and (3) there were plenty of office hours, review sessions, etc to ensure students were able to get the help they need. The biggest weakness was the time element -- classes would drag on a little too long, and it was hard to stay focused on the material for the entire length of class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would. Professor Mooseker gives a level of challenge that is greatly needed, especially if pursuing a pre-med track. I will keep the skills that I have learned from him for years to come.",
    "Would only recommend if this was a credit that is absolutely necessary for your major or if you had a solid biology learning experience in high school.",
    "I would recommend the first half but the second half was hard to do well",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who truly enjoys biology. The course moves at a quick pace and due to its online nature requires a lot of independent work, but the amount of information learned in a short amount of time is really great.",
    "Yes, the professors were very kind and understanding, and I learned so much!",
    "Yes! Professor Collins and Professor Mooseker are so incredible and this course reflects the hard work they've done to put it together and how much they care about student learning.",
    "yes! even though it's a requirement (major\/pre med) for many students, I think it's very engaging",
    "Yes, I believe taking summer courses is very beneficial, and with a smaller group it is much easier to engage with the material than in a typical large lecture. Having this foundation of biology has also been extremely helpful in my work in my research lab, and it allows me to better understand and engage with much of the medical science and information that I come across now.",
    "Yes. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and feel like I gained a lot of knowledge.",
    "It's a prerequisite so you don't have a choice.",
    "Taking this course in the summer is a great experience, as we were able to have a lot of interaction with the instructors directly (through questions, office hours, etc) and the class felt more personal on the whole. This made it easier to figure things out when I wasn't quite understanding and made for a generally better learning environment than a large lecture.",
    "Yes, it was enjoyable and I feel like I learned a lot.",
    "Yes, Professor Mooseker is brilliant and cares a lot about his students.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student looking to get an introduction to biology because of how the material is presented. At the end of the course I learned that the first half presented us with a lot of the biochemistry and biophysics, more towards memorization and application. However, part B gave a first hand experience to reading biological literature and gave an insight into experimental techniques, which are invaluable.",
    "Yes! I found the content very interesting and applicable to anybody interested in biology\/biochem\/med school\/etc. I've learned so so much about biology from the course. The professors are really great mentors and have clearly been teaching this material for a while. I would recommend, but I'd say that it would probably be better to take during the year if possible; taking bio over the summer is a huge feat, and you have to dedicate a lot of time and energy each day to keep up with the super fast pace.",
    "Not in this format as it is not permanent.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they are interested in the field of biological sciences."
