The course then adds a model with various periods, and finally with money, and looks at the changes with rigid and non rigid prices. The course also teaches about growth theory (solo model and some endogenous human capital  growth theory). The main skills you take away from this class are solving pretty complex algebra models and also some intuition abut how different choices you make change with different parameters.",
