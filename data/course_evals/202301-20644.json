                "I learned a lot of skills relating to Multivariable Calculus and biological mathematical modeling.",
                "The middle third of the class was focused on PDEs and biological models of diffusion and advection. Definitely learned how to approach calculus in higher dimensions.",
                "Vectors, multivariable calculus, and mathematical modeling of bioscientific scenarios",
                "In addition to learning multivariable calculus techniques, I appreciated that this course showed us some of the ways the math we discussed are being applied to model biological systems for simulation-based research. This facet of the class also allowed us to study some concepts I found quite interesting that are less traditional for calculus classes (partial differential equations, fourier series).",
                "I gained important problem-solving skills and knowledge about Calc three concepts.",
                "How to integrate with respect to multiple variables, integrate across surfaces, understand advection and diffusion models and various biological contexts where these models are useful.",
                "I gained an appreciation for the ways multi-variable calculus can be used to model real-world biological systems.",
                "Multivariable calculus mostly following the Math 120 curriculum but with a small extra component of application to four articles we read for class. I learned so much about how to think in calculus.",
                "I learned about vectors (and related operations such as dot product, projections, etc.) as well as differential equations, functions of more than one variable, and double and tripe integrals. These skills are super useful for pretty much any field and I am incredibly happy I got to learn them. They are are super cool!",
                "I learned multivariable calculus as well as a lot of differential equation techniques. I also learned how to apply this knowledge to scientific articles related to the biosciences and how to interpret models such as tumor spreading, pattern development, and population growth."

            "comments": [
                "The content is really interesting, well taught, and the course is organized. The workload is manageable especially if you go to office hours.",
                "Strengths: less focus on multivariable content (which could be a strength or a weakness) and I think psets are shorter for the most part than Math 120. Weakness: focus on solving PDEs for the second midterm, which I enjoyed but shouldn't be a part of a multi class",
                "This course was a wonderful intersection of mathematical modeling and multivariable calculus topics.",
                "I really enjoyed the readings that we did in the middle of the class. It was really interesting to see math used in biological research (especially the reading about spots).",
                "Very fast-paced and little support in terms of peer tutors (there was only one) and office hours. Considering the amount of work and content this was not well organized.",
                "Classes balanced spending time practicing and applying concepts with lecture on new material very well, and problem sets reinforced course material. I  found the material covered during the second part of the course (between midterms 1 and 2) most interesting and actually feel that an even deeper dive into some of those theories could be worthwhile (perhaps students could learn how to solve partial differential models using computers and/or apply them in a project).",
                "This course is very good. A big strength is the teacher, Professor Hall, as he is very good at teaching the content in a way that is comprehensive. The ULA's and support offered is also a highpoint of the course.",
                "I think the strengths are that Professor Hall is incredibly available and wants students to succeed. I think the only stressor was the cumulative final, which certainly was applications of things we learned in class, but didnt feel representative of what we learned.",
                "This course was taught at a very fast pace and it would do better if the second unit was better incorporated into the multivariable content instead of feeling like an add-on.",
                "This is an excellent course. Professor Hall is a great lecturer, and office hours and study hall were accessible and useful.",
                "The major strength was the professor. He made the information very interesting and easily accessible, and he made the class enjoyable. The main weakness of the class was that the office hours were at times that were often difficult to manage with other classes.",
                "Strengths: Material is super interesting, Professor is world-class, TAs are super helpful, and even though psets are sometimes very dense, they really help your understanding. Professor Hall also has a lot of videos from previous years he has taught the materials, so even if a topic is unclear or you need more context, this resource is also available for you. Midterms and finals are hard but fair. Grading is also fair. Overall, one of the best classes I have taken here at Yale.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish Professor Hall used more graphing tools during his lectures since some of the concepts are easier to grasp by looking at an interactive 3D graph, but his drawings/graphs are also super good.",
                "The strengths of this course were that examples were provided in the beginning of every class for students to work out on their own, which was very engaging. I also think the material was taught well and the office hours were helpful. Sometimes the teaching was a little too fast paced and I couldn't catch up when taking notes. This was solved, however, by there being videos occasionally posted on the Canvas page explaining the material. I also think that the problem sets were very difficult compared to the examples we were taught in class, but that may have been intentional."

                "Yes. I really enjoyed this course. I thought that pacing was good and we learned so much without it feeling daunting. Professor also posted lecture videos from previous years which I appreciate. Professor Hall is one of the best professors I have had at Yale. I appreciate how he truly cares about his students and makes us feel it. I also like the way he structures every class. It makes the content digestable. The warm up problem is so helpful because it forces us to reflect on the previous class' content and try it fro ourselves and he walks us through it. I would not change anything about the course.",
                "I would not recommend this class if you are engineering, and you should take ENAS 151 or MATH 120 instead. The bio side of the class is only really relevant when we were solving PDEs with diffusion and advection equations. If you are trying to take this class because the bio seems interesting, I would not",
                "I definitely would. Dr. Hall is an amazing professor who explains all the topics in a meaningful way and ensures that every student is understanding the topic.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Hall was great and made sure that he was accessible to all his students. Itll provide you a strong introduction into biological models of diffusion and advection as well as build your foundation of multi variable calculus.",
                "Yes if you're interested in being exposed to actual mathematical models in bioscientific scenarios. Just keep in mind it's more work than 120 due to the additional units related to such modeling. Since it's also a smaller class there is definitely not a lot of support as for 120 which has way more office hours etc.",
                "I would absolutely recommend (and already have recommended) this course to other students. You come out of an engaging semester of class having learned more about math/mathematical research than just multivariable calculus, and Professor Hall is a wonderful teacher.",
                "Yes! Professor Hall is wonderful and the content is interesting. I will say the content is very challenging, but John Hall is great at introducing topics at a good pace. While the course is very challenging, the PSETS and Exams for the most part feel very fair. I liked the Bio applications as well as it gives real context to the things we learned.",
                "Yes absolutely. I love that we learned the applications of the math we were learning and exercised our ability to engage in literature about mathematical models/understand how its connected to the two models we focused on during the course.",
                "I would only recommend this course to students who have taken multivariable calculus before because the pace at which it is taught is very fast and there is a whole unit unrelated to it squeezed in.",
                "Yes! Professor Hall is a great instructor, and I gained an appreciation for multi-variable calculus that I wouldn't have been able to get on my own.",
                "Yes. For this level of math, this was a very enjoyable course, and the workload was manageable. I also appreciated that the students weren't competing against each other for good grades.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Hall not only teaches you the basics of Multivariable Calculus (and a bit about Diff Equations), but he also takes the time to help you develop and intuition for these concepts. This is essential if you are an engineering but it will also set you apart as a biologist or as a person in another STEM field. I would truly recommend this even if you are not a biologist. I myself took it as an engineer (not biomedical) and gained so much out of it.",
                "I would recommend this class to a student interested in biology and multivariable calculus because I think that the learning experience might be more favorable compared to the regular multivariable calculus classes because of the quality of instruction and the one-on-one attention you were able to get. I would say, however, that you would have to be willing to put in a lot of work, go to lots of office hours and peer tutoring, and form a study group because I had to do all of that for this class."
