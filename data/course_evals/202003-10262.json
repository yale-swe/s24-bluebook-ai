                "This was an amazing course. I have never had better discussions with my classmates. Despite the Zoom format, discussions flowed well and included everyone. None of us wanted the class to end.",
                "I can honestly cannot think of any weaknesses. The weekly assignments felt like the perfect amount - each time reading a series of poems grouped around a common theme and writing in a journal to reflect on them. Class time was a great balance of activities - break out groups, full discussion, reciting or listening to poems, and doing small writing activities. I had been nervous about the emphasis on recitation, but after the exercises, you are left with poems of your choice to carry with you beyond class.",
                "The course reader and class discussions are incredible but the quality of the discussion, like in all seminars, depends on the preparedness of all the other students. In this course, where the poetry demands a certain degree of vulnerability on the part of the students, everyone needs to be especially respectful, attentive, and invested in the course for it to go smoothly. This semester it definitely did but I can imagine with a different cohort it could be challenging.",
                "This course was my favorite of the semester, and I looked forward to the seminar every single week. The class felt for me as much like a spiritual discussion group as a poetry analysis course, and I cant overstate how much I valued the sense of community I felt with Professor Wiman and my classmates. I really appreciated the journaling exercise that accompanied the reading homework each week: the prompts were thought-provoking but never constricting. My journal felt very personal, especially because we didnt share them every week, and it also always made me feel prepared to raise specific comments in seminar about poems or ideas that struck me. Finally, I loved that we were encouraged to take liberties with the final assignment and short presentations throughout the course: I felt that I always had the space to follow my own passions, and I learned so much from my classmates because they had the space to do the same. I wouldnt change a thing about this course."

                "Absolutely - this is one of the best classes Ive taken at Yale (and if you dont get in the first time, try again next year. Its so worth it). The reading is never too heavy each week, but the content provides so much to dive into personally and through class discussion, not just regarding questions of faith, but also joy, suffering, conceptions of home etc. Also, its not every day that you get to take a class with the former editor of Poetry magazine. Prof. Wiman is so insightful, down to earth, and has published a lot of the poems that you read in class!",
                "Absolutely, this class is worth it for Prof. Wimans instruction alone.",

Whether or not youve ever taken a poetry class before, and whether or not youve ever thought of yourself as a person of faithI barely had before taking the courseyou will absolutely gain something from the course. I feel so grateful to have spent time in an environment that was both incredibly intellectually stimulating and personally fulfilling. I learned so much about poetry, faith, and my own relationship to both."
