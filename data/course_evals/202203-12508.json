The best and most important part of this course is the focus on New Haven politics and government institutions. DeStefano brings his 20 years of experience as New Havens mayor to the table each week and it was an incredible opportunity to learn from him.",
                "I developed the skill to view public policy through the lens of community well-being, social cohesion and legitimacy. I was able to read contemporary readings on American cities and analyze the arguments of modern political scientists.",

                "Strengths: Professor DeStefanos style of teaching makes it feel like what youre learning is really practical. He didnt give too much reading too, but carefully selected them. The cohort of students enrolled in the class were a great mix of people with different interests and different relationships with cities/New Haven. Also, the first paper was really fun to writethe field trip we had before writing it was a highlight of the course. Weaknesses: It was sometimes difficult to engage if you didnt have some background knowledge about the topics at hand.",
                "The course was wonderful in its intimate, small class, discussion format. I have no suggestions for its improvement.",
                "This course is generally excellent; however, Mayor DeStefano can at times be a little too prescriptive in his thinking which comes across as unstated expectations for assignments.",
                "Professor DeStefano is great, and as a former Mayor of New Haven he brings a wealth of first hand experience to the course, really enjoyed his perspectives and discussions. The class discussions were a huge plus of this course, they were always thought provoking and stimulating, with a variety of opinions and perspectives. My only thought on improvement is making grading expectations a bit clearer, but this wasn't a huge problem and really only a minor comment.",
                "Professor DeStefano is incredibly personable and generous, he is receptive to student input and suggestions, the course has a reasonable amount of readings and is very hands on. My only complaint was that there werent enough weeks in the semester to cover more content."

                "Yes!!! Take this courseits fun, low workload, and Professor DeStefano is great.",
                "Absolutely, leaning from DeStefano is an opportunity that should not be missed. Take this course if you are genuinely interested in New Haven and its politics because that, rather than other urban policy issues, is what takes the fore in this course. Also touring fair haven was great and really insightful",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course for anyone interested in New Haven, public policy or both.",
                "I would recommend this course to those interested in the applied aspects of politics and public policy.",
                "Yes, definitely. If you are interested in New Haven or city politics/governance this course is a must.",
                "Yes! Genuinely one of the best classes I have taken during my time at Yale. The course is clearly organized, there is good discussion, and the Professor both encourages you to learn what interests you and is also available for feedback. Great class."
