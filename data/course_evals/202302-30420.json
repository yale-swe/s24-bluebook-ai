More specifically, you are investigating linear systems closed under addition and scalar multiplication. You learn how to solve large systems of equations through matrices and guassian elimination and cover topics including linear independence / dependence, spans, subspaces, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, matrix multiplication, etc. At the end of each week we typically had a practical application: for instance, Markov chains, Least squares approximations, or just applied linear systems (i.e., to biology or physics) - these were great for seeing how linear algebra is used in the world.",

                "It's well organized and the instructor is nice, sometimes it gets a bit fast or slows down too much but the pace is fine for a summer class. The daily homework is annoying but it's understandable why we need it.",
                "The organization was a massive strength, as even though there was a lot of content packed into only 5 weeks, it was broken down into very small bits to prevent you from getting easily overwhelmed. The major weakness was that this course was virtual, which made the lecture less engaging on the part of the other students.",
                "The course is good in the summmer I feel it focuses on the core subjects. \r\nThe weaknesses is there are not enough examples available so it can be hard at times when lost.",
                "Strengths - good lecturing, consistent and clear instructions for psets, prof was super generous with grading!\r\nWeaknesses - might just be due to the nature of summer session classes but sometimes we went a little slower than I might've liked, and there were times where I would've liked to have been able to spend more time on a concept",
                "Daily classes and psets were great. The prof was also very generous with office hours.",
                "Great class with a great professor. Loved how it was participation oriented.",
                "Strengths: The arrangement of the course is great and workload of each course is fair\r\nWeaknesses: It could be better if it can include some proofs (or provide some materials) and extended knowledge (may be harder) related to the course.",
                "This course was great. The homework assignments were daily but they are super manageable and having the flexibility of taking 2 days to do the assignment greatly reduces stress. I actually prefer this to the difficult weekly psets most STEM classes give during the school year. I also liked that we weren't expected to fully understand or be tested on any material that wasn't on a homework assignment that was already due. For example, if we had a lecture on a topic but we only had one day between the new material and the exam, we were not expected to learn that material extra fast - it just wasn't on the exam. This was super helpful in alleviating stress because in a lot of other classes communication is much less clear and we are often tested on new material that we have never received feedback on."

                "Yeah. The math is relatively simple and everything builds nicely onto itself, its also very useful for other courses/coding. The instructor is again very nice and knows what he's doing, he is also engaging which is important for a zoom class.",

                "Definitely! This is a great way to learn some linear algebra. Know that it isn't as proof-based as 225, so if you prefer that and can take it during the year than do it. For anyone who maybe doesn't feel so confident in their math ability but wants to push and learn more, this is a great class to do that in. I really disliked calculus (MATH 115) and this course along with one other has helped to get me back into math. Would definitely encourage and has significant applications to data science and computer science as well. Linear algebra is a beautiful subject too -- and even the sort of computations matrices could perform blew my mind.",
                "Yes, especially in the summer! this course is well suited to the summer schedule/structure and as long as you keep up with the lectures and assignments you'll do well.",

I'm not sure the material was interesting enough that everyone should voluntarily take it, but as far as classes required for my major go, this one was one of the better ones by far. It was highly organized, Prof Barnes is engaging and approachable, and I liked how I actually learned the applications of linear algebra."
