                "How to write a short screenplay at a professional level. Also, what a script treatment is and how to get jobs in the industry.",

                "Professor Lapadula does a great job of keeping everyone engaged. He really wants everyone to be successful, and proves it by supporting and inviting his past students. Sometimes activities felt very rushed because of the size of the class and the limited time we had together.",
                "High",
                "I think that this is a fantastic course that really meshes well with any type of student, be they serious potential screenwriters or people looking to dip their toes into what it is like to screenwrite or work in the creative department of a movie studio. You really get out of it what you put into it. The main strength is Professor Lapadula himself: he is funny, knowledgeable, and always willing to help. The class is organized really well. The midterm folder is a lot, but that's only if you leave it to the last possible moments (not recommended; if possible, chip at it gradually throughout the first half of the semester - your spring break self will be thanking you profusely).",
                "The strengths are that this is a really fun class for anyone who is seriously interested in writing a screenplay! A weakness is that it could have been better organized with set due dates from the beginning of the semester.",
                "Considering that it is a beginners course it is understandable that the primary focus was getting all of the technicalities of screenwriting correct, I wished that there was more of a focus on developing a good story but I know that will be the focus of the intermediate class.",
                "The course is a wonderful introduction to the world of screenwriting -- however, it mostly teaches you the technical aspects of screenwriting. I wished we would have gotten into story structure and how to develop characters more. For the midterm folder, we had to write coverage, but we never really went over exactly how to write good coverage. However, I really liked the dialogue writing workshop!",
                "Something you usually dont see on course reviews, but I wish there were more assignments! I enjoyed only having my own screenplay to work on for the last half of the course, but I would have appreciated having more writing exercises to help me keep writing things other than just my screenplay."

The final project is the screenplay you've been working towards all semester, so it's nice to leave the course with your own written short film. Be sure to start the midterm folder early, otherwise it will take up a chunk of your spring break...",
                "Yes",

                "Absolutely, writing screenplays is one of my favorite pastimes and hobbies, and to meet many other students with the same passions is such a relief.",
                "Yes! It's a good way to dip your toes into screenwriting!",
                "Definitely! If youre interested in storytelling and would like to learn how to do so in a screenplay format, this is the course for you. There is definitely room for a range of skill levels in this course as well, so if youre fairly new to creative writing, I wouldnt be daunted by it."
