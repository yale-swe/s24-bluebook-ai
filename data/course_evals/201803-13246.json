    "LOVE THIS CLASS! I learned so much about different topics and contentions in contemporary African literature, and got to read such amazing authors!",
    "I learned about postcolonial literature, African literature, African culture and history, postcolonial criticism, global leftist politics, non-realism literary movements in Africa, and strategies to engage with literary theory.",
    "I read a lot of incredible books that I hadn't before, and feel like I've been introduced to several conversations about African lit that I'm excited to keep thinking about in my own reading outside of the course.",
    "Tackled some tough texts.",
    "I read some great books and connected literature with theory in a way I haven't before!",
    "Contemporary African Fiction has a misleading name; Steph doesn't just focus on African lit as of today right now in 2018. She places it into a historical and cultural context, buffered by some theory and a few articles. Discussion was always very interesting, and the class size ensured that when not everyone had done the reading, there was always a sizable group that had. Discussion was also challenging, sometimes in the wrong way. English majors esp. those who have had to do a lot of reading are quick to mask what they have to say behind grand and clunky terms v nouveau riche (I also do this), but Steph doesn't let you get away with that. I think this class, like ENGL 128, forces you to think of lit. as living, political, dangerous -- but not difficult to understand if you put in the work.",
    "Steph makes a wonderful use of literature that comments on race, gender, and world politics. I learned to weave out critique of power from within the details of fiction and narratives in a way that is crucial for understanding the Goliath of power in a way that prevents hiding it. This is an excellent literature course and an amazing senior seminar.",
    "An in depth understanding of the newer African literary tradition pushing against realistic form.",
    "I now know what \"African Fiction\" means. I know how to place its works in a kind of post-colonial canon, as well as how to problematize such placement too. It's a class of realizing tensions and letting them roll in your head for a few days. All the work we've done in the course feels meaningful and important, thanks to Steph and her incredible guidance. You learn to read and think more critically than probably ever before. You learn to write a huge final paper and bring your semester-long questions to fruition."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Steph picks the absolute BEST works for her syllabus, and I loved all the other people that came in to talk with our class!",
    "Strengths: Great syllabus, Steph is excellent at facilitating discussion, brings in guests, encourages us to engage with events, all around excellent course.\r\nWeaknesses: Syllabus is approached through a very specific postcolonial framework. I know it's not Steph's style, but some degree of close reading  (or in general alternative approaches to the material) may make the novels easier to engage with, for students who aren't already familiar with postcolonial studies.",
    "I think the books we read are great, and the sequence we read them in was useful and illuminating. I was surprised that this class spent so little time looking at the material on the page--most class periods would pass with everyone's books left sitting unopened on the table. I think this is a totally valid  approach to a survey lit course when there is so much material to cover, and it's actually one that I think I could have learned a lot from, as it's different from a lot of English classes I've taken at Yale thus far. However, the majority of the students in the class (myself included) very obviously didn't have any background with the historical context of these texts, or with scholarship on the critical debates and discussions surrounding them. The result was seminar discussions that felt pretty uneven. I think that this class would have been much, much better if it had included more critical readings alongside the assigned texts, so that our discussions about larger cross-textual themes could have been grounded in actual scholarly discourse. I also think this would have prepared me to write a better final paper, where we were asked to engage with critical and historical perspectives in a way that the rest of the class did not really set up.",
    "Steph is the strength of this course. She's so lovely and knowledgeable, and her enthusiasm for the material is infectious. The course is tough, though, because so many people in the class have no background of any kind in post-colonial literature and we sort of just jump right in. It can be daunting to talk about or attempt to analyze when you feel you lack important critical background. A lot of the texts are pretty challenging, and we would often get bogged down in one particular theme or dimension of the text in discussion.",
    "Class discussions feel like a book club, all in all a great course!",
    "I appreciated the class size, but it cuts both ways. I sometimes wished it were smaller so more people could talk at length. Waiting for your turn to say something when you are like 80% sure it's absolutely brilliant is frustrating. I am not really sure why we had to have so many juniors?? Love them but like? Steph is a hot commodity, v in demand, and I think in the future, enrollment should really be limited to senior undergrads.",
    "There is a lot of reading but if youre taking this class out of genuine interest, youre going to have lots of fun. Sometimes it was obvious that a lot of the class had not read enough or with care.",
    "I loved everything about this course, honestly. Maybe less guest lecturers?",
    "This class is a picture perfect English seminar at Yale. A book a week, followed by meaningful, engaged discussion around the table. Steph knows exactly when to voice her thoughts, but for the most part the students control the discussion and take it to really interesting places. The only weakness I can think of is that I wanted Steph to talk more! Everything she says is brilliant and appreciated by the class. But still, I mean that critique selfishly, as I know it is better for her to let her students figure things out on their own."

   "comments": [
    "YES! This class is amazing and Steph is an incredible professor. I read so many fantastic books and authors this semester, and our class discussions were always super interesting! Great pick for an English senior seminar.",
    "If you have interest in postcolonial or African literature, I would take this class! The novels are really, really good and Steph is great at facilitating discussion. Sometimes discussions can get tiresome but sometimes they just fly by--depending on how much you enjoyed the material. I loved Beautiful Ones Are Not Yet Born and that class felt about two minutes long. I didn't enjoy Lagoon and that class was like crawling through mud. Steph is passionate and will get you engaged.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, as I think the reading is really incredible, with the caveat that you should be prepared for discussion that often feels a little half-baked and also prepared to write the final paper with absolutely no scaffolding or preparation built into the schedule or structure of the course. If this is your first time writing a paper of this length (as it was for me) I don't know that this is the best class to start with.",
    "Take this class! The books are cool and the professor is amazing!",
    "If you're going to do the work and engage with the texts and participate in discussion, do it. Steph is lovely and helpful and clearly loves the material. If you're not willing to put in the work to read the books, then don't bother taking it. You'll waste everyone's time, especially your own.",
    "Yes! Do keep in mind that the final paper is a formidable challenge.",
    "Would recommend -- even if postcolonial world lit isn't your thing (but like why wouldn't it be your thing?) Steph is a superstar discussion leader, but she's also encouraging and will meet you where you are. I've had professors who've made me feel so stupid after office hours, but Steph would never. But she believes and expects you to be whip smart, and the crazy thing is that at the end, when you've read your work? Maybe you'll believe her??? Wild stuff, guys.",
    "Yes! If you want to radically redefine your conceptions of what is real, or realistic, or objective, this is the course for you. The entire course is a beautiful critique of Western canon.",
    "YES! This class is fantastic and Steph Newell is my favorite English professor at Yale. TAKE IT!",
    "I would recommend this course but with several qualifications. You get what you put into this course. The texts were great and enjoyable to read and think about and I am grateful to have read all of them, but as class conversation could often be vague or ungrounded in the text, the class really asks for individual research and curiosity from the students.",
    "YES!!!!! Take it for the books & for Steph. You will read more critically in this class than most others, but it's totally worth it. She is thoughtful, kind, brilliant, and funny! There was never a dull day in the seminar room and never a dull book to dive into. Class is a book a week with two or one paper(s), depending on your preference. I went for the 30pg final paper and, although it was exhausting, it was a substantial piece of work that I can now be proud of."
