    "How to effectively review a field of research within molecular biophysics and biochemistry.",
    "I learned how to prepare a critical summary of a recently published paper.",
    "I picked a topic which I was only vaguely familiar with at the beginning of the semester. Now, having researched and written about it for months, I can confidently discuss my topic and research surrounding it with individuals in the field. I feel this will be a useful skill moving forward, as becoming familiar with a new body of research is important whenever one is starting a new lab project.",

   "comments": [
    "Strength: good timeline, full draft a month in advance was helpful so that the final draft I sent in was of high quality, flexibility to examine what interests you",
    "Mark Solomon gave good feedback at each step of the writing process and was very friendly. I wish the thesis requirements for the presentation were more clear though.",
    "It is a great culmination of the major. It makes you appreciate the skills that you learned when you can become familiar with a new topic on your own in a few months.",
    "The course was laid out well, no complaints. I wish my advisor had provided more comprehensive feedback on my draft; still, the feedback that was provided was useful.",
    "strengths - this class is not very stressful, perfect for seniors trying to complete the end of a very difficult major\r\n\r\nweakness - more advising could be helpful",
    "I thought this course was nearly perfect. The deadlines were reasonable, and I'm very happy we were required to turn in a \"final\" draft early in the semester. This made the editing process at the end of the year much easier, and took a lot of stress out of the last few weeks of school.",
    "The strengths of the class are that students are given a large amount of freedom, but this comes with the drawback that there is a lack of structure, and the reports only get a single rough draft rather than several, which is scary."

    "Required for MB&B major so it's mandatory, but a good opportunity to write a science review on a topic of your interest, at a good organized pace, of high quality. Better thesis requirement than MCDB hands down.",
    "Chances are, you arent taking this for fun. Mark Solomon was a great thesis advisor, but your mileage may vary for other advisors.",
    "Yes. It is a great senior project.",
    "This course is perhaps the best course of the MB&B because it is low stakes, read and review literature about whatever you would like in 1 semester, and create a fairly sized paper and presentation.",
    "One of the best things about MB&B is that it has a relatively low-key senior requirement! While your friends in other majors will be spending the whole year stressing about their theses, the workload for the MB&B senior project is not significant at all (write a <4000 word literature review and prepare a 15 minute presentation on it).",
    "Obviously this a required course for MB&B, but it's a great way to end your time in the major. Being divided into small groups is also a fun way to meet or reconnect with other MB&B people who you might not have seen very often before. The requirements of the course are fairly low-stress as well. As long as you keep your deadlines in mind (and don't put things off until the last minute) it's all very reasonable to accomplish.",
    "This is a required class, so...."
