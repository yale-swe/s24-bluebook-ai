It prepares you for relevant writing in the professional world outside of theoretically academic work. Besides receiving an important and robust understanding of Native ed policy, you'll be able to analyze studies and methods, discuss them, and propose your own ideas in class. Feedback is really thorough.",

Weakness: could be more practical writing assignments, like short policy memos or more program proposalsI really liked practicing writing them and doing them for assignments.",
                "The prime strength of this course was learning about Indigenous narratives in education. One suggestion I have is having a policy brief switched to the 10 page final, and the grant writing to a 5-7 page to the midterm paper. There is just more to elaborate on with a policy brief.",
                "Strengths - great structure of assignments and prof really listens to students like changing the last assignment to be a proposal for our final!!!! the organization of the lessons\/weekly learning themes were really effective in helping non-native students and students with little knowledge of native education stay connected to the material and caught up with the complex topics\r\nWeaknesses - during class, the occasional more structured lesson (get into groups to answer these questions, analyze this document together, etc) could have helped solidify the information from the readings",
                "This class had incredibly practical assignments, a lesson plan and grant proposal and weekly challenges like finding non-deficit based articles on Native education that I was never bored, learned a lot but in a way I cared about."

                "Yes! Definitely take this course. The assignments are relevant and Prof. Makomenaw is very fair with deadlines and the work. You won't feel like you're doing any kind of busy work-- it's all relevant and important. The readings are very enlightening, and the lesson plan creation is fun.",
                "Absolutely! Especially education or Indigenous studies people, but anyone who wants to learn more about this topic, it's comprehensive and informative and incredibly engaging."
