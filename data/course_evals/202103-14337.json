                "I learned how to deeply read a text to pull apart both its political and historical significance.",
                "This course helped me become a better writer, specifically with regard to formulating argumentative theses. It also introduced the various ways that ancient and medieval thinkers considered political questions, namely what the ideal state would look like.",
                "I definitely improved my close-reading skills when analyzing texts. Developed deeper insight into history answering questions such as: who writes it and how is it being told. Insight into politics and how communities become political. The texts we explored were great",
                "I studied many of the influential historical and political writers of antiquity while learning to write a college paper.",
                "I developed many insights about political thought and the process of writing history. Especially interesting to me were the thoughts of Plato, Aristotle, Tacitus, and Polybius. It is interesting to look back at the political thinking of early philosophers\/historians and get out of the western thinking that dogmatically holds certain things as absolutely (such as that democracy is self-evidently the best form of government). Many of the early thinkers disagreed. I also realized that people have been having the same political discussions that we are having today for millenia."

                "I enjoyed the class discussions and the balance of starting lecture and classes. I wish we had more time to reads more of the sources and do more discussion on them!",
                "I think in seminar sessions it may have been useful for us to leave with a few more key takeaways that are decently solid conclusions. Although we asked many interesting and thought-provoking questions, I think it would have been helpful to understand a little bit more about what the authors certainly wished to communicate rather than focusing so heavily on matters that were open to interpretation. Also I think a little bit of background is always useful, so I appreciated when we did that at the beginning of class.",
                "The course does a good job of allowing students to write on topics that engage them and provides a good overview of significant political theorists and historians. However, as a history course, it falls short of properly investigating the historical circumstances under which the various philosophies we study developed in. It is much more a course in political thought. Of course, it is difficult to cover all these major works and also develop a more complete understanding of antiquity - clearly a reasonable tradeoff was made. At the same time, I think the value of understanding the historical eras in a more complete sense should be weighed more heavily.",
                "This course was terrific and very educational. However, it at times felt like there were two different courses being taught in one, and we would switch back and forth between historians and political philosophers. This wasn't too much of an issue, as the content was engaging and educational but maybe some clarity on how the two \"tracks\" tied together or some more work on connecting them would have been helpful.",
                "I love learning about political theory and enjoyed the survey of historical texts in H&P, but I found the papers challenging to write. Whereas in literature and philosophy I felt there were clear expectations for the papers, H&P felt a bit more amorphous. The material is fascinating and requires plenty of time to cover, but I would have appreciated a bit more guidance in terms of what an H&P paper looks like.",
                "Discussions of readings where a bit surface level because we go through texts so quickly and dont have time in lessons grasp the underlying contexts or dont know which ones we should be looking for while reading the texts initially. Because we are focusing on the texts themselves without a lot of historical context other than the prior readings, i found it very difficult to understand what the important themes were. Discussions were therefore, at times, a confused mix of critiquing the authors themselves, or discussing the events described, but only through the authors lens, which made such discussions feel incomplete.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- the depth and breadth of the class \r\n- the discussion style and the order or chronology of the works\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- often complex texts with limited time for explanation or deeper discussion on what is actually written and meant, as opposed to discussion of our views on the works"

                "Yes I would! H&P is really important to understanding the roots of our political systems today!",
                "Of course. Every DS course has its challenges but H&P in particular. The papers are very argumentative and you learn how to take a clear. stance and make it stand out in your essays. It was difficult to get the hang of writing the papers but the feedback definitely helped me improve. The skills you take away are very valuable.",
                "I would recommend this course. DS is a fantastic program that would not be complete without H&P.",
                "I would. The reading is the most important part of Directed Studies, and you will do plenty of reading in this course. It is interesting to look back an ancient philosophers\/historians to see what they thought of politics and history. I realized very quickly that they were smart - every bit as smart as people in the same professions today. I have a feeling that this background knowledge will be very important for the next semester of DS, and will be useful throughout college."
