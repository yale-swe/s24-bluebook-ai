   "comments": [
    "By taking this course, I gained a deep understanding of cutting-edge research in latent factor models. I experienced the trial and error of the research process. I also learned to extend published methods and apply them to new datasets.",
    "Ability to read and process economic papers, think about economic research questions, begin to conduct economic data analysis",
    "As this course is the first part of a two-part sequence for the two-term senior thesis, I spent most of this semester honing in on a topic and delving deep into the existing literature. It taught me how to approach research and research question formulation from an economic standpoint, and tested my ability to think creatively. Next semester, I know I will learn the more technical skills that come with analyzing data and drawing conclusions to present in a smooth and flowing piece of economics literature.",
    "Research skills, specifically data analysis using your own data",
    "Strong research skills, data analysis capacities, and idea generation. Essentially, I was able to gain strong exposure to various facets of the research process.",
    "This class has helped improve my data analytical skills much more than any other course at Yale. By working with real-life economic questions and hypotheses, I learned how to work with imperfect data and come up with informed conclusions. This class enables me to closely engage with economic data and gain a deeper understanding of applied economic theories."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course provides students a great opportunity to experience life as a researcher. This helps students determine whether graduate school would be appropriate for them. In contrast to the typical course that aims to develop a broad understanding of the material, this course encourages students to become experts in a narrow area of particular interest to them. This course could be improved with additional guidance from faculty.",
    "Great opportunity to interact with economic faculty in a more personal setting",
    "This course is a wonderful introduction to using data and existing literature to elucidate an answer to an economic question or to help inform policy. A strength is the number of advisors available, and the breadth of their knowledge from which to draw in your own research. However, I found that although there are a large number of advisors, sometimes they are not willing to take on an undergrad thesis or do not wish to advise on a topic for which they are listed as being a resource. The TA is also a fantastic strength of the course  his office hours are a space to ask tons of questions and hear his insights as well.",
    "There's no place for econ seniors writing the essay to gather\/discuss their questions. this is available in other departments",
    "Please make it an option to take a one-semester senior essay course in the Spring. A lot of Econ majors are going through job recruitment in the Fall, which is incredibly time consuming, and conflicts with academics in general. Most of us deal with this by either taking a 2-semester essay instead, or simply not doing a senior essay at all. It's disappointing that so many of the other econ majors I've talked to have been discouraged from an essay by the arbitrary time restrictions on it, because I've found it to be a great learning and development experience. Please make it available to more of my classmates, by allowing Spring-term essays - which are an option in almost every other undergrad major at Yale.",
    "The strength of this course is the flexibility it provides students with. Students get to select topics according to their own interests and the schedule is more or less up to their own pace.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course is that because there is no standard topic or process of writing a senior thesis, the level of guidance received in this course is much less compared to other undergraduate economic courses."

   "comments": [
    "I would strongly encourage intellectually curious economics majors to take this course.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student looking for a taste of economic research, academic writing, or an opportunity to facilitate close relationships with faculty members. Especially if a student is considering pursuing a graduate degree in economics, I would advise taking on the challenge of writing a thesis.",
    "Yes -- it's a good experience to do an essay",
    "I strongly encourage all senior economics majors to elect to write the senior essay. It serves as a wonderful culmination of one's work in the discipline, and can act as an opportunity to apply hard and soft skills. Furthermore, you can learn strong research skills which are applicable regardless of one's future plans."
