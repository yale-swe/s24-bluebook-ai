                "I learned a great deal about working creatively, thinking in an outside-of-the-box manner, and approaching problems from multiple angles. I also started learning how to use Photoshop, InDesign, Rhino, and Ilustrator.",

                "Lectures were 10/10, Bimal is amazing. Could be improved by working with peers in-person lol.",
                "Being online, it was very different than having an in person studio. Much of are assignments were changed to fit an online medium, but even then I still had a great deal of fun working on the projects and seeing what all my other classmates also produced given our scenario.",
                "The greatest strengths of this course are the assignments and they way they build upon each other and successively push you, as well as the support from Professor Mendis and especially the TAs. The weakness are the lectures, which, while interesting, sometimes felt somewhat irrelevantI feel like I didn't really take much away from them in general. Another weakness is that all the softwares are introduced in such rapid succession and so quickly. Even now, I don't feel entirely competent when it comes to using any of them. Finally, there was also very little transparency regarding grades throughout the semesterwe didn't receive formal grades on any of the assignments, which made it very difficult to tell how you were doing in the class.",
                "This course was a fantastic introduction to architectural design, and allowed students to bring their personal interests into each assignment. There's a lot of room to experiment and be creative in the course, as well as opportunities to learn computer programs that are otherwise confusing. However, the expectations for assignments were a little unclear at times, leaving students lost on how to approach a given project. I think that more clarity on expectations and project rubrics would benefit the success of students greatly.",
                "The projects were really fun and interesting! It was great to be thrown a challenge and to have to do it. It was also great to have so much guidance from the TFs at every stage of the process. The lectures sometimes felt a bit long. They were at lunch time, and sometimes we would both have a lecture and have a discussion of different students' projects, which the students hadn't prepared for. Since we had so much other class time, it felt to me that these could have been reduced.",
