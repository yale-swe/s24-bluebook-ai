                "I learned about a lot of economists, their various ideas, their role in economics, and how economic ideas adapted over time.",
                "I learned about various Nobel prize winning economic ideas and economists. I also wrote a 12-page paper on William Vickrey and congestion pricing, so I learned about his life and work. I also got greater insight into how the Nobel Prize committee works and how they select the winners.",
                "I learned a lot fo fundamental economics theory",
                "I gained a solid foundation in the variety of perspectives which have come together to found modern economic thinking. I benefitted from the opportunity to explore the work of one economist of my choice in greater depth through the final project.",
                "I learned a lot about a wide assortment of economic concepts. Because we devoted one class period to each economist's main contributions, I felt that I was able to get a pretty deep understanding of many ideas. It helped in my Microeconomics class, as we went over some of the concepts (such as the prisoner's dilemma, the lemons problem, adverse selection, etc.) in great detail during the seminar before I learned about them in my lectures.",
                "I learned many topics and concepts through the study of several Nobel prize winners in various fields. I also learned more about Yales own economic research and merits.",
                "I learned a lot about the real world applications of economics.",
                "I learned about a ton of different economic theories and concepts",
                "I was able to learn a lot about economics from a more theoretical perspective as opposed to lots of math and formulas.",
                "I think I learned an enormous amount of information about modern economic theory, and how it progressed over time, and what evidence and data helps support or reject various theories.",
                "I learned a lot about economic ideas and concepts in an expansive manner. In my previous experience with economics, I had only learned about basic micro and macroeconomics, but not so much about theories or different ideas surrounding economics, so this class provided me with stronger background knowledge about economics."

                "I like the format of the class. I always knew what needed to be done, never felt rushed, where to find all the materials, and was learning consistently. A weakness was the level of engagement from the other students in the class. I think maybe there should've been a no laptop policy.",
                "I think the readings were the strength of this course. They were concise, but very helpful for understanding the lectures and doing the quizzes.",
                "Would have been nice to have more discussion like a traditional seminar course.",
                "The course was easy to follow and presented many interesting and applicable ideas",
                "Professor Espin Sanchezs curriculum and skilled teaching were the big strengths of this course. The readings and class presentations were incredibly interesting; Professor Espin-Sanchez provided us with a nuanced understanding of the complex, in-depth theory behind these economists work, as well as concise examples so we could see how modern theories apply to real-world situations.",
                "The course offered a great overview of economic concepts while still being accessible to first-years with limited experience with economics. The course material was well-structured to grow more challenging as time went on. The weekly quizzes ensure that students keep up with the material. A possible improvement would be in having quizzes for the student presentations as well to encourage more attentive listening.",
                "The lecture format was quite monotonous and I would have enjoyed more class participation in the seminar style.  But the weekly quizzes were excellent way of assessing my knowledge and the final paper was a great way to dip my toe in the water of economic research.",
                "The strengths of this course are that the topics themselves are very interesting, however it's taught in a very non-interactive format. All of the class sessions felt more like a lecture rather than an interactive seminar. Given this was in part due to low class participation but one way it could be improved is if the topics were taught in a more enthusiastic and interactive manner.",
                "It is very interesting but the class could be structured in a way that is more discussion and less powerpoints.",
                "Strengths were class was easy to follow content and understand concepts. This made it easy to apply for assignments. Weaknesses were hard to understand professors accent",
                "A strength is that this course is very organized and easy to understand what is expected of you. A weakness is it feels more like a lecture than a seminar.",
                "The teacher was a great communicator and was clearly passionate about the material. Also, I thought it was a health workload. I am not sure of any weaknesses.",
                "The class was very easy and had little work. The content was interesting, but the professor mostly lectured and it wasn't formatted to facilitate student engagement.",
                "This course was manageable, fit well into my schedule amongst my other classes, and it was well-organized. However, it was not always super fascinating and it was easy to stop paying attention in class."

                "I would recommend this course to any student who has never done economics (like myself). It is a good over view of concepts without having to focus too much on mathematical formulas.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they don't have very much experience with economics, and want to learn a base level knowledge about the most important contributions to the field throughout history. If someone has a more advanced knowledge of economic ideas, they may find this course boring.",
                "Yes, it was a pretty easy social science credit but didn't feel like a complete waste of time.",
                "Yes, it is very applicable to other fields",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in the ways in which economics applies to modern life. Professor Espin-Sanchez is an incredible teacher  I would highly recommend that anyone who has the chance to study with him take that opportunity!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student to become more well-versed in economic concepts and, in some cases, explore the history behind them.",
                "Yes. The workload to interest level ratio was very small and I loved the course. Jose was a great Professor too! Witty and knowledgeable.",
                "No I would not recommend this course to another student because although it was relatively easy to take and course load was very light, I don't feel like I came out of the class having learned a lot. This was partly due to the teaching style, sometimes the material felt a bit rushed or not properly explained. A lot of how the professor explained topics felt incoherent and difficult to follow.",
                "I would. It is a great way to start learning general knowledge of economics and teaches you to think like an economist.",
                "Yes absolutely it is all the interesting things about economics without the math and boring concepts as it is taught from the perspective of the person who came up with the Nobel prize worthy ideas. Additionally the workload is extremely low with only a final essay and project on a concept you want to research and learn about.",
                "Yes, to people who want to see if they are interested in economics but dont have any prior knowledge about it. A great supplement to ECON 115 and 116 as well as a good stand alone class.",
                "Yes, definitely. It is an excellent way to learn about modern economic theory and influential people in the field.",
                "Yes if you want an easy but also interesting class. Some prior knowledge in Economics will be helpful in understanding some of the economic ideas covered.",
                "Yes because it's a good way to fulfill a distributional requirement without significant effort and allows students an introduction to economic ideas."
