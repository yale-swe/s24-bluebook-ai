This class also gave an in-depth understanding of labor histories and an expansive perspective on how British colonization changed racial dynamics across the world.",

It also played a lot with different mediums of creating history including contemporary music, rap, documentaries, and even art.",

                "The wide range of geographies and time periods covered in this course allowed for a richer understanding of how South Asian migration intersected with questions of law, citizenship, colonialism, and decolonization, and the selections of readings covering books from history, anthropology, sociology, and fiction, as well as primary material provided a great basis for discussion.",
                "In the beginning of the semester the readings were quite dense and overwhelming, so I really appreciated when the weekly readings were broken up, and students were allowed to pick one or two to focus on. I enjoyed how this led to small group discussions and presentations during class. This was a great opportunity to truly understand and analyze one reading in depth, while also gaining broad information about the other readings. While I appreciated how Professor De cut down and adjusted the readings to be flexible in this semester, at times it was frustrating to have the readings so much in flux, making it difficult to get ahead on the readings, since the syllabus would be changed on almost a weekly basis. Just a little advance notice on reading changes would be appreciated!",

A little background knowledge in South Asian history would definitely be beneficial before taking this class.
