                "I became a much stronger reader and writer through this course. Alongside these skills I developed more confidence in critically thinking about the political foundations which featured in several of the texts. By comparing different authors and their ideas on the relations between the leader and the individual or the individual and the state I made strong connections between texts and was able to extrapolate those skills to different questions. This course also made me question how history is taught and recorded. Overall, by taking this course I became more comfortable asking questions of various historical and political texts and became a much stronger writer.",
                "I really learned how to analyze and compare historical and political thought across the ancient era. This course taught me how to identify big themes that different historical authors addressed across time, the influence their own point of view had on conveying certain messages and connections between various authors that served to further my understanding of how historical thought evolved over time.",

                "It seemed like this was another aspect of DS philosophy, the distinctions between this class and Phil blurred. There were even shared readings and authors, which is understandable but at least this semester I wanted more historical context and actual events than I actually gotan emphasis on human nature and humans in society but not a lot on how it all plays out in the real world. I hear that next semester it's going to get even more abstract.",
                "I would have liked more diversity in the reading list.",
                "I appreciated how my professor used breakout rooms to break up class time, and that he was very engaged in with our discussion posts and seminar conversations. He also gave helpful feedback on my papers and made himself available for additional support through office hours.",
                "Historical and Political thought was by far my favorite course of DS. The course fosters a variety of strong and interesting discussions, prompts critical and analytic thinking, and has ample opportunities to make connections and comparisons between historians, themes, and differing ideas on how a society should operate. At times some of the readings overlap with the DS philosophy readings which provides a nice break from the heavy reading load, but at times makes it feel like some authors have double the air time as others.",
                "Some strengths of this course were definitely Professor Nakhimovsky who always posed really interesting questions and had engaging activities ready to for each class. He is always willing to help out and just talk about ideas during office hours and really guided the discussion in class. He had a really good balance between guiding while not being too overbearing and still allowing us to bring up our own ideas and questions about the text. A weakness would probably be the sheer amount of reading we had to do for this class; it simply was not feasible some weeks to be able to read everything and then sometimes, even when we would read everything, we would only focus on a small snippet of the reading in class which was frustrating. This course could maybe be improved by providing a little more background information about each text or some guiding questions before we start reading, because sometimes there were big jumps in time periods and eras that were hard to keep track of making it difficult to understand the context of the works.",
                "The strengths were that there was a clear progression of topics, and a weakness was that there was not much background knowledge mentioned. In other words, we werent given overviews of the history of certain countries and instead relied directly on the texts.",
                "The only weaknesses I can think of with this course is a somewhat unbalanced syllabus. Sometimes we were reading two texts in one week which did not give us enough time to dive into them deeply. On the other hand, there were some texts on which we spent multiple weeks.",
                "This was my favorite course of the fall semester; Professor Nakhimovsky is amazing. This course had great lectures given by the various DS-affiliated professors, but the standout element was our class discussions. They were always thoughtful and engaging and helped me more fully understand the often difficult texts we read. The workload, of course, was pretty heavy, but DS professors make a good faith effort to help you balance the courseload.",
                "The only weakness was that we spent too little time on each text, but DS is known for this.",
                "The professor was fantastic, as were the texts, but some of said texts felt ill-suited for history and politics. Maimonides and City of God (which I loved) felt more philosophy oriented. Maimonides could be replaced, and COG could be only one day, with more selected readings. I say this as like the only person who completed the COG readings haha. It was great, but much of it was theological (so much on astrology!) rather than a discussion of the Christian state. I do think it should remain in the curriculum, but I may be biased because of how fantastic Professor Freedman's lecture was.\r\n\r\nI think the material and organization was better at the start of the semester (although maybe we didn't need to spend so long on the Republic when we had already read it in Philosophy). After Tacitus, everything we read was focused on the \"Thought\" instead of the history\/politics. The two non-Christians, Augustine, and Aquinas were all read consecutively, and it felt a lot like the philosophy section. I would have liked more analysis like Polybius's, and also more biographical\/documentary works like those of Plutarch and Thucydides.",
                "Group discussions were great, and having zoom rooms in small groups created a better perspective and understanding of the authors that we read. The political thought aspects were that much more confusing and I felt like in between Rome and the rest of the time, there was no real comparison to civilizations- though that's more on the authors of the time. I think there was a lot of time spent on Plato, while we could have spent more time on either Polybius or Plutarch. I did enjoy all the discussions and the authors themselves."

                "I think this course was well adapted.",
                "In my DS Historical and Political thought each class often had a break out room with a central question to discuss as a group. This helped keep class going and often lead to really insightful and enjoyable discussions with my peers. Having these break out rooms with central questions also allowed more people to discuss during seminar as each group elaborated and explained their answers to the central question. Sometimes these breakout rooms also asked to do more than listing ideas and at times we did drawings and comparisons which made for a really engaging time in class.",
                "Professor Nakhimovsky adapted the class really well for the COVID-19 pandemic. We used google slides and breakout rooms quite effectively to focus on a question in a small group and them come together as a class to discuss everyone's ideas. We also had daily check-ins with Google Forms and weekly discussion posts on Canvas that we talked about at the beginning of each class that was a really good way to start thinking about the reading\/subject of the day\/week.",

The reading load is very heavy though which is something to consider. Historical and political thought was definitely my favorite class of DS because there were so many topics to dive into from the actual telling of history, to the power of custom, to political organization and so much more.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. While I wasn't the most interested in this ancient history when I decided to take DS, it was definitely really rewarding and more engaging than I thought it would be. The ideas we study and analyze with Herodotus and custom and Tacitus with tyranny are still concepts and themes that we see relevant today, but it is also interesting to see how they shaped history. Professor Nakhimovsky was an amazing professor as well and I would definitely take his class again!",

DS is a stressful course that focuses on the humanities aspects and the reading and writing week after week can be very stressful to do all of the time so I suggest a real love for all things classical if you are interested in reading these books."
