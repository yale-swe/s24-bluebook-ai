                "This course could not be improved. It is wonderful as-is. The harder PSETs allow deep engagement with the material, and there is SO much wonderful support in this course, lead by Professor Steinacker, TAs, and peer tutors!",
                "This course explored many difficult-to-grasp concepts that made it hard at times to remain interested, but the community of peers in the class made it much easier to easily digest the material. I think this course definitely needs more teaching fellows for office hours, as it became difficult at times to get assistance from only the professor.",
                "Strengths: Professor is very nice, supportive, and good at explaining dense concepts. Problem sets and exams were manageable, and helped improve my understanding of the concepts from in class. The TF\/peer tutor team was also very helpful during office hours. Weaknesses: None that stood out.",
                "Strengths: Professor Steinacker's homework always did a great job of testing my understanding of the material. I always felt like I learned the material again from the problem sets, which I believe is the goal. I also appreciated that she decreased the number of required questions this semester, as it helped me spend more time actually understanding the problems instead of rushing to finish all of them. Study hall was also extremely useful, especially because I could not attend Professor Steinacker's office hours. Lectures are also another joy--Professor Steinacker knew us all after last semester, so class was a lot more relaxed and fun, and she is such a kind-hearted, good-humored soul. \r\nWeaknesses: None! This course was more difficult than PHYS 180, but better taught and more enjoyable to me!",
                "I genuinely cannot think of weaknesses of the course; it is exceedingly well organized and formatted to optimize student learning both in and out of the classroom, between the work that Prof. Steinacker does to organize her lectures and the 10+ office hours that are available for students to attend if they have questions.",
                "Potentially adding optional section could be helpful for the course?",
                "The strengths of this course is how well taught it is, but its weakness is how time consuming the workload can be but it's understandable when you need to learn so much content.",
                "This course is yet another Prof. Steinacker SLAY. Hands down one of the best professors at this university, especially in stem.",
                "This course is one of the best courses I have ever taken, the professor makes the content very engaging and is very patient with all her students during office hours if there are any unanswered questions. The materials are ordered well, with the PSETs graded before each midterm and the final. Also, at least 2 review sessions are held for everybody before the exams.",
                "-Steiny is a clear strength\r\n-very well organized and tons of resources\r\n-midterms not worth a lot but homeworks are",
                "If a student goes to every lecture, reads the review notes after that lecture, and still cannot correctly answer a single question on a problem set, something needs to change. I found this course ridiculously time intensive and difficult for a prerequisite, introductory physics course. I understand that a grade distribution has to be established, but what I don't understand, is why this class took so much time away from the classes in my actual major. It just simply is not necessary. The lectures are great! The lecture notes are fantastic! But the problem sets suck! Some potential improvements include: limiting the number of pset problems to 3-5 a week; writing problems that start easy and are just an application of lecture notes, then increasing the difficulty in later problems.",
                "This is one of the best courses I've taken. Along with 180 I've learned more about physics that I would have I think in any other introductory physics course. It is so logically taught and it is evident that Steinacker created, honed, and breathed life into this course. I came into sophomore year hating physics, even into 181 not liking it very much. I hit a point in this semester when I realized I had become good at it, and I actually enjoyed being able to do the problems. I did not think this was possible. Yes the course is difficult. 180 kicked my ass. But I also learned a lot, and with enough effort improvement is inevitable. I think its also graded fairly as the homework is worth the most, and the midterms are worth relatively little and corrections are offered. The only way I think the course would be improved is to get rid of the in class participation questions or not weight them as heavily. I don't feel like students should be penalized through their grade for not making it to a lecture, but I understand she wants high attendance.",
                "great Professor. No complaints this semester!",
                "Well done course. Lots of out of class opportunities and ways to get a good grade.",
                "Strengths: Adriane. Steinacker. That's it. She makes this course what it is, and she does a fantastic job at doing it. I think the course is very well organized and has a nice flow of information, and the peer tutors are very helpful during office hours to help solve homework problems and resolve general content questions. \r\nWeaknesses: The homeworks are lengthy and difficult, but it's worth it in the end to get a good grasp on problem-solving. I think the only weakness I can think of is that the teaching fellows aren't as helpful as the peer tutors, and can sometimes even be a little bit condescending when it comes to explaining stuff, but that's not a norm. Generally have had better help coming from undergraduate students.",
                "The problem sets are very lengthy and it is rare to complete them without going to several office hours.",
                "The lectures could be confusing, but the professor is so sweet and the lecture notes she posts afterwards are so helpful that it never really becomes an issue.",
                "Strengths: Instructor is very engaged with students, lots of available office hours and support for the psets\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would be nice if the course made it clearer which point in the course would be on the final or not.",
                "The course is great as Prof. Steinacker is engaging, excited about the material, and good at explaining. It is hard, however, to stay focused when she just does problems on the board. I know there are time restaints but I think the class can gain a lot if we worked with the people next to us more often on solving a problem ourselves before we go over it as a class. I know that this is what the PSETS are for, but I find myself often just copying down what she writes on the board without understanding it",
                "This is an absolutely phenomenal course; the teaching team is so passionate, and Professor Steinacker is an incredible instructor and person. The class has really evolved from prior years in a positive direction (for instance, having 4 mandatory p-set problems instead of 5-6). This evolution has been a great strength of the course in making it more accessible and manageable while still keeping the challenge and value that come from engaging with physics.",
                "The course is very well organized and I received help or guidance almost every day! At the end of the semester, I felt that I learned so much and had a great time engaging with the discussed topics. We had many office hours and sessions that may further help the students review once again, more in detail, the concepts discussed during the lectures, or work in teams on ideas for the problems on the assignments, or simply discuss interesting topics in classical and modern Physics. All the problem sets tested rigorously the understating of the material and developed my creativity in finding a solution to a problem.",
                "The time is taken to explain concepts thoroughly, and she goes through complicated examples so that you can see how they are applied. Lowkey, there is no way this class could be improved.",
                "Strengths: Lecture is pretty well taught, and the lecture notes are helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Not much additional support for preparing for exams.",
                "This course is clearly designed over years of work and it shows. It is well designed at getting students to understand concepts in physics, at least as presented by Prof Steinacker. As long as TAs and ULAs continue to be supported to support this class, it is excellent",
                "I think the greatest strength of this course is the ample support that is offered. Office hours are held Monday-Friday for 2-3 hours, and additional study hall sessions are offered by peer tutors during five evenings of the week.",
                "I thought the course was incredibly strong in total. I found that the rigor of the psets properly prepared me for the exams and did a good job of cementing the information.",
                "This course was very challenging. The psets were very hard and it pushed me to understand the intricacies of physics. The workload was very high and a lot of time had to be spent outside of class.",
                "It was too advanced for general physics. I won't need half of this in my further studies. There is an advanced physics course for this type of physics.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. Professor Steinacker cares a lot about each student and does everything possible to ensure that her students succeed in the course. There are a lot of opportunities to attend office hours and study hall, and the exams (although challenging) are very fair.",
                "Strengths: This course was taught very passionately and in much computational detail. I love the insistence on really focusing on a problem, working through it, and using it as a tool for learning. This sort of deep learning through problem solving was thoroughly impressed upon me from this class. Additionally, the frequency of office hours and peer tutoring was phenomenally helpful. I loved the emphasis on collaboration with classmates. The lectures were also taught with such passion, and while there was significant time spent computing and proving the origin of certain equations, the rst of the time was spent in productive marvel at the beauty and mysteriousness of the physics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The arrangement of the concepts was sometimes a little unclear. For example, before transitioning from \"finding the magnetic field due to some particular object\", to \"finding the magnetic force of some object on another\" (from force to field), it would have been helpful for the distinction between those two topics to be verbalized simply and clearly (just to help students compartmentalize and process as they learn). Without this, some new topics or specific equations could feel a bit 'random' at times. And when content feels random, it immediately becomes more intimidating, uninteresting, and \"out of reach\".",
                "Professor Steinacker is the greatest stength of this class. She is fabulous and such a great professor. Her lectures are engaging and fun and she is so helpful in office hours. Another strength is that psets are worth a lot of the grade and you can get them checked in office hours also you can get half of your points back with revisions on the exams.",
                "Professor Steinacker is a very caring teacher who wants her students to do well and learn a lot. She went a little easier on us this semester with problem sets, but I had a harder time learning the material this time compared to mechanics.",
                "This course benefited from the ample study hall and office hours opportunities. I greatly appreciated that I could always go somewhere for help.",
                "Strengths : office hours and homework!!!",
                "Strengths: So so interesting!! Loved this class, very organized and lots of resources for help.",
                "My only qualm would be that the lectures are often too fast-paced for me to keep up, especially when a lot of new material is presented in weeks when there are exams.",
                "Strengths: Adriane Steinacker is an incredible professor. She expects a lot from us, but she provides us the support to achieve a lot. I appreciate how available her office hours and study halls are. She is a great lecturer. \r\nWeaknesses: It's a tough course, but that is natural for the subject matter.",
                "Great visual demonstrations.",
                "Strengths: Professor Steinacker!! She is the kindest, most caring professor I have ever had at Yale. She is an amazing and engaging lecturer and is extremely accommodating. The class is also very well-organized with detailed notes posted after each lecture. I didn't always follow what was happening during the lectures, but reading the notes on Canvas really helped my understanding. As someone who had never taken a single physics class before and last took calc 3+ years ago, Steinacker provides all the information you need to succeed in this class. There is also a TON of support throughout the semester- office hours offered almost every day of the week, study halls at night, etc. The PSETs are hard, but if you attend office hours or study halls they are completely doable. I left the class feeling like I had truly learned a lot and become a better student overall. You also have the option to do test corrections and get 50% of the points back on the midterms, which takes some stress off of them. Steinacker's review sessions were also really helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: PSETs were difficult, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. They really test your knowledge of the material and help you practice the concepts. Classes went a bit fast and were at times hard to follow (but lecture notes are helpful when you need to catch up).",
                "Great class! Professor Steinacker is wonderful and the class is structured very well.",
                "Always people available to help you. Whether it be the peer tutors or professor herself, someone can always help.",
                "The course is consistent in its homework and midterm strategies, which people get prepared for via Physics 180 in the fall semester.",
                "Strengths:\r\nAttention to students via Professor, Study Halls, and Task",
                "Very well laid out, clear, and expectations are clear. The material is made incredibly accessible, it is easy to get help, and the tests are written well based on the class material. i really can't find any weaknesses.",
                "It would be good to have TFs on all night time study hall days rather than just the weekdays. I found them more helpful than peer tutors",
                "I think that the plethora of office hours is the greatest strength of this course. The OH were amazing in that the TFs would always aid students, however I did find that these OH were less helpful than PHYS 180 OH. I also think that Professor Steinacker's problem sets this semester felt at times more difficult than in PHYS 180 but that could have been due to the fact that many students have a background in mechanics rather than E&M when entering college.",
                "Lectures are sometimes hard to follow, but the office hours help solidify any topics that you may have issues with",
                "Professor Steinacker is incredible, and her office hours and the study halls are really helpful. The course is well organized, and the lecture notes and lecture videos are great. There aren't any weaknesses.",
                "lecture notes are solid",

                "This is a required course for most STEM majors. It's a tough sell to take this for fun. The class definitely teaches a lot, but there are better ways to learn this material. Many pset problems seem unnecessarily difficult and tedious compared to what is tested on exams. It will take a lot of work to gain a true appreciation for electricity and magnetism, and you won't get much from half-assing this class.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to someone else! The skills you learn here are transferrable, and engagement in this class allows you to not only understand physics more but gain life-appliable tactics to succeed. (Also, the professor is so kind that meeting her is a real pleasure.)",
                "Yes, you get a lot more out of learning physics, but the psets involve a lot of calculus.",
                "With Prof. Steinacker, absolutely",
                "I would recommend this course to another student simply because of Prof Steinacker. She facilitates learning in a unique way that allows for us to become much more fluent in physics than any course I've taken.",
                "Yes. Even if it's not a requirement for you, the material is interesting and the professor is great.",
                "Absolutely, especially if Professor Steinacker is teaching it! I had a few friends who took PHYS 181 without Professor Steinacker, and from what I heard, my experience was considerably better than theirs because of Professor Steinacker. She does a great job of going through lecture at a quick pace but offering plenty of opportunities to clarify material. The workload was also a bit more manageable than PHYS 180 (due to the slightly shorter problem sets), which also made the class better than PHYS 180 I think.",
                "Absolutely would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning more about E&M in a challenging but incredibly supportive environment. You will learn a lot and have countless opportunities to think critically about the material while also building community with fellow students, peer tutors, and TFs who act as resources in the course.",
                "Yes this course is wonderful and Prof. Steinacker is a very rare and wonderful sort of teacher who guides you through a physics journey that is difficult but very possible for anyone",
                "Probably not if it wasnt required for their major.",
                "I would recommend taking it. Most people need it as a major requirement, but it is well taught and resources for help are readily available.",
                "Yes, with Prof. Steinacker this course was a treat.",
                "I would 100%",
                "Yep, well taught and organized. Homeworks do take a bit of time tho",
                "No, absolutely not. For an introductory physics course, it was completely unnecessary. Prerequisite courses should never be this time consuming. Difficult, sure, but time consuming because of contrived mathematical tricks in problem sets and tests? Definitely not.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in physics. I don't really think people coming in with advanced physics backgrounds should skip this class either. This forms a very strong foundation for future physics. That being said, people taking it only for a requirement, especially premeds, should not take this course and opt for the lower level physics course. Engineering majors have to take this course so to them I would recommend to put in the work early and try to learn the most out of it.",
                "yes. Take this over 171 if you are stuck. It is a more formal class, and you will feel better for it.",
                "If you want to learn physics, this course is for you. Great professor and good vibes.",
                "Absolutely, though I'm assuming you have to. If you are deciding between 171 and 181, take this course  trust me. It is worth it for Prof. Steinacker alone. She is so passionate about this course, and you will definitely not regret taking this. You learn a lot in a pretty short amount of time, and it could be just that I disliked kinematics, but I found that this course was more interesting and applicable.",
                "No, unless you are a physics major and have taken multi variable calculus (this should be a prerequisite).",
                "Yes, but make sure you have a good understanding of calculus beforehand!",
                "Yes, I enjoyed the problem solving process for the psets and I liked collaborating with my peers.",
                "Yes, its an important Physics class. You make friends in office hour as everyone works on them together. The material is very interesting",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Steinacker is a one-of-a-kind instructor and person; truly the finest STEM professor at Yale. Her lectures are so engaging, fun, and interesting. The sheer amount of passion and dedication she has motivates us to work harder and is honestly very, very inspiring. I am not even planning to go into STEM after college, and this has been an invaluable course for me. There is a lot of rhetoric that surrounds this class and grading. If you're asking if it's an easy A, the answer is no. But you don't take this class because it will be easy. You take it because of Professor Steinacker and to have the chance to learn from easily the best STEM professor at Yale. Physics is hard, but it is not impossible. As Professor Steinacker says: \"You can do it!\"",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, because it represents a backbone in the Physics\/Sciences major, developing interesting and engaging problems and discussions around fundamental, vital concepts in the field! The course developed my critical thinking and I learned skills useful in life and in many adjacent STEM fields.",
                "Yes. For most people taking it, it is required, but the amount of help and time dedicated to this course by the professor helps immensely with the difficult nature of physics.",
                "Yes, but I wonder if PHYS201 or PHYS261 might be better if youre looking to learn physics for the sake of learning rather than getting requirements done.",
                "This class is one of the best I have taken at Yale. Steinacker is unlike any other professor  you can see how much she cares about teaching and the art of learning in everything that she does. I developed such a profound appreciation for math and the mechanics of physics through this course. This class is a lot of work, but I truly believe it is one of the most rewarding challenges you could take on academically at Yale.",
                "Yes if needed. I took it even though I could've taken 171 and it was still rewarding",
                "Yes!! I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Though the material can be tricky, ample support is provided to students, and the course is designed to encourage collaboration between students as they work on problem sets.",
                "I would recommend that another student take this course if they need it for their major or have any interest in learning about physics.",
                "Yes if it is a prerequisite or required for their major.",
                "No, nothing personal but this class contains more content than a general physics class should",
                "Yes! You learn a lot in this course, and it was a really great experience!",
                "I would recommend this course to a student fully dedicated to their pursuit of physics and with some background in Electromagnetism and\/or multivariable calculus. This is not a good class for someone who has never had a physics class (or never gone past AP Physics A), as there are certain assumptions made of familiarity of content. For example, I found myself just having to intuit what \"ds\/dr\/dt\" meant in each context because I was scared to ask outright for a while. When I finally did, the reasonings for when (and in what context) it is one versus the other, was made completely clear to me by a peer tutor and I never have felt confused by that again. However, if this had been conceptually explained at the beginning of the course (for maybe 5 minutes), it would have saved many students many hours of convoluted guessing on problem notation. I definitely felt frustrated and \"dumb\" in this course many times because of my lack of experience in electromagnetism, and seeing as even students who had taken AP Physics C struggled in the class, I'm not sure it's the best decision for those wanting to be introduced to physics in a way that doesn't scare them off. Additionally, it is hard to get by in this class if you don't have availabilities during weekday afternoons and evenings to spend hours working on the problem sets. I felt like the bulk of my real learning happened outside of class.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Steinacker is wonderful and the class is pretty interesting. There are so many help opportunities. If you happen to be like me and wondering if you can take 181 before 180, its doable. Office hours are the best part of this class, go to them!",
                "Yes, I would. Although I sometimes find Professor Steinackers problem sets unnecessarily challenging, and the way she introduces new concepts hard to follow along, she puts in extra effort to provide support to students struggling with the material. There is plenty of peer tutor and TF support all around, and she is very accommodating when we need to request extensions on problem set deadlines.",
                "Yes!!!",
                "Yes!! So interesting, but definitely recommend taking PHYS 180 in the fall before taking 181",
                "If they have a real interest in physics and are willing to put in a large amount of work, this is a really great introductory class. I didn't know any physics coming into the sequence, but I feel it was decently beginner-friendly but still generally intellectually challenging and stimulating for students of different levels.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially since Adriane curtailed her Psets from 6 problems a week to 4. This makes the workload far more manageable while still preserving the intellectual rigor of the course.",
                "Yes. Its a good course to learn intro physics.",
                "probably a req",
                "Yes! It may be daunting to take 180\/181 over 170\/171, but I truly think it is worth it. I had never taken physics before in my life, so I was very hesitant to take this course, but Steinacker is a great professor and you have a lot of support to succeed in this class. I think I have actually learned more in this class than any other class I have taken at Yale. I feel like in other classes I just memorize a bunch of information and regurgitate, but 181 genuinely taught me new things and has made me a better student as a result. I am very grateful that I took this class!",
                "Yes, any class with Professor Steinacker is worth taking",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student if they are in the 180\/181 track, or want to solidify their high school physics before moving on to more intensive subjects.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The course is very difficult and challenging but worth your time if you want to improve yourself as both a student as well as a future STEM Major Graduate.",
                "If they're interested in introductory physics, absolutely! There are ways to not make it heavy and bothersome so very good",
                "If its a requirement take it with Steinecker!",
                "I would, but only if required for a major. I think that this course is difficult and can be a lot of work (PSETs each week and studying for exams) but that you can learn a lot. I think that the dedication one would have if it were to be a required course helps to justify all of the work.",
                "Highly recommend for STEM students and those interested in the fundamentals on how the world works",
                "Yes",
                "Yes!! Professor Steinacker is one of the best instructors I've ever had. She is so dedicated and organized, and she really cares about the course and her students. The course is not easy, but there are so many office hours and study halls and resources (lectures notes and lecture videos), and you come out of it really feeling like you've learned something. If you can, go to Professor Steinacker's office hours!",
                "Only if they are truly interested in physics. I am not and would have taken the bio physics course 170 if my major allowed me to.",
                "only if required",
                "Yes, basic physics is necessary for most"
