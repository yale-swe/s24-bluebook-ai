I was able to read selected political science papers and see how those conclusions and theories were created as well as their impact on the rest of international relations. I was also able to apply the theory from the readings and history we learned in class to construct my own arguments during our final and midterm. Additionally, the new approach to teaching this course gave us hands-on experience with the experimentation side of political science with our own surveys and data collection projects.",

It also gave me a groundwork understanding of the purposes, developments, and functions of different international regimes and systems and introduced me to discussions about the nature of intervention, the rise of populism, the foundations of the liberal international order, and the character of interactions between democracies and autocracies, among other topics. This course also provides the opportunity for a great first experience in international relations experimentation and an understanding of how social science experiments are created, conducted, and interpreted.",

We learned about the key schools of thought in international relations and applied them to the world's most pressing issues today. We also used them to analyze historical topics in international affairs, such as World War I, World War II, the Cold War, and 21st century conflicts. I also gained valuable skills in data analysis through the two experimental design projects we conducted. This was a very interesting class and I gained significant insights into our modern international world.",
                "I developed a profound understanding of the foundation of international relations. David Allison is by far THE professor to take this course with. His world view, and experience certainly made this class a must take."

                "I felt the strengths of this course were the content as well as Professor Allison. He is a great lecturer and does a really excellent job presenting the material. However, I felt that my section discussion was not very helpful.",
                "strengths: i like how we do projects because it allows us to apply real world problems to what we have been learning weakness: at times it feels like what we are learning in class doesn't always translate to the questions on exam",

                "n/a",
                "I thought the lectures were very interesting and I enjoyed attending class. The weaknesses for me were that the professor spoke too quickly to take notes on the lectures. In addition, it felt as if the class could use some more logistical clarification. Both projects were each worth 20% of the overall class grade but the project guidelines were no more than 4 sentences.",
                "A good intro but heavily politicised to represent the views of the Professor which was uncomfortable at times",
                "Could be improved by having lectures also about Africa and South America. Can focus less on the World Wars and instead talk more about international relations in today's world.",
                "Strengths - material was very interesting, readings were solid (relevant both to class and current events), I found the professor's lectures engaging, and the theories/core ideas were well explained. Discussion section was lively and helpful. Weaknesses - needing to cite readings on the exam took away some from understanding the material and was tedious at times. While I learning about enjoyed about the military history aspects of IR, I feel like the course could have a little more variety (for instance, more time spent on international institutions/law, the role of espionage in international relations, the history of US backed regime change around the world, etc.)",
                "I liked the decision to emphasize the development of social science skills through the projects. I understand that this was the first year making that change and that there are some kinks that need to be worked out (making the deadlines for the experimental data project hard unless you have a legitimate excuse might be a good place to start to prevent delays), but I hope the emphasis is maintained going forward. I also think the lectures were engaging and well connected with the course readings, and, at least for Michael's section, sections did a good job of further diving into and teaching the material for the course in a way that improved understanding.",
                "Class is extremely boring. Not very interacting , just listening to the teacher read off the slides, no real need for the instructor. Section much more helpful then lecture.",
                "Strengths: quizzes, papers, tests\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: could have had more focus on international relations and politics of other countries rather than such a high focus on different warfare and gun types",
                "The lectures of this course are engaging and the course has a great range of material to draw on for the semester. This course has an interesting mixture of history, science, and social studies that make this a good introductory course for, not only political science students but also any student interested in the social sciences. This course is, however, in the process of making changes to its style of teaching with new elements such as the experimental survey project and the data collection project. While I enjoyed the process of making these, there are still kinks to iron out. For example, the experimental survey project was given quite early in the semester, before we had many topics to choose from. Still, the effort in teaching us and taking a risk on a new approach is greatly appreciated.",
                "One nice aspect was that the subjects were so broad and interconnected that by the end of the semester, I felt like I had a good understanding of the foundations of political science. However, sometimes it felt like it was so rigidly following a structure that it didnt maximise on engagement. For instance, the readings were restricted to just the theories and there wasnt much time spent on the relevance to current affairs.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Allison is a fantastic lecturer. Content was EXTREMELY interesting and I wished most classes were longer than 50 minutes. I also thought the projects were very well structured and the course itself was very well organized. The readings all had a clear purpose and were not overwhelming, especially because of Prof. Allison's organization system. Genuinely loved this course and I'm so happy I took it as a non-political science major. I especially loved the \"applied history\" portions of the course, as well as classes about nuclear policy, the rise of China, and the Russian war in Ukraine. Feedback from TFs was clear and extremely helpful and TFs were very accessible to students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Focus was often placed on Western history and Western schools of thought, though other narratives and ideas were included in the course. It would be nice if non-Western perspectives were more integrated into the main narrative of the course (ie if different ideas and histories were more frequently held in comparison/contrast with each other rather than using non-Western examples to support/reject Western narratives/ideas)",
                "The organization of the coursework was one of its major strengths. The must, should, could system of reading was incredibly helpful in facilitating the workload. However, I wish there was more of an emphasis on the history and present-day state of cooperation and the liberal international order, rather than military history and strategy.",
                "This course was very interesting, from the lectures, to the sections, to the majority of the readings. I really found the content as well as the professor to be incredibly engaging. The only thing that could maybe be improved would be the volume of readings since a lot of times what we learn in the lectures is the application of multiple readings that seemed to say the same thing, but maybe they could have been condensed in light of work load for all other classes.",
                "This course was not well-planned. Lectures were good, but the major assignments were not planned well and one should have been removed. Sections also seemed to vary greatly.",
                "Very engaging",
                "Overall an ideal introduction to IR. It does exactly what it sets out to do. I was impressed by how much it taught given how little work it required.",
                "More focus on fewer readings, very little feedback from TAs, projects were a bit meaningless",
                "Great course. I think data projects could be a bit more streamlined.",
                "Lectures too fast-paced for effective note taking.",
                "I think its a good course but sort of repetitive. We talk about the same topics a lot",
                "Heavy emphasis on military history as opposed to overview of international relations as a whole",
                "Strengths: Well taught, sections are interesting, TA's and the professor are great, broadly interesting readings, engaging lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing major, but a few of the readings were rather dry. This was more than offset by other readings that were fascinating.",
                "veery detailed\r\nthe statistical part wasnt explained well",
                "I really appreciated how the professor was very open to students asking questions or extensions, etc. Ive never asked myself but he showed that he was very understanding and encouraged students to come talk to him if they needed to.",
                "The strengths are the engaging lectures and content. Weaknesses are that the lectures sometimes felt disjointed.",
                "Strengths: Lectures are interesting and incredibly engaging, course material feels relevant and balanced (Professor Allison made a point to include information about current events in his lecture, which was fascinating), and Professor Allison cares deeply about both the success of his students and the material covered. Readings are also quite manageable and interesting, and the overall workload is not at all overwhelming. I especially appreciated the two projects, which gave me my first experience in political science experimentation and data collection/interpretation.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I definitely struggled with the online quizzes in this class, and felt that the strict time pressure made it hard to retrieve answers from my notes and limited my ability to demonstrate what I learned. I think I would have benefitted from a different quiz format (perhaps an in-person quiz during section), but overall this weakness is incredibly small compared to the strengths of the course.",
                "I really enjoyed the structure of this course. I feel as though it was very easy to follow and each lecture flowed from one to the next. The professor also typically introduced the topic of the upcoming lecture the week prior, so I always felt like I knew what was coming next and where I was supposed to be to remain on track. However, the formatting and releasing of the quizzes created a bit of a struggle for me. I felt that towards the end, we were a bit rushed to finish all the quizzes since there was such a lag between the first quiz (free points) to the second quiz and the second quiz to the third quiz. It was also difficult at moments because though the quizzes were meant to be fairly simply, the questions were sometimes very specific thus difficult to answer with such a short time limit. I wish the spacing between the quizzes would have been a bit more consistent and there would not have been a time limit on  the quizzes.",
                "This course is very reading heavy, most of which I feel was not discussed or engaged with during class and discussion; however, the course did provide a good overview of International Relations.",
                "Personally, I felt like a lot of this course was review for me because of classes I had previously taken. I did enjoy how the lectures clearly taught concepts and gave context to those concepts.",
                "I thought the lectures were engaging and the evaluations were fair. I think my discussion section could have been significantly improved. The readings were quite long and it meant most of my section didn't complete them at all- most of our \"discussions\" were sitting in silence, listening to our tf summarize a reading, or watching our tf correct another student's summary of a reading.",
                "I think we could spend more time China and how they their influence around the world at the expense of the U.S. and the potential implications this may have in the future.",
                "The course was organized very well and easy to follow. Each lecture featured a different topic and the two lectures every week were related so the content did not feel very rushed. PLSC 111 also used a very helpful system to organize its readings, categorizing them into \"must readings,\" \"should readings,\" and \"could readings.\" This system allowed me to focus on the most important readings and saved a lot of time. The lectures and sections were great reviews for the readings but also introduced new topics. I also appreciate how Professor Allison spent time each lecture to discuss any arising international relations news that happened that week. One way the course could be improved is to have more resources about ways to engage in international relations studies at Yale and beyond. Much of the content taught was theoretical, which is understandable since this is an intro class, but more information about ways to apply it and put it into practice would be nice.",
                "Strengths: The TF staff clearly wanted to work with him, so they were very motivated for their students to do well. I would also say that the reading list was very good, and if you read (which you really should) made the course all the more interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: If you take this class with Allison you will have to do two projects. Although I can see the application of the projects to field work in political science, I would say that the expectation were not that clear. I think that there could have been more than just a canvas post to describe the requirements and expectations for these two summative assignments."

                "Yes. I think the course provided a good overview of the field of international relations and a helpful introduction to the practice of being a social scientist as well. Professor Allison's also a funny, interesting lecturer and the course is definitely designed to be accommodating of newcomers to the field and low stress.",
                "Yes I would. Would just give them a preface warning.",
                "Absolutely, I think every student should take this class so that they know the world we live in and have a basic understanding of human governmental history.",
                "Some students may find that they aren't particularly interested in the topics of focus such as world wars, nuclear politics, etc. This is no one's fault, but it is something to have in mind before selecting the course. For students who do find themselves interested in the politics of the world, this course is easily the best one for learning a bit about all the major global issues and finding out which one you may want to focus on learning about. It serves the function of an introductory course perfectly. This course is also very fun to be in. The 50-minute lectures by David Allison leave you feeling more knowledgeable without feeling tired or overwhelmed.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes! I genuinely loved this course and Prof. Allison is an amazing lecturer. I frequently left the lecture hall wanting to discuss content and questions Prof. Allison had posed us. I found this class to be extremely engaging because of --- rather than in spite of --- it's lecture format.",
                "Yale students interested in how military history and strategy should absolutely take this course. For students seeking a more comprehensive look at world history and the cooperation of international relations, this is not the course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course because it was engaging, applicable, and overall interesting. Professor Allison was a great lecture giver, and the content that we learned about was very interesting because it can be seen in the world today and also has a healthy amount of history associated with it so it expands both modern and historical knowledge.",
                "Perhaps if you need a gut or it's a requirement. You learn some IR theory, but the assignments do not match with the subject of the class. You could probably just read the syllabus readings and learn what you need. Take this class if you are okay with doing a major assignment during spring break.",
                "Yes. Course was very interesting",
                "Absolutely, it is not very demanding but teaches many important facts.",
                "Yes, great course, thoroughly enjoyed the lecture",
                "Yes. Important course to take in a very important field!",
                "Absolutely! Fantastic pick for a poly sci course that explains theory, history, and present day.",
                "Yes, if theyre interested in international relations",
                "Not necessarily  not very interesting and the coursework does not go very in depth",
                "I would. Anyone interested in foreign policy or world history (particularly military history or the history of international relations) should take this class. I thought it was informative, engaging, and provided a good framework for analysis.",
                "Yes, I would. It's a great class that is both relevant to the times as well as teaches theory.",
                "yep, its good",
                "Yes, most definitely. The class is not all about just history or current issues; it teaches you the importance of learning all different perspectives so even if it isnt a major requirement, its a good course to take.",
                "If they are trying to determine whether they might be interested in the field of international relations, then yes.",
                "Definitely. This is crucial information to anyone who is interested in politics or wants to understand how the world works",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning more about the ways in which states interact, but especially if they are interested in pursuing political science or global affairs and wish to learn more about those fields. This course really provided me with a strong foundational framework with which I could view the world of international relations, and it has informed both the ways that I analyze interactions between states and my approach in forming my own opinions about current international affairs.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if it is a major requirement. The course has a very organized structure and I enjoyed gaining experience conducting mini political science experiments.",
                "Yes, I enjoyed this course and would recommend it to a student who wanted to learn a basis for international relations and a foundation for overall political science.",
                "I would recommend this course. It is an interesting introduction to political science and a good survey course for those interested in international affairs.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in IR especially for anyone interested in conflict and its implications on international stage.",
                "Yes! I highly recommend this class to any student interested in global affairs or political science. It is a great introduction to a complex school of study and the topics we learned are very interesting and relevant to the modern world. I am now able to look at news articles and pinpoint/understand the undercurrent ideological and political forces at play.",
                "100 %."
