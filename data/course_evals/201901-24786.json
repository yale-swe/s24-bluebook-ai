    "I learned how to capably read Middle English and developed an appreciation and understanding of the general themes of medieval religious poetry.",
    "I read Piers Plowman and gained exposure to concerns, contexts, etc., surrounding Langland's text.",
    "This class reinforced skills of close reading and analysis, particularly because of the Middle English language of Piers Plowman. It was a slow process of going line by line through a long work, but it definitely was worth it.",
    "I developed a much greater ability to read and understand Middle English. A more in-depth understanding of the traditions of writing about religion."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths are Professor Lawler's expertise; in many ways, he \"wrote the book\" on Piers Plowman. He's very well versed in other Piers Plowman scholarship, and when time comes to write a paper, he has a strong repertoire of sources to direct you to. If you like seminar discussions to use the text as a departure point to discuss other things, you might find it a weakness that the course sticks very closely to Langland's writing.",
    "The class thrived because of Professor Lawler. He came in everyday with spectacular passion for the subject and fostered an excellent seminar atmosphere.",
    "Sometimes the reading segments were fairly long and hard to get through, but overall a well taught course. Prof Lawler is very engaged and invested in the class and very dedicated to his students."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Lawler is very knowledgeable and attentive, the best person to teach a text as difficult as Piers Plowman.",
    "If you're interested in medieval lit, I couldn't recommend it enough! Piers Plowman is a weird, funny, difficult, surreal poem, and you'll have your brain stretched.",
    "I would, especially for a medieval requirement! We had a comfortable seminar environment.",
    "This course is very much worth taking. It definitely is an intense foray into Middle English. I struggled to familiarize myself with the language at times, but my comprehension of the overall poem was a firm takeaway.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in reading medieval poetry outside of Chaucer!"
