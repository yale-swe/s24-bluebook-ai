                "The course is strongest when it focuses on application and tracing regulatory pathways, and at its weakest when bogged down in memorization of specific details. The material is dense and at times the course moves quickly. However, the small class size and discussion sections served as a major benefit to the class, as these enabled real opportunity for student-led discussion and problem-solving.",
                "This course was fascinating, well-organized, and engaging. There were very few weaknesses the tests did vary dramatically in difficulty but this is honestly to be expected in a class taught by different instructors.",
                "journal papers can be challenging to read and discuss, but was necessary for me to eventually feel more confident reading them. enjoyed the video assignment and news and views assignment, very fun ways to wrap up our learning. the exams were inconsistent between all three professors, and all of them should be considered \"exams\" given their lengths rather than \"quizzes.\" TA review sessions were not helpful at all. i liked the format of discussion paper and lecture as it kept the lecture material manageable.",
                "The quizzes were really inconsistent with one another and there were limited resources provided to prepare for them.",
                "The instructors are very much the strength of this course. Profs. Jacob, van Wolfswinkel, and Dimitrova are incredibly kind and intelligent. They are each great lecturers and are very receptive to student needs. They work very well as a team, but one weakness was that there was often overlap between their separate parts of the course. This did really drive home certain points, but it could be repetitive sometimes.",
                "I liked the leminar format, definitely kept me engaged with the course material. Only thing was that the course was backloaded with assignments all near finals period."

                "Absolutely, if they have the prerequisite knowledge of genetics and\/or molecular mechanisms. The three professors are some of the best in the department, the material is fascinatingeverything from anti-aging and cancer therapies to a \"fraudulent\" discovery in the journal Natureand the relevance of the course content is very clear. This has been my favorite MCDB course so far.",
                "I absolutely would recommend this course. This was one of my favorite Mcdb courses that Ive taken.  I really enjoyed the format it was useful to have one interesting lecture that explained content and theory each week, and fun to have one discussion day. The material is fascinating and incredibly relevant, and unlike other MCDB courses where Ive had to discuss papers, I felt like this course actually made me comfortable understanding ans critiquing the experiments others performed. The quizzes are fair and actually reasonably interesting, and the teaching team is absolutely spectacular. Its really so amazing to have three wonderful professors in charge of a single course.",
                "yes! as someone who didn't feel too confident in genetics or reading scientific papers but nonetheless interested in the field, I'm surprised how much I was able to learn from a semester's worth of reading scientific papers and discussing figures with my peers. epigenetics is simply fascinating",
                "Definitely take the course if you are interested in epigenetics, it's a great course!",
                "I would recommend this class to other students because the material is very interesting, but warn that it is very difficult.",
                "Yes, definitely take this class if you are interested in epigenetics. One of my favorite MCDB classes I've taken.",
                "I would recommend the course to any MCDB major that wants a great learning environment to learn high level biology concepts and applications.",
