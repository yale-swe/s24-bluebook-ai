                "The strengths are all around: it is a rigorous and thorough introduction to Japanese. It must be the next best thing to learning Japanese outside of actually living in Japan. I think that the course could do more to teach and test on Japanese historical culture. I think a class visit to the Japanese art gallery in the YUAG wouldve been awesome",
                "Strengths: Lots of homework that allowed me to gauge my skill level and gain the practice needed for language learning, quality slideshows and lesson material that feels well thought-out and organic, high-energy classroom environment\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Due to the fast-paced nature of the course material and having to meet 5 days a week, this course can be a little unaccommodating to those who find it hard to keep up. Nishimura-sensei herself was always empathetic and accommodating, but the nature of the course can feel too rigorous for some.",

                "I would, but only if you have an interest in Japanese language learning. I loved my experience, but I can see how people who aren't interested in the Japanese language may struggle.",
                "Yes there were a lot of funny moments in the class, and I absolutely loved singing japanese songs together at the end. In the end, the students make the class fun so I would recommend this to anyone."
