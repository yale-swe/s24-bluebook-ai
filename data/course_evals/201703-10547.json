   "comments": [
    "The class does a good job at helping you be interested in the mechanisms and reactions you are learning. Real world applications like developing acetaminophen make a reaction much more memorable.",
    "It helped to improve my critical thinking during lab procedures, and helped me hone my lab skills in general. I think that the kind of care you develop in this class helps with research in general.",
    "I gained more comfort in the lab and got to actually apply organic chemistry concepts in a real-life setting. In general, I improved in my understanding of organic chemistry concepts. I also got much better at doing TLC, melt point, and IR techniques. Furthermore, I got a lot better at keeping my work station and lab notebook clean and organized as I worked.",
    "Basic lab skills in a lab",
    "This course helped reinforce techniques needed to work in an organic chemistry lab like reflux, vacuum filtration, and TLC.",
    "I learned lots of lab techniques and reinforced my knowledge of organic chemistry.",
    "I understood organic chemistry techniques better and learned more widely applicable skills relating to organization and paying attention to an experiment."

   "comments": [
    "This course does a good job at giving students freedom to think as scientists while in lab. However, I wish there had been better consistency and instruction amidst formatting for the post lab assignments.",
    "This class is mostly a very strong class -- very focused, and very interesting\/engaging. The one poor part of the class was the lack of clarity with grades, and the harsh grading by our TA this semester. Overall though, Dr. DiMeglio is great, and the experiments are interesting and challenging in a good way. It's not just turning a white powder into an off-white powder, it feels like real chemistry.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- Good focus on the concepts\r\n- Reinforces techniques learned in organic chemistry I\r\n- Helped refine techniques that I learned last semester\r\n- Fun to read scientific literature\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Didn't really learn any new techniques (we learned about NMR, but we didn't actually use it)",
    "Same as most labs. It's good for experience, though the final exam was rough",
    "This course overall is good, however, I wish it could be considered a full cole edit course.",
    "I feel the grading was too dependent on the final exam, and sometimes lab reports were graded really harshly which severely impacted grades. Grading also had very little to do with the actual work we did in lab which was frustrating.",
    "The course is designed to keep interest with different types of experiments each week. The readings assigned are informative and engaging. I think it would've helped a lot if we had been exposed to the multiple choice style questions in the final before the course. Also the formatting for the PLAs were sometimes confusing,  and having a more precise guideline would benefit a lot.",
    "Strengths:\r\n-good instructor and good TA, readily available, provided clear and useful feedback and explanations, very friendly and easy to approach with questions\r\n-clear instructions and procedures, good course packet\r\n-I appreciated the discussion of green chemistry, an important topic that I had never really considered before\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-I'm not sure if this is a weakness but the course pretty much felt exactly like the first semester. The only new\/different thing that I can remember is NMR (which we did only one class toward the end of the semester and then had multiple questions about it on the final) and some discussion of green chemistry. If possible, I would have liked to explore some new techniques besides first semester stuff like reflux, vacuum filtration, recrystallization, etc."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely take it! Dr. DiMeglio is awesome, and the experiments are cool!\r\n\r\nPlus, this is probably a pre-req for you.",
    "Prob wont have an option if youre taking it. Not exactly \"fun,\" but relatively painless!",
    "If said student planned to continue doing chemistry lab work, I would recommend it to them because this class can really help refine lab skills and technique.",
    "Dimeglio is awesome! Best teacher at Yale. How good the course is is based off of the TA you get though.",
    "Sure, if you're taking organic chemistry or need lab experience, this might be a good one to go with.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in lab work in the future.",
    "Orgo labs are always better than GenChem labs, but make sure to really study all of the exam study questions because the exam is a lot of your final grade.",
    "If it is required, it is a good course to take. But if you are not interested in learning the techniques\/it isn't required, the course is very specific and not very engaging for those not interested in organic chemistry.",
    "I wouldn't call it a \"must take\" (unless, of course, you must take it for your major), but still a good class if you enjoyed the first semester"
