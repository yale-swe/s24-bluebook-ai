While L3 Spanish mainly helped me review grammar concepts from high school and learn some new grammar concepts, L4 seemed to focus more on working on fluency and ability to communicate effectively rather than exact grammar concepts, although there was some focus on that as well. Every student in the class was required to get a free tutor through Yale CLS as well, which I thought was a good idea. Working with my tutor helped improve my speaking a lot. My writing also improved, as well as reading and listening skills. Overall, I was very pleased with how many Spanish progressed during this course.",

                "This thing where they up and decided that the students could just teach themselves a solid 40% of the coursework was the absolute dumbest thing they could have come up with. I realize the pandemic necessitated some changes, but this was the worst. If they're going to cut out nearly half the actual teaching, they should have cut out 40% of the requirements. Instead, we had to do 100% of the requirements with only 60% of the guidance. I was actually insulted when the professor suggested I come to office hours when the professors weren't even coming to 40% of the classes. They wanted me to get a tutor and spend EVEN MORE TIME on this when, again, the professors couldn't even be bothered to show up to nearly half the classes. The idea was stupid and insulting. Furthermore, and in general, cut out all the \"creative\" stuff from the course. I was there to learn Spanish, not to figure out how to edit a video or put sound effects in a podcast. The notion that I had to figure out how to put sound effects in to ensure I got a good grade in a class that had nothing to do sound design was infuriating. As long as I'm on a tear here, the book we had to read \"The Battles in the Desert\" was mind-bogglingly boring. And we spent like a month on it! It was a terrible book. Stop making me try to do literature analysis in a class that isn't about literature analysis, and if I DO have to do literature analysis, try to pick a book that is a numbing insight into the problems of children. I really want to emphasize this class and its design was terrible. Stick to the textbook. Stop trying to be creative. Anytime the course did something outside of the textbook is was heart-wrenchingly awful.",
                "Strengths: encouraged participation\r\nWeakness: so much homework, deadlines/assignment unclear",
                "Strengths: enthusiasm and energy of Professor Len, requirement to work with tutor, interesting material, positive environment to learn and work on Spanish, investment of Professor Len and her willingness to give her time to each student. Workload could get a bit heavy sometimes (sometimes it seemed a bit too heavy), but overall I think it was a good workload, not over-the-top but a pretty decent amount. I think it was the right amount of work considering the level of Spanish we were at and the level we were trying to reach.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes things seemed a little bit disorganized. There are a lot of small assignments so it is easy to accidentally forget or miss one. Because this course was on Zoom, we went into breakout rooms multiple times every class, and sometimes the breakout rooms were not very efficient without the professor being there to ensure things were running smoothly.",
                "I loved how Professor Leon encouraged speaking and participation. Great teacher and very willing to help you improve. I thought the exams were unnecessarily difficult. The practice exams weren't that helpful to prepare for the exams. I liked the exposure we got to hispanic/latinx culture and history through the podcasts, movies and stories etc. But, need more practice provided for the types of questions asked on the exams and quizzes. Felt like I was caught by surprise for some exams/quizzes and just freaked out during the allotted time.",

If you're going to cut 40% of the classes, then cut out 40% of the coursework. Ensure teachers start and end courses online. Actually put some thought into Zoom pedagogy instead of just half-assing it and hoping for the best. I would have gotten more out of just doing DuoLingo and y'all asking for status updates every once in a while.",
                "Professor Len's preparation for every class, with slideshows ready, etc. was great. That was a success. Going into breakout rooms was 50/50. Half the time it worked well, but the other half of the time people didn't know what to do or just didn't do very much. Breakout rooms are tough because you can't easily access the professor; in-person, you would be able to. I think breakout rooms were just kind of a \"necessary evil\" for learning during Covid. They were okay on the whole.",

If you go in with that goal and mindset, the course will help you improve, and you will enjoy it for the most part. If you don't go in with that mindset, however, it might start to feel like a slog with a lot of work. Professor Len is awesome, very helpful and a good teacher. If you're engaged and invested in the class, she will help you a lot. If you're not engaged and invested, though, you won't get as much out of the class.",
