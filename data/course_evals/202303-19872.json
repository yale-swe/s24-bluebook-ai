                "My skills in Spanish have definitely improved.  I've gained a lot more confidence when speaking and writing in Spanish throughout this course.  I also loved the emphasis that this course placed on culture and art-- I know that's included in the course name, but the depth with which we explored and analyzed artistic concepts from gastronomy to music to visual arts to literature and beyond was really pleasantly surprising.  Not only did I leave this course with a better grasp on communicating in the Spanish language, but I definitely feel that I have a much deeper knowledge of various cultural and artistic movements throughout Latin America.",
                "I learned more about Spanish grammar. Coming from a background in which I was mostly a heritage speaker, this was useful to learn what directly I was doing wrong in my conversations. I also learned a lot more on various topics of Latin American culture such as art, music, and food.",
                "I improved my Spanish speaking, writing, and thinking! I also learned so much about really cool art.",
                "I learned about art in various forms such as painting, food, music, etc.",
                "Great overview of art with lots of specific examples across subfields. Also good regular coverage of grammar.",
                "I gained a really strong understanding of art, politics, and social movements in Latin American countries. I became a lot more comfortable communicating in Spanish and gained a much more complex vocabulary.",
                "I developed a more formal conversational Spanish style while also learning to appreciate art of all different kinds.",
                "I practiced speaking more fluidly about my ideas and learned to speak about my ideas even if I wasn't completely sure of them or if they were a bit more \"out of the box.\" This class also provided a good review of grammar rules.",
                "This course improved my conversational skills A LOT. Everything during class time is discussion-based, so you get a lot of practice in speaking and in listening comprehension. Homework was mostly articles + grammar quizzes, so I also noticed an improvement in my reading comprehension and I gained a lot of very useful grammar skills (especially for situations like phrasing hypotheticals, using the subjunctive, etc.).",
                "I learned conversational Spanish abilities, reading comprehension abilities and essay-writing etiquette.",

                "I think the format of the course was great.  My class was very participative and collaborative, which made the seminar feel very comfortable by the end of the semester.  I also liked the flow from topic to topic, and the way in which we were constantly practicing writing, reading, speaking, and listening in Spanish; it was almost immersive, and I think that's the best way for me to learn a language.\r\nOne improvement could be the way in which assignments were assigned on Canvas.  Sometimes it was difficult to see what work was due for the next class, and it might have happened once or twice that the syllabus wasn't updated with links until a few days after class.  If those links were provided sooner that could be one improvement.",
                "Strengths: Incredibly kind and engaging professor. She truly wants you to succeed and help you improve your Spanish. Engaging visits to the YUAG to engage with the material we are studying. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes left me with questions on assignments and I would hope I understood correctly. Frequent YUAG visits might tough if you have a class right after at another location on campus. \r\n.",
                "This course covers a ton of ground, and all of the topics are really interesting. The lessons always felt meaningful, relating to culture and social movements now and throughout history. Profesora Leon did a really wonderful job. My only suggestion for improvement is that a lot of the homework felt tedious, maybe just due to volume? I think if that could be minimized I would've been even more engaged with the class.",
                "I enjoyed that going to the YUAG was a significant part of our class time and conversation",
                "Strengths: Very fun course, loved the conversation exchange component, improved my speaking\r\nWeaknesses: Course materials/assignments could feel a little disorganized sometimes despite being in a single document as its spread among so many different platforms.",
                "I think this course is awesome! Wouldn't change anything.",
                "The small discussion-style classroom forced me to get out of my comfort zone and converse in ways I am not used to, allowing me to pinpoint my weaknesses in my conversational Spanish with the intent to improve. The first-hand experience of going to the Yale University Art Gallery to discuss paintings in the presence of the actual paintings is also quite a unique experience that only enhanced my engagement, entertainment and retention in the course. One weakness in the course is the ineffective application of technology. Unlike stem courses that can just formulate problem sets, a conversational art course is more nuanced to come up with productive out-of-classroom assignments.",
                "This course spent a lot of time on each unit. I liked that we were able to go into depth about the topics, but at a certain point some of the discussions/activities got a bit repetitive, which I didn't like. I think if we spent a bit less time on each unit we could have incorporated another unit or spent some more time on grammar, which I would have enjoyed. I really liked and found very useful the grammar review. I think that we might have been able to fit in a few more grammar topics, and I would have enjoyed that and found it helpful. I loved that we were able to talk to students from Per; this was one of my favorite parts of the course! It was a fun and valuable experience.",
                "The small class size helped make our discussions and presentations not too stressful! Overall, the class is structured really well; it's nice having class sessions that are solely about speaking and listening (besides days where we had quizzes/timed essays) and homework that focuses on reading comprehension and grammar. (Also, the weekly Zoom conversation with students in Peru was really helpful in improving my conversation/listening skills, as well as simply fun.) Overall, I didn't find any notable weaknesses with the class; just important pay careful attention to the instructions given in class for projects/presentations.",
                "Strengths: development of cultural themes, pacing\r\nWeaknesses: connecting different unit themes, applying vocabulary",
                "Strengths: Each student was assigned a conversation partner from Peru and we met weekly. This was super fun and great for my Spanish\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of busy work assignments. It wasn't too time consuming but I would have preferred some of the work to be structured differently. For example, all the readings came with a lot of short questions to answer about them while you were reading. I would have preferred that we answered one question in more of a paragraph form rather than many few sentence questions since I think it would have given me the chance to dig into one aspect of the reading rather than answer a lot of more surface level questions."

I loved that this course aimed (and succeeded) to not only augment students' linguistic abilities but also their cultural understanding, and I think that is an extremely valuable quality to have in any language course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it is very engaging and provides the opportunity to pair with a student in Peru and have weekly discussions to practice your Spanish. It is a great opportunity to meet someone to practice your Spanish with, and as a student who was initially unfamiliar with Peruvian culture, provides a unique experience to learn about a different country.",
                "Yes- it is a super interesting and engaging way to improve Spanish.",

                "Yes!!! Rosamaria is a great prof and you'll learn a lot about gastronomy, music, and visual art + historical/cultural nuances. Had a great time and made friends in the class! Definitely had a very actively participating class this sem tho",
                "Yes! I think that this is a great L5 course. It is both interesting and challenging. I found myself learning equally about culture and language.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students who want to take their Spanish to the next level. The environment alone provides for a great learning opportunity and this course convinced me just how intriguing art can be (This is written from the viewpoint of a STEM major).",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to practice speaking Spanish through deep dives into certain aspects of Spanish and Latin American cultures.",
                "Yes! This isn't a gut class, but it improved my Spanish skills a great deal as well as helped me to think about art through a more critical lens than I would have had on my own. The structure of the class is good (class sessions that are discussion-based, homework that's reading-/grammar-based), and features like regular trips to the YUAG and Zoom conversations with students in Peru made this a super enriching and engaging course.",
                "Yes- it was a good course that allowed me to develop stronger speaking abilities and gain greater cultural awareness.",
                "I would recommend if the student was interested in postmodern art/art history. The conversation partners were also amazing for practicing my Spanish and also making a new friend!"
