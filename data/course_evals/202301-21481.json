                "The course is fast paced, but the professor is fantastic, and the material makes sense in lecture.",
                "Strengths - great TAs and Prof. Skiba is very nice and charming.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - everything else. Final exam was way too difficult and it was physically impossible to prepare for it. Class average on the midterm was a 50% (40% excluding the 3 outliers who got a 100% - keep in mind this is a class of 50 ish students). Too much content taught in a semester. Each class consisted of Skiba doing 2 hours of unilluminating vector algebra on the board while making errors and mumbling to himself what he was doing, so it was difficult to follow. Moreover, this was mainly formula derivations already present in the textbook, which was useless for the PSets\/exams. Instead, it would be better if we were taught how to apply the concepts to PSet like problems. There was such a big gap between what Skiba thought we knew and what we actually knew (which was nothing!) and we were speeding through content way too fast to even be able to catch up with what we don't know.\r\n\r\nHere's how to fix the problem of the absurd amount of material rushed through in this class: Start with Maxwell's equations week 1, don't derive everything from scratch (it's unnecessary and doesn't teach us anything, that's what the book should be for!), explain how to use Maxwell in PSet style problems (maybe 1 week on Ampere\/Gauss's law), and then do EM induction + waves + the rest of post-midterm content for the entire semester.",
                "Lectures were very fast and hard to follow most of the time\r\nAlso the exams were on content that was much more difficult than anything we'd seen on psets and sometimes content that we hadn't seen before at all.",
                "This was prof. Skibas first time teaching the course, but it was still well-organized on the whole. I think there were some lessons in the second half (mostly about radiation) that we spent a little too much time on and therefore we didnt get any practice with the new stuff at the end, but overall very cool.",
                "Very hard psets (in my opinion) and the exams are no different",
                "Weaknesses: I can't say I learned a lot in this class. We certainly covered a lot of content, but the amount that I (and my friends) retained is miniscule. Prof Skiba's lectures were mainly composed of math, without much, if any, physical explanation of what each derivation and equation we were being shown actually represented. It was really difficult to develop any physical intuition for the situations we were being presented with because the physics each equation described was never, or only very very briefly, explained to us. Problem sets were so hard that often we would show up at office hours and the TAs wouldn't even know how to solve the problems. Prof Skiba didn't provide the TAs with solutions, so they had to spend many extra hours of their own time figuring out how to solve the problems, and then a few days later, when they did get it, they would essentially have to give us the whole explanation of the answer, because the problems were simply too complicated for us to come to solutions on our own. The midterm exam was really difficult and the class average was really low, but Prof Skiba never addressed it in class or in an email or anything, and continued to teach as he had been before when obviously that wasn't working for us. We spoke to the TAs and they assured us they talked to him about changing his lecture format to include more physics rather than just all math, but he never did change the way he lectured. The final exam was outrageously difficult, and completely undoable, because while Prof Skiba told us that the exam questions would only be on topics we'd covered on the problem sets, none of the questions were like anything we'd ever seen before -- not in the psets, not in lecture, and not in even in the textbook. This class has made me and a bunch of my friends stop liking physics, or at least stop liking electrodynamics, and some of us are switching out of the major because of it.\r\nStrengths: the textbook. The Griffiths textbook is really good and if Prof Skiba is teaching is class again, teaching yourself out of the textbook is your best bet.",
                "Strengths: the textbook, Intro to Electrodynamics by Griffiths, is fantastic. I learned far more from the textbook than from lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Prof. Skibas lectures were extremely unhelpful. The best way I can describe it is he did very disorganized derivations (sometimes with mistakes) at us for 75 minutes. He rarely ever provided any physical motivation for the math he was doing, so it was very difficult to connect how to apply the lectures to the problem sets.\r\nSpeaking of the problem sets, they were frequently so difficult that the TAs didnt know how to solve the problems, and Prof. Skiba didnt provide solutions.\r\nThe midterm exam was extremely difficult with a very low average. Prof. Skiba never addressed this, and simply continued the course the way he had been. The final exam was preposterous. Prof. Skiba told us the exam questions would be such that we could effectively prepare by studying the problem sets. This was wrong. The exam looked nothing like our problem sets, midterm, or even the textbook.",
                "It was very fast-paced, which was good. However, I think some of the lectures could have benefitted from more preparation. Although I love Skiba and the fact that he rederived everything on the fly was very impressive, there were a few mistakes here and there which definitely slowed the course down a bit and led to some confusion. Lastly, while relativity is definitely very cool and the main equations at the end of the course were satisfying, it felt a bit rushed and was definitely not done justice. I think the course might have benefitted from diving more deeply into other topics rather than trying to cover that much of relativity in two weeks.",
                "Skiba is a very nice and funny person. Unfortunately, he cannot teach to save his life. This class has so much content, but he was unable to convey any of it effectively. Also his exams are totally unreasonable.",
                "Taught well. Good structure.",
                "The textbook was good, but lectures were very difficult to follow. The professor would derive various expressions in the blackboard, but struggled to explain the concepts in a way that we could understand. The class consisted of a lot of concepts that we had never seen before, and I feel like we were all struggling to understand and survive rather than learning at a comfortable pace.",
                "Great p sets, lectures should have given an overview before diving into derivations",
                "Strengths: Professor Skiba is funny and a fairly engaging lecturer. He brought in a few demonstrations, which were quite cool, and was happy to answer questions during class and office hours. The exams are fair - you can tell that Prof. Skiba tries solving the questions before he assigns them. Griffiths is a great textbook, and can shore up your understanding of the material (especially since Prof. Skiba follows the textbook fairly closely). The lectures teach material effectively - unlike in 261, I didn't need to rely on the textbook to teach me things.\r\nWeaknesses: once or twice, a whole class was spent on a long derivation, motivated at the beginning and explained at the end but without much physical intuition for what happened in between. It might be nice to pause more frequently to evaluate what we're doing.",
                "This course was good at giving a good overview of the specific concepts, topics, and problem solving tools that are essential to Electrodynamics. I learned quite a bit about how to solve important equations  (namely Maxwell's equations in a variety of contexts) and how to apply these skills to different sets of problems. However, I believe we covered too much content to be easily digestible during a semester-long course. It sometimes felt like drinking out of a firehouse, and I know that this was not conducive to our learning in this course. I feel like I learned much less about Electrodynamics because we tried to cover so much content, and I have had trouble retaining the content I was able to learn because I was so rushed doing so.",
                "The course covered far too much material for a single semester, leaving us with a very weak grasp on some important topics which should have been covered more in-depth. The problem sets were difficult, but reasonable. The exams however were not reasonable. We were told that the final would only cover topics which were on the homework, but multiple topics on the exam were never in our homework, leaving us completely unprepared for the final.",
                "Weaknesses: Lectures were dry, psets were long and exams were far too difficult  \r\n\r\nStrengths: Shivnag Sista was a great ta",
                "The strength of the course was the lectures, which were engaging, and of course Griffiths. Also, the TFs were very helpful with consolidating concepts and helping with psets. The only weakness of the course was the midterm and final, which I felt were too difficult. Maybe not the midterm, since the problems resembled the homework pretty well. But the difficulty of the final felt completely unexpected.",
                "This entirely depends on the Professor teaching the class, but the exams were unfairly difficult. The average for the midterm was just a bit over 50% and the final was somehow worse.",
                "Strengths: teaches a lot of material quite well. Potential improvements: maybe at the beginning of a derivation, give more indication about where the math is going, so that we understand the motivation for each step (or when there is no motivation, let us know so we aren't looking for one!)",
                "This course moved through the textbook (Griffiths) wayyyyy too fast. The textbook itself recommends that only chapters 1-7 be covered in one semester, but Professor Skiba covered the entire book (chapters 1-12). This pace was way too fast and resulted in most students not actually learning anything: we all had trouble keeping up (no time to digest the material because every lecture is a new topic) and the psets were insanely difficult. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, since Professor Skiba made up the pset problems himself, we had no solutions that we could reference, so if we couldn't do a problem, we were just stuck and had no way of learning anything from that problem. If pset problems were assigned straight from the textbook, we may not know how to do the problems immediately, but at least we could read the solution and learn something about the problem.\r\n\r\nThis course MUST slow down its pace.",
                "Phinaincs hard",
                "Strengths: \r\nAmple amount of office hour sessions (which you will most definitely need to utilize) and instructor is willing to make more resources available should the need arise.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe course progresses way too fast and it is very clear that this was the instructor's first time teaching this course because he tries to cover way too much in one semester but just ends up creating more confusion as the students desperately try to keep up. Even before the midterm, a majority of the students stopped being able to understand the lectures and relied entirely on the homework problem sets to figure out what topics to go through and review in the textbook. Skiba also refuses to post the lecture notes on Canvas, which makes the task of trying to catch up that much more difficult. Another weakness, though not entirely the instructor's fault, is that this course is not at all geared towards non-physics majors. \r\n\r\nLectures themselves were subpar overall because the big picture is regularly obscured, so students have no idea why the instructor is doing what hes doing. Furthermore, its understood that students are supposed to extract different solution and analysis methods from the lectures, but the instructor often gets lost in his own algebra such that it becomes incredibly difficult to follow his line of reasoning. The outcome is leaving lecture more lost than when you entered and praying the textbook does a better job of explaining. Again, part of the problem comes down to the fact that the instructor moved too fast through the material.",
                "This class is overloaded with content and not enough time is spent on anything for any actual learning to occur. When pairing that with lectures that were disorganized and poorly explained, it felt like it was more beneficial to not attend class at all and simply read the book instead.",
                "Many lectures were spent deriving formulas, but sometimes it was hard to follow because steps were skipped, and things generally felt a little rushed. It would have been helpful to know what chapters of the book corresponded to the lectures, and it would have also helped if there were some lecture notes available online.",
                "It seems like their was a lot of material covered in this class, but that may be the nature of electrodynamics.  I thought Professor Skiba moved quickly through the material but this was necessary given the amount.  The textbook was great and we closely followed it, and the TAs\/office hours were really helpful.",
                "The tests are incredibly hard and we do not know the curve until after the class is over. Also we had to turn the psets in physically which was a bit annoying. Griffiths himself writes in his textbook that a one-semester course has its hands full with the first seven chapters of the textbook; we try to cover all of it, and made it through chapter 10 and into 11. This meant a more rushed treatment of chapters 4 and 6, and not enough time to get used to the sudden ramp-up in algebra starting with chapter 9."

                "For non physics majors, it must be taken with Skiba.",
                "Absolutely not if Skiba is teaching it. And I say this as a straight A intensive Physics major who has been able to overcome the difficulty of every previous STEM class here. Unless you do college level competition Physics, you will fail this class. No matter how much you study, it's impossible to do well unless this is the only class you are taking in the semester and are devoted to teaching yourself Griffiths every day. If you HAVE TO take it with Skiba, I recommend skipping lecture and just reading the textbook every day, and going through every single practice problem in it (there's hundreds). Maybe then, and just then, will you be able to do okay in this class if it gets curved.",
                "I should start by saying that Skiba is a wonderful person--he's really funny and genuinely kind, and was very entertaining in lectures! With that said, I would hesitate to take 430 with him if it's offered again. For starters, there was an enormous amount of content to be covered in the class, and we went through it so quickly and with so little practice that it often just felt impossible to fully learn everything. Secondly, the midterm and final were disastrous for our class; despite Skiba seemingly believing that they were easy tests, the overall performance of our class was possibly the worst out of every upper level STEM class I've been in. I think the problem was that Skiba failed to see that we were not understanding the content in the way that he thought we were, and he routinely seemed to simply not tell us what we were learning in lecture and make mistakes in very important derivations that were not fixed during lecture. Efforts were made with the TAs to address this, but nothing really happened. Myself and everyone I know essentially taught ourselves the course content out of the textbook (Griffiths) and gained all of our understanding that way. If taught by a different professor, or maybe if the final was not so completely out of the ballpark of everything we'd seen on our psets, I could imagine 430 being super engaging and fun--the content is really interesting if you like E&M. However, it just felt insurmountable with Skiba, which is really unfortunate.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. Prof Skiba is a great person, but his teaching of the material is unclear and often seems aimless. He doesn't tell us why we're doing the calculations we're doing on the board, and most of the time many of us leave class both a) more confused than when we first arrived and b) having gained no useful knowledge whatsoever. I now realized that it would've been better if I didn't go to class and just read the textbook instead. Problem sets were fine, though there were a few that had me staying up until the wee hours of the morning and walking up science hill to turn it in, printed, in person, to the SPL mailroom (horrifying experience). I will say that the midterm was fair---I thought it was a fair evaluation and consolidation of the information that we'd learned so far. The problems were clever and interesting. However, the final was, honestly, borderline cruel. Literally incomprehensible. None of the problems matched anything that we had ever done in class, on the homework, or in the textbook. I had never studied so hard (I'm talking upwards of 40 hours) for an exam that I could not solve a single problem on.",
                "The course essentially goes through all twelve chapters of Griffith's textbook in a single semester. This is extremely fast. I often felt lost in class and only learned concepts for the first time doing the homework (which I would often stay up 'til 3am completing).\r\nGriffiths is a fantastic book, but I did not have the ability to follow it at the pace we went. If you want to learn electrodynamics, and are used to self-studying from textbooks, just read through the book on your own. Budget a year for it.",
                "Only if it is required (or you are a math major)",
                "No, absolutely not if Prof Skiba is teaching it. He's a very kind person and makes the best jokes in class, but he's not a good teacher. His teaching style is to purely show derivation after derivation of complex math on the board without any associated physical explanations, which makes everyone feel completely lost in lecture. The problem sets are really difficult and the TAs don't have solution sets so they just have to spend hours and hours solving the problems themselves, and then explaining those solutions to us because the problems are too hard for them to be able to lead us to the answer without just giving it to us. The exams were ridiculously, ridiculously hard, especially the final, which was entirely impossible and way beyond the scope of the course -- we had never seen any problems like the ones on the final before, not in lecture, not in the problem sets, and not even in the entirety of the Griffiths textbook (which is a necessary read if you want to pass the class). Even after we asked for a different teaching format in lecture and even after the midterm scores were outrageously low, he never changed the way he was teaching. We spoke to the TAs about it too and nothing changed. The TAs were a godsend, but not enough to salvage the class. This class made a lot of us reconsider our love of physics and some people have switched out of the major because of it. It's made me feel really discouraged about my knowledge of and appreciation of physics, and definitely given me a lot of imposter syndrome in the field. If you're an intensive physics major and have to take this class to graduate, I'm sorry. If you have a choice to wait another year to take it with a different professor or don't have to take the class at all, please don't take it.",
                "Yes, take this class! It may feel like a repeat of PHYS 261 at first, but you will definitely learn much more and in more depth.",
                "Yes, we learned a lot and Skiba is an excellent professor.",
                "Yes, especially with Professor Skiba. He's so nice, very funny, and a great teacher. I'm not a physics major and I just shopped this course after taking 410 on the off chance that it would be good... and I'm so glad I did!",
                "I would recommend this course to any physics student.",
                "This class is workable if you have a good group to work on psets with and if youve already seen E&M before at a high level. Otherwise, Id be cautious in taking this class.",
                "Yes, if they are up for the rigor",
                "Probably, if the student is majoring in physics or similar, and the course is taught by Professor Skiba. The lectures were generally engaging, the PSETs weren't too difficult, and I learned a lot about electricity and magnetism, as well as a few new math tricks for solving physics problems. I also picked up some intuition for what various equations should look like (e.g. something radiating outward in space probably decreases with 1\/r^2).",
                "I would not recommend this course if Professor Skiba is teaching it. This course is a requirement for the Physics major (and many Astrophysics majors also take it), so you can't avoid taking it all together, but if you have the chance to postpone taking it when Professor Skiba is teaching I would definitely recommend doing so. Professor Skiba tried to cover way too much content throughout the course of this class. He would sometimes launch into a complicated derivation of a concept during lecture without telling us the broad-picture implications of what he was doing, get lost in the weeds of the math, come up with an answer that was often incorrect after saying its \"trivial\" and \"morally correct\" and still not inform us about the significance of the material he tried to teach us. This had a negative impact on my learning in the course, as I was never quite sure how to connect the concepts covered in lecture and I couldn't get a grasp of the bigger picture of what we were trying to learn. Professor Skiba never made adjustments to the course despite the average on our midterm being a 57%, and in the end, we took a final that had little to no resemblance to any of the problem set questions or examples covered in class even after being told by Professor Skiba that they would match. Our head TA even told us he would be able to start one of the problems on our final. As such, I do not recommend taking this class with Professor Skiba.",
                "I would not recommend this class. It was nice that we followed the Griffiths textbook closely, but even if you do well on the homework, there is a good chance you will earn less than a 50 percent on the exams.",
                "No, unless its for their major or their department is incompetent and cancelled the required course for their major forcing the seniors to take this class instead in order to graduate",
                "If you like E\/M, then sure, because you'll strengthen a lot of knowledge and add on to it. I guess if you're a physics major, you sort of have to take it. If you're a math major that's trying to get a requirement out of the way, though, maybe just do 410 and 440 (or maybe I just dislike E\/M).",
                "Yes. this is an important course for anyone interested in physics, engineering, math, or any related fields.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn E&M.",
                "Absolutely not; under no circumstances would I recommend this course. If it's not required, there's no reason to put yourself through this torture. This class is a complete time sink; I easily spent upwards of 20 hours a week between lecture, office hours, and the weekly pset.\r\n\r\nYou won't learn anything from the class; you might as well just read the textbook on your own or watch YouTube videos to learn E&M if you're really interested in this topic. The lectures move too quickly for you to understand anything, so you might as well learn on your own so you can control the pace of learning.",
                "Had to take as an ABET EE. Incredibly challenging and not that rewarding, but I do feel like I accomplished something getting through. Honestly a boot camp in vector calculus if anything. Only take it if you have to or if you really love difficult physics and math (you must be able to handle both)",
                "I would recommend this course to other students only if they are well versed in the common solution\/analysis methods and problem setups utilized in Physics. If you are a non-physics major (for example, EE) fight as hard as you can to never take this course.",
                "It largely depends on who is teaching this course.  For the most part though, I would personally recommend PHYS 401\/402 instead, as I feel like there was simply too much content being covered in this one semester course.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone explicitly interested in electrodynamics.  The topics covered provide a solid basic understanding of electrodynamics and some basic problem solving techniques.",
                "If you know you really want to do physics, then sure. If you are a bit iffy, I would probably say look at the textbook beforehand and see if you are into it. If you have some hesitation, probably take 402."
