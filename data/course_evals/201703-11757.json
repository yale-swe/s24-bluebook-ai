    "Augmented 6ths, different interesting chord progressions, techniques for reading and interpreting atonal music",
    "I developed my musicianship skills and learned about the types of musical analysis that I can go on to learn.",
    "I learned how to recognize different types of chromatic chords aurally. I also gained better sight reading skills, especially rhythmic sightreading and atonal melodies.",
    "This course taught me how to listen to music in a more informed way. Keyboard Lab also helped improve general piano skills.",
    "I developed my harmonic dictation skills and learned new harmonies and rhythmic units that to identify in music. I was introduced to atonal music and sight singing and new ways to interpret chord changes. In keyboard lab I worked on sight reading simple figured bass notation."

   "comments": [
    "The one-on-one student engagement from keyboard lab was good, though often the most interesting parts of the class were the tangents Prof. Adams went on in interpolation of the material from class.",
    "I thought the course was great and I don't think it needs to be improved.",
    "We practiced the skills every class and I felt very engaged. The material was also really interesting and Nate really taught us things that we wanted to know.  However, we did not get a lot of one on one feedback which made the midterm and the final pretty difficult.",
    "This was a great course. It lined up pretty well with the curriculum of Music 211. The  work for this class provides a nice balance to the work of other classes since its mainly just practicing piano and singing.",
    "A strength of this course is that it covers a wide range of interesting and new (at least for me) material. The pace is just right to gain some familiarity with several new harmonies and how they appear in music. The in class activities are mostly fun, including sight reading Bach fugues and recognizing chords. A weakness of the course is that the homework was erratic -- almost always assigned but sometimes pushed back or ignored completely. It was frustrating to prepare a rhythm or sight reading exercise and then discover that it had been unnecessary. Keyboard lab was good but there was not enough time to make as much progress as I would have liked."

    "Take this course with Professor Adam - PLEASE! He is a wonderful human being and an even greater Professor. He *always* makes himself available to students and is truly great at explaining concepts in SUCH an accessible way. As a person who has taken lots of music classes: if you have to take this class (or 218 or 210, for that matter) do yourself a favor and **TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR ADAM!!**",
    "It's tricky, and depends on the musicianship level, the class can often skew more toward advanced students if the students aren't transparent and advocating of their personal experience levels.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student since it is only half a credit so it's not a huge commitment. It would let students learn a lot about music but also leave space in their schedule for other classes.",
    "If you are a musician looking to improve your aural skills, definitely take this class. I feel like I have gotten significantly better at sight reading and dictation, and the class was very enjoyable and fun.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's a lot of fun and you learn how to better listen to music, including more contemporary songs.",
    "This is a great course for students looking to expand their musical horizons. I took the class expecting to simply improve my sight-reading and dictation skills (which I certainly accomplished). It was cool to be exposed to atonal music, which was completely new to me, as well as certain harmonies that I had not covered in music theory."
