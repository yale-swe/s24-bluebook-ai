    "This course is good because it provides an informative intro to Spanish history and culture before and during arrival to Spain. I do, however, believe the readings can be improved by including more current information about Spanish culture and not only history of Spain, as that would have helped my adjustment upon arrival in Bilbao.",
    "The long readings and lists of regurgitated questions that are completed in New Haven didn't help me to learn the material (the in-class powerpoints along with the professors' explanations did a lot more than a textbook page). This being said, the culture classes in Spain were the most enjoyable part of the program and I was able to learn so much about the country's history just from seeing and doing."

    "Yes! Great course to take before arriving in Bilbao. Very informative and helpful in cultural adjustment.",
    "Although it can seem towards the beginning as if you are simply memorizing laundry lists of facts and dates, touring and witnessing Spain's history in-person does a lot to bring the course material to life. Take the course and stick it out!",
