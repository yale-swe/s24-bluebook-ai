Also some things in SuperCollider like pattern classes, synth classes, etc. It feels very much like a broad survey class of computer music synthesis and I don't really feel like I understand anything in-depth/can really implement any synthesis techniques (other than additive synthesis tbh) by myself.",
                "I learned tools and methods for synthesizing sound. Some topics covered include: additive synthesis, subtractive synthesis, FM synthesis, wavetable synthesis, granular synthesis. Some other topics include convolution, delay, feedback, sequencing musical structures. We learned about envelopes, modulators, human-computer interfaces, networking, and a collection of other topics.",

                "I learned how to synthesize lots of different sounds using the SuperCollider programming language. I learned about the details of different types of filters (comb, allpass, lowpass, highpass) and how they relate to sound. I learned the theory behind Fourier transform and analysis, convolution, FM synthesis, cross synthesis, and reverb. I learned a lot about how different waves sound! I also learned some music theory (partial frequencies, chords, etc) and how to use additive synthesis to reconstruct sounds like bowed strings."

                "Strengths: open-ended midterm and final projects, Prof Petersen wants you to learn. Weaknesses: very very hard to stay engaged in lecture, didn't really understand any of the material in-depth, TA (Tong Cheng) was super unhelpful at office hours. Also there were assigned readings but it was pretty clear that no one was doing them. Also #2 SuperCollider made me want to tear my hair out because the documentation is SO obtuse.",
                "Scott provided a lot of materials and example files for each class. We covered a lot of topics. The assessments, however, were very specific to a single topic covered in class. While this allowed us to dive deep into specific areas, a large amount of the lectures were never revisited in assessments or projects.",
                "I love the interactive aspect of the course. Every lecture included practical examples that we could use in our own projects. The course was a good mix of theory and practice.",
                "The course material is very interesting, but sometimes it is confusing in lecture.",
                "Strengths: open-ended assignments. Easy grading. Weaknesses: very disorganized class. Classes were random topics (did not follow the syllabus) and the professor talked about whatever he wanted without following any curriculum.",
                "Strengths: organization of the class website, interesting lectures, and open-endedness of projects. Weaknesses: the learning curve for both using the program and applying concepts. The class moves quickly but it can take a while to grasp foundational concepts.",
                "The lectures are a good mix of theory and hands-on coding practice/examples. The example SuperCollider documents are key, and are really interesting and helpful. The lecture slides/material itself was easy to sort of miss or not fully absorb, since we were never responsible for remembering it or showing mastery of that material on exams, etc. I did love how project-based and open-ended the course was; it allowed for a lot of creativity and fun creation of music. I think a big weakness was lack of feedback in a timely manner, and not much specific feedback in general."

                "I would say you probably get out of this course what you put into it... except no one was really putting much into it (as far as I could tell) so it was hard to stay motivated. Working on my final project was the first time that I was like.. maybe SuperCollider IS actually useful for some specific things and isn't just an obtuse music programming language... so perhaps I'll have more appreciation for SuperCollider in the future. From a faraway perspective the stuff we discuss/implement in class is really interesting, but it was just difficult to understand so I don't think I could fully appreciate what I was doing.",
                "Yes. If you are into music composition, production, sound, audio engineering, or anything related, there is a lot of useful information in this class.",

                "You get to make some cool stuff in this class but supercollider is hard. The lectures started off fascinating but as the semester went on they became more and more hard to follow. Scott is an awesome guy but his slides could use some pedagogical attention.",
                "Yes! But only if you are interested in music and sound. The course material was really interesting, and the workload was pretty light.",
                "If you are already into sound synthesis. Otherwise, the class is pretty niche.",
                "If you're interested in both music and CS, definitely!",
                "Yes, I'd recommend it if you love playing with waves and want to be able to create any sound you can possible imagine (plus more!). This could be especially good for EECS or EE majors who are interested in wave shapes, filters, etc. You'll do a lot of hands-on coding and pretty much won't have to worry about theory at all. \r\nThe downsides are sometimes unclear guidelines for the assignments, and also very slow grading if you're worried about your grade. But overall you'll become very familiar with an interesting, powerful computer music language that's fun to experiment with!"
