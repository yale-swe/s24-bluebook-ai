Finally, I learned how meaning can change depending on who the speaker\/listener is and what the context is, and how accommodation allows for better communication.",

                "Strengths: Professor Szabo is brilliant and knows how to lecture while fostering discussion. It's also not an insane amount of work, especially for the amount you learn. He knows how to answer questions clearly and efficiently.\r\nWeaknesses: this is less of a weakness and more of a necessary annoyance, but some of the readings are very dense.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- reasonable amount of reading, this gave me time to read carefully as opposed to rush through longer material and not have time to really understand much\r\n- the weekly discussions questions\/comments we had to post and the biweekly responses were helpful in making sure I had understood the material we covered\r\n- discussion sections were great for challenging one another's ideas\r\n\r\nI don't think this course had any weaknesses",
                "I thought the class was very challenging and the professor graded too harshly",
                "Strength: Prof Zoltan Szabo is quick to answer students' questions. Willing to discuss questions and papers outside of class. We received prompt feedback on our papers and assignments. Three guest lectures! Weakness: I feel lecture time is mainly used to summarize the course reading.",
                "Strengths: Lectures are very clear and really helped parse some readings which I found quite difficult, Prof. Szabo is willing to answer questions and does so convincingly and in-depth, assignments really do make you think about the material and sometimes let you dive deeper depending on interest on the question, fair grading\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it was unclear what the progression of ideas always was and why I should care about some of the stuff. Although all the questions are interesting it was unclear what as at stake in some conversations, and also I think my understanding of the material would have been better if stronger through-lines between different lectures and readings were given as a way to set the context.",
                "I liked the lecture\/seminar format, and the assignments were helpful. The only assignment that was out of place was the first draft of the final paper -- it seemed to me like it was due much too early.",
                "Strengths = The professor clearly knows what he's talking about, and was really helpful at explaining thoroughly (sometimes more than once) somewhat difficult topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses = Not many. Material can be dense at times."
