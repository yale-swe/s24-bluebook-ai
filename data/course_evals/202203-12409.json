                "The experiment guides are very wide-ranging in quality and could benefit from an overhaul both from a content organization perspective and also from the perspective of how much students are expected to accomplish in one lab period. \r\n\r\nThe strength of the course lay in the teaching assistants, who were so open to questions both during lab and over email, and so supportive of the work my lab partner and I put in. \r\n\r\nHaving a TA office hour midweek to help with lab report issues would be amazing -  conversations that took several hours over email could be resolved in a few minutes face to face and would save both the students and the TAs a lot of time overall.",
                "The strengths of this course were absolutely the incredible TAs. Weaknesses: The lab guides could be reworked to be more clear. Also, instead of scattering the questions throughout the lab guide, it would be helpful to have them highlighted or to have them all in one list.",
                "great course, great experiments. A couple of the experiments are much harder on the rest so I believe they should be reevaluated.",
                "Really standard experiment/investigations. You'll def pick up some new knowledge along the way, but I can't guarantee the 3 hours of lab + hours spent on LaTexing the reports will be worth it.",
                "Strength is you can pick which labs you want so you know you are doing something interesting. Weakness is some of the lab reports are better organized than others.",
                "The experiments were all interesting, but the lab reports took me the same amount of time as my other full-credit coursework. The teaching staff was helpful and I enjoyed how to class was run, and my TAs in particular were what made the course worthwhile."

                "Yes, standard physics lab. Though not necessarily when you are doing the intro lecture sequence haha!",
                "This course is highly dependent on which labs you choose (some are much more complicated/frustrating than others, some have unecessarily complicated lab guides, some are easy but the data analysis expected is very complicated, etc.). I would say it also depends on how much effort your TA is willing to put in outside the lab as you work through writing the lab report. I would not recommend taking this lab in a semester where you have a heavy load, though it is only a half credit I definitely put in more work than some of my one credit courses. I also sincerely recommend having a strong base knowledge of Python, and not just the syntax but how to use it for scientific error analysis, how to fit Gaussian curves to raw data and extract the standard deviation, etc. \r\n\r\nFinally, hevaly discourage taking this if you haven't taken 205L - a lot of the equipment operation is taught in 205L and then you're expected to know how it works in 206L, and a lot of the accepted error analysis techniques are also extablished in 205L.",
                "I took the 205 lab online because of COVID, and my high school didn't do any physics labs, so this class was my first experience with any kind of science lab. I really enjoyed that aspect of the class, and I think that if you haven't done an in-person physics lab before, you should take this class. You should definitely start your lab reports early, and choose your lab partner carefully. I had a great partner that I worked well with, and that made this class not too bad.",
                "yes, if you want to gain hands on knowledge of how many household items work. is a very good compliment to a classical mechanics course",
                "If you know EE, go for the investigation labs. Just because an experiment sounds fancy on the first day of class, doesn't mean it will be worth spending 20 hours a week on. Plan wisely, talk to prev. students.",
                "I would recommend it over Phys 165L if a student needs to take a physics lab requirement since the experiments and equipment are more interesting while the workload isnt too bad",
                "Not unless you have to. It's much better than 205- you don't have to turn in a lab book or prelab, the experiments are genuinely interesting and fun, and the teaching staff was a godsend. You genuinely do learn a lot about report writing and Python data analysis. But each lab report took me longer than my final 3500 word research report for my actual lab, and the data analysis was still a slog."
