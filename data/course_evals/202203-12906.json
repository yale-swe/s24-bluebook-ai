As a heritage speaker, I don't think my accent or ability to pronounce improved greatly, but my understanding of the grammar and logic behind the language I only knew partially truly improved a lot.",

                "Strengths:  A lot of repetition helps a second language learner really drill the language.  Noelia is a great professor who speaks at a reasonable, understandable clip and with great clarity.  The assignments were appropriate length and relevant to the class material.  Noelia noticed the grammatical mistakes that were commonly made and took time to explain them.  \r\n\r\nWeakness:  Much of the class topics were very political in nature.  I think this class should have one political/social justice unit out of the three, while the other two topics should cover stuff like travel, business, etc., things that a Yale grad who speaks Spanish as a second language will use in his/her career.  I also found the class to lack some grammatical context -- it's assumed that you know the full conjugation of a verb into all seventeen tense/mood combinations, which I think is a bit difficult for a student who has only done three semesters of Spanish.  Spanish has many different conjugation rules and still many verbs fall outside their confines, so perhaps some attention to that would have been nice.",
                "Keeps you engaged on a daily basis and is a small class size. Some of the assignments however are underdeveloped and feel redundant.",
                "It would have been helpful to have one brief lesson at the beginning of each week or class going over a specific grammar concept. Although I could have a conversation in Spanish I was aware of the grammar mistakes I was making but didnt know how to correct them because meaning was emphasized over correct grammar. I wished I received more feedback on my written work.",
                "The courses strengths were its focus on speaking and writing in order to improve general knowledge rather than specific grammar concepts. However, it could have included a little more formal teaching in some aspects (could be based on the students' strengths and weaknesses)."

                "I would recommend it.  It's a solid course in any manner -- you will have a better grasp of the language and some of its more nuanced facets and will have much less discomfort speaking Spanish in complicated contexts.  You get a lot of bang for little buck -- it's listed as 1.5 credits, but frankly it wasn't much work at all.  If you need it for your language requirement, obviously take it (and with Noelia, she's fantastic).  If you don't need a language requirement, but you want to learn Spanish in contexts that may be useful in your career/personal life in the future, you can take this class as a gateway to L5, but don't expect the actual content to be particularly thought provoking (though in a few spots it was).  It is definitely somewhat of a gut class, and a fun one too!",
                "Yes; its a fair way to fulfill the language requirement.",
                "Yes. This class was actually quite fun and a good break from my non-language classes. If it had been a heritage class, I think I wouldve fostered stronger friendships, but I enjoyed the course regardless.",
                "Yes! If you are previously able to hold conversations in Spanish and write and read well then this is a great course to strengthen your knowledge and abilities.",
                "Yes."
