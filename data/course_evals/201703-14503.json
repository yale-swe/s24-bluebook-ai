    "I got from this class:\r\nexposure to a new (to me) field of artistic work and theory. \r\npractice with a rigorous academic style, citations, etc\r\nI've never had a class that moved so far in time so comfortably, connecting current events to classics. \r\nBroader questions about the hidden work behind defining the perimeter of the language. \r\nThinking that will carry out beyond the class into other personal and academic work.",
    "This course encouraged me to read closely and to think creatively about a variety of texts and cultural contexts. This critical flexibility was my most significant academic development in this course. Of course, the material itself was fascinating: I encountered many classical, African, and black diasporic texts for the first time; compared literature, art, and music across cultures and contexts; and found new ways of reading texts (the Odyssey, for example) that I had encountered before. The result was a mix of disciplines and academic modes that changed with every seminar discussion. The challenge of following these many threads made this course a pleasure, especially with such expert guidance from Professor Greenwood and Sarah. There is no single insight to be gleaned from this course -- only that tracking the links between classical Greece, Africa, and the black diaspora, though not the sole approach to any of them, shapes my understanding of each in new and valuable ways."

   "comments": [
    "Some of the readings seemed like they were very tangentially related to each other, but I really enjoyed the variety of texts and genres studied, so I'm not even sure I'd say change that",
    "This is a wonderful course -- the professors have put together an incredible syllabus with extra readings I hope to complete in the future. They are stellar and do a wonderful job with our class discussions. I hope to see them teach this again, because it will only become a better course.",
    "A more articulated structure for the syllabus (e.g. a consistent chronological\/generic\/regional pattern of organization) might have helped the material flow a bit more smoothly from one week to the next, but that's just a small point.",
    "I left most class sessions feeling like I'll just never be the academic\/ scholar that my professors imagine us to be, push us to be, conduct class as if we are. This was a good push, though I often felt tongue-tied and unsure of how to say what I wanted to say. I was talking with a classmate after class one day and they described a similar feeling, saying, \"I promise I'm smart and have things to say!\" I think a few more \"easy entry\" style questions would have let me, at least, warm up in class.",
    "The greatest challenge of this course was the variety of topics and approaches we explored over the course of the semester. This challenge was also the course's greatest strength: the flexible design of the course kept me from thinking of any text as a straightforward retelling of a classical model. Instead, the appearance each week of a new subject and new approaches to it encouraged me to think creatively about all texts, both classical and modern. Our strongest discussions found new lenses for texts many of us had encountered before -- the week spent with Romare Bearden's collages, for example, opened new readings of the Odyssey. In the occasional seminar, the difficulty of aligning two texts prevented me (though perhaps not others) from reaching quite the same understanding of either one. The week we spent on Heliodorus's Aithiopika and Abouet\/Oubrerie's Aya: Life in Yop City comes to mind -- there is certainly a rich conversation between the two, but this was perhaps one of those moments when the course's challenging flexibility outpaced my ability to join that discussion. A future version of this course (and I hope there will be one) might explore different ways to engage with these texts, perhaps through a strong focus on popular culture (that seemed to be the lens that week, though it seemed slightly lost sometimes) or another critical apparatus. In any case, the surprising and enlightening format of the course is worth the occasional difficult moment."

    "This class is a great way to study classical receptions in a context that isn't just white men writing about Rome and Greece. The readings are fantastic and varied, there was even a week where we looked at art instead of readings. The papers are essentially choose your own topic, so they can be really fun and whatever you want them to be. And in addition you learn a lot about how classics has shaped, attacked, defended, been incorporated into, been rejected from, forced upon, and embraced by the African diaspora not just in the US but in the Caribbean and other places around the world. Truly an excellent and insightful class.",
    "Yes!! Must take. Anyone.",
    "Amazing course.  You'll learn a ton, no matter what your academic background is.  Professor Greenwood and Sarah were both highly knowledgable and very caring instructors who guided discussions well without dominating them, and their effort preparing the course on a weekly basis paid off (I'm sure I'll keep the bibliographies they provided on their weekly handouts as references for a very long time).  Perspective-changing class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Both Sarah and Professor Greenwood are fantastic teachers and scholars, and I was lucky to learn from both of them. I came into the course with a moderate knowledge of ancient Greek culture and little familiarity with African or black diasporic literature. I found myself excited to engage with the African and black diasporic texts every week, and my experience with classical literature grew as a result. I am glad for such extended engagement with classical reception studies, which seems to push the discipline of classics beyond history and commentaries on ancient literature. This course felt vital to my experience with classics as well as with African and black diasporic literatures. The varied set of personal backgrounds and academic interests in our seminar made me look forward to our weekly discussions."
