I especially appreciate the foundation in studies of Islam."

Because there are many ways a syllabus on religion and US empire could be put together, this certainly is not the only or ultimate iteration of such a course. Knowing this, I really loved how the instructors' expertise came together as vivid conversation partners and pedagogical collaborators in weaving through these fields and disciplines, making sure that, as a class, we were constantly questioning and rethinking what an \"empire\" was, and what \"religion\" was."
