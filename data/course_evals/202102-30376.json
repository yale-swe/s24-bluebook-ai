                "I learned a lot about the development of the Southern economy due to slavery as well as regional economic discrepancies that emerged between the North and the South. Very interesting class and I enjoyed learning about evaluating statistical information and considering potential biases of different datasets.",
                "I gained a large amounts of knowledge on the South, and why it developed the way it did.",
                "Learned about the economic history of the American South.",
                "Critical thinking and analyzing economic history papers",
                "I developed the ability to critique economic papers. It gave me an insight on what the material needed to create the arguments.",
                "I learned about the many influences the economy of the American South had, and especially about the influences that slavery and jim crowe had on stunting southern economic growth. I also learned the impacts that these institutions had on public investment and education. Throughout the course I learned to interpret data and analyses to draw conclusions and the causes and effects on the southern economy. Through our writing assignments, I also learned to critique analyses and think about alternative ways data could be interpreted and presented. Some specific topics covered were: indentured servitude, the slave trade, slavery as an economic\/financial institution, impacts of slavery on racism, education patterns, economic mobility of African Americans, and agricultural systems (the plantation economy, sharecropping, tenant farming)."

                "Great professor, wish he would have looked at our actual papers during office hours instead of just our outlines.",
                "It is a comprehensive exploration of how the South's economy developed. It does a good job integrating data without getting bogged down in it. I think that having more breakout rooms like in the second half of the course is beneficial to help maintain engagement.",
                "Three-hour lectures can be kind of draining, but breakout rooms help break up the monotony.",
                "I think there could have been more peer discussion in the course. It would have helped us understand the topic more. There could have also been more time given to think and answer questions.",
                "A strength and weakness of the course is the use of data to back up arguments and discussions about southern economic development. Most of our course material (both readings and lecture slides) were based on fairly recent economic research, so a lot of interpreting regressions, theoretical supply\/demand graphs, and data in general was involved. Having already had a background in statistics (a few econometrics courses and a couple S&DS classes on data analysis) made these exercises in examining data super interesting and insightful, but I was able to tell that some of my classmates were (rightfully) confused with a lot of the more mathy discussions. I felt that my learning was greatly improved by the use of statistics and econometrics, but I think a better introduction to basic stats at the beginning of the course would help less stat-inclined students (especially since econometrics isn't a prereq - non-stat people are still valid!!!). Another hit-or-miss was the readings - they often gave great background into the topic, but once the author got to the very intensive statistics, basically all of us got a bit lost. Luckily, Prof. Will made sure we understood we didn't need to know the hardcore math and theory (and that we wouldn't get tested on it!). A final strength was Professor Will. He was a very down-to-earth instructor and always showed clear compassion for us. He made sure we all were comfortable asking questions and would always try to start class with some banter to get to know us better. When we had writing assignments, he also was willing to engage in our writing process by offering to look over our outlines and giving us pointers\/tips. One of the most memorable weaknesses was the length of the lectures. While it is excusable since summer classes are only 5 weeks, sitting through 3 hours of class twice a week would be difficult for any class I'm sure. I think more break time or class discussions would help us stay focused."

                "Yes. I found the course very interesting, and knowing the historical context helps understand why the South is the way it is today. Not only is it a good example of how to connect economics and history, it is useful to understanding today.",
                "Yes, it's interesting to learn about a major region of the US",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed taking the course. It was interesting to learn of the American history in combination with the economics side of it.",
                "I would reccomend this class to any student interested in economic development, and especially if they are comfortable with statistical analysis. The course would give a great opportunity to put theorhetical micro\/macro and stat knowledge into use, especially if you've just finished the intro or intermediate econ courses! Also, any southerners out there (like myself) may find this class super interesting if you want to learn more about what impacted the development of your home region.",
