We looked at the Surrealist movement both in France and overseas, spanning the early to mid-twentieth century and even into present day. In addition to all the analytical and writing skills of art history classes, this class incorporated practicums that supplemented the readings and discussions each week.",

I also learned how to better analyze and understand Surrealist art."

            "comments": [
                "This course is really well organized: chronologically, geographically, thematically. We trace the movement of Surrealism from Paris outward into the French colonies, and all throughout, the discussions are framed by certain polarities that the Surrealists addressed in their work.",
                "Strengths: The weekly practicums were really engaging and helped me engage with the course materials in a really non-traditional, non-academic and exciting way. I like that there was an organized polarity that we studied each week and that the class had a good mixture of lecture and discussion. The professor was great and was super engaged and passionate about the course material.\r\nWeaknesses: The readings were so heavy, theoretical, and often nonsensical that trying to read through them each week was very stressful. Since they were so difficult, I found that it took me an extraordinary amount of time each week just to get through many of them, and then in class we might end up spending only about ten minutes on it. For those that I tried to skim when I was short on time, I often ended up more confused and taking away very little than before I had started. I wish we could have slowed down and dived really deep into some of the dense, theoretical texts or read secondary literature that could have helped us break it down on our own time.",
                "More notes or basic guidelines on how to interact with the readings in class would be very helpful! Some of the readings were a bit dense / difficult to digest",
                "Strengths: The readings were both interesting and challenging. The organization of the canvas discussions plus the in-class coverage of these readings was extremely well done - the class discussions were generative, exciting, and deeply engaging because they were bolstered by the personal practicums (in accordance with that week's theme) we engaged in and posted to canvas. There was so much interesting content that we sometimes couldn't get to all of it, so if the seminar could be longer (although that might be mentally taxing) or meet more frequently that would allow more room for discussions."

                "Yes, I would recommend the course to others, since I learned a lot from it and definitely understand the Surrealism movement a lot better. One thing I will say is that the class focuses a LOT on the political and theoretical side of Surrealism (the Surrealist manifestos, organization of pessimism, etc) and a lot less than I expected on Surrealist artwork itself.",

THe contents of the course are refreshing, illuminating (about the ways one views the world), cerebral yet intuitive as well. Professor Fiduccia is an incredible professor to work with - kind, brilliant, thoughtful, and passionate about the course and about all her students' insights and ideas."
