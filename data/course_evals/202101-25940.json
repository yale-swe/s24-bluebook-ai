This wishy washy ignorance meant I myself had never had a proper conception of what liberalism wasneither historical nor current. This course overviewed the original \"tenants\" of liberalism, the voices of their opposition, and followed its trajectory through the 1900's up until the modern day. Our 3 professors made for an interesting sectioned class, where we got to hear differing perspectives on the nature of liberalism's supposed crisis. This ideology is an enigma to a certain extent. I loved learning about liberalism's religious and secular roots, as well as its upholding of freedom and simultaneous history of maintaining inequalities.\r\nThe most important skill I developed is having a more informed opinion on liberalism. I can now say why I may or may not agree with a stance, having a conception of neoliberalism and reactionary politics that I did not originally have. I feel more secure in my opinions, instead of just echoing what I hear from online discourse. \r\nDefinitely recommend taking it!",

            "comments": [
                "The course bit off more than it could chew. It tried to deal with too much course material to actually go deeply into any one portion of liberal thought. The strengths of the course were the beginning, when we would read one thinker a week (like Tocqueville) and discuss their influence on liberalism. This made sense to me, and felt like we were actually developing an understanding of what \"Liberalism\" even means. But the second half of the course was mired in far too many readings every week. This is not some college-student philistinism or laziness. This is, instead, a criticism of the way the course was structured: in my case, the problem wasn't that I was averse to doing reading, it was that I had no idea how to integrate the disparate array of articles we would be given every week into some sort of coherent broader narrative. Surely the instructors were just giving us more than we needed to actually read, so that we could just get a set of working impressions from all of the articles, but I found this strategy extremely unsuccessful. I was left feeling completely unmoored, without any real understanding of where the course was tending, nor any sense of the philosophical development of Liberalism past Cold War American Liberals like Niebuhr. The course was in search of a sensibility. Because of its winding and overwrought structure, I don't think it found it.",
                "There were many readings but very few of them played into the course; the topics were interesting after a certain point but the early readings were less so because they focused on political philosophy and early liberal thinkers that did not play much of a role on influencing the writings of the latter half of the course",
                "very interesting course and learned a lot, also a really unique structure in the discussions between the 3 professors, but definitely disorganized and didn't feel like a normal class at all - probably would have preferred more structured lectures (or one structured, informational lecture per week and then another similar to the current format).",
                "Strengths: Lectures were always really interesting, especially with all three professors, all of whom are fantastic. I know I'll keep thinking about the questions they posed for a long time. Each brought his own ideas and approaches and brought the best out in each other. I would have given the professors more time instead of having a question-and-answer periodI wasn't particularly impressed by the questions, but I was always intrigued by what the professors wanted to talk about. The readings were always interesting (and you read quite a bit for the course), and I appreciated how we placed today's challenges in historical perspective. Weaknesses: The course moved very quickly through each topicit would have been great to have an hour and fifteen minute lecture rather than the fifty minutes, which only gave very limited time for each quasi-lecture to be followed by even briefer responses from the other professors. I also thought the questions we discussed in class and section often turned out to be more interesting than our paper prompts, but that is more a testament to the classes \/ section than a weakness of the essays. Overall, a great course!",
                "Strengths: Extremely engaging and eye-opening, discussion-based lecture format was great for hearing the instructors' different viewpoints, weekly discussion section provided an opportunity to further ponder and engage\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Readings were quite varied in length depending on the day, ranging from a couple 20-page articles to a 250 page book (to be read in one day). It would have been helpful to spread the readings out to be more consistent.",
                "Strengths: this course covers a great breadth of material, and the professors each present interesting perspectives. The discussion sections allowed for a thought-stimulating exchange between students and the TF.\r\nWeaknesses: there are few opportunities for determining your grade in the class (2 essays, final exam, and participation). It would have been helpful to have an additional essay assignment to reduce the weight of each assignment. Sometimes, it was difficult to understand what the professors were getting at in class, and having three professors with three different view points sometimes just made the lecture more confusing. There was also just too much reading assigned for the course, and it was hard to know which readings should be prioritized for discussion section.",
                "Strengths: incredibly knowledgable instructors; diversity of perspectives; highly engaging discussion format; great mix between classical texts and current affairs; the syllabus was very well thought-through; some of the best Professors Yale has to offer  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have preferred reading even more classical texts over the current affairs lectures. Some of those seemed a little repetitive. Also looking a little more beyond American Liberalism would have been nice but I get that a class like this has a limited scope.",
                "Perhaps a definition of liberalism would help in determining if there is a crisis. Not that one can easily be found but at least setting the terms more clearly so one professor isn't referring to the status quo order while another is discussing a philosophical tradition.",
                "Cool discussion panel format between the three professors: The different professors offered different insights. That being said, there could have been more structure in the course  discussion.",
                "Professors were great",
                "I think syllabus became significantly weaker towards the end of the course, and I don't think the link between the contemporary readings and the theoretical discussions had earlier in the course wasn't explored satisfactorily. Additionally, I think the syllabus would have benefitted from the inclusion of Rawls.",
                "The debates were good but the essay prompts were quite bad.",
                "This course was quite ambitious in the amount of material it wanted to cover, and I thought the reading was ultimately too much (especially during COVID). It was helpful when my TF started telling us which readings to focus on for section, but some weeks there were hundreds of pages to read before lecture and that was not feasible (so I sometimes felt lost, or didn't know what to tackle when I was pressed for time). I think reducing the reading load would also make discussions a little more fruitful as people would be more likely to be on the same page. I also think that while it was useful in the end to have covered so many different genres of readings by the end of the course, as I felt I had a broad understanding of the history and contemporary aspects of liberalism, it was sometimes disorienting to move from dense political theory to op-eds.",
                "Literally no strengths. Dont take this course.",
                "Very interesting and engaging because of the professors. Not sure how it could improve.",
                "The readings can be a but scattered and not fully discussed in lecture or in section. They should focus in on more specific works. Mosty fun reads though.",
                "The class starts with the assumption of a basic understanding of all these thinkers and theories. It could do better for students who lack this background.",
                "While the readings were fascinating and discussion section fantastic, lectures themselves could definitely have been more organized and substantive. It generally felt like we were receiving each professor's stream of consciousness, whichthough interesting and almost always enjoyablewasn't especially informative.",
                "Strengths: the readings were always very interesting and the course was structured chronologically which was helpful. I also enjoyed that each of the three professors brought a different perspective. Weaknesses: I think the course could have benefited through a broader look at the impact of liberalism globally and on non Western countries in specific.",
                "The strength of the class were the readings, but the weakness was the breadth; too much was attempted.",
                "This class was super entertaining and the converations between these three prof's was just so enjoyable. I loved the format and we covered a lot",
                "Only good thing was the professors but the class itself was disappointing overall",
                "The only thing I can think of is to maybe spend some time going over important terms or events, as not every student has the background knowledge to go straight into discussion\/analysis.",
                "Strengths: AMAZING readings, supportive TAs, impressive professors\r\nWeaknesses: large amount of readings",
                "The readings were interesting, but too much to go over in the class time. I think more focus would have been nice. Additionally, the class did not seem to progress very much in the final month, hovering around the present without seeming to go forwards or backwards. We also lost a lot of critical theory and many of the readings seemed to lose track of the first half of the class when we debated what constituted  liberalism. The professors were all interesting, but did not have enough time to talk.",
                "Too much reading",
                "This class had three really cool professors who would be interesting on a panel about liberalism. However, the class felt unrooted. It meandered around questions without a strong structure. The different perspectives within single lectures could be confusing, especially because they did not always engage with the readings well. This class would've been a good four week series but it broke down fairly quickly after that.",
                "Strength: three great professors. Inherently interesting topic.\r\nWeakness: everything else. The class assumed that you could grasp all the ideas about hard thinkers and com to lecture ready to listen to 3 professors debate thinkers you didn't even understand. Way way too broad. Honestly worst class I've taken at Yale, and everyone I know who took it with me felt the same way. 0\/10!",
                "Strengths: covered a lot in a short amount of time, 3 professors, my TA :) , manageable papers, very accommodating about the final\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some weeks we were assigned a lot of readings, which made it difficult to really get into them (more time spent skimming, than actually deep reading)",
                "I thought the 3-instructor format had a lot of potential, and was very helpful for getting to see the interplay between three different people of different ideological persuasions within the umbrella of liberalism. Lecture was always engaging, instructors did a great job interspersing humor and pop culture which kept things fresh during Zoom. Good syllabus.\r\nI think this class could benefit from limiting itself a little more. I don't know whether this needs to come in the syllabus or the way lectures are structured but \"Crisis of liberalism\" ended up feeling like way too gargantuan a topic and it was hard to grasp onto anything sometimes. I also thought there were so many readings that it was very difficult to do them all every week and most people probably didn't, but I guess that's common. I also think making sure that each instructor spoke in every fifty minute lecture made it very challenging for the instructors to fully flesh out their points\/arguments; it often felt like things were left hanging. Maybe either lengthen the lecture time and have it only once a week or only have two instructors talk each time?",
                "I think my main problem with the class was that I sometimes didn't feel like the content was worth engaging with because it felt like it framed very real and concrete issues in abstract ways that made them less concrete and sometimes denied the realities of certain issues. (Maybe this is more of an issue I have with political philosophy\/theory overall than with this class specifically.) But overall it sometimes felt like three white men talking about the history of liberalism (and colonialism and capitalism etc) in an abstract theoretical way and that was frustrating at times.",
                "Expert professors, time for discussion with peers was great.\r\n\r\nThe class itself was hard to engage with over zoom",
                "This course's biggest strength was how timely it was. I felt engaged much of the time by dint of the fact that the material always felt relevant.",
                "Can't think of any weaknesses. I absolutely loved the tri-professor format. It made every lecture very interesting.",
                "Strengths: highly engaging lectures by three very dynamic lecturers. I loved the structure of the whole class - the balance between lecture content and discussion sections was very on point. Also super thankful to be put in a graduate student section, and not mixed undergrad-grad sections. The content itself was also really thoughtfully delivered, and the readings were fascinating. \r\nWeaknesses: the course would benefit from having a more international focus, and spending at least 1 week on liberalism in non-Western countries. It was very American-centric, and at times it felt like the class was really just trying to determine why Trump was elected rather than the broader international trends leading to the global rise of populism. Prof. Moyn is a great section leader though at times I felt the section was too free-form - I would have preferred a more deliberate discussion of the readings rather than the pick-your-topic discussion we ended up having.",
                "I thought the course was great. The subject matter was interesting and relevant and the balance of teachers was good as well. Garsten represented the center, Douthat represented the right, and Moyn represented the left."

I also thought the weekly required reading response was useful in helping us to stay engaged with the reading. The accommodations made by instructors and TFs for COVID were also so helpful and welcome giving us some more time to write our paper and giving a week to do the final was very kind and very necessary.",

                "Discussion posts in theory were a good idea but due to their design never became a place for productive discourse. The lecture format worked pretty well as did the discussions. Office hours for two of the professors were very accessible but for Prof. Douthat I could not make the two single-hour sessions he scheduled over the course of the entire semester.",

                "Yes and no. Yes because the instructors were great. No because it was not well structured so as to give a clear sense of what liberalism was.",
                "No; there were far too many readings and it was never clear which ones actually mattered",
                "very much so, especially if interested in modern challenges to liberalism",
                "Yes! Fascinating and relevant content, a quick and interesting introduction to political philosophy (although I think you'd enjoy the course more if you had some experience in the discipline), and lectures that were always an adventure. Be prepared to do a good amount of reading, but they're well worth the time. The class will be a great foundation for a future as a voter and as an interesting person.",
                "Yes! If you're at all interested in the state of liberalism in the world today, take this course! Do note that this course isn't really geared toward everyone, despite the \"open to all\" label - most of the students in the class will be humanities majors, so if you're more of a STEM person, be prepared to do a LOT more reading each day than you're used to.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in political theory, philosophy, economics, etc. I am a STEM major, and a lot of the material in this course just went over my head. A lot of the abstract concepts were hard to grasp, and having the material presented in a quasi-debate format during lecture made understanding the material more difficult. However, there are great opportunities for discussion across both sides of the political spectrum.",
                "Would absolutely recommend to any student with an interest in political philosophy and\/or current affairs. The content was fascinating, highly relevant and helped me reframe many of the discussions taking place today.",
                "No. You can do some of the readings on your own if you are interested but the lectures didn't provide much direction and felt more like a series of professorial ego trips than a coherent course.",
                "Yes, for anyone interested in political theory or philosophy! (Or, for that matter, current politics.)",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they're interested in exploring the theory and history behind some important contemporary debates. The reading can be a bit much, but it tends to be very engaging and thought-provoking.",
                "I would because the debates are so prescient.",
                "Yes, I would, but I think more so for individuals who are already very interested and engaged with political science and contemporary politics. I don't think this course is for someone looking to dip their toes into political science, but for individuals who want a more nuanced understanding of liberalism.",
                "Absolutely not. DO NOT TAKE!!!",
                "Yes, very interesting and unique class",
                "No, the amount of readings is preposterous.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, as long as they are willing to do the readings and interrogate their own beliefs independently.",
                "Yes, but this course is basically a DS course. I know because I took DS. So be prepared.",
                "I would recommend this class to someone who is looking to gain a better understanding of of Western political and social theory.",
                "No. The professors are great but the class is disorganized. It dipped its toes in too many areas. Part philosophical, part political, but did neither thing particularly well. Section very disappointing. Good reading list but lectures did not live up to the potential.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course if you think the syllabi is interesting. I loved gaining this knowledge and these profs were awesome.",
                "No dont take it. Better options even though douthat is the man.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The professors did a great job of putting together a comprehensive, balanced survey of recent political thought. It definitely made me more informed, and showed me that there is a lot more nuance and history to the conversations we are having today.",
                "I think I would, but only if some changes were made. I loved listening to the professors reflect on liberalism in the last century, and my TA was incredible. However, the reading load was SO MUCH, especially as a fifth class. They made the course easier halfway through, but I dont think I was ever able to fully do the readings and understand them to the best of my ability because I didnt have time.",
                "I would recommend the interesting material. The class could use a little better organization.",
                "No!!! The course was way way way too broad that it felt like we didn't actually learn anything. The class assumed that you could grasp all the ideas about hard thinkers and come to lecture ready to listen to 3 professors debate thinkers you didn't even understand. Way way too broad (eg we read like 100 pages of John Stuart Mill and discussed him in lecture for approx. 3 minutes). Honestly worst class I've taken at Yale, and everyone I know who took it with me felt the same way. I felt like I learned nothing. The class had so much potential, but did not follow through.  0\/10!",
                "100%\r\nI spent a lot of time talking to my friends who were majoring in political science about this class. I'm sure part of my reaction is due to my lack of familiarity with the topic, but I had so much fun in Liberalism. Even when I didn't fully complete the readings, I was still able to appreciate what was being said, because I was able to see the effects of liberalism in my life and how it informed how people I knew approached politics. \r\nConservative politics, the origination and critiques of capitalism, and identity politics are all topics that I much better comprehend.\r\n\r\nIf someone asks you, \"what is liberalism,\" and you're struggling to respond, I definitely recommend taking this class!",
                "Yes I'd definitely recommend this class, keep in mind it's a very abstract political theory class sometimes which is a very specific kind of brain usage so if you're into more concrete stuff I would stay away. I'd also caution people that are just getting into political theory that there's a lot goin on here!! but it's very relevant and engaging and interesting, and I think the assessments gave a lot of leeway to talk about what itnerested you. Do keep in mind it's sometimes very broad as well. But readings are interesting, and I think lectures would be even better in an in-person format! Worth taking for more of a \"sitting in on a political panel\" vibe than a \"class\"",
                "Yes",
                "I'd recommend this course to any student interested in recent and historical developments in liberalism.",
                "Yes, if I knew someone interested in political philosophy (whether at the beginning stage of interest or further along), I would definitely recommend this course. It was fascinating to learn about liberalism from the center of one of liberalism's intellectual bastions.",
                "I would recommend this course to every student at Yale. It is an important foundational course for understanding where we derive the values our society so frequently appeals to - values such as individualism, freedom and the right to liberty. It is also critical for contextualising the so-called 'crisis' our society is currently experiencing, and being able to see the wood from the trees. The professors you get to listen to each week are fantastic speakers, and many of the texts studied are by people you feel you ought to have read but somehow were left off the syllabus in undergrad years.",
                "I would definitely recommend it. You will be exposed to and be able to analyze many different ideologies, and particularly the one that is the foundation of our current society."
