                "I really appreciated the way Professor Panter-Brick approaches writing assignments. I found her writing advice really helpful for other courses as well! It was great to have that as an added bonus to the valuable course content on humanitarianism.",
                "I learned so much about the humanitarian field, how it functions, and its theoretical flaws from an anthropological perspective.",
                "I learned about what working in NGOs was like, how humanitarian organizations function, and the problems within the humanitarian field.",
                "I developed a deeper understanding of humanitarian interventions  previously, my only knowledge of humanitarianism was what we see on mainstream news. When I was younger, I even wanted to work for Doctors Without Borders because I knew it was a very noble career. However, I learned that the humanitarian system is intricate and complex, with the traditional mode of delivering aid becoming increasingly unfit for our present world. I also learned how to write a critical analysis.",
                "The course presented an in-depth, critical perspective towards the humanitarian field. Through the class, we discussed how humanitarianism interacts with larger structural ideas and sought to unpack how the field has fallen short historically. An anthropological approach was often taken, providing nuance and pushing back on how power imbalances offer difficult obstacles towards improving the field. Another important skill drawn out from this course was to work on writing in a very direct, policy-oriented style.",
                "Coming into this course, I had little knowledge about Humanitarianism and Humanitarian Interventions around the globe. I knew what Humanitarianism was and the histories of past and present crises but I was still lacking in understanding the values, the theories, and the realities of humanitarianism. I think this class was incredible in closing that gap of knowledge I had. Likewise, with our assignments involving a two-page critical analysis of a weekly topic, I did not feel overwhelmed by the class but still synthesized and expanded on what I had read and learned. I think that the instructive efficiency of this class, which is the ability of the instructor to teach, of students to retain, while not being overwhelmed with a heavy workload, was among the highest of classes I have taken at Yale. Also, my improvements in critical thinking as a result of this class were incredible; I really enjoyed this course."

                "Strengths: Professor Panter-Brick is insightful, knowledgable, and kind; she also brought in several fascinating guest speakers (I especially enjoyed the class with the ex-president of MSF\/ Doctors Without Borders); the readings were interesting and varied throughout the semester\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It might have just been due to this semester's virtual conditions\/ zoom, but I think we never fully broke the ice in this seminar; I felt Professor Panter-Brick was at times too quick to transition activities\/ to end class early when there were zoom silences; we ended up often ending class rather early, which limited potential conversations; there were weeks when it felt like the discussion never fully took off. Although I generally appreciated Professor Panter-Brick's expertise and insights as a practitioner herself, at times, she was a bit too opinionated\/ defensive about humanitarianism in a way that shut down certain discussion topics\/ points of analysis.",
                "No weaknesses. Professor PB is wonderful even over Zoom, and this class has been the highlight for me this semester.",
                "This course was very informative and interesting, but writing the essays were a bit difficult since there was not much guidance on how to write them.",
                "Strengths: Professor Panter-Brick is absolutely incredible! You might be reading the class evaluations, see everyone gushing about her, and think \"Wow, how good could she be?\" Really good!!! Professor Panter-Brick is brilliant and highly accomplished, while also deeply kind and understanding. She made sure to check in with us often and give us breaks, and consistently encouraged us to take care of ourselves and our mental health. She also did a great job at leading our debates and listening to our opinions. Possibly what I enjoyed most, however, was Professor Panter-Brick's commitment to honesty and being genuine; this would show up during class, when she would challenge a guest speaker's statements, or in feedback, which was thorough and very comprehensive. She is a gem of a Professor and one I feel honored to have learned from and spoken to.\r\nWeaknesses: I believe too much reading was assigned every week; it was often gargantuan and impeded my ability to churn out Critical Analyses as frequently as I would have liked, and dominated my schedule.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Panter-Brick is an amazing professor who is clearly passionate about the course material. You get to learn about many aspects of humanitarianism (mental health of humanitarians, success\/failures of community engagement tactics, urban refugees, etc.)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Since the class only meets once a week and is discussion-based, it is easy to get fatigued. I would have liked to do more class activities in addition to discussion.",
                "A huge strength was PB herself. She made class engaging, interesting, and I always looked forward to our seminars. The constantly changing class formats and discussions really lent themselves to high engagement. Also, the student presentations worked wonderfully to set up the class discussion. I also enjoyed the critical analyses as a means of learning to write in a very direct format. However, the learning curve to really nailing this type of writing, and what PB expected was a little steep. I did appreciate PB's support and the process is definitely a trial by error format."

                "Thinking about the course, I appreciated PB's flexibility with class discussion. Out of all my classes, she was the only one to regularly check in with us, ask us about our days beyond the class, gave us breaks throughout class, and honestly created a very positive learning environment. I wish more of my professors were as caring and thoughtful.",
                "I really appreciated the frequent guests coming to speak for our class. With virtual instruction, routine class discussion can become repetitive and not-interesting after a while but having guests come in and shake up our weekly topics with personal experiences made the class unique and riveting. Even though this course was taught virtually, having outside guests helped me not get stuck in the monotony of virtual instruction."

Professor Panter-Brick is phenomenal and you should definitely take the class if you are interested in anything from medicine, to international development, to aid work as a whole. It was an eye-opening class that really changed the way I thought about the field and really made me contemplate any future career choices relating to it. Highly recommend, especially if you are a fast reader and can handle the colossal amount of reading.",
                "Yes! This was one of the most interesting classes I've taken at Yale and really opened my eyes to humanitarianism. The workload (weekly readings, leading one class discussion with a partner, 3 critical analyses, 2 pages single spaced, and one final paper 2500 words) is not too overwhelming and you get to have a lot of interesting discussions in class.",
                "I would most definitely recommend this course. First and foremost, Prof Panter-Brick is an excellent example for what a professor should be. She showed that extremely clearly in this crazy semester. Yet, the topics we covered and the way we are pushed to examine humanitarianism definitely shifted my perspective on the field. I left the class with many more questions than I entered with, but also with a much better sense of what and how humanitarianism functions in today's world.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend this class to other students because the topic of humanitarianism is more complex than I think it is given credit for and the structure of work for this class helps investigate these complexities while allowing the freedom to form your own opinions on a myriad of topics. The ability of this class to provide so much insight and have students succinctly synthesize this insight in a two-page analysis is a testament to how much one learns in this course."
