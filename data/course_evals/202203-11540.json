                "I learned to write and structure clear essays with a significant public point.",
                "I learned how to write a personal/non academic essay.  I learned tips and tricks for quality, engaging writing and got ample, helpful, timely feedback on my work.",

                "The discussions in my class were a positive experience, as well as the peer workshopping, since they motivated me to write better essays and pay closer attention to the class discussions.",

                "It's possible that a number of readings that you can count on your hand are not interesting. BUT, more than 95% of the readings are fulfilling, you do not regret leaving a section. The essays exist, yes, but Lincoln gives dates that are very supportive, and he even spreads them out in the beginning and so you can focus on other midterm exams. The essay's aren't terribly long either, only 1500 words max and they are all personal writing. The strength needs Lincoln, the dude is easily the best human and professor at this school. He is so humble and so accomplished, you learn from hearing him speak, you become a better reader, observer, and writer. Lincoln gives the right feedback, and he responds instantly too (a skill I don't know how he has).",
                "The feedback aspect of this course was so helpful; Professor Caplans deadlines and comments really helped elevate my writing.",
                "Lincoln Caplan was amazing. Absolutely an incredible instructor.",
                "Strengths: We were assigned quality pieces to read and discuss in class, expanding my knowledge of contemporary essay writers. The distribution of the assignments was consistent; at no point did it feel like some weeks were heavier than others. Weaknesses: I see two flaws in the course. The first is at the outset. Students of diverse writing backgrounds enter the class. The class, as structured, did not provide an introduction to creative writing that I could have benefited fromand I assume other people could have benefitted from. The second is the nature of some of the discussions. The nature of the subject matter is one that naturally broaches contentious political issues. At certain points, the class discussions veered in directions that strayed from conversations about the craft of writing. Most people were made uncomfortableif only onceby the comments some people made.",
                "strengths - learned a lot, challenged me to think in new ways\r\nweaknesses - a lot of work, although all of it was relevant it was stressful at times to do both readings and essays",
                "Because Professor Caplan is such an experienced writer that he is able to pick up on things that students wouldn't be able to read into at first glance. I do think that Professor Caplan can spend more time listening to his students. He heavily contributes to class discussions, which can sometimes take time away from his students. I also think that Professor Caplan favors or is seeking for certain answers which is sometimes frustrating. I also think that have the writing workshops should be before the second draft is due. Then students can actually implement feedback instead of resourcing to \"if I could submit another draft.\""

                "Yes. Take this class for pleasure and for writing. I don't care if you don't like writing, you will leave this class loving it, not forced writing but personal writing. I know that it's difficult to not think about your grade, but regardless of who you are, 100% guaranteed you will leave this class not caring about your grade because you were blessed with the experience of this class and a Lincoln Caplan, and your grade will be worth it. \"Better writer\" isn't close enough as a description to describe your expected output from the class, better human is more like it.",
