Through the written responses I wrote during this class, I learned how to better research for a political science class, including how to incorporate data into a paper.",

                "A lot of the lectures felt super repetitive and boring. If the lectures were more interesting I would have had a more positive experience.",
                "lots of material, sometimes too much.",
                "Strengths - interesting content, light workload, short yet sometimes challenging assignments.\r\nWeaknesses - sections sometimes felt disjointed from the lectures, we were often 2-3 lectures behind, lectures sometimes felt dry, readings were either fully discussed in lecture or kind of irrelevant, so you did not really have to do them.",
                "The main strength of this course is its clarity, especially with regard to the assignments. I very much appreciated how clear Professor De La O was in her instructions. Although there were not any real weaknesses to this course, I wish we were able to spend a bit more time covering certain topics such as ethnic conflict.",
                "I think the lectures were basic summaries of the readings, which made the readings feel very optional. If the lectures went beyond the readings, I feel like I would be more engaged. Also, I think the brunt of the difficulty comes at the beginning of the class, while the later units feel much easier. I think an opposite progression should take place. I think this course succeeds in distilling wide ranging topics in political science and making them feasible to look at in a class.",
                "Its a great intro class in that the concepts and ideas are fairly simple, making it easier to do well and learn. I also liked that there were a lot of minor assignments through the semester, instead of having massive assignments at the end of the semester.",
                "strength - discussion sections were very effective in preparation and greater understanding. and material was never overwhelming and the pace of course was organized well\r\n\r\nweakness - lectures were not the most engaging",
                "Strengths: Sections were very well organized and structured in a way that fostered understanding and comprehension of lecture material. Modules and presentations were well-organized. The course provided a good overview of key concepts and challenged class participants to apply them themselves.",
                "This course was very nice in that the sections provided greater engagement opportunities and review opportunities. The guest lectures were also very interesting and engaging. However, the regular lectures themselves were a bit boring in that they went over the exact same things that the readings did.",
                "Give grades back in a timely manner??",
                "Section leader was excellent. Lectures presented the information in an easy to understand way, and assessments were creative, engaging, and approachable. The final was extremely scary.",
                "strengths: interesting reading material\r\nweaknesses: not super engaging lectures, assignments could be a little confusing, material seemed very surface level",
                "The course is inherently interesting and covers a breadth of topics without feeling too superficial in any one topic. The course did, however, often rely too heavily on the readings and this made the lectures feel far less insightful once those readings were completed. I wish the lectures would lay on additional details or applications outside of the readings.",
                "The class is kind of boring but not super hard which is nice",
                "This course is very well organized, and I was thankful to have a class this semester that followed the dates strictly planned in the original syllabus. Ana de la O gives informative lectures that match with the readings, and I really enjoyed the discussion sections paired with each week. The only improvement I would say is to swap the final long-answer paper with the final short-answer paper. I think I would have done better on the long response had it been earlier in the semester, rather than the last week of classes. Maybe the short-response should be the final assignment before the final, not the long one. That last week is very difficult, and I know I could have done better work earlier in the semester.",
                "The lectures felt a little repetitive, because we would often repeat slides that we had already gone over the past week.",
                "Strengths: interesting readings\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were extremely unengaging and rarely even touched on the readings; the course was unstructured and disorganized; the assignments were often unclear with confusing prompts, and the emphasis of the class seemed to be on memorizing jargon from the field rather than actually learning to think deeply.",
                "Lecture was not very engaging and I felt as though I learned course material better on my own. Assignments were overly complicated and graded harshly. Little to no feedback was given. I felt as though grading was completely subjective. Assignments also took several weeks to be graded. For most of the semester we were a week behind on content. Lecture was much more confusing than it had to be. Course readings other than the textbook were not applicable to content and biased.",
                "I loved writing the essays and learning via research so much more than the class itself, lectures, and discussion sections. The lectures were, in my opinion, very unengaging and discussion sections so depend on who your TA is. But the overall format of work for the course was excellent.",
                "This course's lectures are very clear-cut, and there is ample direction and support for assignments.",
                "The teaching is great but the power points are relatively brief.",
                "The course was too easy too maintain the student's interest. I believe it would benefit from combining an introduction level with a continuation level of the material e.g like Econ 115 to keep the students more interested and engaged.",
                "Readings always ended up being ahead of lectures because we were so behind with the slides in class. We would fully be two weeks behind in lecture and still going at normal pace in section. Professor de la o spent too long on unnecessary topics and skipped over others that felt important and necessary for assigments.",
                "More analysis of class materials rather than direct notes.",
                "No weaknesses!! Solid Class.",
                "Strengths: Professor De La O is an incredibly experienced academic and I would encourage students to go to her office hours as she has so much knowledge to share. She is incredibly approachable and is very clearly student driven. I also appreciate how she discussed various countries and cultures throughout the course. Weakness: None.",
                "Strengths: The weekly readings were pretty doable and reasonable. The flow of topics that we covered made logical sense and different concepts built on each other. The real-world examples of some of the concepts we were covering (eg. ethnic brokerage in Bolivia) were interesting and engaging. There's no midterm or in-person final exam which made for a more manageable workload.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I had a hard time staying engaged with the course material besides the few times we covered real-world case studies. This could just be because I don't have an innate interest in abstract political concepts, like state formation, commitment issues, and typologies of regimes, but I found these topics to be less than engaging. While the lack of sit-down exams was appreciated, it felt like papers and reflection pieces snuck up on us pretty frequently. I think an increase in case studies, particularly from a more variable set of countries, would make the course feel less repetitive.",
                "I think that the lectures could have been more engaging.",
                "Strengths: Comprehensive, covered many topics\r\nWeaknesses: Writing Prompts and discussions felt a bit randomly ordered",
                "The course is well-structured with its set of modules. Furthermore, it does a good job of going through a variety of topics without getting too detailed and without taking a passing glance; it strikes a good balance for an intro political science course. The readings were interesting, and the writing assignments were well-spaced to allow for balance and focusing on certain important topics.",
                "The material is the primary strength. The quality and clarity of instruction is lacking. I think that attendance at lecture shouldn't be required if the lecture will be so similar. Also the assignments should be better suited to reviewing the entire information.",
                "The course is well-structured, and its readings are far more diverse than the conventional article-only readings common to political science courses (PLSC 116 opts for a combination of scholarly articles, textbook chapters, newspaper articles, podcasts, films, etc.). These qualities made for an incredibly engaging learning experience. Professor De La O clearly knew what she was talking about, and I was incredibly lucky to be able to learn from her. I also loved the weekly discussion sections and the fact that we got to engage with the readings during those sections, lectures, in weekly discussion question posts, as well as through our written assignments."

                "No. The syllabus looks interesting at first but the lectures are very unengaging and rarely touch on the readings and the questions that the syllabus claims to explore. There was a constant focus on learning long, seemingly empty terms that were not even clearly defined in lecture, but that we were supposed to use to make judgments about the world. Very disappointing class.",

                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in politics or the world as a whole. This course is such an amazing tool in understanding how different nations function and provides a great deal of insight onto the people of those nations in the process, which is amazing.",
                "Absolutely! Solid Class. 2 papers, 3 reflection pieces, and a take home final.",
                "Absolutely! As someone who was never exposed to comparative politics, I thoroughly enjoyed this course! Since it is a survey course some topics are going to be more boring than others, but overall I enjoyed the readings. The assignments were also very innovative and weren't your basic research paper. You can obviously tell she cares about the learning process! The applications of Comparative Politics are also so expansive that any student would benefit from this course!",
