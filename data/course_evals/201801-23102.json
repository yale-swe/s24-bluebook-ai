    "Great writing course!",
    "Concise prose, essay structure, story elements, how to be interesting",
    "With lots of writing, I improved my flow and also learned style for several different types of essays.",
    "I learned how to take control of my language and use structure to strengthen my writing. Through weekly assignments, I created a habit of writing every day. I started enjoying writing and developed confidence in my own writing.",
    "I learned a lot about master structures and useful techniques to write various types of essays effectively. I also was exposed to a wide range of very interesting and engaging readings throughout the semester, and I now have a much greater selection of authors at my fingertips to seek inspiration from.",
    "I learned how to effectively tell stories. I learned about the role that structure plays in different types of stories and narratives.",
    "I learned how to read for craft, as well as how to write five different types of nonfiction essays. I learned how to work through the various stages of the writing and revision process. One of Professor Green's main focuses was structure, and I learned how to use different structures. And I learned about writing concise, clear prose. My writing and confidence in such writing rose greatly.",
    "- Writing clearly, concisely\r\n- Structure and details in non-fiction writing\r\nThis class taught me so so much! I mean if you want your writing to be more than pompous papers on inter-subjectivity, take the class. If you want to learn how to write something that will actually be read, take this class. Everyone should take this class."

   "comments": [
    "I think it was very well organized. The units went in a logical order, the readings and workload were manageable and predictable. I really liked workshops and reading my peers' work.",
    "This class is great.  You get 1-on-1 meetings with your professor and specific attention to your writing.  Because you're doing so much writing, you also improve a lot.  And you get to read fun\/interesting articles.",
    "I really loved that this course taught me how to read for craft. ENGL120 isn't like the English classes you took in high school. All of the readings are interesting, and they help you apply specific tools, devices, and structures to your own writing.",
    "I honestly loved this class and looked forward to it every week. I thought the workload was fair, and the class format was engaging and interesting. I enjoyed nearly all of our readings, and I also felt like while Professor Green made his lectures to us entertaining, I did learn a lot. And even with the sheer amount of practice we were forced to do, in addition to all the feedback (first drafts, workshops, one-on-one meetings, etc.) my writing did get much stronger over time. Sometimes, the class would get a bit off-track, and one thing I did wish we did more of in the class is discuss the writings for their themes\/subject matter, instead of just how they were effective. However, I understand it is a writing course, and not a literature course, and the writing piece of this curriculum was done well and effectively.",
    "This course was my favorite class of the semester. Professor Green makes class fun and interesting, and spends a lot of time with each student to help improve their essays. I learned to not only write better and with purpose, but also read more strategically.",
    "This course's strength is the flexibility it gives to each instructor to tailor the section to their individual taste and to their student's needs. I have no criticisms.",
    "The class teaches you how to write by reading as many non-fiction essays as possible, and writing at least an essay every other week. The attention given to individual students is unequaled, and makes a huge difference."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It is a fun course to take! Your writing improves like crazy!",
    "Take this class.  You'll be a better writer for it.",
    "Highly recommend this course. Yes, it's \"creative nonfiction\" but control of essay structure and clear, concise language will help in any field. This course teaches you how to actually communicate effectively, not just write.",
    "Yes.  Take it.  You will get so much better at writing and you will have actually interesting readings.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Even if you're not particularly interested in writing creatively, ENGL120 will help develop skills that will help you in whatever future career you intend to pursue.",
    "Yes, I absolutely would. I think anyone, working in any field, could benefit from a class like this. I really appreciate how much freedom we had in what we could write about each unit (whereas I know other classes, like ENGL 114, were much more focused on a specific topic all semester long), and that we were able to engage with each other and the professor each and every class. The difficulty is not too great, but also enough to be interesting and challenging, and the class is really fun.",
    "I would recommend this class in a heartbeat, but it is not for everyone. I recommend it to students with an appreciation for non-fiction, and with a taste for exploring ideas through such non-fiction. And of course, a love of writing is needed.",
    "Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. We all need to learn how to write things that will actually be read by someone. We need to leave the bubble of \"in this essay, I will argue that\", and start writing creatively, which is the only way to get in touch with readers."
