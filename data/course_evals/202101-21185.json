I read a variety of 'classic' texts and authors, such as Thucydides, Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, etc. in addition to more contemporary articles and case study-specific literature. The discussion format of this class also allowed us to develop skills in speaking/discussing areas of interest in terms of strategy.",

However, these are texts that are referenced in political decision-making. I now have a better grasp on these texts and could engage in a conversation about them. Strategy is also a process that is applicable in most fields, from the military to healthcare efficacy to political campaigns, so it is helpful to have a grounding in these readings.",

                "Grand Strategy is a good program. The emphasis on political theory was a little much for me and I thought the first half of the semester went pretty slowly. I also thought that the guest lecture/Q&A style of the first half of the semester was not very interesting.",
                "I really love the application in case studies at the end of the course, drawing together all of the material and applying the other readings and frameworks.",
                "Well taught course, but the post-small group discussion posts were not helpful.  They detracted from the conversation as students were focused more on note taking and the write up than engaging with each other.",
                "No weaknesses. This course was engaging, organized, and fulfilling. I really enjoyed the readings and thought the professors worked hard to create a welcoming class environment. I just wish we got feedback on our writing earlier on in the semester.",
                "I overall felt that the course format and assignments fit the objectives/subject matter very well and allowed us to engage effectively with themes in grand strategy. However, I would have several proposals for changes to the syllabus. There were very few authors of color and also other notable works of 'strategy' that were not on the syllabus; for instance, it was mentioned in class that Lenin and other leftist thinkers were grand strategists in their own right, yet such authors were not included in our readings. I do think, though, that the case studies chosen for the last few weeks of class were fitting and that the overall organization of the material (starting with military strategy, moving into political strategy/leadership, and ending with social movements) was effective.",
                "Strengths: amazing professors, interesting readings, perceptive classmates\r\nWeaknesses: the readings can sometimes be long; Mondays are packed with class and events (sometimes 2:30pm-7pm straight); the group work can be annoying if some people fail to participate",
                "A strength of the class is the weekly guest speakers. The guest speakers are experts in their field and it is great to engage with them in a smaller setting; they offer additional insight into that week's readings and their respective work. A weakness is the workload. I'm not sure if this is usually an assignment, or if it was only added during the pandemic, but each week students met in small groups and wrote a short group essay (~500-700 words) about their thoughts/discussion on that week's readings. This assignment was on top of the weekly individual reading responses. The course requires high engagement, which is fine, but it felt excessive to participate in discussions with the entire class, small group, and guest speaker and also write an individual and group reading response each week. Also, the Social Movements and Social Change and Case Studies in U.S. History units could include readings from more progressive leaders.",
                "The readings are definitely a strength of the course, I left feeling like a learned a lot of framing/important theoretical background for the rest of my intellectual pursuits. The class would obviously be more engaging in person, but Prof. Gage and Brenes did an excellent job facilitating very interesting discussions virtually. The class could perhaps be improved by cutting the time we spend writing responses in a small group to more organized full-group time, or interaction with the practitioners.",
                "Prof Gage and Brenes are very accessible  whenever you need help, you can easily contact them during office hours. They made a good effort to make zoom interesting, too -- we had a guest speaker lead the first part of class and then a group.",
                "The instructor-led discussion followed by a chance to break into groups and develop a response to the weekly prompts worked really well. The events were we were able to meet practitioners and learn a bit more about there experiences were great. The readings were great at helping up consider what strategy looks like at different levels."

                "Having guest speaker events, webinars, etc. on Monday nights immediately after our class became very exhausting, and I know that this feeling was shared among many peers in class. In-person, I think this would be very different (we could move from our classroom to a dinner with a speaker, etc., and it would overall be more engaging) but virtually it was rather draining to have two hours of virtual class followed immediately by 2-3 more hours on Zoom with speakers, events, etc. I think events should have been spaced out a bit more across the week given the virtual format.",
                "The events worked well for us to get a chance to learn about the speakers and our future lecturers. While there is no substitute for being able to sit down and share a good old-fashioned meal with someone, the Grubhub vouchers added a sense of occasion."

                "If you get accepted to this course, take it. It is a special program and it will be integral to your intellectual and personal development.",
                "Yes! I already have recommended it and will continue to do so because I strongly feel that more students interested in community organizing, advocacy, social movements, and transformative/radical politics should take Grand Strategy. This program in the past has had a reputation of being conservative and/or focused on military strategy, and while military-related topics are certainly covered in introducing strategy/related themes, my own experience in this course has been overwhelmingly positive and engaging even given that the military is not at all my area of interest. Professor Gage and Professor Brenes have truly done a phenomenal job of including topics such as political strategy, organizing, social movements and social change, etc.  for instance, a great deal of time in class is spent discussing the slavery abolition movement, the civil rights movement, etc. No matter your political ideology or interests, I think any student hoping to make change  be it through politics/policy, organizing, or any other means  can gain a great deal from this class. I encourage anyone even remotely interested in strategy to apply.",
                "YES for sure! I loved my classmates and hearing what they had to say, and I really appreciated the wide variety of lenses through which we analyzed strategy: wars, republics, and social movements. It was interesting to see the connections between the strategies of these three, and the course allowed us to read a lot of fundamental pieces that are addressed in other classes (e.g., Alinsky, Thucydides, Federalist Papers, etc.). Highly recommend!",
                "This course attracts students from all corners of campus, so it's worthwhile to apply",
                "If you can get in, I highly recommend it. GS gets a bad rep sometimes at Yale for being pre-professional, but depending on what you're looking for, you''ll get as much out of the class as you put in. The readings are excellent, and Prof. Gage has brought in interesting perspectives to the traditional cannon. I also really appreciated the opportunity to actually engage with and get to know the visiting practitioners.",
                "Yes!! If you can get in, you have SO many opportunities to meet people, undertake a research project, and learn about a field that is being expanded beyond military strategy (although as someone who had no knowledge of military strategy, I learned a lot there, too)",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. The readings and practitioners build out a sense of the history of global affairs and key considerations one must make when crafting grand strategy. The guest speakers who step in, the questions posed to students, and the questions answered by practitioners will advance your ability to pay attention to key variables when strategizing."
