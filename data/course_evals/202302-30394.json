In addition, I got to see how pretty much everything in our lives can be connected to these microeconomics topics, which was very insightful. It gave me a new lens with which I can view things happening in the world. For example, schemes like buy 1 get 1 half off are price discrimination of firms trying to extract more profit from the consumer surplus, and bookstores putting your purchases into multiple bags utilize framing and the asymmetric value curve to make customers feel happier.",

The recorded lectures were very nice, and Tolga gave frequent examples and anecdotes which very very fun and engaging. I feel like the zoom live meetings could be split into 2 shorter sessions instead of 1 long one, because due to the large amount of material covered per session the classes often ran long, and sometimes it was a bit fatiguing to sit through without any breaks to get up and walk around.",
                "Professor Koker and Dana both worked hard to make the course as engaging and productive as it could be, especially for an online summer course. I really enjoyed it, and I wouldn't change anything about it. I learned a lot.",
                "We went through the material thoroughly and discussed applications in the real world. The live sessions could have moved a little faster since we were already assigned videos to go over prior to each class.",
                "The excellent organization, devoted teaching staff and seamless execution of the class are strong strengths of the class. However, the only true weakness is the discrepancy that arises in what's taught during live lecture and tested in psets, although it is more than adequately covered in office hours (so go to every one!).",
                "Strengths: Tolga's the best and made the summer class so much fun! Dana was also always super kind and supportive!\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough time to fully grasp concepts."

The materials are covered in a relevant and useful manner, with live lectures going over the foundations of concepts and their applications, while supplemented by recorded lectures that go through derivations and more in-depth descriptions. It has a more than manageable workload while not sacrificing on any key material for senior classes!",

I'm grateful that we learned about price floors, rent controlled apartments, the war on drugs, the gender pay gap, recessions, inflation, monopolies, and many other important concepts from an economics perspective.
