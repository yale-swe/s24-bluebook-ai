While none of this is comprehensive, the course is fascinating and draws connections between all of these different arcs well.",

                "This was a fantastic course and a great second half to Islamic Theology and Philosophy. The main strengths of the class are of course Professor Griffel and the TAs. I also really appreciated the option to write our paper during the semester rather than as a final paper. I'm also glad that the class wasn't only focused on extremism, but also women's rights movements, modernists, etc. The only weakness is that each lecture is always trying to cover so much ground that we usually have to rush through the end. I don't really know how to get around this, however, as there are already so many interesting topics that we don't even have time to touch on (Hezbollah, Hamas, etc). \r\n\r\nThe only other thing is that I don't think the class should be called \"Islam Today.\" For one thing, the class starts all the way back in 1798.",
                "Great lectures, readings, discussions. Maybe a (low stakes) map quiz?",
                "This course was fascinating and well designed. There was a lot of reading and a lot of material to cover, but I felt that the material was covered well through efficient lectures and engaging sections. I cannot compliment Professor Griffel and his two amazing TAs Aseel and Sana enoughthey covered so much new and interesting material in a clear and understandable way. I cannot think of any weaknesses. This class was lot of work but was amazing. One of my favorite classes of all time.",
                "Strengths: There is much variety in the themes, concepts, and historical figures that the professor presents throughout the course. I walked away feeling so much more knowledgeable about Islam. Professor Griffel is a great lecturer. Weaknesses: this is the type of class that students end up CR/D/Failing because of the way that the professor calculates grades; he has an odd system for doing it. The section participation is also expected to be tiered, meaning not everyone is supposed to get an A; the grading system is the biggest turn off so be wary of that when you take this class. The class also requires a major memorization of figures, dates, and events (these are key for the midterm and final comes around), so if you don't have the bandwidth to memorize dozens of figures, when they were born and when they died, etc. then DON'T take this class. I would be prepared to CR/D/F just in case."

This class reshaped my view of the middle east. I am so grateful I took it and would enthusiastically recommend it to any student who asked. I would caution, though, that there is a lot of reading in this course. I did not mind this; I actually appreciated it, as the readings were fascinating and I enjoyed them, but that is something to be aware of when signing up for the class.",
                "Yes, really important knowledge. Well organized.",
                "I would not recommend to someone looking for a 5th credit or a class to simply fill the void of an empty schedule. This class requires an extensive amount of memorization and there are very few things/assignments that determine your final grade. This means that there is not much room to improve your overall grade if you bomb the midterm for example. I would recommend. you take this class if you have a deep passion for the topic or have an unwavering determination to take the class (especially if you don't mind CR/D/F or getting a lower grade than anticipated). I would not recommend this class out of light or subtle interest."
