I thought the textbook was great and classes were very engaging. I never was bored.",
                "Strength - great way to get regular exposure to Chinese listen, reading, and writing. Not too challenging so good for intermediate level students.\r\nWeakness - the 'talk to other students' exercises were not too helpful, should probably be reduced.",
