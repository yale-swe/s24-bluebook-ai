In seminar discussions, we talked about truth and reality in myth, world-building in fiction, and technology's role in sci-fi. I think my Greek improved a lot during this course. Vocab and grammar quizzes were really helpful for keeping me on track.",

                "I enjoyed the class! PLV and my classmates both provided a wealth of perspectives and knowledge. I left almost every class with questions, and for me personally this is an indication that the discussion was pretty riveting. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I did not mind that we did not place emphasis on going over grammar and syntax--the theoretical stuff was so much cooler, and I'm glad PLV was willing to sacrifice grammar review in favor of a really deep conversation on mechanical beings, for example.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I was wistful about was the gradual disappearance of labs over the course of the semester--I really enjoyed them!",
                "Strengths: We covered a lot of ground in terms of Greek authors, going from Hesiod to Lucian.  feel like I learned a lot about ancient Greek literature just because of the variety. Also, we read lots of wacky, crazy texts like Lucian (where the characters visit the moon and fight a war there), so that was fun. The other students had so many interesting thoughts to contribute. Also, Prof. LeVen was great and fostered a really fun class environment. One last strength: I felt like the workload was not very high, especially for an L5 language class. If you want an L5 Greek class but don't want to be overwhelmed with work, this class might be a good fit.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I thought the sci-fi\/fiction themes of the course didn't always come through clearly to me in the texts we were reading. While the discussions were interesting, it sometimes felt like we were meandering and confusing ourselves with questions instead of getting answers. I wonder if Prof. LeVen could have jumped in more to give us more concrete observations and knowledge. Also: I have heard from my classmates (and I felt this way too) that we sometimes felt too inadequate to contribute or ask questions. I myself sometimes felt like I didn't have enough background knowledge to add anything useful to the discussion. But overall, this class was really fun and I learned a lot!!!",
                "I really enjoyed the class discussions and the authors we discussed. I was surprised that Philostratus ended up being on the final exam that I had, and I wish that we had discussed him in class at least a bit as preparation for that (although I know the final could be on a passage we didn't talk about in class), but I never felt like we were wasting time with our discussions."

The most valuable things about this course, for me, were the warm class environment and the opportunity to improve my Greek.",
