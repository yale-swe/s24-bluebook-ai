                "Strengths: \r\na really interesting angle on victorian poetry. Focusing on mostly three major poets helped keep the course not too broad. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nThe syllabus was definitely too large. We would have several readings assigned and only have time to discuss one or two. Also it's a do-the-reading, come to class and talk about it and listen to the professor talk about it kind of class. Which isn't super engaging if you didn't have time to really deeply read every day or just didn't like the poem. \r\n\r\nAlso I'm not sure if this is a strength or a weakness necessarily but the writing assignments were totally open-ended, in that there was not a prompt and very little guidance on what was expected, which was a little difficult to navigate. Professor Brisman is an acquired taste. I enjoyed his insights and anecdotes, but others might find them off-putting.",
                "This course benefitted from the great variety of material, and the Professor's extensive knowledge of both the poetry and also writing in general, so that we could gain enjoyable insights of the poetry while improving our ability to close-read literature and our writing. The course always had a manageable workload, so that it was fun being able to show up to class each day with only a handful of poems and examine them at length."
