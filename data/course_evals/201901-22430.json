    "I learned how to perform research and work with a group of other seniors to design\/develop a functioning ethylene production plant.  \r\nThe course is basically a review of the past CENG 300-400 courses, with added economics classes for finding material prices and plant profitability.",
    "Learned about the design process for setting up a plant, from the chemistry aspects to the economics aspects.",
    "Learned a lot about what to consider when evaluation whether or not to build a plant for a specific process. Also learned a ton about working in a group on a long term project. Super helpful overall. Lots of frustration with not having much help with the program\/software and not knowing how to approach very industry specific info",
    "Prosim software",
    "Basic considerations for chemical engineering process design. Intermediate use of ProSim plus software. Presentation skills."

   "comments": [
    "It is great to have the capstone be a group project. I was able to get closer to the other two in my group, and it made us all stay focused on the project and on track. If this had been an individual project, I'm sure most of us would have waited to the last minute. \r\n\r\nI think it would be good to have on non-presentation weeks a rough draft of writing to turn in and get comments on. It would help with the writing of the final paper, and make sure we are wording processes correctly.",
    "Pros:  Class is nothing but fellow Chem Eng seniors, no homework or tests, more relaxed atmosphere.\r\nCons: hard to schedule meeting as a group, IPR (progress update) presentations always ran overtime, Prosim modeling software was never used in the groups.",
    "The software, even though it was changed, was frustrating as it seemed there were not a lot of resources for help since the software was so niche. Perhaps more class time could be used to help with ProSim as much of the outside of class work uses the software of a software with more online help could be used. The IPRs were helpful to get feedback every other week, and so was the last week where class time was used to work in ProSim.",
    "The fact that we worked in a group was difficult  the group youre assigned can either make or break your semester. Also, much more class time should be spent on the simulation software. As is, I felt that the lecture didnt really pertain to our project much.",
    "The lectures with this course were very theoretical while the project was quite a bit more applied. There were many aspects of the project we had no idea how to approach because of the specificity . Not knowing the software very well is probably the major weakness, as was the limitation of the software in modeling some relatively simple or widespread chemical processes",
    "This course pretty much sucks. ProSim sucks. The presentations suck. Your group will probably suck. Sorry, you need it to graduate.",
    "Software is confusing but okay overall",
    "The demand for this class if just a bit too high. the project is so large and time consuming that if you do not work perfectly with your group the workload can become unmanageable.",
    "Strengths: practical design skills for engineers\r\nWeaknesses: way too much workload (I would rather have taken Transport again), little to no support exists for the software, ambiguity of progress reports, felt like lecture had little to no relevance to actual content of project and report"
