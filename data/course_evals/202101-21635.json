In particular, I think this class helped me learn to write with restraint -- making conscious compositional decisions as opposed to using every trick in the book in every song. You always learn a lot from looking at other people's songs each week, and the course felt like a good way to apply what I've been learning in other theory and composition classes directly to my work.",

                "Absolutely! If you are considering a career in musical theater composition, or even if you are just interested in writing, this is the class for you. You will really hone your craft during this course, and class meetings are thoroughly enjoyable -- the highlight of my week every Friday. Be prepared for a high workload, though. You're writing a song every week, and I usually spent 3-4 hours per day at the piano writing my songs for class. Maybe I'm just a slow composer, though... If you're willing to commit to the high workload, you will get so much out of the class, and I highly recommend it.",
                "Yes. It's deceptively difficult. It is a lot of work. It is hard to be creative and organized at the end of the week -- two things that the course requires. But, if you want to be a musical theater composer and have done work to pursue this, this is a course you must take. I wouldn't recommend coming in cold because there isn't much discussion on the basics of musical theater writing. The course assumes a lot of background knowledge, which is great for some but challenging for others.",
                "This class was a really fun introduction to musical theater for me, as someone who had some very useful prior composing/scoring/writing skills and intuitions but otherwise didn't really know much."
