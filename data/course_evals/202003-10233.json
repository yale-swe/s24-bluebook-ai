Due to the nature of the works, the questions and discussions we had forced us to think beyond literary phenomena and actually address questions like what it means to navigate a colonial history, what it means for a work to be difficult, what it means to be an \"epic.\" I certainly gained a lot from this course."

I also think our discussions of Omeros felt a little less enthusiastic than our discussions of Ulysses, but maybe we were just tired at the end of the semester.",

I would not have found the novel as personally meaningful if I had read it on my own. The critical readings helped me identify new interests within English literature. Although students were enrolled in the class from many different places, we felt like a community by the end of the semester. This course is a uniquely enriching reading experience!",

They are worth reading as they force us to grapple with questions we might not grapple with so often and their styles are highly interesting. Both works are innovative, comic, beautiful, challenging, and certainly epic."
