                "I think by providing more information on how to solve problems the course could become more clear, but overall a lot of practice was provided for students and TA office hours were always helpful",
                "The strengths of this course tie to how accessible the faculty were and how the workshops and extra practice really helped me grasp the material better. The process of working out example on a Jamboard together as we ask questions was a pretty straight forward, yet effective structure. The pre class modules that sometimes included videos made by Dr. Bobby himslef posted before every class also helped with introducing the material and breaking down in order to strictly spend class time on further examples if need be. The main weaknesses of the course lie in the overall usage of virtual platforms since calculus is pretty difficult to learn through a screen, but there have been numerous resources the proffesor and the TAs have used to make things more engaging.",
                "The breakout rooms, using the jamboard, are effective. I don't have any suggestions on how to improve, since I believe Dr. Bobby did the best he could given the circumstances.",
                "dr bobby was a great teacher",

                "I would say one thing that I appreciated about the course was how well it was able to adapt to the circumstances of Covid while still being pretty engaging through the use of online tools like Jamboard to work out examples in groups. I thought this made the class more interesting and it overall helped me retain the information better. Another thing that made the course succeed was the accessibility of the TAs and the professor through virtual workshops and plenty of office hours, which definitely helped me practice some of the concepts in order to get it down. The only thing I would improve upon is how engaging the lectures are. The professor always had a dialogue with us and always asked us questions about the topic at hand to keep us engaged, and we also worked out examples in groups through Jamboard to further practice the material. But sometimes, the engagement within the lectures lowers as there are many talking points the professor has to go through on certain topics. Another thing was that sometimes certain assignments and modules were posted incorrectly or posted a bit later due to technical issues and other various things, which is only a minor issue, since it was easily fixed.",
                "Posting the lecture notes on Canvas and entering breakout rooms are the two most helpful practices of this course. I feel like Dr. Bobby cares more about student comprehension than rushing through material.",
                "the format was good for the situation",
                "The breakout rooms during class really worked because they made the students apply their knowledge in group work through doing out problems on Jamboards. The office hours for problem sets also worked really well. If I had to choose something to be improved I might say recording the lessons so that I could have gone back and rewatched parts because the lessons went pretty fast, but I understand how recording them would decrease virtual class attendance among some students.",

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone just getting into Calculus and looking for where to start just due to how accessible and understanding the TAs and the professor are. All of the sessions and time you spend with them practicing the course material will definitely help you out in the long run. The group work within the course will also allow you to bounce ideas off of fellow students in order to not only practice the material, but also develop relationships with other first years. Overall, I had a great experience taking this course and I'm sure anyone else who is interested will too.",

The course is well structed and Dr. Bobby is a great instructor, he's very personable and really cares about his students' learning. The course also involved a lot of group learning\/working together through problems, which I enjoyed."
