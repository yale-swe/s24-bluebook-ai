                "Very organized, helpful psets and exams were fair",
                "Strengths: cool content that built on itself nicely. Weakness: very poorly organized and confusing lectures. Every third lecture or so was just jam-packed with important content, and the rest were totally unnecessary diversions that did not contribute to understanding the material at all. It was always a dice roll whether you'd actually learn something in class.",
                "Strengths: I was not expecting Hanwen Zhang to be as strong and as interesting a teacher as he was on a topic like differential equations. He was incredibly engaging and patient. I really appreciated how he reviewed previous lectures with the first few minutes of every class, so each lecture felt like a genuine continuation from prior content.\r\nWeaknesses: I think there is decent support for this course, but typically in math classes of this size, I usually see more than one ULA.",
                "Maybe a tad dry, wish it had moved faster so we could cover Sturm-Liouville.",
                "It requires a lot of self-teaching.",
                "The course is well organized with daily slides uploaded. The pacing allowed enough time to learn and absorb all the techniques without being too slow. All relevant book chapters are mentioned but I never felt the need to read them - the class covers everything well enough. It's a very manageable course.",
                "The content is boring, but there's not much you can do about that. Hanwen made it as interesting as possible.",
                "Strengths: Great problem sets that are well-connected to lectures and exams while still relatively easy without feeling like busywork. Prof. Zhang designed them extremely well. Also, Prof. Zhang worked through many examples (real examples, not toy problems) in class, so we got to see how an expert approached the problems, which was very helpful for such a skills-based course.\r\nWeaknesses: No lecture recordings, so many in-class asides were forgotten by exam time (though Hanwen posted his thorough notes).",
                "I thought a strength was that Professor Zhang certainly had a very good understanding of the material and was able to teach it well. However, I felt that the notes on the slides were a bit messy sometimes and that made reviewing difficult. I also felt that sometimes the exam questions were not the most relevant to what we had learned.",
                "Lecture notes were always posted which was very helpful. Exam questions were fair and PSET questions always aligned with class material well. Sometimes lectures would spend a lot of time on proofs or examples that we would not actually be asked about, and I wish some of this time had been spent doing practice problems. However, an overall well-run class.",
                "This course was very well organized and structured. A strength was that lecture notes with annotations are always provided along with several examples of each concept, which helped with learning the material.",
                "Strengths: Unironically the psets were very interesting as it related the topics we learned with other classes, such as economic, biology, analysis, complex analysis, and physics. Weakness: We did a rigorous proof (like math 255 level) about the existence and uniqueness theorem using uniform continuity, which I think is a overkill."

                "I'd recommend it! Especially if you're looking to take a math elective for some reason. The content is interesting. The course itself is reasonable (weekly homework, two midterms, and a cumulative final but all exams allow cheatsheets). And it's gratifying to solve concrete problems.",
                "I mean someone who is interested in applications of math, yes.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in any field that has a mathematical background.",

                "Only if you want to do math or physics.",
                "Yes, definitely. You learn how to approach and solve a very common mathematical problem that arises in numerous fields. At the same time, the course is not incredibly time-consuming or difficult. As I learned more in this course, I felt my physics courses getting easier due to my comfort with differential equations.",
                "This is a computation class (you do a lot of calculations)  if you have a good foundation of calculus, this is a good, easier class to take! This semester, we used the textbook Boyce, Diprima, Meade, Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems and it was very helpful to supplement and get intuition on approaches discussed in class. I wouldn't say it's super intellectually stimulating, but a good, easier class.",
                "Yes, pretty good introduction to differential equations.",
                "I would recommend this class to a student in a math-related major.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend taking this class. ODE is probably the most underrated math class since its importance extend beyond simply math and physics. However, don't be an idiot like me and take this class alongside 3 level 300 math courses thinking it is a gut class."
