I thought there wouldn't be much of a difference and did mine in the fall to get it out of the way\/ enjoy my final semester, but I think I would've been more prepared\/less stressed had I done it in the spring. \r\n- I do not recommend writing your thesis at the same time as 401 (also kind of shocking).  it's not that 401 is necessary to be able to write your thesis (in fact, I found it to be a rather poorly taught class), but I do think 40's final paper sets you up for the kind of thinking\/analysis that will eventually come up in your thesis. From a practical standpoint, it's also just way too much writing for a single semester (~30 pages here + ~15 pages in 401 + however many more pages you have in your other classes, all during finals period. It's a nightmare). \r\n- I do not recommend taking it during a semester with 4.5 credits or more. Let this be the beefy part of your schedule.\r\n- One page of clean(ish) writing took me at least three hours of brainpower (single spaced).\r\n- Do not leave until the end bc it really isn't that kind of thing (coming from a person who has made everything that kind of thing at Yale :\/ ) \r\n- Time and structure are the hardest part of the thesis, not the exercise itselfit's just more of the same writing we do in most classes here."
