                "Strengths: collaborative participation!\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes it felt that the same voices were only being heard, and other students left out",
                "Strengths: Professor Sunny!!! She is truly an amazing person who truly cares for each of her students. She was beyond flexible as we dealt with this chaotic semester, and made it clear that she truly wants us to succeed as students. Discussions were fantastic because Professor Sunny knew how to guide them, when to change topics, etc. Overall, an amazing instructor. I also REALLY want to shout out her choice to make participation collective, since this made the vibes so much better! Weaknesses: the syllabus. I personally found the syllabus deeply frustrating and borderline problematic. While the course is titled \"Readings in Comparative World English Literatures,\" this course felt like a deep dive into post-colonial literature. Note: I think reading this type of literature is still very important, but I think it unfairly created a canon that exclusively looked at other cultures through the framework of suffering. I rather enjoyed the Oceania segment of the course, as well as the occasional poems Professor Sunny snuck in there, and I wish more of the syllabus looked at culture as both a synthesis of historical analysis (which includes suffering/trauma), and cultural elements (which tend to be less dark/traumatic). Overall, the course was still strong and engaging, if just dark and at times triggering.",
                "Strengths: Everything. If you can take this course with Professor Xiang you absolutely should! Intimate setting-- check, engaging discussion-- check, GREAT discussion leader-- check! A phenomenal first English experience at Yale.",
                "We discussed this several times throughout the year, but there is something misleading about making a World Literature class dedicated to the trauma of colonialism. There is more to the world than suffering imposed by European interests, and I think opening the course to texts that celebrate the cultures they spring from would help to balance the view of the \"marginal\" nations we study. I would also like to see more works from east Asian and South American writers, because the majority of the class focused on African and Carribean sources.",
                "Strengths: interesting works on syllabus (mostly chosen by Sunny), manageable workload - though we were expected to read at a quick pace, and a progressive, understanding class environment.\r\nWeaknesses: conversation could be boring, works were trauma-heavy, and there was very little guidance around writing.",
                "strengths: you read great books and have interesting conversations\r\nweaknesses: the class is not the most organized and often just feels like a converesation",
                "The one and only weakness of this course was something outside of Professor Xiang's control: the very trauma-heavy book selection. It really spoke to her character and core values as an instructor that she was actually the one who raised this weakness and had a conversation with the class about this trauma and providing trigger warnings instead of just sweeping it under the rug. Our class wished that the ENGL 128 syllabus could be changed to reflect more diversity in world literature as something that does not only contain stories of trauma through the lens of colonialism. That said, the pieces that Professor Xiang chose were incredibly interesting and diverse, especially the unit on Pacific Islander literature (an area I do not think I would have otherwise encountered in the English major). The biggest strength of this course was definitely Professor Xiang. She has been an incredibly caring, engaging, passionate, and brilliant professor. She leads seminars wonderfully and makes everyone feel welcome to speak while providing her input and questions along the way. She's also been a very thoughtful and caring professor who is mindful of her students' well-being and the stressful conditions of the semester. Just to give you an example, on the day of course registration which coincided with the beginning of class, she allowed us to register for courses before starting class. And on one day where the reading was particularly trauma-heavy, she made the class optional. She also started every class with an ice breaker and brought us snacks! My writing also improved tremendously under Professor Xiang's guidance through her generous feedback and writing handouts. She has also just been a very different professor than I've ever had before in the most positive sense of the word. Her scholarly focus is on AAPI literature with a special interest in war and imperialism, and it was so wonderful to be able to hear her thoughts on these topics during class, even if it was implicit. Additionally, as an Asian American student, it meant a great deal to me to see someone like me represented in the English department. She also graded us on collective participation, had a final project of sorts that wasn't an essay (where we had to teach an object that we believed to count as \"world literature\"), and encouraged us to include archival research into our paper writing. Professor Xiang is one of the English Department's finest instructors, and I cannot wait to take another course with her in the future!",
                "Strengths: Professor Xiang!!! Such a kind and understanding professor Weaknesses: This definitely has to do with the course structure than anything else, but I wish that there were more texts that actually engaged with joy and happiness, instead of just focusing on decolonialism and struggle of formerly colonized peoples/people of color.",
                "Good discussions.",
                "The only thing I would say needs improvement is the syllabus. Less trauma-heavy would be better. Other than that, I thought that the organization and structure of the class, the assignments, and the discussions were all really great. I genuinely looked forward to coming to class at 9am twice a week."

                "Since it's required for English majors yes (unless you do both 125 and 126, which I don't recommend)! For anyone else, I would caution that this course is a fair amount of work. You read a significant amount (about 1 text per week, although sometimes it's stretched out a bit more), and the writing pieces, while not long, require a lot of consideration to earn high marks. I think that overall, it's a challenging, but rewarding course and Professor Sunny is a joy to work with. One note is that the syllabus can be very triggering to some people, so please, please, please check the readings out ahead of time and consult your professor (Sunny said she would bring them up ahead of time and find ways of accommodating)",
                "YES! TAKE TAKE TAKE!!!",
                "I think it's critical for students of literature to read globally, and this class did introduce me to authors that I would not have encountered otherwise. However, I don't know if I'd recommend this iteration of the class to students who do not require the foundational English courses because I think it is a very skewed and still Eurocentric view of world literature. Instead, I would recommend courses that are individually dedicated to regions of world literature, such as Chinese literature or Brazilian literature, etc. I realize that these courses are few and far between, however, so this would be the next best thing.",
                "Maybe. I liked it, but it wasnt revelatory and the workload was too rushed to enjoy, and too much to analyze profoundly. It felt sort of superficial, which is probably inherent to the task of covering the worlds English literature in a semester, but Im glad I got to read the books on the syllabus.",
                "If you like reading stories you may not normally get in a classic literature course and dont mind the english class vibe of just talking the whole time and listening to other people then take it. Prof Xiang is super understanding and sweet. but it can get a bit boring",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course with a few caveats, however. Be aware that the ENGL 128 syllabus is incredibly trauma-heavy, so try to take it with Professor Xiang if you can because the texts she includes outside of the ENGL 128 core texts are amazing. Professor Xiang is also an incredible professor who will teach you so much.",
                "Yes. Good texts and engaging discussions. Good feedback on writing.",
                "Yes, but do your research on the syllabus and decide if these are texts you really want to spend time with. More importantly, I recommend taking any course with Prof Sunny. She is wonderful."
