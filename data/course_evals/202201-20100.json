                "Strengths: interesting material abs really smart and knowledgeable professor. Professor Kenney makes super complicated physical concepts much kore accessible to undergrads which is really cool. One way the course could be improved is that there was a pre lecture abs lecture for each class which meant that there are 100 slides to study for each class and thus there were 1600 slides to study for the final.",
                "Prof. Kenney made the class fun. The in-person classes were centered around discussions which were very engaging and developed my astro problem solving brain. However 1.5 hours of recorded lecture and another hour of in-person class is a lot of information to swallow.",
                "The prerecorded lectures were really long and at a certain point, it stopped feeling worth it to watch them. It's so much information at once to the point where it feels impossible to absorb everything. The homework and lectures also felt mismatched. I also wish there were more office hours. Prof Kenney was very cryptic whenever answering questions since he didn't want to give things away, but it often left me more confused. Besides this and how much information he throws at you, Prof Kenney is really good and a big strength. I also felt like his giving practice tests was really helpful. His exams were really tough, though, and seemed way too long for how much time we were given. I wish there were more office hours, though. Prof Kenney was also very cryptic whenever answering questions since he didn't want to give things away, but it often left me more confused.",
                "The strengths of the course is that Professor Kenney is amazing and extremely knowledgeable. The course goes very in depth into topics. The only weakness is the class is a flip class.",
                "Strengths: phenomenal structure, consisting both of recorded lectures and live interactive discussions that kept the students engaged and willing to apply the knowledge they had acquired to actual applications.\r\nNo weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Kenney is great!!! Really makes you excited about the material. The in-class questions and discussions are great for really understanding the material. Weaknesses: Sometimes the recorded pre-lectures were very long. Also it's sometimes difficult to know how much detail to put into test answers.",
                "I really liked the way we thought through and answered problems during classtime. It was really helpful to learn how to think through problems in that way. I do, however, wish we were shown more math problem examples in class and in the lectures."

                "It was tough, but I enjoyed this class. While the amount of content became overwhelming before the exams, the rest of the class was fun and not too much. The jump from 210 to 310 is very large, though, and requires a lot of work. Overall, I would recommend it with the caveat that you should stay on top of lectures throughout the semester since it's a lot to cram!",

                "Yes if you're very interested in astronomy and have prior knowledge! ASTR 210 is a prereq but I was able to do fine in this class even though I hadn't taken it. However, I had taken ASTR 255 previously  you definitely need at least one prior broader astronomy class otherwise you'll have a tough time."
