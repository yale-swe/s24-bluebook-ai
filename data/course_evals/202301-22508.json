                "one of the few courses at Yale where you actually make things. big things.",
                "I learned how to use a variety of shop machines and tools. I also gained a wealth of information regarding various materials, from wood to steel.",
                "I learned so much about how buildings come together physically. It was a delightful introduction that made me gain more knowledge about the make up of the world around me. After taking this class, I have an additional lens with which to see the world.",
                "I learned the general history and modern uses of the most common materials used in architecture today such as concrete, timber, steel, brick, glass, insulation, and others. Also through the lab developed skills in welding, construction, architecture tools, and more.",
                "I learned many essential concepts for building. For example we learned to weld, lay brick, mix concrete and create a wooden frame for a building.",
                "I feel much more confident in my ability to use different tools in woodshops. I feel more confident with basic construction methods. I understand how to approach thinking about materials in architecture.",
                "How to build with different materials, the history of each material, and the applications",
                "I learned about the materials used to make many buildings and how to work with these materials.",
                "Architecture and the materials that go into buildings!",
                "Through Materials in Architecture, I have learned how to weld, mix concrete, cast, use Rhino, and CNC mill. Through hands on learning, I have been able to observe, first hand, the relationship that materials have with the structures that are being produced.",
                "I gained many skills that I don't think I would have picked up anywhere else. Pouring concrete, welding, laser-cutting, laying bricks, all the shop tools  so many technical skills. I also gained a deeper understanding of different materials, and a lot of that comes with the hands on nature of this class.",
                "I strengthened so many skills!! I strengthened skills in design, material use, creativity, hands-on creation, analysis, research, building, and collaboration."

                "This is an awesome course! The class is fun and a great way to spend a Friday morning. It is consistent and well organized. The tfs and instructors are dedicated and engaging. The main project outside of in-class work is the precedent study. Students should be organized in their approach to conducting the precedent study, setting aside time throughout the semester rather than completing all of it in the very end. If anything, slightly more guidance on the precedent study could have been beneficial.",
                "This course balanced lecture and lab very well. The TFs were fantastic because they were always available to help. I felt very supported throughout my learning journey.",
                "A strength of the course is the lab which is very fun and lets students participate and learn how to complete activities that they never would be able to otherwise such as welding, shaping wood, timber construction, laying brick, making concrete, and more. Additionally the final project let students actually build a model which was very engaging and learn more architecture shop skills.  A weakness could be the lectures as they sometimes went over time and were not the most engaging but were interesting.",
                "The course was awesome. I wish there were more check ins for the precedent project, and I wish the shop was open for longer hours.",
                "It was an awesome class. I enjoy the precedent study format. The materials discussed and their accompanying labs were diverse, interactive, really fun.",
                "Strengths: fun, interesting, easy workload\r\n\r\nWeakness: not organized",
                "It was great",
                "As someone who enjoys learning, I do not think that I had learned as much as I wanted to. I think that this class certainly has potential to be expanded upon. I found that having both the lecture and the lab crammed into one Friday was quite stressful and felt that it did not maximize the contact we had with the content and the hands on learning. I think the class could be more enriching if it could be organized such that lectures are held throughout the week and labs are held on Friday.",
                "Class each week was always really enjoyable. Friday at 9am is often hard to get awake for, but I was glad I was there every time. The TFs were always so so helpful and they are a real strength of the class. Also another strength is how you can engage as much as you want with this class, especially with how much independence you have with the final project. One weakness may be because of how it meets only once a week and has just the one final project, I don't think I got much feedback  but everyone was still super helpful.",
                "Strengths: The creativity of the course, the excitement of going to each class, the workshop days, the balance of research and building, the class atmosphere, and Professor Newton\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The time commitment (although I think it was necessary and I was prepared for it)."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if you are at all interested in building materials and like working with your hands. The time in the architecture shop is simply very cool and the lectures albeit slow provide good background information for everything we use today which is interesting. The class has virtually no work associated with it which makes it a stress-free environment as everyone is there just to learn and explore the materials in architecture.",
                "Of course. Its a great way to actually learn hard skills with an awesome. That is something that most people lack the skills learned in this class. They are great to have for any future homeowner.",
                "Definitely. I already have been :)",
                "Yes, so fun and a great stress release. Good way to use the other side of your brain if youre not an art focused student.",
