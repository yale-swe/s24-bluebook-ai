                "This class taught me how to research a single site, and create a series of assignments around that space over the course of the semester. In particular, I learned how to use some software (Photshop, Illustrator, InDesign) to create those images and present.",
                "Although I had qualms about this course, I did think I learned the adobe suite to a useable level and had the chance to work on my presentation-giving skills.",
                "As someone who had never taken an architecture course at Yale before, I felt like this was a completely immerse experience as to what it takes to do meaningful work within the department. I learned so much about visual communication and verbal presentation over the course of the semester -- one of the most unique classes here for sure.",
                "It's a great question that I'm still kind of asking myself. This course isn't quite a design class, not really a history or sociology course, and not fully an art class. The projects are a strange mix between everything that leave me strangely fulfilled but also confused as to what it is I'm really learning. The one thing I know for sure is that I put a lot of research into my site and came away with a deep understanding of that area, as to everything else, I can only say that I took away... \"something.\"",

                "Arguing for a thesis through visual material; giving oral presentations; learning how to actively incorporate constructive criticism; use of Adobe Suite including Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign; new theoretical ways of thinking about how to represent what makes our world \"urban.\" I also gained more insight into how design thinking is truly iterative, I saw that our projects and arguments improved each time we revisited and reworked them.",
                "This course provided an intensive means to discover the urbanity of deeply isolated spaces. It provided a rudimentary introduction to Adobe Suite products, which are integral to succeeding in the course. Further, it provides for a challenging but rewarding engagement with a site that is chosen by the teaching team for you to investigate throughout the semester.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: I think this class has actually taught me a fair number of practical skills for presentation, creation of artifacts, and software use. The architecture school can be a difficult place to navigate, and this is a good class for learning how to use the printers, plotters, laser cutters, photo lab, etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the assignments in this class are really difficult to understand if you've never taken a class like this before. At the end of the semester, I feel like I can look back and understand the general thread of architectural presentation that was present throughout the course, but even by the midterm, I was still super confused about what we were making and why.",
                "This whole course is based on students choosing from a list of remote sites that they then must research for the whole of the semester, mostly within the frame of attempting to understand how they are urban without really being urban. A big limitation of the class is if you don't like your site or start to get bored with it as time goes on, you are out of luck. You are forced to make a lot of big claims about these sites which you will never visit. You \"research\" by creating digital art like maps, collages and sections. My experience in this class I think would have been greatly improved if I had had the opportunity to choose my own site that fell within the parameters of the classes' ethos. Further, I think a more reasonable, cohesive, and clear schedule for assignments would have been appreciated. In some ways, the course unfortunately forces last minute work. The section for the class where you get to work one on one with TAs and receive actual feedback about your ideas and tutorials on how to use software were on Monday nights ending at 8pm, and assignments were due the following Wednesday at class time at 1:30. This means that if you had busy days on Tuesday, you basically were always going to be rushed doing assignments. This was a huge weakness of the class and greatly greatly diminished how much I got out of it. \r\n\r\nFurther, I felt that the class was far too large for the way that it was run. Many classes would go over time because every one of the 15 or so of us had to present our work during class. This meant a lot less discussion and a lot of rushing around. \r\n\r\nThat being said, there were many things about the class that were exceedingly awesome. The TAs, for example, Miranda and Annika were incredible in leading the course and working with students through problems. They were very patient and gave so much of their time to the course. This is very rare in the architecture school, where many graduate students push the culture that exists at YSoA of working working working on projects even if your own needs are at risk. I felt endlessly supported by the TAs and was so grateful for them throughout the duration of the course. \r\n\r\nThis class also took a trip to Iceland which was..... maybe the best thing that has ever happened to me at Yale College. I mean. Wow. I think I would have even rather the class just talk about the urbanism of Iceland. I learned so so so much on the trip and it was extremely memorable.",
                "This class has such a unique approach to discussing the problems facing the urban world today. By giving studnets assigned sites to research all semester long, I felt like I really got to know what it was like to do long-term research projects, and revisit my work with new material every week. \r\n\r\nThe course could have been organized better in some weeks, giving studnets more time for assignments that were extensive and long.",
                "Strengths: Joyce and the TFs are fantastic, the urban lab space is amazing, the trip was mindblowing, the work was (mostly) fulfilling\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There's a feeling of never fully knowing when things are due more than 4 days before the date and the rearranging of dates that happens often. \r\n\r\nThe main thing for me, and i say this sadly because I loved everyone I took this class with, is that it should not be as big as it was. This course is marketed as a sort of Urban Studies equivalent for architecture studio, but the majority of people in the class weren't even urban studies majors. Crit times were always uncomfortably short and presentations were rushed. I really think this class should be a small studio for urban studies majors only, not a course you take to shop the major.",
                "really wonderful course, I would have enjoyed more structured lectures or learning from the professor !",
                "The freedom that we are given when exploring our initial site was both a strength and a weakness, in my opinion. On one hand, each person in the class was self-driven in researching the site we chose initially. However, towards the end of the semester, it felt like the instructor and teaching team tried to persuade us to choose one way to interpret the site. We were given little restrictions in how we wanted to present the location we chose, but in the end, our final presentations more or less reflected what direction the teaching team wanted us to go in anyway :/ I think this could have been avoided if we were given freedom in exploration *and* more concrete (less abstract) guiding questions from the beginning. \r\nAnother weakness included the fact that a lot of our negative feedback came from things we did not receive much guidance on, firsthand. We never really talked about how to start \"making images that speak for themselves\" or the rules of graphic design, and yet our midterm grade and in-class constructive feedback often related to these points. Though I appreciate we had quick tutorials through Adobe Suite, I think less of our grade should have reflected sophistication/mastery of these tools that were new to most (if not all) of us. \r\nThe class size was another strength in that we had a seminar-studio environment. We learned from how each person crafted their biweekly presentations, but at times the class size felt more like a weakness: on days where we had one-on-one feedback, class time almost always went over. \r\nBecause we all learned so much about our sites, I think another strength is that we gained a lot of information that we could potentially carry on into our senior theses next year...",
                "This course is strong with the teaching team. Joyce and the TAs were extremely supportive, engaging and engaged, and provided amazing insight into improving our research and end products. The course is weak in its structure  lab time, which was held Monday evenings, were when we, as students, learned how to do weekly assignments. Often, these assignments were then due the following Wednesday in the early afternoon, making the time needed to master the Adobe Suite product to complete them, as well as actually completing the project, extremely difficult. This course, at times, felt disengaged with students time capacities. The assignments also felt extremely detached from the course, titled Urban Lab: An Urban World, until the class goes on a trip, in which themes of the course reoccur and are better engaged. The course can be improved by removing one of the assignments and committing more time to discussions of urbanity and isolation, through the context of each site. It can also be improved through more lecturing  there needs to be more connection and relationship-exhibiting between the chosen sites, as well as to themes of the course.",
                "A definite strength was the use of one site, and especially the kinds of sites, through the entire semester. The approach to research was a bit confusing, as it did not become clear that one half was quantitative and the other was qualitative until the end of the semester."

                "I think I would recommend this class. Joyce is amazing, and our TFs were super helpful as well, but I'm not sure what exactly I was meant to achieve from this class besides a deep knowledge of the remote site I was assigned. I think it's super hard to understand what the class is before you take it, so here's a brief overview: The first week of class, you choose a remote site from several options. These were things like remote islands, the moon, glaciers, and zones in the ocean. Once you have your site, you'll make your assignments about that site for the rest of the semester. You'll make a \"map\" of your site, which maps something that normal maps don't show, you'll \"reimagine\" that place, making a movie or an artifact, you'll do a section, a collage, and a PowerPoint presentation. You basically research different themes of the site in the early part of the semester, and then find aesthetically pleasing ways to displays that research later on. \r\n\r\nIt is definitely not for everyone, and it will take you a long time to struggle through the design of assignments, the printing process, etc. But I do think I gained valuable skills in terms of learning the importance of design and aesthetic and the different software. So overall, I would recommend!",
                "I don't know. I think you should know what you're getting into. Read past syllabi. Make sure that your course load is accommodating and you have time to work on assignments. When you are picking your site pick very carefully. The type of \"research\" you do through making visuals is interesting, and you will learn how to use the adobe suite if nothing else. The class trip, wherever it is, will be really impactful. Just be prepared to be frustrated and willing to miss a deadline or two to take care of yourself first.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course, but it is a lot of work. Probably the biggest woakload class I've had here at Yale. So just be mindful of other classes as you do so.",
                "Definitely, if interested in urbanism and beginning to learn a different way of thinking",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they're required to take it, and even then I'd recommend they at least have a friend going into this class. Assignments are much too vague to understand on your own, and asking the teaching team could make you more confused. The field trip is certainly a highlight if you can make it but be prepared to spend hours and hours on projects/presentations that are going to be taken apart in front of the class. I think people interested in urbanism, international policy, architecture, and climate change could benefit from this course if they adopt the mindset that they have to receive harsh criticism before they can grow in their fields. I'd recommend this course to another student if they also had experience in Adobe too, since that is what we used for almost all our assignments. I'd also recommend this course to someone who has already taken a seminar-studio in the architecture department since they'll be using many of the same resources (printers, plotters, computers, etc). My last piece of advice would be to not get too attached to any one project-- it can always improve.",
                "Yes and no. Do not take this course with a greater than 4 course workload (including the course). Do not take it if youre doing it for a trip. Do take it because youre curious about the world functions, through an urban lens. Take it if you want to expand your Adobe Suite understanding and portfolio. Take it if you want to engage with your own sense of creativity. The course is extremely effective in pushing students to think more  your thinking will be challenged, so take the course if you are okay with that.",
