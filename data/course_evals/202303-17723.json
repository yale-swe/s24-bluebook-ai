Through homework, class presentations, and events for the asynchronous hours, I also learned about the Deaf community in the United States, Deaf history and storytelling, and some elements of Deaf culture.",
                "During the course, I developed a very strong foundation in ASL, especially for an introductory course. Beyond advancing my signing aptitude, I learned more about deaf culture and had many opportunities to work on applying my skills outside the classroom. I also gained valuable experiences interacting with my classmates and other individuals, which proved very insightful.",

                "Strengths: curriculum is straightforward. many opportunities to practice and improve. class is low-stress but high-reward. it really transformed my perception of ASL and the Deaf community. \r\nWeaknesses: rarely receive feedback from professor and assignments go ungraded for entire semester.",
                "Zen is an amazing professor who is extremely engaged with his students.",
                "strengths--interesting content, work, meaningful discussions about the Deaf community\r\nweaknesses--a lot of the content on quizzes are not taught in class, so you have to just guess. also this year (fall 2022) there isn't a service project for ASL1 but a lot of the canvas assignments weren't changed yet. There were a lot of journal entries about the service project and I wasn't sure what to put for them, so I didn't put much, and the professor marked me down pretty substantially. I think the grading is the most stressful part, as grades were put in at the last second and there were a lot of modules in Signing Naturally that just failed to sync with canvas and either showed up as late or missing.",
                "Fun class! Would be nice to have more feedback to know how we're doing",
                "The homework and classes make the proper way to sign and certain appropriate variations for some words pretty clear. The \"asynchronous hours\" component is wonderful and provides great opportunities for practicing the language and learning more about the Deaf\/Hard of Hearing community. However, it would be much improved if there were a list of all events that qualify at the beginning of the semester. Without it, it is hard to plan ahead and determine how best to complete the required number of hours. As it is, it is best to aim to complete them earlier in the semester or during times with less of a workload.",
                "Many of the strengths include strong engagement from Zen (he was a very fun and competent professor), well paced (in terms of content), and a great atmosphere in the classroom. In terms of future improvements, Id like to learn more nuance vocabulary for conversations.",
                "Amazing, the class was so fun and I looked forward to going. Concepts were taught at the right pace and the content flowed nicely.",
                "The course was well organized to introduce new vocab, though at times class itself felt repetitive and assignments did not seem to accord with what was being done in class."
