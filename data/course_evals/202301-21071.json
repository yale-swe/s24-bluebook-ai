                "This course provided me with an excellent overview of current directions in AI research and made me more interested in the topic than ever before. I find that the reading assignments provided are very interesting, and I like how Prof. Jara-Ettinger encourages us to think critically about each topic through weekly responses. The seminar-style discussions were also very rewarding since they allow the students to engage in friendly debates from time to time. Overall, I feel like this course enhanced my knowledge of computational theories of human intelligence and provided me with more than enough insights to hold a conversation about the topic with anyone.",
                "Through this course, I learned about the current progress or lack of progress in important domains of AI and cognitive science, particularly in areas of how each field can inform the other to advance innovations and current AI technologies and understanding of our brains and cognitive systems.",
                "I learned how to talk to talk about AI and understand how to think about it from a Cognitive Science Perspective.",
                "In this course, we learned about the multi-faceted aspects of AI and cognitive science. We learned about deep learning, morality around machines, and the importance of the brain as the blueprint for AI."

                "Strengths: you learn how to form your own opinions about the topics that this class covers, at the end of seminar day the professor goes over what will be discussed in the next class which is super helpful, \r\nWeakness: since this class is structured like a debate, oftentimes the CS students in the class overtakes the conversation due to their more advanced/technical knowledge about the material. When the conversation turns to more technical things, it hinders other students from participating.",
                "I really can't think of anything that I would change for this class. It was a really nice balance of the professor lecturing and a debate for class discussion. Everyone seemed very engaged, and I learned so much from the professor, readings, and my peers.",
                "As it stands, I cannot think of any particular weaknesses of this course. This seminar is extremely well organized and planned out in a way that makes sense. Both the content and the professor's engagement in weekly discussions are the general reasons why this course is so strong. I will also mention that I anticipated weekly presentations that rehash the previous week's debate to seem a bit redundant, but I've grown to like this method since it helps refresh everyone's memory, especially in cases where the debate builds off the previous one.",
                "This course is a wonderful seminar and I really enjoyed every class because I was able to engage with the material in a very interactive manner and the class, particularly through Professor Jara-Ettinger, really valued and supported each other to develop our knowledge and thoughts on important matters in AI and cognitive science.",
                "I enjoyed it as is!",

                "If you're interested in big-picture questions about AI engineering and/or about how large-scale mechanisms of cognition, this is the course for you. The readings are super rewarding, and the debates in class are always thought-provoking. Prof Jara-Ettinger always adds interesting ideas that help discussion flow.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are willing to put in the work of reading very difficult papers related to Cognitive Science.",

While I believe that this course could be just as interesting to anyone with a completely different academic background, I have found that being generally curious about the topic and having some form of introductory knowledge in cognitive science is extremely helpful. While the workload is manageable, I would recommend it to anyone signing up for the course to make the most of the readings because the content is always very interesting. Knowing what I know now, I would absolutely take this course again.",
