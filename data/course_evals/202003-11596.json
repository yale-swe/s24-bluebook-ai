                "The class was really great! The lectures were well-done, and the assignments were helpful. It would have been nice to have a few more grades in the gradebook throughout the semester so we knew how we were doing, but otherwise it was good!",
                "Strengths: Professor Kane genuinely loves what he does, and he infuses the lectures with so much energy and enthusiasm. He makes some pretty challenging music accessible even for people with a minimal music background, and makes sure to explore the tough territory of race, gender, cultural appropriation, minstrelsy, etc. in very thoughtful ways. Also, he puts all the music into Spotify playlists, which adds a way to casually engage with the class (I liked listening to the playlists while driving). Weaknesses: There is a TON of reading, and the two required texts are dense and expensive. In addition to assigning chapters in these books for every lecture, Prof. Kane also assigns primary sources on Canvas. I was not able to keep up with the readings at all, but I did still get a lot out of the class, so if you're comfortable skimming or you're actually happy to do that much reading about jazz, then this will still work for you.",
                "Strengths: really cool content, great prof, realistic expectations\/accommodations during covid. weaknesses: n\/a",
                "Very strong content structure, assignments, and teaching. Prof Kane is a wonderfully engaging lecturer",
                "We got to listen to a huge array of jazz music throughout the course, and that often served as a helpful backdrop for the historical and cultural components of the course. The weekly discussion posts were very helpful in allowing us to dive further into the material discussed in lectures. Perhaps slightly more organization of lecture material would help, e.g. a summary slide at the beginning or end to help students focus on the major takeaways of each lesson - at times I felt I got lost in the midst of all the music.",
                "I thought the course struggles to translate to zoom but I throughly enjoyed it either way. The nature of the class is such that being in person and listening together would make it far more enjoyable",
                "Lectures were very informative, engaging, and enjoyable! Reading responses provided the perfect opportunity to become more knowledgeable of the material discussed in class, and the time required for those assignments wasn't a lot. Various papers assigned throughout the course were also very manageable. That being said, it would've been nice to have access to the PowerPoint slides that were shown during each lecture."

                "Professor Kane decided to eliminate section meetings and instead assigned discussion posts for us to write every week. I would have strongly preferred section meetings, because there was almost no student participation during lectures, and I could've benefited from the chance to ask questions in a small group and work through some of the ideas Prof. Kane flew through in the very dense lectures. Also, the Canvas discussion posts were often totally unrelated to what we learned in lecture, so rather than helping us solidify and deepen our understanding, they involved going off on very specific tangents.",
                "I really enjoyed the asynchronous discussion section because students from different time zones could get into deep discussions in the threads without having to be in a long zoom call.",
                "I really disliked the virtual written section. Though the TAs told us that we should only spend the amount of time on the blog posts that we would spend to prepare for and be in a traditional 1hr section, there was no acknowledgement that written work is VERY different from in person discussions and require very different amounts of preparation and levels of expectation concerning precision of language. I also missed seeing peoples faces in a live or virtually live section discussion.",
                "I think I learned a ton from the research I did in section, but the reading required by section plus the reading required for the course generally was somewhat overwhelming considering the atmosphere of the pandemic and overall increase in screen time.",
                "Discussion sections were helpful in allowing us to explore supplementary material and were probably the best way we could have engaged with each other's ideas given the circumstances. Screen and audio sharing were utilized with success throughout the course.",

Professor Kane is super nice and knows a lot, so I don't see any reason not to take it. You also definitely don't need to be a music major to take the class -- it's accessible for people with all types of backgrounds.",
                "Yes -- if analyzing old recordings of jazz sounds fun to you, you will love this course! It's a true blend of history and musicology. You don't need a music background to succeed--Professor Kane makes the material totally accessible--but I think I wouldn't have gotten as much out of the course without my prior exposure to jazz as a musician.",

                "Yes! If you are interested in jazz or are looking for an interesting , fun, and relevant 5th class take this! Really engaging course but not too work heavy. Lectures are well organized and Prof. Kane does a great job making sure the course is accessible. Definitely not just a class for people with prior musical\/jazz knowledge.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any musician or anyone who has even a remote interest in music. I always took for granted the complex cultural history of jazz, and learning more about that has helped me to develop a more nuanced and thoughtful approach to not only jazz but to all styles of music.",
                "Yes I would but perhaps not virtually.",
                "Absolutely! Regardless of your musical background, this is a great class to learn about early jazz. Workload is very manageable and the readings are very interesting. You will certainly leave the class with both a great appreciation for and respect of the music form!"
