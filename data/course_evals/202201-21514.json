This class gave me a chance to finish a teleplay, and I learned so much about storytelling in the process. Ill definitely be taking the lessons I learned about developing conflict and tension to my future writing.",

                "Prof. Tracy gives really helpful feedback on your work. I think the class's structure was its main weakness. I would have liked if we had more assignments to turn in for feedback. I would have liked to write more and peer-edit more in a way that was inherent to the class. I think we could have done a lot more talking to classmates about our ideas in a way that felt useful and not so rushed\r\n\r\nThings that were helpful: learning about mistakes younger writers often make, rules of thumb, different paths people take into the industry, good questions to ask yourself when writing a scene or creating a character etc, talking w classmates about ideas\r\nThings that weren't super helpful: lots of absolute rules, lots of YouTube videos, not a ton of opportunities to receive feedback",
                "While I found every given assignment and class discussion productive and enjoyable, given the final assignment and amount of time we had, I did not always think we optimized our time well.\r\nI wish this course built in revision on the individual assignments more, as well as feedback on actual writing before the final assignment.",
                "Strengths: attracts a lot of cool ppl who wanna go into the industry\r\n\r\nWeakness: lots of overlap w 425",
                "Strengths: great professor, great material to read, fun discussion, very good guest speaker. Weaknesses: can be slightly repetitive and writing a full screenplay is a challenge.",
                "The course provided lots of good material to study and some of the guest speakers were very worthwhile. There were maybe too many guest speakers however and not enough focus on dissecting the scripts as a whole.",
                "There isnt enough writing in the course, so by the time you write your pilot you feel somewhat unprepared. Also, the professor is really nice but sometimes he just plays videos instead of explaining things himself. But I did learn some stuff."

                "I think that this class could just be better structured! If we did outlines and things much sooner, it might be more work, but getting feedback earlier would be really helpful and would avoid the end of the semester feeling a little like the only time we have a big assignment. I think front loading the course (having more things due before the break) and then spending the rest of the semester working with classmates on revising/editing, doing peer-edits, receiving feedback from Prof. Aaron would have been really helpful.",
                "If you are interested in the tv industry, this course will get you with a first draft of a full pilot and a fleshed out idea for a series.",
                "Yes if you wanna take a general tv writing course but no if youve already taken 425",
                "Yes! I would strongly recommend any future students start writing their pilots as soon as possible, because it can be rather overwhelming during finals period. If youre interested in television writing, however, this course provides an excellent opportunity to write a complete pilot episode in a supportive environment.",
                "Yes!! Amazing course. Aaron Tracy is a great professor and this course is very helpful especially if you want to go into the entertainment industry.",
                "I would recommend to any prospective writers. Its very intense toward the end of the semester in terms of how much needs to be written but its a great way to get credit for developing your craft and Aaron Tracy has lots of good insight.",
                "YES! Such a cool class and highly recommend if you are interested in TV writing. You don't need prior experience so long as you are willing to speak up when you don't know what something is."
