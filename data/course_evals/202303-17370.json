                "I loved the emphasis on student writing in this course -- each week we read two student short stories and gave detailed notes. Our class discussions, then, were mainly devoted to discussing these notes. This format pushed everyone to bring their best writing when it was their week to be workshopped. Caz also provided incredibly detailed feedback on every draft, which was a highlight of the course.",
                "I benefitted a lot from the workshop structure of the course, as well as from the focus on specific feedback and individualized reading assignments. The weekly workshops helped me develop a stronger editing and writing skill set.",
                "A big strength was the amount of time for individual focus, whether in workshop or office hours. Each workshop would allow for lots of helpful feedback. I think a strength and a weakness was Caz's bluntness--he is someone to really tell it as it is, which can sometimes be incredibly helpful but often verged on cruel.",
                "It would have been good to know what was expected of our second story before beginning our second drafts (ie that we ought to write a more structurally sound story that writes towards ourself). \r\n\r\nOtherwise, I really enjoyed getting to read samples of writing to know how to improve my own structures. This class gave me the best insights into character out of any writing class at Yale."

Professor Phillips is great at identifying and naming what is and isn't working in a piece, and he leads workshops that provide thorough and actionable feedback.",
                "If you are serious about writing and want to pursue it in the classroom, yes.",
                "Only take this course if you are willing to put in the work to be a better writer! Although you only have two stories throughout the semester, expect to be constantly drafting and redrafting your work. This is more of an intellectual than productivity struggle; be thinking of your stories early and meet with Caz regularly. He is extremely helpful and getting to know where your writing is standing makes the class far more useful."
