                "In this class, we spend over two hours analyzing two works in the YUAG's collection. We learn to extricate the different processes of art historical argumentation -- providing visual analysis first, and only then interpreting from the details observed. This class teaches you to think clearly and argue effectively by assuring that statements and interpretations you make are grounded and not prescriptive. You also learn to find the benefit in observing an object for prolonged periods of time to continuously find meaning."

                "I think almost every aspect of this course was great. I think it could only be improved slightly by maybe meeting twice per week for shorter periods of time, since by the end of class we tended to get tired because we spent most of the time standing in the gallery.",
                "Strengths: It's great to explore the YUAG and take advantage of having it on Yale's campus. Professor Suthor is very kind and makes everyone feel comfortable participating. \r\nWeaknesses: Class can feel long sometimes because we just look at 2 pieces.",
                "All strengths. Professor Suthor is incredibly engaging and receptive, and the program was well thought out.",
                "I wish there was more modern art in the syllabus, but that is just personal preference and not her area of speciality so is understandable",
                "This course is so stimulating with wonderful yet doable readings for each class that enrich the approaches to works we deal with for a chosen week. The class discussions are wonderful, and each student brings their own background (academic and personal) to enhance readings of the artworks. It goes without saying, but to have a class fully taught at the YUAG is also an unparalleled opportunity one ought not to miss out during their Yale career. The only weakness of the course was that I wish we found a way to handle objects to not only engage the eyes."
