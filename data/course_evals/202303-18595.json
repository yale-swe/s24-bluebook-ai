This course greatly helped me develop further insights on Database Systems, their history, the various challenges that were encountered through their development, their various applications, and filled me with several ideas for research, in a field which is directly related to my research interests.",

                "The course was very comprehensive, and I believe the in-class discussion ensured that if a student had not understood something from reading the papers, the in-class discussion with the instructor and the rest of the students would help the student and resolve all questions. There were no weaknesses for this course - it is recommended to anyone who is interested in diving more deep into database systems.",
                "Strengths: discussions were helpful, especially in terms of understanding tradeoffs made in database design. Instructor was also very helpful, and the class structure that encouraged participation was conducive to learning.",
                "I would say there are no weaknesses of the course. In terms of strengths, the whole course was a strength. I really enjoyed the discussion aspect of the course. It was more of a seminar setting and I was able to learn a lot from it. The assignments were engaging and so was Professor Soule.",
                "Strengths: the class was extremely engaging because all students participated in class. Soule is a great teacher who explains complex database concepts in simple terms and is very open to communication.",
                "The strengths are that 1) students will learn to read and discuss academic papers 2) in the 6 psets, students will learn to program the basic elements of a database 3) students will develop a basic but solid understanding in relational database.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses are that 1) each paper and lecture seems to be self-contained and independent so it is hard to relate lectures to each other 2) some guidance on how to setup the Java environment for IntelliJ might be necessary for Java beginners; also come tricky Java basics will be of great help for the programming assignments",
                "This was an excellent course, with very little to recommend improving. You might consider making this the first of two classes, with the second one building on the first."

                "The course would definitely be recommended to anyone interested in database systems, as it provides great knowledge for the field.",
                "Yes, I would strongly recommend this course to any student looking to learn more about databases from reading academic papers.",
                "For many folks in the class, this was their favorite class that semester. It was run like a seminar  we had under 10 students and we would read a textbook chapter or paper every class, write a short reading response, and discuss it in class (this sounds daunting but it only takes 1-2 hours before each class). I got better at skimming and reading academic CS papers and it was cool to see the progression of the field of databases from the very beginning to recent works. Prof Soule is really great at explaining topics from papers in depth on an intuitive level. There were 6 PSETs in Java where we implemented parts of a database. They mostly took 10-15 hours each with the last one being shorter. Most of the test cases are public and the grading was lenient. There were no exams or projects. I used to think there was not much to databases, but I now realize how incredibly intricate and interesting they can be. This class is not about writing SQL queries or how to use databases, but how they are designed and implemented. I was surprised to see a lot of connection with topics in operating systems, distributed systems, compilers, and parallel programming, although I want to emphasize that no prior experience is required from any of these classes. I would however recommend 323 as a soft prerequisite. This class was awesome  the only thing I would change is the fact that it was at 9AM.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was my favorite course of the semester and one where I learned the most from. The concepts that are learned in this class are extremely interesting and applicable to industry and research.",
                "Absolutely! The class felt very well-structured and manageable, with interesting papers to read accompanied with relevant problem sets that had us implement our own database.",
                "I recommend this course for students who want a deeper understanding in relational database and who want to develop paper reading skills.",
                "It prepares you well for both industry and academia."
