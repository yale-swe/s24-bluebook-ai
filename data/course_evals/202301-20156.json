                "An understanding of the history of making climate knowledge as well as a vast array of topics in epistemology. Moreover, I understood how to analyze knowledge-making instruments in regards to making climate knowledge.",
                "We analyzed how those that can make the knowledge, especially in the frame of climate change, have unprecedented influence today.",
                "I learned how to write about topics I was not already interested in, which at first was daunting, but become easier as time progressed. Your writing truly does improve; Professor Coen really does a good job of facilitating an environment where I was conformable to make mistakes since I knew I would have the opportunity to revise them. Plus, the class is a first-year seminar, so the class discussions were often tailored to our experiences and how our backgrounds have affected how we have learned about climate change.",
                "I learned about how different cultures/time periods understand the world around us. It's not as science-y as one might expect, and you become a stronger writer."

                "This was a fantastic course that was engaging and interesting. I found the weekly topics to be fascinating as well as the related readings. One of the highlights of this class was certainly the field trips and hands-on learning that happened outside of the classroom. I really enjoyed this class and is certainly one of my favorites at Yale so far. My only wish would be that the class took place twice a week for a shorter period of time rather than once a week for a long period of time, though I understand this would be difficult to make happen with the field trips.",
                "I think that its a very abstract topic which doesnt necessarily need improvement because it appeals to some people but not to me.",
                "I really appreciated how professor Coen designs the course for people to improve their writing skills throughout the semester. The format in which she offered feedback on every essay, and then you were allowed to revise drastically improved how I write historical papers. Moreover, the field trips were very relevant to the course content being discussed. I would say one way the course can be improved would be a shorter class time? However, that's just me being knit picky since I am usually tired on Thursday evenings. However, I found very few weaknesses of the course.",
                "I liked the field trips because they were interactive, and I think classroom seminars could have involved more live demonstrations or other multimedia.",
                "Strengths - Field trips to places in New Haven that correlate to what you learn in the course. Active revisions of essays, you have the opportunity to submit each essay you turn in with revisions for the opportunity to earn a higher grade, which dramatically reduces the scariness of taking a writing credit class. The seminar meets only once a week, which allows freedom in your schedule. The readings are a light workload too. If you appreciate historical context about climate change, this class is for you.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The seminar is three hours, which compensates for only meeting once a week. However, Professor Coen would often let us out one hour early if she gaged that we went through all the necessary perspective. Plus, the time frame is really three hours to accommodate for when we go on field trips.",
                "Strengths: Readings are highly manageable. Essays are also manageable because they can be turned in again for full credit with corrections. Professor Coen is incredibly sweet and understanding, and she speaks about every topic with a lot of care and detail.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As a writing class, you learn by trial and error instead of in class teaching."

                "Absolutely. If you need a writing credit or are interested in understanding the history of climate-knowledge making, I would 100% recommend this course to you.",
                "Yes, this was a very welcoming seminar into the field of HSHM.",
                "Yes, I think the subject material is relevant to anyone and everyone. Climate change affects everyone and part of understanding the impact is recognizing how our current theories about the climate originated. Plus, the class is very non-humanities oriented writing friendly, so do not feel discouraged if you are not a humanities person. The class applies to both STEM and humanities people.",
