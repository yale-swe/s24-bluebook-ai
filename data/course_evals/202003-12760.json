This is especially true when the class is held at 7:30 in the morning. LT Melvin is a great instructor and does his best to liven up the content, but when even he is suggesting that the course is rather dry, there is an upper bound on how enjoyable a class can be. I would say the course is as strong as it can be given the circumstances and the content, and LT Melvin makes the course as strong as it can be.",

Don't take this the wrong way, and I absolutely mean it as a complement, but LT Melvin was very entertaining (while still being professional) and the class was a lot of fun when it could just as easily been really dry. \r\n\r\nI realize this was an introduction, but I would have liked to have been able to learn more; that being said, it was nice that the course was not too dense and the relaxed pacing was nice for making sure the most important material was emphasized.",
