   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I became better at writing philosophical papers and thinking more deeply about philosophical concepts while writing them.",
    "Not only the knowledge of one of the most important works of philosophy of all time, but also the skills to read, discuss, and enter into conversation with difficult texts.",
    "Got a better grip on Kants overall system and his language\r\nLearned about several of the main arguments in the Critique as well as its overall goals and themes\r\nLearned about the surrounding philosophical landscape of that time period and which Kant generated\r\nImproved skill in breaking down difficult arguments\r\nBetter appreciated interpretative difficulties and how they can effect ones understanding of a philosophers work.",
    "Learned about the framework of the Critique, the interventions that it staged within the history of philosophy, and the technical insolubles within it that anticipate and inform future thinking (neo- and anti-Kantian as well as properly Kantian: the rest of Kant's corpus). Perhaps most significant, however, was what I took away methodologically: how to approach, with rigor and ambition, the task of exegesis for non-analytic works.",
    "I feel like I really developed my capacity for thorough and orderly thought and expression of those thoughts, in addition to understanding Kant much better (which is hard to do).",
    "The course presented a good, in-depth close reading of Kants Critique of Pure Reason, a seminal work in philosophy. The course broke down some of Kants most important arguments, including arguments from the third division.",
    "A fantastic introduction to the most important philosophical work of the last 250 years. Great preparation for philosophical writing",
    "I gained a deep understanding of Kant's metaphysical theories, particularly that outlined in his text Critique of Pure Reason. I also gained broader philosophical thinking skills and honed my philosophy essay writing skills.",
    "I got an in depth look at the main topics and issues in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. This course was very focused, and while it talked a bit about some of the philosophical context, it stayed almost entirely on the primary text.",
    "I gained insight into a different way of thinking about the nature of what we perceive as the world around us. In terms of practical skills, I was able to practice understanding slightly convoluted texts, and was able to develop and express my own insights while writing the 3 papers.",
    "I learned about the main arguments of the Critique of Pure Reason and, in terms of particular skills, how to approach and interpret arguments in a philosophical manner.",
    "Understanding of key arguments from the Critique, of Kant's terminology and his theory of how cognition is organized, of his impact in the history of philosophy and his relationship to earlier thinkers. Skills were interpreting Kant's dense language and evaluating philosophical arguments."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A bit more structure? It also seemed like the course wasn't sure whether or not it was a seminar course or a lecture course.",
    "The strengths are too many to count. Perhaps the only glaring weakness is the lack of TAs, although Professor Franks did an excellent job of explaining the text and answering our questions.",
    "Strengths:\r\nProfessor Franks is great. In lecture he tries to put things as clearly as possible, and is always willing (and able) to answer questions if anything is unclear or any other questions have been raised. The same goes for office hours, in which Professor Franks is willing to discuss pretty much anything\/everything Kant (or anyone from that time period) related.\r\n Critique of Pure Reason. \r\nThe text itself is incredibly interesting and mind expanding (I really think it changed the way I thought about some things). Also, I found it by-and-large quite compelling once you get used to reading the difficult language Kant uses.\r\nThe papers I thought were fair and covered interesting and important topics in the Critique. Furthermore Prof. Franks is helpful and willing to meet to talk about the papers as you are writing them.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nFeedback on papers can be somewhat light, but it is still sufficient to understand what he thought was good\/bad.\r\nThe text can be unbelievably difficult, so it can be frustrating (though there is a secondary source on the book which is in the bookstore which can be helpful in these cases)",
    "Strengths included incredibly clear presentation and organization, compelling readings of the material, openness to questioning and objection, and keenly selected paper topics that provided room for substantial independent engagement with Kant. The only weakness that comes to mind is, I think, an unavoidable one: getting a systematic understanding of a systemic text like the Critique -- and an especially reticulated one at that -- calls for a lecture format, so the class was somewhat less interactive or jointly exploratory than might be hoped. On a related note, nuances of the secondary literature were occasionally sidelined in the interest of appraising the dimensions of the primary text. It might be helpful to add an optional discussion section to future iterations, where students can linger over particularly troubling passages in the Critique, play around with putting the pieces together, and probe the secondary literature at greater length.",
    "I thought the teaching was wonderful and the essay prompts were productive for helping us really understand Kant. My only complaint would be that class was cancelled a lot. It was great to have class off at the time, but I do want to take full advantage of my classes if possible.",
    "The class is well-structured and lectures were engaging. One improvement might be to clarify the handouts",
    "The course was well-taught. Professor Franks is an excellent lecturer who is able to break down and deliver the ideas in the text. Without the lectures, I would not have been able to understand as much as I did about Kant's metaphysical theories. \r\n\r\nThe readings are very difficult and time-consuming--but this is not a weakness of the course as much as it is just a necessary process of trying to understand Kant's philosophical theories.",
    "This is a very difficult course to teach, merely because the material is so difficult, but I think the way that the course was set up helped to make it doable. The only real weakness I felt was a lack of engagement with later criticism and defense of the system, but I understand that there was barely enough time to even get into the basics, so the focus was understandable.",
    "The course deals with an abstruse but important philosophical work in an excellent manner. Kant was able to perceive various intrinsic difficulties and flaws in philosophical discourse in his time, and proposed groundbreaking solutions to circumvent them. Prof Franks is able to elucidate these ideas clearly, and is very patient and willing to answer every possible question you can throw at him.\r\n\r\nThere's not a whole lot of ways this course can be improved, but more time in class could have been devoted to teaching and less for answering questions, some of which I felt were only tangentially related to the material being discussed, and seemed to have been asked merely for the sake of participation.",
    "It is very lecture heavy but Professor Franks is very knowledgeable and clear on the various topics and is always available for questions.",
    "This is a wonderfully organized lecture from beginning to end, and it clearly reflects a long experience reading and teaching the first Critique.",
    "I think the organization of the course was helpful in breaking down the text. I think the secondary readings and Gardner's guidebook were well chosen to frame the Critique in historical context. Franks is extremely knowledgeable about the subject and does a good job of explaining very thorny arguments  the handouts were a nice touch.\r\nThe main weakness is that the material is so hard. Even when I had plenty of time, the readings were a real slog and the return on investment in terms of understanding was often low. The secondary sources and the lectures got the main ideas across, but when it came down to writing the papers or getting into the details the text was often still quite murky. I think the thing that would make this course really work would be to add a section. Franks's lectures are essential and I wouldn't want to cut time out of that for discussion. But if I had some time to dig into each reading  if I were forced to answer questions about it every week, it would have helped keep me on track and get the most out of the class.\r\nAlso: under no circumstances should this class be scheduled for Friday at 9 am."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "Absolutely so long as theyre interested in philosophy to the point where they want to take an entire class just on the Critique of Pure Reason.",
    "Yes - this course pushed me to evaluate philosophical texts in a way that challenged me",
    "Yes. Professor Franks was a compelling lecturer and a pleasure to interact with. The Critique is incredibly interesting and mind expanding (and important), so its was a treat to get guided exposure to it and to be able to try to grapple with a few of the big arguments. Highly recommended",
    "Absolutely! Franks' treatment of the Critique is clarifying and challenging in equal measure, and you'll emerge with a new appreciation for both its insights and its problems -- perhaps inspired to take on an entirely new tradition.",
    "I would definitely recommend, for the reasons mentioned above.",
    "Absolutely, if you have any interest in Kantian philosophy, or Western philosophy at all.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who have a very deep interest in philosophy and who have had previous experiences with studying philosophy. I found Kant's ideas to be very interesting to work with and while Professor Franks is a wonderful professor who makes the text easier to engage with, I would say this class is meant for people who is comfortable with philosophical thinking coming in and is ready for a challenge.",
    "This course is tough, but it is worth taking. The only way to learn this text is in a class, and this class was well structured and taught.",
    "If you're interested in the nature of the world around you, and feel like a lot of metaphysics you've read so far has been clutching at straws, then do take this course. Kant offers a different way of thinking about these things, though in a very pedantic manner. I'm still not sure if I'm entirely convinced by what he has to say, but he is worth reading merely for the original insights to these age-old questions. The workload is reasonable - 3 papers, and how much time you spend on the readings is entirely up to how engaged you want to be with the material.",
    "Yes, but only if they are willing to put in the time to really try and work with Kant's arguments. You can't decide to skip a weekly reading because everything ties in together in Kant's system, and thus all of it is essential in its own way.",
    "This course does an admirable job of showing us that we can do philosophy by studying its history. Professor Franks has an extensive and well-developed reading of Kant of his own, but he does not neglect other interpretations. His excellent knowledge of the general history of philosophy and science in the modern period contribute greatly as well. And he's a skilled, personable lecturer! \r\nIn this course, you'll read selections from the first Critique. With the lectures and handouts, these come together to form a good general picture of Kant's project. 3 papers are required, which build on each other.",
    "Probably not. Even though it is well taught, there are very few people for whom studying Kant at this level is worth the opportunity cost of another good Yale class. As a non-philosophy major I took this class just for fun, and I would have been better served with less technical material."
