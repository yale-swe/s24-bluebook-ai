The class community built was very strong, so it actually felt like an environment where students wanted to talk. The discussions and projects were also great and creative there weren't any in-class assessments.",

One weakness of the course is the limited time spent on grammar instruction in class. The course could be improved by spending more time on grammar instruction and practice in class.",

I loved the class structure around major themes about culture, art, and politics instead of rote memorization."
