                "I think the class is organized very well and I think it is definitely organized the facilitate student learning. The slides, homework assignments, and lab sections all lined up really well and I felt like they all helped me understand the material. I also think the assessments are very fair and the instructor provides lots of preparation for them so I never felt particularly stressed about the class. The final project was also really helpful in learning how to test hypothesis, think about data, and write up results. I think the only thing I would change is maybe the structure of the lab sections. I think they were definitely very helpful in learning R and reviewing the principles we learned in lecture but I think they may have been more effective if we were allowed to work on the lab assignments on our own and then asked our TFs for assistance if\/when we needed it.",
                "In general I think this course was organized quite well. The workload was very manageable and lectures were concise and thorough.",
                "I liked weekly homeworks and how there was no final during final period. I thought the exams were fair but were a bit of a time crunch. Also the professor was so knowledgeable and a really great teacher. So kind",
                "This course is extremely basic. If you took AP stats in high school and any other R coding class, you will be bored out of your mind. Having taken both, lectures seemed basic, sections were incredibly repetitive, and homeworks were way too easy. If you haven't done either, I'm sure you will like this class though.",
                "The strengths of this course are that the lab sections and lectures really helped with completing the homework and that the teaching staff is very enthusiastic to help students out. A suggestion for how the course could be improved is that the final project be incorporated into the course along the way instead of having it being due during finals weeks since a lot of things overlap.",
                "Professor Yildirim is a fantastic lecturer who's classes are so well organized. Each week is planned out and followed to the dot. He is able to convey statistical knowledge in a precise manner, I really enjoyed all the lectures. No real weakness as such for this course.",
                "Strengths: really amazing course pace in the first half of semester. Does speed up but tests are incredibly fair, and lots of material to study from.",
                "The course was great! Professor Yildirim is amazing, the TFs are very helpful and always available to provide support, and content is well designed. However, since this is a psychology class, I wish the content reflected that a bit more rather than just being a general introduction to statistics.",
                "I wish there were office hours mostly at the end of the week coordinated with the days psets were due. The only office hours we could go to would mostly be before all that weeks class material was out before labs and so we couldn't even really start our psets. Then after we had class and lab, we had no office hours to get help on psets.",
                "This course was terrific, and I was afraid to take it as a \"humanities person.\" Professor Yildirim is a supportive, kind, and engaged instructor who is always incredibly fair. The one weakness I would say is that it would be great if there were an R template for the final project data analysis like the templates we filled in to do our problem sets--it felt like we were being coached along and then suddenly thrown into the deep end at the last minute.",
                "Incredibly well-organized to facilitate student learning. Amazing lecture slides and effective teaching",
                "Strengths: Many resources and opportunities to do well and get help if needed. You learn how to R in a no pressure pressure environment. You can chose how much or little you actually learn about R. Weaknesses: Pace was sometimes a bit slow, making lectures boring.",
                "I really liked how the course was structured with a really easy to follow and understand lecture and slides posted beforehand and guided lab sections which applied the things we learned about statistic tests in lecture in the form of R.\r\nI did not like how the section project was completely different to the weekly assignments we had throughout the semester. I would have preferred having an extra lab section going through the expectations and details of the project because a lot of the guidelines seemed very out of context. The instructions for the abstract, methods, introduction for a full written scientific journal report seemed more suited for a project we collected data for rather than a project which we have only been given a choice of one dataset out of three. I wish the different components in the section project were introduced and dispersed throughout the class.",
                "Strengths: R is very manageable, notes are organized\r\nWeaknesses:",
                "It's a good course! Lot of office hours, understandable material, and really kind professor.",
                "Strengths: the material was very clear, lab sections were very helpful\r\nWeaknesses: could use more guidance on the homework assignments",
                "The course lab sections were a good use of time for learning R. The connection between lecture and labs were helpful for practicing the concepts.",
                "Strengths: Access to lecture material is available at all times. The slides and lecture recordings are very helpful when doing homework and studying.\r\nWeakness: Although we did cover statistical concepts in the homework, I felt like the homework was mostly to learn how to code in R. I wish we would have had more practice with statistical concepts since that's what most of the tests on the question are about (very few R questions).",
                "Strengths: professor and TAs responsive on poll ev and to emails, a gut (in my opinion) -- one pset a week that takes like an hour to do and you get to drop one, 2 exams (2nd one is not cumulative, and you get to bring in a cheat sheet front and back to use during the exams), final project due during finals that's super easy to do as long as you don't save it all for the last minute. \r\n\r\nprof Yildirim is a good lecturer and kept things engaging. also didn't usually take up the whole class time. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the final exam. we had 65 minutes instead of the 75 minute class time. and it was too long. usually people finish exams early but I didnt see a single person walk out of the room early. when they said pencils down pretty much everyone was in their seats and I know of lots of people (including myself) who simply did not finish. the problem wasn't the difficulty of the exam because I think it was reasonable. it was simply too long and should have been curved. \r\n\r\nthere's no curve. I think it's easy to make an A in this class even without the curve and I don't know the grade distributions, but this could be seen as a weakness. \r\n\r\nwhile I do have a better grasp of R, I don't think I am confident with R in general. because this is a gut you're not expected to memorize code. you do get what you put into it -- I guess I could have memorized code on my own and this is def an intro stats class. but if one of your goals in taking the class is to be super comfortable with r, don't expect that to be the case unless you're willing to put in extra time outside of class to do that on your own. for me it was a strength that we didn't have to memorize code because I really needed this class to be a gut but for others this could be a weakness.",
                "The course is well paced and obviously prioritizes student learning and well being. It can be hard to know when to do what or where to look for certain resources since the size of the class means it is pretty spread out over a TA team, the professor, Canvas, Gradescope, etc. and can feel like there are lots of things to keep in mind.",
                "Sometimes it's easy to forget where the \"psychology\" component of the course ties in with the content we are learning (other than the fact that psychology is heavily concentrated on research). I think it's a bit misguided to have this course be listed under the psychology department and even be listed as a required course for students majoring in psychologynot everyone is interested in engaging in research. However, I guess I understand why the course is set up the way it is.",
                "Strength: organized, clear\r\n\r\nWeakness: NA",
                "Strengths: concepts taught clearly and thoroughly, helpful examples. Weaknesses: wish there was more opportunity for collaboration with other students.",
                "Strengths were the combination of the lecture and section to make sure students are able to learn and ask questions in multiple ways.",
                "I really struggled with this class because math is not my strong suit and I had foundational knowledge of statistics so I felt very lost and overwhelmed at the beginning of the semester. I also had no idea we would be using R which just added difficulty for me. Overall I am glad I took this course because it challenged me a lot and now I have skills I never would have but I do think that they could advertise this course by saying it will be harder without basic statistical knowledge and a background in R.",
                "Strengths: enthusiastic professor \r\nWeaknesses: P-sets not well designed to teach r independently, lecture format not useful for internalizing statistics processes and content.",
                "Strengths: organization and communication\r\nWeaknesses: ?? Can't really think of anything. I had trouble connecting the individual bits of knowledge to a broader working framework of how they were all connected but I can't think of anything the class could've done differently to change that. really?",
                "The strengths were that the homeworks were VERY easy and could be done by looking at the lab keys. The TAs were very nice as well.",
                "Professor Yildirim is very engaging and has a palpable love for statistics. I loved both the lecture style classes and sections because it was always easy to ask questions.",
                "I wish this class went more into the R. I felt like the final project was the first time that I was actually challenged in R.",
                "Office hours and exam format. The class was pretty fine to do. My largest critique is the exam being on paper, and not very mathematical, while the bulk of everything else turned in is through R. I became fluent in R quickly, and suffered a shock taking a paper exam, especially since practice exam answers are not released so there was not a way to know what mistakes were made before making them again on the actual exam. Further, as a disabled student, even with accommodations, many of the lost on my exams were because of minor details from redundant answer choices that have the correct components mixed around. I find this unfair and not a test of knowledge, and a senseless disadvantage for other students that might suffer the same learning disorder as me.",
                "I think that the professor was very passionate and knowledgeable about the material was teaching. I also think he meant well, but it ends there. This class was truly a STRUGGLE for me. Every p-set, I had to fight for my life. I think that he over complicated a lot of the material, didn't explain it well enough, and there were multiple instances where we had to bear with the instructor\/ TA's but that same understanding was not given to us (i.e. material missing from the exams that they put on a projector IN THE MIDDLE of the exam). Using R, the tiniest error, and I do mean THE TINEST thing wrong (i.e a period in the wrong spot, a dataset name that is slightly different) and the p-set will not knit, and there was hardly any empathy or understanding given. I had to contact my dean MULTIPLE times over extensions that could've been coordinated with just my professor, not because my work was incomplete, but because of a technical difficulty that I (with absolutely no background in CompSci; coding) had NO CLUE how to fix. The psets were due Sunday and My TAs office hours were not until Tuesday @ 4:30 and by then, that is two days after the deadline. And guess what? The PENALIZED HEAVILY! The last problem set that was submitted was submitted late once again due to a technical issue that I contacted my TA about, and I had NO OTHER CHOICE but to wait until TUESDAY for her to physically see what the issue was as we could not figure it out via email correspondense. And my grade went from a 9.4 to a 5.4 and there was not an ounce of understanding from either party (the professor or TA). I STRONGLY do not recommend this class, and I do mean STRONGLY!!!!",
                "Overall, the course provides a great overview of statistics, and is relatively approachable for students from all backgrounds. It does its best via Ed discussions, lab section, and Canvas material to provide support. However, it suffers from many of the traditional problems of STEM lecture courses: including poorly communicated concepts\/unengaging lectures and an initial confusion\/lag while getting used to the various course expectations, technologies, and concepts. Often, I felt that key inferential steps were glossed over too quickly, while basic concepts took incredible amounts of time to explain. The lectures did eventually explain and define how all the concepts connected and built on each other, but did so towards the end of the course. It would have been better to simply provide an overview earlier. The course workload is also rough including lectures\/class participation, PSETs, and lab sections, as well as the exams and final section project work. However, the exam difficulty was fair.",
                "The strengths of this course are its overall structure and pace, which I found to be steady and, as a whole, manageable. A weakness of this course that could be refined in future iterations is that it seemed that most of the more complicated statistical tests we learned all came towards the very end of the course, after spring break. I think the course could be better if these tests were more distributed."

                "If you want to learn statistics with a psychology\/social sciences focus, absolutely take this! Professor Yildirim is so patient and will guide you through each step of the way. I feel really accomplished having taken this and gained such a concrete quantitative skill set that I know I'll use in the future.",
                "Yes! This course serves as a great introduction to stats.",
                "Absolutely. As someone with little experience in statistics, I feel much more confident when approaching data in research.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course as you learn very applicable information and it's not a very difficult class.",
                "Yes, I would 100% recommend this class. If you like an evenly paced class with emphasis on student learning rather than overly difficult material, this statistics class is perfect. The focus on R was also nicely done even for people without any programming experience.",
                "Definitely! The workload of the course is very manageable, and provides lots of knowledge a student needs if they want to go into the social sciences.",
                "Definitely! If you are premed and need to get your statistics requirement, and aren't really interested in furthering education in statistics, take this course. It is simple and chill.",
                "Yes, I would. It is very well organized as you can learn the material from the lectures very clearly, and then apply this knowledge in the lab sections and homework assignments.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are looking to fulfill a QR requirement since it is easier than a regular stats course. I would also recommend this course because learning how to use R was kind of fun.",
                "yes I would recommend this course to another student especially as a major requirement or pre-med requirement (for me it served as both!). very low workload, lots of support, and you learn statistics. \r\n\r\nI would not recommend this course to someone who wants a super in depth understanding of statistics and R.",
                "Yes! We all read statistical papers, either for other classes in detail or in the news and it helps to understand concepts taught in such an accessible way.",
                "Yes because there is tons of support, especially with learning how to use R. I had never coded before and took a lot away from the weekly labs.",
                "I would. I thought it was useful and taught well",
                "Not really, but this might not even matter considering that it is required for students majoring in psychology, so I'm not sure if my opinion matters.",
                "Yes, because the course is clear and material is easy to understand",
                "Yes - great intro level course to fulfill a QR requirement.",
                "Yes, this course is great if you havent taken much statistics previously and want to learn R. The psychology aspect of the class makes learning concepts much more interesting and makes me want to engage with homework in a deeper way.",
                "If you are a student like me and want a challenge--yes. Also if you have a stats background or are just very quick to pick up math I would also recommend it.",
                "Not unless necessary for the major.",
                "Yes. I feel like this is as good as a stats class could get. I think I did very badly in this course TBH but I can't really chalk that up to the course itself--stats just really isnt my jam. It's a good practical foundation for statistical learning.",
                "As an engineering student, this class was the easiest class I have ever taken at Yale. The homework sometimes took 15-30 minutes a week. Id recommend it to anyone needing the easiest QR credit, or someone who will be taking higher level stats courses and would like a very slow introduction to basic statistics. However, I really did think they covered the basics well, as it was slow enough for everyone to have their questions answered and they went through plenty of examples. There was so much repetition, that it would be hard to get confused in this course. I now feel like I have a good foundation of basic statistics.",
                "Yes, its a great intro to stats and I felt like I learned a lot.",
                "yes, it has good real world applications.",
                "Maybe if all they cared about was learning about stats. If they have any interest in learning R, then no.",
                "I would advise others to take it under a professor other than Yildirim based on hearing of my peers' experiences with different professors for PSYC 200.",
                "NO! NO! NO! NO! If you did not come from a private school with paid tutors that equipped you for such a class, DO NOT TAKE IT!!!!! It DOES NOT facilitate student learning in a lot of the material, I had to go back and contextualize it MYSELF! No way we're paying 40k a semester for me to have to contextualize it myself and watch YouTube videos, NO WAY!!!!!!!!!! If you come from any kind of underfunded institution\/ public school, this class will dang near BREAK YOU! I recommend waiting until you've familiarized yourself with the material in order to foster some kind of foundational knowledge before you go in, because one thing about Yale professors, it is incredibly difficult for them to teach the material to someone who is trying to join the field.",
                "I'd recommend the course so long as you have a strong interest or background in STEM and statistics! Beyond that, it's a shaky, at best unoffensive QR or Stats requirement for humanities\/non-majors that requires work and conceptual struggle in exchange for minimal algebra and reasonable exams.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, especially students in psychology and students looking for an informative and useful QR credit."
