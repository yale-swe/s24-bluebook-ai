Perhaps this is a bit difficult to execute, but I would have liked a bit more explicit instruction on how to write a paper in religious studies. What are the norms and conventions, what makes a paper a \"good\" paper? I suppose we'll find out at the end of the week when grades come in?",

As a non-religious studies major, I found each week's readings and discussions to be enthralling and engaging. Professor Doerfler also brought several faculty from the religious studies department & the divinity school to our weekly sessions, and it was interesting to learn about the work being done in these areas firsthand!"
