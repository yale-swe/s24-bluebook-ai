It was nice working on projects for a more extended period of time so that I could really immerse myself in the subject, an experience I haven't had in other courses.",

In every other English class I've taken at Yale, we just kind of talk about the readings...maybe workshop an essayWATE is not this class. This semester, Prof Burdick incorporated more in-class writing exercises, which I loved. Hearing your and your classmates' work out loud will really help you come into your own voice. Do not pass up the opportunity to take this course!",

                "I expected this course to have more environmental themes in the more traditional sense, ex. trees, climate change, etc. I liked how open-ended the class's use of \"environment\" was as well, but it's just something to keep in mind when choosing to take the class. Alan's teaching is a huge strength. His office hours were awesome, and he is great at creating a very open dialogue between himself and the students. His editing was also fantastic -- he was very honest and his suggestions always felt justified. I also loved how much of the class revolved around discussion with the other students.",
                "As I said, the strength of this course is its emphasis on making you a better writer. The mini-assignments and in-class exercises will stick with me forever. Prof Burdick is also a huge strengthhe line-edits your drafts and is always willing to make time in his (busy!) week to chat about your work. I met with him literally every week! I haven't had many professors willing to welcome their students into their offices all the time. I don't think really anything could improve this class. Not only did it teach me a ton about my own writing, but it also introduced me to some great people at Yale. Coming into this class on a Tuesday morning was such a joyI already miss it!",
                "The discussions and assigned readings were great. The assignments were also great, especially the \"off the cuff\" ones like writing an anonymous letter to a classmate, etc.",
                "The small class size and interesting readings facilitated interesting conversations. The assignments were well structured and built off of each other, the writing getting more in depth throughout the semester. I also really enjoyed the smaller, ungraded, weekly assignments and thought they added a lot to my experience.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some weeks the assigned readings were a little too much. Often I didn't finish them or ones I did read we didn't have time to discuss in class. Still I enjoyed the readings I did, just would maybe state explicitly which ones we will discuss in class so students can prioritize reading those.",

                "100%!!! Prof Burdick is great and does an excellent job guiding you toward the right reporting project. Our semester didn't have as strong of an emphasis on lengthy readings, which ultimately gave us the space to do those smaller fun assignments. This was honestly so greatI feel like you really learn how to write by doing, and this class will get you writing in all sorts of ways (from letters to classmates to short profiles of each other to your longer reported piece).",
