                "Excellent course, no weakness",
                "The main strength of this course was its use of varied sources and activities to explore broad subjects through concrete examples. Print, film, and other resources were used to provide important context, and in-class discussions helped to make this material feel relevant and engaging. Occasionally, I felt that there was an excess of reading materials assigned, with some readings not getting a chance to be discussed. I think an improvement could be ensuring that all readings are incorporated into class discussions or activities, or that some readings are made optional if they will not be discussed. Additionally, I think that the course could potentially benefit from more explicit in-class activities involving vocabulary.",
                "Strengths: Prof Pinzka was very encouraging and gave me a lot of confidence in my ability to speak French. The topics we studied were interesting and I learned a lot about France's social problems. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes individual presentations took up too much of class time and I didn't feel very engaged.",
                "After this class, I really came out with a more nuanced understanding of French culture and its history. I liked that we talked about France's (and Belgium's) horrible history of colonization and how France needs to reckon with this. My spoken French also improved a lot, and I really enjoyed our final project where we got to interview a French-speaking person. Learning about current events and having guest speakers was really fun! I do think, however, that the reading load for this class is a bit extreme, especially considering that the plan for the week was constantly changing. The professor would change the readings for Wednesday on Tuesday afternoon, which made keeping up with the readings very stressful, and I often couldn't finish all of it. I also felt like many of the readings were redundant and some of them didn't relate to what we were discussing in class. It would have been nice to have a clear idea of what we'd be discussing in class so that we would be able to better prepare. The sheer amount of information contained in the readings made it almost impossible to know what was important. I liked that we got a vocab list, but I would've liked more discussion as a class on unfamiliar words, or even a short presentation. Sometimes I felt like it would have been nice to have a short presentation at the start of class to introduce the topic of the day."

I think one improvement could be incorporating these tools even more often into class, without interrupting discussions. One challenge may be ensuring that the instructor can still see students while using these tools, so care should be taken to make sure that participation is not negatively impacted.",
                "All of the readings (except for the textbook readings) were online, and this was very helpful. I also liked that the professor often put us into breakout rooms and that we had the option to record our presentations if we chose to. Technical difficulties were very hard in the beginning but I liked how the professor handled them. I think it would've been nice if the professor had used more of the Zoom features (like the whiteboard; we would talk as a class but then an unknown French word would come up and I had no idea how to spell it). I also feel like maybe the reading load could have been reduced some."

                "Must take with Professor Lauren Pinzka!! Such a great review\/intro of French culture, so many interesting topics from languages to religion and environment, I get to pick up my spoken French once again after a few years, very interactive, excellent French course, chill",
                "Definitely!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in improving their french skills and gaining knowledge about French culture and society. The discussion-focused format of the class is great for improving oral skills, and regular short essay assignments also help with writing. Students read and listen to French in a variety of formats, from a textbook to films to news articles, and there is a great emphasis put on learning important new vocabulary. For those who have taken AP French there may be some overlap with certain topics, but here they are explored in more detail and from a wider range of subjects. Students should be mindful that the workload can be substantialthough not out of line with other Yale French courses and that you get out of the course what you put into it.",
                "Yes, it isn't too much work and it really helps you become more confortable with your French skills, especially when it comes to social\/political topics.",
                "Only if you're really interested in learning about French culture or if you have to take it. As an L5 course, it's not the most interesting if you don't already have a strong interest in France, but the readings for this class are not literary, so if you prefer reading news articles\/current events, definitely take it!"
