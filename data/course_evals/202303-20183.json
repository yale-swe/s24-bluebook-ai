I learned about the history of the romantic comedy genre and its fundamental elements and tropes; I also learned how to critically analyze films, create a beat-sheet, and write a film studies essay. Additionally, I had the opportunity to develop my own romantic comedy story, which was a phenomenal experience.",

                "I learned about how the romantic comedy film has evolved from the 1920s through to today, how it responds to and reflects its present moment in ways that make it much more profound than it is typically given credit for. Also, by developing the original concept for a romcom we learned the fifteen-point plot structure that scaffolds most romcoms (and feature films generally).",
                "Through this course, I learned all about the history and development of the beloved genre that is romantic comedy in the united states. We looked at how cultural context often shaped and still shapes the path the genre takes, and we discussed what this can say about the genre moving into the future. I also learned more technical aspects of a movie such as how to write a logline, how to understand and compose a beat sheet, and even how to write a movie scene.",

                "The best concept and execution! I was so lucky to take this class in my final semester. Professor Price was so wonderful and chose such great movies and readings for discussion. I can't say enough good things!",
                "An excellent critical evaluation of rom coms.  The goal of writing our own was amazing and I was impressed by the stories my classmates were writing by the end of the semester.  \r\n\r\nNo major negative notes.  It leans into its strengths as a fun course while giving a strong academic base.",
                "ONLY STRENGTHS NO WEAKNESSES! such an interesting, experienced, informed professor and amazing seminar, movies, and readings. I looked forward to class every week, and I am really going to miss it! learn so much about film as a whole and the romantic comedy in particular.",
                "strengths - very approachable for someone without a film background\r\n\r\nweakness - some of the themes explored by the film felt a bit repetitive at times, and this came at the expense of watching other films that offered different perspectives; i also think the class could have had more diversity in perspectives, especially when we watched romcoms with diverse leads.",
                "I always looked forward to attending CSBR 390- the films were really enjoyable, the discussions were engaging, and I left seminar feeling like I had gained valuable insight into the romantic comedy genre and the film of the week. I loved that the course covered a breadth of romcoms, and also included a creativity element (developing our own romcom). It was great to receive feedback from Prof. Price and my classmates through Canvas. The course was also very well-organized and the final essay was a great learning experience.",
                "STRENGTHS: Every week is structured around an era of rom-coms and a film from that era/niche, which allowed us to use each as a thorough case study. The assignments were very well-paced throughout and varied in style.\r\nI can't think of any weaknesses!",
                "Professor Price is very welcoming and he covered a great deal on the subject of romcoms. I very much appreciated his knowledge on all things romcom, especially with his insights on the screenplay and beat sheets. I felt like I learned quite a lot from him and I enjoyed the classroom discussions. Professor Price was very encouraging of class participation.",
                "This was seriously the best class at Yale. This class had many strengthsweekly screenings (which I highly recommend attending), insightful class discussions, wonderful peers, a strong throughline and an incredibly devoted professor. No weaknesses!!"

This was my first film class at Yale, and I didn't feel over my head at all. My first stab at screenwriting was a success thanks to a great professor and encouraging classmates!",

The combination of creative writing, academic writing, and reading assignments allowed me to develop a wide range of skills. I left this class even more excited about the romcom, with a whole list of films to watch over break!",

                "I definitely would recommend this course to another student! Other than using this course as an excuse to watch and talk about romantic comedies, I absolutely loved learning about the background that has created one of my favorite movie types. The discussions were always very engaging and allowed me to interact in a fun but intellectual conversation about romcoms with a great group of peers! Definitely take this course!",
