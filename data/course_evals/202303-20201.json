                "I developed so many skills:\r\n\r\nHow to listen effectively (sounds simple, but this was HUGE and radically changed my relationships), \r\nthe importance of body language, how to create psychological safety on teams (i.e.: where people feel comfortable to disagree), \r\nhow to ask good questions, \r\nhow to create positive affect in your relationships, \r\nthe importance of intellectual humility (not selling more than you actually know), grew as a public speaker, \r\nlearned how to have tough, high-stakes conversations with people (friends, coworkers, you name it), \r\nhow to write concisely and in plain language, how to create positive affect in romantic relationships, \r\nhow to take on interpersonal risk, \r\nhow to give and receive feedback better, \r\nlearned what my character strengths were (huge), \r\nand more.\r\n\r\nDon't be fooled by my brevity. I learned so much more. Legitimately the best class I've ever taken at Yale.",

It teaches you some fundamental techniques for engaging better with the people in your life. The skills you learn in the class will be helpful in all domains of your life--writing, academics, communication, leadership roles etc.",
                "I learned practical and applicable leadership skills such as effective and empathetic listening, engaging in crucial conversations, taking and giving feedback, setting a growth mindset, etc. Through class assignments, I applied these skills in interviewing people, starting crucial conversations with people I care about etc.",
                "I learned how to be a better person. That is not an overstatement; that is a fact. Among many other skills, this course provided an opportunity to hone the core leadership behaviors of listening, expressing gratitude, and asking questions. I also learned so much from Peter's example.",

All Yalies should be required to take LAByou learn how to listen, how to navigate tough conversations, how to give\/receive feedback, and more. These are all vital skills that we rarely get the chance to practice, and this class gives you a great place and reason to.",

This course frames a leaders as someone who has the skills in empathy, critical communication, listening, and public speaking needed to understand a team, create an environment of psychological safety, and lead. This course taught me to become a better writer, communicator, and person."

                "So, so many strengths. Peter is the most caring and supportive professor I've ever had at Yale. The course material could not be more applicable. The class culture\/environment is unmatched. No weaknesses.",
                "The strengths are the format and the reading assignments. You sit in a circle for 2 hours and have intellectually stimulating and engaging conversations with others who also want to improve themselves. The readings were interesting and insightful. I plan to return to them frequently as I progress in my professional career. \r\n\r\nThere are no weaknesses.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Peter (professor) is a phenomenal teacher and leader. He's thoughtful, kind, detail-oriented and I've never seen a professor more prepared than he is every week; I'm not exaggerating (if you take the class you'll see what I mean). Peter is the most organized professor I've ever had, and he's only a guest lecturer lol. Man raises the bar so, so high. \r\n- The material is so, so good. I have a running notes doc of everything we covered in this class in list format that I'll be returning to and adding to for years to come, no doubt about it.\r\n- The community of students within the class is so wonderful. It gives secret society vibes, without any of the elitist undertones. Everyone is so diverse and thoughtful and bought in, and it makes coming to class everyday to dang exciting. Not your typical Yale seminar.\r\n- What you learn: the things you learn aren't solely applicable to being a better leader. It's really skills to help you grow to become better teammates, friends, siblings, and romantic partners. \r\n- Being in blackbox theater is DOPE\r\n- Love how experimental this class was. You didn't just sit in a blackbox theater and talk about the principles we learned in theory. You had to (cuz it was homework) go out and implement it in a real relationship that you have. And I love that. Most classes you take, you learn material and forget it right after the semester is over. Not this class.\r\n- The handouts he makes are fire. \r\n- No phones allowed vibe is Dope!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- We did a lot of public speaking, but wish we got more feedback in real time and worked it more intentionally (nitpicky)\r\n- Wish we learned more low-level conversational\/body-language skills (like attending behavior\/listeningI loved this).\r\n- Wish Peter shared more anecdotes to enrich the things we were learning  so we could see how the things we're learning about in abstract can be done well\/poorly IRL.",
                "This is one of the best courses this college offers--it makes you learn things that apply to fundamental aspects of your life. The assignments are unique and make you think a lot about your life--past, present, and future. The class activities are well-structured, and you learn a lot about the people taking the class with you. The people taking the class are very driven and engaging--they feel passionate about the topic and bring unique insights to the class. I wish I could get to know them even more outside the class! Peter is a fantastic presence to have in class. He leads by example and makes every session memorable. He goes the extra mile to meet you one-on-one multiple times throughout the semester and help you with the class\/life in general. He cares very deeply about the class, which is visible in the amount of effort he puts into it. He makes sure the class is an enjoyable experience, both in the classroom and outside of it. Can't say enough about the class! No big weaknesses come to mind- I learned a lot from the class.",
                "Strengths: Peter is such a great instructor. He is the best professor I've ever had. He cares so much about everyone, offering time to meet with us one-on-one outside of class time to get to know our stories. share his story with us and help us with the final papers. During class time, he is very engaging, paying attention to what everyone says and great at facilitating the class. He really helped to build a trusting community in the class, not just 20 strangers sitting in one classroom. I never felt judged or uncomfortable to say what I want because of his effort in building such a great community. He also takes feedback very well. In mid-semester, he took out half of the class specifically for giving feedback on how the course is going and how he could change things. After we gave feedback, he implemented those feedback. \r\nThe class is very organized. Everything is clear in the syllabus. He communicates assignments and expectations well in advance so there are no surprises. The workload isn't too much, just one page of writing every week. Peter gives specific and detailed feedback on every assignment and has helped me to become better at clear writing. \r\nNo weaknesses. This is the best class I've ever taken at Yale, period. If you get into this class, take it.",
                "Strengths: This course is about as perfect as any earthly course can be. It is the most organized and thoughtfully designed course I have ever taken at Yale, and I've taken some phenomenal courses here. Peter is a god. He is a necessary and sufficient ingredient for this course's excellence. He truly practices what he preaches. He gives detailed, actionable, and copious feedback. He truly cares. I cannot praise him highly enough.\r\nWeaknesses: None.",

I was initially hesitant about taking the class because the title \"Leadership as Behavior\" seemed very vague and seemed like a self-help course that only teaches the concepts with no real takeaway. I was blown away by this course. Not only I get practical and applicable leadership skills, I think I became a better person. I got better at navigating my personal and professional relationships. You'll learn so much not only from Peter but also from your classmates as well.",

This course changed how I understand other people, how to handle stressful conversations, how to give good feedback, how to listen better, how to be a better partner, how to writer clearer, and--overall--how to be a better person. Peter is prepared, thoughtful, and intentional. He makes an immense effort to understand his students and support their individual needs.
