                "Given the extenuating circumstances presented by 2020, this course balanced its strengths and weaknesses well. The instruction format was adapted for remote lesson work, and lessons proceeded smoothly aside from a few technical issues here and there. Overall, the course was reliable, suitably challenging, rewarding, and flexible in regards to scheduling. One improvement that could be made: I find that practicing in a meaningful way between lessons is most streamlined when a detailed yet manageable weekly assignment is given (with specific goals). While my instructor and I did have a live document that listed broad objectives for me to consider, I would have liked a smaller, more specific list to clarify expectations and to hone my focus.",
                "Due the the zoom format it was difficult to fully express my full potential to my teacher, but on the other hand the zoom formal allowed lessons to be very convenient.",
                "Strengths: flexible schedule wise, I could reschedule if I absolutely needed to, and my professor asked to reschedule twice but with plenty of advanced notice. Also extremely grateful that the (for-credit) lessons were covered by tuition, which is not something every university has for non-music majors. Weaknesses: some initial audio setup trouble that we resolved within the first few weeks. Studio lesson sessions sometimes went long, but otherwise I had no problems!",
                "It was great!",
                "Strengths: This course is tailored to the needs of each and every student. As such, this course can be anything the student makes it out to be.\r\n\r\nWeakness: N\/A due to how individual this course is.",
                "These are individual lessons, which I imagine differ greatly depending on the teacher. Csar was fantastic and gave me exactly what I needed at this point in my musical trajectory.",
                "Strengths - One on one teaching\r\nWeaknesses - As this was a music course, an online class had many limitations.",
                "Strength: it was very nice to have weekly hour-long lessons, and I enjoyed my lessons with my instructor and I feel like I grew as a musician from them\r\nWeakness: nothing I can really think of",
                "I learned a lot this semester about how to phrase better and about the baroque style, as well as certain tips in improving my technique. Unfortunately, there were quite a bit of technological issues with sound quality and lag even with high fidelity mode and an expensive external microphone that got in the way of deeper learning. I also wanted to work more on my physical technique, but the camera angle made it so I could not accurately show my position.",
                "I would have appreciated a tiny bit more structure\/guidance as an incoming freshman who had no idea what to expect, but overall it was a great course. I feel super lucky to be able to take private lessons with a professor.",
                "The main weakness of the course was inherent with the audio quality of Zoom and the inability to see my professor in person.",
                "Strengths: Very clear feedback, able to mold the course to my needs \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "The course needs to be clearer from the outset what is and isn't up for debate in planning the syllabus. Though it is an individualized study, it is one the teacher makes knowing very little about you. \r\n\r\nA major weakness, no fault of Carrie's, is her specialty in classical saxophone. She applies the hard-and-fast methods of classical music to jazz where there is definitely plenty of room for debate. She can't replicate the sound of jazz saxophonists very well. But this course is in general saxophone lessons. It just can be tough to be taught your life one way and then have to put that aside. \r\n\r\nThat being said, Carrie is a great teacher. She tolerated my stubbornness at the beginning. After I came around to her methods, I learned a great deal. She is very good at listening to you and telling you what to change. She is knowledgeable about the respiratory and skeletal and muscular systems and how they apply to playing saxophone. She challenged me to change my way of transcribing to learn a less theoretical, more phrasal way useful for its own purposes."

Simultaneous use of medium- to high-quality USB microphones, earbuds, CleanFeed, and Zoom made for relatively seamless audio and video connectionsa large improvement from the spring of 2020. Given that the largest inconvenience was my personal internet connection, I think the course adapted well.",
                "Music lessons are not effective in a virtual environment. There are so many nuances that cannot be heard over Zoom or Skype, even with a good microphone. Lessons were fine and I learned some, but I can't help but wonder if I would have progressed much more if my lessons were in person. It's 100% possible to do them in a covid-safe way, so I'm not sure as to why Yale College has really cracked down on music more than it has any other department. This semester has not been fair for music students or their professors.",

That being said, I don't think we could do much better given the circumstances, and I appreciate the work that went into making lessons happen at all this semester.",
                "It took a bit to figure out the correct Zoom settings for audio, whether I should use the computer mic and speakers or bluetooth earbuds. It helped that the music dept. eventually sent an email detailing the ideal settings on Zoom and recommendations for the physical audio set up. I just had to remember to set up these a few minutes in advance before lessons. We also were loaned professional microphones to improve recording quality.",

                "The Zoom lessons may not have been as effective as in-person lessons, but it honestly still worked pretty seamlessly. Also, adjusting the Zoom audio settings seemed to make the lesson experience more illuminating for everyone.",
                "Because of internet and Zoom issues, a lot of times I could not hear my instructor and my instructor could not hear me. Our playing would cut out at times, or we couldnt hear each other talk. There was feedback if headphones were not used, but I kept getting tangled in them. I was using an expensive external microphone and was connected to Ethernet, so I was doing everything in my ability to have the best circumstances, but it still did not work as well as I had hoped.",
                "I think the virtual engagement was extremely high given that it is a private lesson. The biweekly seminars were also very engaging. The issues with remote teaching were that it's much harder to explain certain movements\/techniques when you cannot physically feel them and the sound and video isn't as good as it is live. I also found it hard that I could not practice in any practice rooms because I had to schedule my practices around my suitemate's classes so I wouldn't bother her, but I couldn't practice too late at night. I also had to practice in my room, which was a bit cramped, and the only chairs were the Yale rocking chairs so I couldn't use my rockstop and the chair would move if I wasn't careful. It would really help (especially for larger instruments) if we could have access to practice rooms, perhaps on a system similar to the small individual study rooms in Bass Library.",

The expectation is one hour of practice daily, and that may not be an easy or familiar bar to meet for some peopleit certainly was not for me. That being said, taking this course pushes students to think critically about how, when, and why they practice, and thorough engagement with the course yields high returns. I am very grateful for the opportunities I had within this course, especially the chance to host an outdoor solo recital. This course pushed me to take ownership of my musical education with an objective, growth-based mindset. If that sounds like something helpful for you, definitely take this course.",

It'll probably vary across instruments\/professors, but my professor was very understanding and I could set my own pace of learning if I had a busier week with other work or exams. If you did a lot of music throughout high school and would like to continue but are worried private lessons would take up too much time, I would say you can definitely still take lessons.

It's a very enjoyable course, provided you get along with the professor, and you get out of it more or less what you put in. There's no limit to how much you can learn and improve, but at the same time there isn't a ton of pressure aside from the pressure you put on yourself.",

But I would go into it knowing that not only will you not work on jazz per se, you will have to set aside the methods you are used to. And this is for your benefit. In the end, I am glad I took lessons with Carrie. I learned a great deal from a new perspective of approaching saxophone."
