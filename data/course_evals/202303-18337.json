It provides extremely important knowledge that one cannot find by reading current political theory about international relations because that work is not historically grounded. After taking the course, I feel prepared to critique this scholarship and to write more nuanced historical scholarship about the topics we discussed. It provided new lenses for thinking about important political problems including international law, trade, globalization, decolonization, and more."
