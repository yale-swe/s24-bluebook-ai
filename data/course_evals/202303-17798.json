                "This course has a lot of support from its teaching staff and is generally easily paced. I would recommend this for people who want to learn to use the Solidworks software without a lot of stress.",
                "The course was often very engaging and hands-on, however I thought some of the lectures felt a bit unhelpful to the projects we were doing in class and I think more hands-on projects would have been better.",
                "Strengths: it's a very open-ended and flexible class. You can work on whatever you want for the final project and other assignments. You are also given multiple opportunities to fix assignments after you turn them in, which is comforting. \r\nWeaknesses: there isn't much structure to the class.",
                "strength: very little work\r\nweakness: don't learn much as you could i guess",
                "strengths:\r\n- learning in a low-pressure environment\r\n- assignments are really fun\r\n- teaching team was always helpful and happy\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- bit of disorganization at first since some computer wasn't working",
                "The final project kind of came out of left field. The whole class was just creating and then the final project was creating and modeling. I would rather have had a final project that was something like \"make a project that includes a gear, a few premade parts, and 20 parts made by you\"",
                "I liked the mastery-based learning format of the course -- it allowed me to learn CAD in a very enjoyable, low-stress way. I also liked the flexibility in the assignments because it allowed me to pursue things that I found interesting while still learning the key skills of the course. I thought the class sessions could be a bit more organized and more hands-on practice.",
                "Wish it was on zoom because the 6pm class time was awful which made attendance hard",
                "The assignments or CAD models were pretty fun to work on each week and were pretty low-stakes.\r\n\r\nI think that if we could spend more time learning how gears work or how to make part drawings other than in the first weeks assignments, it would have been beneficial. I also would've enjoyed doing more assignments on 4 bar linkages and cam followers.",
                "A strength of this course is the open-ended final project which lets students design and test anything they desire and get familiar with testing functions not directly taught in class. A weakness could be the unorganized structure of the course, as it never known what each class would entail and how what we learned related to the course at large.",
                "The strength of this class is that ti allows each student to make of it what they will. The weakness is that it doesn't really teach us anything that we can't learn from YouTube. All of the tutorials were already built into the program and we weren't really learning anything new in any of the lectures. This is listed as an upper level engineering course but it was at a high school level at its best."

The course is organized in a way that allows for complete beginners to Solidworks to get started, but if you already happen to have some CAD experience, you'll have even more fun with the more creative projects!",
