                "I like the pace of this course. I feels just rigorous enough. I do wish there was more of a focus on improving speaking.",
                "I love how the class is a smaller seminar style because I think its very conducive to participation and learning, especially for a foreign language. Not really any weaknesses, set up well for success and actual learning and practice of language skills.",
                "Strengths: Very structured, clear, and straightforward. The exams were more thoughtful than in prior years, and the material was challenging. Weaknesses: It would be helpful to have a stronger sense of progression, as well as built in review."

                "I would! The Chinese Department at Yale is just excellent. The professors are extremely kind, and there is a reason for all the work done. The grading is generous, and it was a really enjoyable seminar experience. It's a little tiring because the volume of work, weekly tutorials, and everyday classes add up as the semester goes on, but the work is very predictable--some preparation on the weekends and time management will aid you in doing very well without feeling burned out.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes I would, although the workload can be a bit heavy, the class is definitely worth it and was my favorite this semester. The smaller class size really helped to make new friends and get good feedback to improve and build confidence and important language skills.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Chen Laoshi is by far one of the most thoughtful and hardworking instructors that I've had at Yale. So long as you stay on top of learning the incoming material, and check in with Chen Laoshi periodically, you can do very well!"
