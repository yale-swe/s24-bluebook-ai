    "This course taught me the fundamentals in reading, writing, speaking and listening in Chinese. The rigorous approach with daily exercises and practice allowed us to communicate in Chinese by writing and speaking, and we were able to have conversations on a variety of topics by the end of the semester.",
    "I learned introductory Mandarin. We started off learning about tones, and then moved into dialogues, vocabulary, and grammar. Each lesson is taught through a dialogue, which makes it easy to understand when\/how certain phrases and grammar would be used.",
    "Learned a surprising amount of Chinese in a short period of time.",
    "Taking this course, I learned the basics of Modern Chinese. Although I am not yet a fluent speaker of Chinese, I understand how the language works and can see that I will further improve by continuing to take Chinese at Yale.",
    "I learned so much! I think we learned about 300 characters alone, learned a lot of the basic, fundamental grammar, and we focused a lot on speaking and listening, which I really appreciated. While of course I am still a beginner, I feel like I have a good grasp and knowledge of what the Chinese language is like and how to say many common, everyday phrases.",
    "I gained an ability to hold some simple conversation in Chinese, with excellent pronunciation."

   "comments": [
    "This class was remarkably well-taught. The structure of the textbook was very helpful in learning vocabulary regarding a certain topic, and then learning different grammatical structures and expressions to communicate these ideas. We learned so much because of the daily quizzes, daily homework, and weekly tutorials, but also because of our teacher's dedication to making us learn and strictness with our pronunciation. I see very little weaknesses with the course. I would have appreciated the possibility of having oral exams in person (as opposed to on a computer), and of engaging with the class in Chinese beyond the classroom and tutorials (for example in weekly\/biweekly lunches in Chinese). I also appreciate how close we became with our professor, which was made possible by this year's different class structure (without rotation of professors).",
    "A huge strength of the class is the level of engagement - I've never been more engaged in a class than L1 Mandarin. The sections are small, which makes it more intimate. While it may seem annoying in the moment, we have quizzes each day which forces you to stay on top of your work.",
    "The teaching is very good, however I would have liked the rotating teacher system of previous years better.",
    "The course requires daily homework assignments that are essential to learning the language by routine practice.  The frequent assessments also provide students the chance to review a longer stretch of material periodically.  One suggestion would be to modify the oral test slightly. Having the students speaking to answer the same questions in the same room on the computer causes some confusion and makes it more difficult for students to focus on the questions at the same time.  A solution would be to set up the oral exam so that each student gets the questions in a random order. In that scenario, even if the students go about the exam at a similar pace, the questions that the students are on would be different and it would be less distracting to hear other students.",
    "Strengths: flipped classroom style so very focused on speaking and listening and practicing what we prepared ourselves the night before. Professor Li was very intentional in having every student in class speak at least a few times, and we were really able to practice our Chinese in class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the grammar was maybe not taught super clearly since it was a flipped classroom style, but I think overall no weaknesses that stand out to me!",
    "This course is very time-consuming, but resultantly excellent at teaching Chinese in an accelerated manner."

    "I cannot recommend this course highly enough. I believe that the Chinese department is one of the strongest at Yale, thanks to the rigor of the course, the devotion of the professors, and how organized each class was. I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in having a solid foundation in Chinese. I am beyond grateful for the opportunity to have taken this class.",
    "Yes. If you want to learn Mandarin, Yale's program is amazing. The instructors are great and caring. You will definitely learn Chinese, but you must put in the work.",
    "If you are interested in learning Chinese, yes. The workload is high as are the expectations, but you will learn a lot quickly. There are also many resources available to help you if you fall behind.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who would like to start learning Chinese! You can come a long way within a semester and it is an enjoyable learning experience. If you are taking this course, you should be dedicated to doing homework and practicing regularly to get the most out of the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn Chinese and is willing to put in the effort to learn it! The professors are amazing, the class is well-structured and well-taught, and you learn so much in just one semester. However, it is very easy to fall behind, so you have to be motivated and willing to put in the work.",
    "Yes, if they truly want to learn Chinese this is one of the best opportunities to do so, very rewarding course.",
    "Yes. Great start to learning Chinese."
