   "comments": [
    "Lots of room for creativity and a high degree of flexibility! Maybe a few more structured assignments and, certainly, more monitor hours (e.g. on fridays and saturdays!!) would have been nice for deeper exploration of techniques",
    "I really appreciated the flexibility of the projects because it allowed students to turn in their best work and not feel pressured to be fixed or limited by a strict time limit.",
    "I appreciate the cooperative approach to being in the printshop that Alex created for all of us in the class. I appreciated that the class felt like a space in which we were encouraged to explore and work with each other in. Time allocated to the various projects sometimes felt a little short, although I think the way the lead-up to the final project was particularly rushed was more an inevitability of how this semester had, by Yale scheduling, been pushed forward a week, with thanksgiving break being only a week away from reading week as opposed to the usual two weeks, than a fault of the class itself. I appreciated how Alex approached the final projects as works-in-progress, allowing us to present and talk about our work as such and to constantly be thinking about what else we might want to do next. I thought the comments that Alex provided in crit were also always very engaging and constructive.",
    "The strengths of this class were that we covered a lot of material in a short period of time. A weakness would have been that there was a low enforcement of doing work and homework so there was a feeling of low motivation in my classmates."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Great art class, totally manageable but also developed skills effectively. A great course, would also recommend as a 5th class bc the workload is totally what you make of it, and it's possible to do relatively little outside of class time and still succeed if you work quickly",
    "Yes! The class was great and gives you access to equipment that you would otherwise not be able to buy or use yourself on your own time. I really appreciated the instruction and access to a different art form. Take the class, the professor is very understanding and nice!",
    "Yes, it's a great introduction to printmaking and I enjoyed taking the class very much.",
    "Yes I definitely would. It is a great way to get a beginning and general start to printmaking."
