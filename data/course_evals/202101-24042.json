This course was super useful in refining my existing Spanish skills from 110 and building my confidence with speaking.",

                "Strengths: I loved how the smaller class sizes for this course gave me lots of engagement with the professor even while fully virtual. I loved the projects we had to do and I think they really helped me improve my confidence with speaking while also giving me a chance to learn more about the Spanish speaking world. I did like how we had freedom to pick what topics interested us and that aspect of the course really made me feel more excited about class. I loved Professor Tortora's energy; she really made this class amazing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course moved really quickly through some of the material. I wish we could spend more than a week on some of the units especially towards the end of the course however, I totally understand the time constraints.",
                "Professor Tortora was incredibly kind. Even though languages are absolutely not my strong suit, she made the semester much more enjoyable. You learn a lot of vocab, grammar, etc. The only weakness I would say is that there are can be an emphasis on culture to the detriment of actual learning. Cultural understanding is of course key, but I feel like an emphasis on conversation (what a vast majority of L2 students will use the course for) would be awesome.",
                "For some reason it never really felt like we were spending much time with the material. I think we maybe focused a little too much on grammar and supplemental exercises at the expense of vocab and speaking.",
                "This course would obviously be much more effective in person, but having such a small class virtually was very nice."

                "I liked how we were able to practice speaking one-on-one in breakout rooms. Although it was definitely not as engaging as in person learning, I don't think any aspects could be feasibly improved using zoom as a platform. The course ran as well as possible given the online platform.",
                "I thought the course worked well over Zoom. I'm never as comfortable speaking on zoom which doesn't help, but I can't think of much to improve it.",

                "The partner video recordings weren't very helpful. The cultural projects helped with learning.",
                "Ultimately, I appreciate that this class did not meet M-F, but I think that has probably resulted in less immersion and rigor than usual L2 Spanish. Also, not meeting every day meant that I always felt like I was missing or forgetting homework assignments."

                "If you want to learn spanish (or have to do a language requirement), yes! I don't love languages and struggled at times, but it's a well-taught course and not too brutal. Definitely take with Tortora, she's great!",
