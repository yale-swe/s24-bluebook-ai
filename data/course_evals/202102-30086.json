                "I gained a deep understanding of collapse events and causes of the past. I learned to ask \"why?\" for different collapse events and search for the paleoclimate or archaeological evidence for a given observation. This course introduced me to different points of view regarding collapse explanations and studies which was really useful because after reading all those different approaches I could make up my own mind about what I believe to be true historically. This course also furthered my understanding of the current climate crisis we are experiencing and the potential resilience strategies we, as a society, can employ to survive.",
                "I had not realized how complicated the definition of collapse could be. With so many moving parts, it is sometimes hard to distinguish what is the true cause without ensuring that what you are analyzing is truly inherent to the problem in the first place. I believe the main skill I developed therefore is that of critical thinking. During this course, we read from other professors and authors who presented their definition of collapse to us -- but as we read those books, we were encouraged to discover what was wrong with their stances. This helped us be able to delve further into this course while also helped us develop our own definition of what is considered to be collapse.",

                "There could be more student-run discussions throughout the course. That would also relieve some stress from Prof. Weiss since the lectures are quite long during summer. Other than that, Prof. Weiss did an excellent job of communicating all the key materials and concepts in such a short amount of time.",
                "The summer course moves at a very fast pace, and can feel very confusing to those with no background in this area. I thought this would focus more on present day climate change, but is definitely focused in a more historical perspective. Those with little knowledge of ancient history may struggle to learn both the history and corresponding scientific data to explain it.",
                "As mentioned above, I believe the strength of this course truly is the push it has on critical thinking. I believe that this could have been improved with more time dedicated to discussions about the readings we did the night before, and figuring out what we thought was wrong with those stances before we were told what was right from wrong by the professor. I recognize that this is a summer class, however, meaning time was much more restrained than usual, so that is only a suggestion. One other thing I wish we got to focus slightly more on was how climate change has (for a lack of a better term) changed throughout history. While climate events used to be naturally caused, now they are human caused. I wish we were able to discuss our current day situation slightly more.",
                "Harvey Weiss' lectures are great. Some discussion sections to review the material would be even better.",
                "Very rushed. Way too many readings that weren't super relevant in way too short period of time. The materials for the course were also super confusing (ie lecture slides with very little information and no context, incredibly difficult to use to review)",

                "I definitely would, especially for a summer course. The workload was manageable and the course content was extremely interesting and engaging. Any student that's interested and wants to learn more about paleoclimate research, archaeology and the history of complex societies shouldn't miss this course. Also, the fact that climate change was a huge part of our discussions made the course even more interesting and relevant to our modern context.",
                "Yes, it is a excellent course about the social collapse. You can learn the idea and theory of so many archaeologist. And you can also know about the important role climate played in human civilization. The professor is so nice!",
                "Yes I would, I believe that this course really highlights knowledge about both past societies and past climate events that are necessary to understand -- as this helps us better contextualize how those events are different from the ones we deal with today. Generally, I believe that climate related classes in general should have more of a focus considering our current situation. More people's eyes need to be opened so we can ensure our world can remain safe.",
                "Yes, it provides really interesting insight into historical climate change and how that relates to the present situation. One thing to note though is that it's mostly about historical cases and doesn't nearly focus as much on modern climate change. \r\nAlso there aren't any assignments for grades until pretty much the last day.",
                "Yes! Everyone should learn about ancient climate change.",
                "Probably not during the summer. Maybe during the academic year, but the summer session was way too rushed.",
                "Yes I would, but only if that student likes the details of archeological study, and reading in depth historical records. If someone if particularly interested in these subjects as well as societal collapse, this course would be perfect."
