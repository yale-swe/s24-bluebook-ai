I was unfamiliar with many of the texts we read this semester and the movements they fell under, so I had to analyze things such as context a lot more.

                "I have improved my ability to look at literary texts holistically and situate them in a greater literary context (e.g romanticism, realism, modernism); I have learnt to identify and extract key stylistic pointers from a close-reading of the text that may help me relate it and compare / contrast it to other texts on the syllabus. Extensive, engaging thematic discussions on the books on the syllabus has improved my confidence and ability to express my views clearly orally; the stylistic connections that I draw between different genres of art (literature, visual art, music) have become more distinct.",

I can delve deeper in my writing, and construct general points referring to broader themes. I drew important connections across the Western canon, and I can see a much clearer bridge between antiquity and modernity."

                "I don't really think there are any weaknesses. Professor Bassi had a tun of fun activities to improve engagement, and the work we were assigned before class always enriched our discussions. I think she did a phenomenal job!",
                "I thought the selection of texts was wonderful.",
                "Strengths:\r\nI think that the one-lecture two-discussion section division of the DS courses more generally works extremely well, where the lecture provides an overview and interesting avenue into the text while the discussion sections enables the students to interact with it more directly as they discuss and consider it together with their peers.\r\n\r\nTo me, the most thought-provoking and valuable lectures were those that started with a short biographical situating of the text, and then provided a distinct, in depth reading of it thatbecause it did not attempt to do everythingwas able to go into great detail regarding a certain aspect of the work. Examples of such lectures include: the lecture on Frankenstein, on A Raisin in the Sun, on Hadji Murat as well as both lectures on Paradise Lost.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nIf I compare the DS literature syllabus in the Spring to e.g the H&P Spring Syllabus or the Fall literature syllabus, it felt slightly less coherent. Personally, I think that less time could have been spent on Paradise Lost (perhaps not reading the work in its entirety?) and that we should have read more of Wordsworth's Prelude rather than combining it with a selection of his poetry. It would have been valuable (and related back to Goethe!) to read some modernist literature from the continent (e.g Kafka), and while I understand that reading Tolstoy's Hadji Murat is a more realistic project than tackling one of his most famous works, I believe I would almost have preferred reading selections from Anna Karenina, because it connects so well with Flaubert.\r\n\r\nWhile it was a very engaging play, I think that the reason for picking 'A Raisin in the Sun' above any other text from the mid-20th century was not very clear. Similarly, 'Omeros' was incredible, but unfortunately I believe that a lot of students ended up not finishing it because it was a difficult text to end the semester with, especially since we had already started studying for Finals.",
                "Strengths: I think DS Literature in general has a carefully crafted syllabus and is well-taught. Prof. Bassi's section in particular was excellent; we got to engage more deeply with the texts by exploring Yale's archival and museum resources, participate in creatively structured discussion sections, and explore not just the texts themselves, but also classical reception and literary criticism. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: interesting works, fun essay topics; Weaknesses: lots of reading",
                "It covers a lot of material but not in great depth",
                "Professor Bassis section was fantastic, but it often (every text with the exception of the troubadours and Paradise Lost) felt like we didnt have enough time to discuss it in the depth the texts merit. I think trimming a few texts from the syllabus would be valuable, and also would make room for a wider range of texts (including more non-English texts). I think the troubadours and Petrarch could safely be relocated to the first semester, and the second semester could start with Don Quixote.",
                "There were so many amazing activities Serena planned, including fishbowl discussions and gallery visits. There were countless avenues to engage with textual content beyond just what we read. Maybe the essential themes of the texts could be specified, instead of leaving them up to question, deeply rooted in the works directly."
