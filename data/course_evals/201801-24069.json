    "I learned a lot about comparing the late 19th Century, and Soviet vs. US 20th Century contexts behind literature, politics, and film. We read a really interesting array of texts, some of which would be well known, and others definitely not. It was a great exercise in literary modernism.",
    "Survey of some 20th century literature in the US and the Soviet Union. Discussion of political and artistic relationships between the two.",
    "We grew more attuned to recent American and Russian cultural strands, to various standards of living. A large part of the class was dedicated to making sense of the cultural parallels between the two sides of the Iron Curtain."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are a strong individual attention between professor to student because of the small seminar size. Professor Weinstein comes in with a lot of expertise in different literary traditions and he is super knowledgeable in his own interpretations of the text. He is always willing to listen to other perspectives, and he is super available for office hours. The context he gives is often helpful for the students' understanding of the texts. His essay feedback is incredibly thorough and helpful. I don't see many weaknesses.",
    "The pace and diversity of the syllabus is fantastic. In seminar, Prof. Weinstein's introductions were always informative. Though the student-driven discussions were sometimes rather bland, Prof. Weinstein picked up the best in people's comments and kept the ball rolling. At first, I was a bit afraid that I was dominating the discussion as the native Russian lit major in the room. The general student involvement felt much more meaningful by the end of the semester, when we were giving each other feedback for our final projects. Since people tend to respond to films more extensively than to literature, it may be helpful to introduce a film earlier in the semester (but only if it makes sense historically!)"

    "Definitely take a class with Professor Weinstein, especially if you care about the cultural, political, and historical context of the works you are reading. Professor Weinstein brings both a good dose of historical context and literary theory to class discussions and he really cares about what each student has to say. Also, the reading list for this class is amazing.",
    "Yes, the reading list is super super super interesting, and I love the way it's paired.",
    "A great class with a great reading list taught by a great professor. Professor Weinstein does a great job leading seminar discussions, knows a huge amount, and always makes himself available outside of class. He was highly responsive to the class interests, often tailoring material to better fit those interests. Above all, he clearly cares about the class and his students, and that makes a huge difference. The workload is very manageable: a couple 5-6 pagers and one 10-12. Highly recommend.",
    "Yes, absolutely yes. He's a wonderful professor and the course is rigorous, but you always get a lot out of it. It's a shame, however, that he's leaving, so I'm not sure when, or if, the next time he teaches would be.",
    "Take classes with Professor Weinstein. He's fantastic.",
    "Yes, this was a great course. Michael Weinstein is an excellent teacher and the discussion was always engaging and lively. Weekly discussion posts make this more work than comparable courses but the main assignments are manageable in length and scope and the topics are interesting.",
    "Take it. You will read works that you've probably never encountered before and will have a chance to work with a professor who cares deeply about the honest social\/cultural questions of our world today."
