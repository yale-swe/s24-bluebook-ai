                "The strengths of this course are the effective execution of an in person course in which I was able to learn gamelan, while utilizing social distancing practices. Additionally, the assessments and virtual lectures were very effective in providing a background and context to the musical practice we were engaging in as an emsemble",
                "This course really struggled in this pandemic semester. Any cultural learning from the virtual seminar meeting was never mentioned outside of zoom, and rehearsals were awkward with a \"learn by doing\" mindset that needed more clear instruction. Assignments seemed out of sync with the rest of the course, which seemed to be almost entirely focused on in-rehearsal participation. They were graded kind of harshly by the professor who was not actually instructing us in class and did not seem to reflect the chill attitude of rehearsal. Communication about upcoming assignments was also difficult, with surprise midterms and final projects we didn't know about until they were happening. Rehearsals were also frustrating, as I believe many students would have benefited from basic music skills instruction, which we never got. Grading was sometimes harsh and inconsistent, which was confusing, since the class seemed like it was supposed to be a very laid-back environment.",
                "This is a great course. The professors are extremely knowledgable, kind and enthusiastic about what they do. The one thing I would improve upon is more flexibility. Some students struggled playing certain instruments, and I wish that students had the ability to swap in these cases so that the overall ensemble performance could be improved.",
                "I really liked the lectures with Maho and the readings that accompanied them, and I was so grateful for the chance to work with Mas Dar for our in person rehearsals. The long rehearsal time on Fridays was intensely challenging for the mind and the arms, especially when we played a 10+ minute piece, stopped for 20 seconds, and then did it twice more. When we made mistakes at the end of the piece or at a tempo change, more often than not, we would start the piece from the beginning, take every repeat (sometimes taking a repeat four times, tiring our arms without addressing the reason we stopped) , and not play the part where we made the mistake for multiple minutes. I wish we had used our rehearsal time to target specific parts of the pieces that had the most issues. I might not have struggled playing the last measure of certain pieces if we'd just played the last 20 seconds instead of the whole thing repeatedly, and it might have helped the long rehearsal time feel less monotonous. Overall, I am grateful I took this course, but sometimes the rehearsal practices contributed to my repeated exhaustion by 3:25.",
                "This class is an incredibly fun and immersive experience. Mas Dar was an amazing instructor for our in-person rehearsals; he always listened to carefully to each student's playing and gave constructive feedback. It was also inspiring to hear him talk about his experiences playing gamelan in Java. For our seminar discussions, Maho was a wonderful instructor who clearly cares a lot about her students. I learned a ton about cultural practices surrounding the gamelan, and it definitely has piqued my interest in a musical tradition that I knew very little about beforehand."

                "I would recommend this in another semester maybe. I was never comfortable or knew quite what was expected of me, and communication between Mas Dar, who saw only in-person instruction, and Maho, who ran everything on canvas and zoom, was difficult and intimidating to try to give feedback about when things didn't seem to line up because they're married.",
                "Yes!",
