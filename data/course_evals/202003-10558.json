                "Strengthened my grammar skills in Spanish! It was a fast paced overview of L3 and L4 grammar, and as someone who really enjoys grammar, I really liked the way this class was organized! I also feel much more confident in my ability to speak Spanish. Using Lingua Meeting to do a live virtual individual sessions with a language coach from Spain, I talked in Spanish for 30 minutes every week for the first half of the semester. The second half of the semester we all got a conversation partner from Ecuador who we talked to for an hour every week! It was very enjoyable and helped me improve my ability to speak Spanish spontaneously rather than through memorization.",
                "This class helped me feel more confident and comfortable with various aspects of Spanish grammar, such as the subjunctive, \"por\" vs \"para,\" and the placement of adjectives. It also expanded my vocabulary with the readings that were assigned for homework.",

                "My grammar has strengthened significantly as a result of taking this course. There isn't an introduction to too much vocabulary, but it is a grammar course after all.",
                "I think Spanish 223 is a good bridge between L4 and L5 classes. The course focused more on grammar and writing skills, which does not necessarily involve learning a lot of new information, but rather strengthening prior knowledge with more complex grammar structures.",
                "This class was wonderful for solidifying my knowledge of Spanish grammar. It greatly helped to improve my grammar to a level where it feels much more natural and fluid. By going through an abundance of grammar topics (preterite vs imperfect, subjunctive, conditionals, articles, pronouns, etc.) in a much more rigorous way than previous classes, you really feel as if the language comes together. I also greatly enjoyed the conversation partners, as it helped to actually use the grammar rather than just learn about them. I couldn't be more thrilled with the layout of this class.",

                "Strengths: great professor, grammar-oriented. Despite the fact that the workload rating for this class is pretty high, I did not think it was heavy workload at all! It was a perfect amount for me because I get a lot of dense readings from my other classes; so the weekly grammar assignments were a nice break! It is also pretty easy to do well as long as you do the work--you just have to stay on track, do all your assignments, study for exams, and participate in class well. I can't think of any weaknesses; I thought everything from organization of the syllabus to the expectations from students was fair and great.",
                "In this course I became deeply familiar with advanced Spanish grammar. Mostly the focus was on speaking and writing correctly.",
                "Strengths: Professor Terry Seymour!! She made this class very engaging, even at 9am. Its a very week structured course that works on all aspects of language learning. A lot of different tasks: from lower stake hw assignments, to graded hw, composition writing etc. one of the best parts of the class were speaking sessions with Spanish speaking tutors and Zoom session with students from Ecuador. Weakness: sometimes homework was unevenly spread out through the week, one day there was only one task and the other six.",
                "The biggest strength of this class is the professor. Terry is wonderfully kind, knowledgeable, helpful, fun, and easy to understand. In this weird semester, she was delightful to spend the mornings with and really helped everyone feel comfortable while also teaching us so much Spanish grammar. I also think the structure of this class is a huge strength. Because this class is entirely dedicated to rigorously learning grammar, it is so useful to solidifying former knowledge or the past four classes at Yale. I think this is the perfect transition class between L1-L4 and upper level L5 classes. Finally, the rigor of this class is both a strength and a weakness, as it is necessary for effectively learning the grammar but can lead to a fair amount of busy work. Sometimes I wish it were made possible to do the homework a few days in advance (maybe making all assignments available for 2 weeks) because it would allow you to avoid a day with both lots of Spanish homework and another big class assignment."

                "I know that not everyone prefers this, but as someone who is rather quiet, and finds it harder to participate and especially online because I don't want to accidentally interrupt someone, I really liked that professor Seymour cold-called on students and allowed for students to raise hand and jump in. (Don't be afraid, if you don't know the answer, you can just say so!) She was my only professor to do so, but I really preferred this, and I definitely participated the most in this class than in other classes! I also liked that Friday classes were asynchronous; it gave me flexibility on when to get things done! Breakout room was also a nice tool to encourage peer-peer Spanish conversations and learning during class time.",
                "The cold-calling during class made me pay more attention to the presentation and kept me engaged even at 9:25am. Everyone was expected to have their cameras on, which allowed me to get to know my classmates better.",
                "The virtual environment was suitable for this class.",
                "I really enjoyed the variety of homework tasks and that we actually had to submit it on canvas, because it gave additional motivation. I think that distribution of time time spent in break out rooms and in the main room was pretty good. Although, sometimes we spent too much time in the breakout room and we were not really doing anything.",
                "Live lectures for two out of the three sessions with an asynchronous day on Fridays worked exceptionally well in my opinion. It allowed us to have a little extra flexibility of virtual learning while also having the interactions of communication. Overall, I was very impressed with how well this class worked online. The exams were especially fair and well-designed for this."

                "Yes, absolutely! I feel much better about my Spanish speaking and writing abilities. You write a total of 5 papers (3 take-home, 2 in class- each around 1.5 pages) and the amount of grammar and complex sentence structures you learn really help to improve your writing. I also found myself constantly speaking Spanish whether in class, in the LinguaMeeting sessions, or with my conversation partner from Ecuador. I feel so much more confident in taking more advanced L5 classes now, and I am very glad I took this class.",
                "Yes, definitely! This is a great course to take as your first language class at Yale. The readings\/hw assignments always contained new vocabulary and grammar, but they weren't overwhelming, and you'll feel much more comfortable speaking and writing knowing you have a better understanding of Spanish grammar.",

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student looking to perfect their Spanish. It is a challenging class and since an A is a 94% and above, the grading is pretty harsh. However, if you are willing to put in a fair amount of time studying, an A is possible.",
                "I would recommend this to someone who is trying to improve their grammar and speaking skills in the language. It was very helpful for me although there was a lot of homework. Just be prepared for that, but the professor is so sweet and is willing to help you whenever you need it!",
                "Absolutely! Take this class if you are looking for a good transition from L4 to higher level classes. It improves writing skills and builds up more complex grammatical concepts on the already existing base.",
                "Absolutely! I truly loved this class, and Terry is wonderful. I have always adored grammar, so this class was so fun for me, but I also think it greatly improved my Spanish as well. It is a substantial workload; however, because it is so predictable, I found it incredibly manageable and not stressful. I highly recommend it.",
                "Absolutely. The grading was fair and not overly harsh, I would say a straight A is a tall order but an A- requires a very reasonable level of commitment. Learner a ton, feedback was extremely consistent and personalized."
