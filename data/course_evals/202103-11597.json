We learned important Korean grammar.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Choi ssn was pretty disorganized with the schedule in terms of when things were due and what daily assessments covered. She also kept changing her mind about what the final project consisted of.",
                "Strengths: Incredible consistency in teaching techniques not only with daily speaking exercises in class, but homework twice-three times a week which increased my engagement with the course. All the projects and assessments were also highly interesting and always peaked the curiosity of the students, therefore we were always excited to let our creative freedom help us better understand the topics at hand. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Absolutely no weakness, terrific course!"
