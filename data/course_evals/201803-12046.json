    "The ability to read Devanagari. Understanding of Sanskrit grammar and vocabulary at an introductory level. To be honest, the class is not really a good way to learn Sanskrit (I'm not sure there is a good way to do that in the way that you can learn to speak Spanish or Arabic) but it is an excellent way to learn ABOUT Sanskrit, and about Indoeuropean languages in general.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The workload is really manageable. The exams are extremely well defined --- you know exactly what will be on the exams and how to study for them. The class is really low stress and the people in it are really nice. The grading is very generous.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The engagement isn't the highest, and trying to keep track of everything is like trying to drink from a firehose; there's just too much to try and recall, but the grading makes up for that.",
    "Professor Uskokov was one of the strengths of the course; I felt he was really knowledgeable and helpful. I thought the textbook could have been more helpful, it sometimes was confusing and it wasn't very well organized. But this might be hard to remedy since I'm not sure if there are a lot of Sanskrit textbooks on the market to begin with?",
    "The professor is very well prepared to answer questions and his knowledge of the subject matter is evident. The textbook that is used, however, is very verbose and not user-friendly. Should reconsider instructional materials."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. It's not a very practical language but it sure is fun. Plus, there are no daily online assignments or oral exams or anything like that.",
    "This class is a lot of fun; take it if you are interested in languages, linguistics, Indian culture, etc., keeping in mind that this is a highly inflected language with unfamiliar syntax, so it's definitely gonna be hard, but the class moves at a manageable pace."
