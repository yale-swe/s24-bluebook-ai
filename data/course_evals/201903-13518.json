   "comments": [
    "Good acquaintance with the main 16-18C (mostly British) literature and philosophy texts.",
    "I thought this course was awesome. I learned a lot about the material, but more than anything, I learned a new way to analyze both literature and philosophy in a cross-disciplinary sense.",
    "I developed deep knowledge of how literature and philosophy inform each other, and how the events of the seventeenth and eighteenth century provoked thought that created the world we live in today. I learnt a lot of philosophy and got to read some unusual and fascinating literature. I also developed my literary analysis and seminar skills hugely, as it was a small seminar and Prof Kramnick is very accessible and good at working with individuals.",
    "I learned how to approach literature with an eye to the philosophy of its time period, and to recognize how much philosophical ideas saturate literature.",
    "A general overview of philosophy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and its connection to the literature of the period. I learned about the connections between the two and improved my writing skills."

   "comments": [
    "Wonderful class! Discussions were lively and engaging, Professor Kramnicks familiarity with the texts and their contexts helped so much in revealing important takeaways that I definitely wouldnt have gotten reading them on my own. AND, he brought his dog to class which was a real mood lifter",
    "The strengths were twofold: the professor and the small class size. First, I thought Professor Kramnick was wonderful. He is very knowledgeable, but he's also a master at leading a productive discussion. He doesn't let students get lost in the weeds of a difficult text, but he also doesn't control the discussion in an overbearing way. Second, the class size (7 students) allowed us to really engage with each other in a small, seminar style. It was really wonderful. In terms of weaknesses, I just think that the course was very back-loaded. Going into finals week, we had really only had one major assignment and 70% of our grade was still up for grabs. I would recommend that the work be more evenly placed across the semester. Otherwise, an awesome course.",
    "Strengths were the quality of the readings (they were all interesting and tied well into the project of the course) and the truly excellent teaching by Professor Kramnick. His ability to lead seminar in a way that both includes and stimulates everyone, critique and advise papers and personally encourage his students is what makes this class really stellar. A weakness, if I have to think of one, might be the fact that the course covers a lot of diverse writers and philosophical topics without any clear topic structure, but the topics and themes do emerge through the seminar discussions.",
    "Strengths: great readings, great discussion, knowledgeable instructor.\r\nWeaknesses: Class time was sometimes too short and limited discussions."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! So fun",
    "Yes. I would recommend this course to any student of English, comparative literature, philosophy, or humanities -- or even anyone with a passing interest in any of those subjects. It offers a new way to analyze texts and gives you important background for a number of crucial topics like aesthetic value, political epistemology, and sense perception.",
    "Yes. Professor Kramnick is an amazing thinker and teacher, and frequently brings his even more amazing dogs to class if nobody has an issue with it. He begins each class with a quick outline of where the previous discussions had been and pivots to our interests. His grading is very fair and he really wants to work with you and help you succeed.",
    "Yes definitely!!! I would recommend this course to anyone who's interested in philosophy, literature or history. Professor Kramnick is the best seminar leader I have ever been taught by and the class was the highlight of my week. Kramnick provides excellent one on one feedback, is incredibly insightful and truly cares about his students work. The course really succeeds at delving into both philosophy and literature as well as their relation to one another, and definitely grew my ability to analyze literature and philosophical texts. I learnt a huge amount, and the workload isn't too taxing. Overall it was one of my best experiences at Yale.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in literature, but also wants an in-depth survey of its connection to philosophy, beyond literary analysis. We read from novels and poems and enquiries, but were not limited in class or in our papers to either literary or philosophical analysis."
