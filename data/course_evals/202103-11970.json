There isn't an emphasis to speak exclusively Arabic in class, so speaking is confined to specific exercises and suffers as a result. Work from the book was set every day, but wasn't always checked, which led to complacency in doing work outside of class.\r\n\r\nThe class sticks to the Al-Kitaab textbook pretty rigidly, and the topics in the textbook are pretty boring and unfocused. The class is most interesting when Professor Aziz relates the material to cultural and religious examples.\r\n\r\nThe class could be improved by focusing more on speaking, both MSA and dialect. I found the presentation at the end of the semester difficult, as I took a gap year after completing L2. I would have found more spontaneous conversations in class to be helpful."
