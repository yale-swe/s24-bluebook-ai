                "Absolutely. First step to learning Portuguese, and it's a good first step  especially if you put in work to be dedicated to it.",

                "Yes, Portuguese is one of the few language classes that doesnt have a super traditional learning method. In other words, you learn the language while learning the culture, not vice versa."
