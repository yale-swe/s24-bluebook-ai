                "I improved my German reading, writing, and speaking abilities while also gaining exposure to a wide range of literary texts. I also improved my ability to speak and write about literary texts through both analytical and creative assignments. This course was a great opportunity to gain a sense of identity-oriented literature and its relationship with genre and historical/political developments in Germany.",
                "I deepened my knowledge of the concept of \"genre\" and its implications in German literary tradition, especially focusing on genre within the realm of modern German \"identity literature.\"",
                "I learned about German history and literature. I also developed skills in reading more quickly and composing longer essays in German.",
                "In this class, I read genres of German texts that I had not previously engaged with. I felt that the texts were not the \"typical\" German poems, dramas, and books that are often taught, and so I read texts that widened my understanding of German literature (particularly in a modern context). Not only the texts but also the assignments for this course pushed me to think outside of the box. In all of the German courses I have taken at Yale, none have required me to write creative assignments in the way we did in this class. These assignments made me engage with the German language in a new way, and I believe they imporved my language skills as well."

            "comments": [
                "This was an amazing course! I loved that we were a small group, which enabled efficient and frequent group work as well as insightful and inclusive class discussions. The workload was ideal to facilitate extensive but focused study of a number of German poetic, prose, and dramatic works. The creative assignments gave us an opportunity to apply some of our conversations and observations to the practice of literary production. Weekly discussion posts were also a wonderful way to make sure we were consistently thinking critically about the works we were reading, practicing writing in German, and engaging with one another's ideas  I also loved that Professor Schweiger integrated our ideas into her powerpoint presentations.",
                "Strengths: This course was one of my favorite classes this semester. Projects and assignments were always interesting and engaging, and nearly every reading piqued my (and, or so it seemed, many of my classmates') interests. Class discussions were generally lively in comparison to those of my other courses, and the class environment was generally warm and welcoming. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps one or two more \"traditional,\" less-creative essay assignments would have been helpful as essay-writing practice, but this is a very minor \"weakness\" (if a weakness at all)",
                "This course could probably use some more grammar practice just to keep it fresh, even though we are in an L5 class. Professor Schweiger adjusted appropriately after our midterm exam, which turned out not to fit the mode of instruction as well as the writing assignments did. One suggestion to improve the course would be to post the lecture slides after class so students could review them.",
                "The strengths of this course are the texts and in-class discussions. I always looked forward to our discussion in class and left with new ideas and considerations for a text. Additionally, I felt that the small class size allowed for our discussions to feel more like conversations about texts rather than classroom commentaries. I became very close with my classmates through talking about this course and its materials outside of the classroom. \r\n\r\nI believe were this class lacked a little for me was feedback on my writing. While we wrote quite a bit, the commentaries did not focus on grammar (which I know I have not yet mastered) but rather on the content. Of course, this was still important and helpful, but I had hoped to receive a bit more grammatical criticism and help."

                "Yes! This is a great class for anyone with the desire to read and discuss more German literature of various different genres, improve German speaking, reading, and writing abilities, and learn about German literature through the lens of a thematic focus on identity.",
                "I would DEFINITELY recommend this class to other students. All of the readings are incredibly engaging -- they often involve perspectives to which I had never been previously exposed in the context of German literature. Assignments (though some are more traditional) often have a creative component, which I very much enjoyed. Sophie was also a wonderful instruction, incorporating/expanding on the ideas from our weekly discussion posts in her lectures and creating a warm and welcoming classroom environment in which I generally felt comfortable participating.",
                "I would recommend this course. It covers some blind spots of German instruction (particularly pre-statehood and modern history). The reading assignments are very interesting, and a good balance of historically important and cutting-edge. The assignments are fun but also challenging because you have to put yourself in the mind of the authors you read (or apply your own twist). The personal project also added a lot to my learning experience.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students who take German because the professor was amazing, the content was interesting, and the class discussions were very engaging. I hope that other students who are interested in German literature take this course."
