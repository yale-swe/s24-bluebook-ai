                "You learn intro design of planar mechanisms. I didn't know before coming into this class how integral simple series of links are as a base element for many machines. This class teaches you how to take something like a simple rotary input and transform it into more complex motion. Helpful to take alongside dynamics as it will make some elements of dynamics easier with the concept overlap.",
                "Mechanism design, 4 bar mechanics, equations to model mechanisms. All in all a very fun class.",
                "The course teaches a lot of the math/intuition behind machine design. It provides insight into how to design common mechanisms to yield the behavior that you desire by manipulating the geometry of the mechanism. The course also teaches some useful Solidworks skills. It also covers a lot of dynamics and is geared towards students who already took dynamics so it goes a little bit more in depth and is specific to machine design.",
                "Learned about new mechanisms - all the four-bar mechanisms and their uses, Geneva wheel, cams - learned how to design four-bar mechanisms, use more advanced Solidworks features than we covered in Meng 400, Lagrangians for solving complex multi-body systems.",
                "learned the math and design of mechanisms including four-bar mechanisms, slider-cranks, cam-followers, Learned how to implement them hands on, Learned where they're used, Learned how to design them with constraints, did some CAD too"

            "comments": [
                "The course was very well taught. The homework wasn't too much. It probably would have been best to do one homework before each midterm. Also, it would be better to have some more guidance along the process of making our final projects.",
                "Strengths: Doc A has a wealth of practical engineering knowledge so if you put in the energy to interact more in the class you'll be rewarded.\r\nWeaknesses: More specificity going into each lecture of what material was being taught and how it differs from the previous material would have been useful. Especially near the end, it felt like the lectures blurred together into repeating the same process over and over, even though there was distinction. Overall, could have been pushed a little more in the class to alleviate boredom, although on the other hand an easier class is welcome amid the MechE curriculum.",
                "Great quantity and quality of work. The class content is interesting, Doc A is also an interesting prof. Two downfalls: the time sucks, I'd usually be asleep if Doc A didn't make the classes so funny. Downfall 2 the exams clapped me. especially the MATLAB one.",
                "Good course overall, I think it would have been fun to also cover more mechanisms that we didn't touch on already in Meng 400. We learned a lot of advanced solidworks features, but there were more to learn that would have been nice to have in our toolbox, as this is the last solidworks heavy meng class offered at Yale. I think more topics could have been covered, and the time spent on the individual projects could have been decreased a little bit (maybe by a week or two to fit in another bigger topic).",
                "Strengths: well paced, well taught, good workload. Weaknesses: homework should be due before the exams, there should be 2 exams bc by the end there wasn't a lot of material on the last one/it felt rushed, also would prefer having courses during the day and not at night"

                "I would definitely recommend this course for people who are interested in the subject, especially if they have previously taken MENG 400. It has a minimal workload, teaches useful concepts, and allows for creativity through the final project.",
                "Yes! At the end of the day Doc A is personable and cares about your success as an engineer and adult, so I'd recommend any class with him. There's plenty of opportunity to have fun with the open-ended project at the end too.",
                "Yes, Any class with Doc A is a great class",
                "The course is a great engineering elective. The material is very tangible and it feels like you're learning real mechanical engineering things.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course! It forces you to get more solidworks experience and you learn some interesting physics relations that govern our mechanisms. Some topics could have been easier to understand with a bit of a physics background (like the Langrangian) but are very powerful tools. Also Doc A is an awesome prof and it's always fun being in his classes.",
                "Yes I would, learned a lot but wasn't terribly stressful, fair exams, workload made sense but wasn't too stressful, project feels useful"
