I learned how to properly produce signs as well as catch when one of my group members wasn't producing a sign correctly. I learned how to hold conversations in ASL, both in class with my professor and outside of class with my group members. And, I'm starting to learn how to think more conceptually, as the language requires. Overall, I have such a new respect for the language and the people who speak it.",

                "All strengths, no weaknesses! The combination of \"live\" class and prerecorded lessons on Canvas made learning how to sign a much smoother process, at least for me. The material--vocabulary, grammar rules, homework, and Deaf culture readings--was all very interesting and engaging. I never felt like I was drowning or falling behind in the class, and that was absolutely due to the pacing of the work and instruction. Of course it would've been nice to sit in a classroom together in person, but that aside, this course was excellent.",

                "Honestly, this course had no weaknesses. Dr K is an incredibly engaging professor with a true dedication to each of her students. I always felt comfortable asking questions and was confident about class assignments. One major strength is the organization of the course, as each week of vocabulary is easily accessible, and assignments are very clearly posted. I also appreciated the \"voice-off\" policy Dr K used since the first day of class. Being in a silent environment, where we were utilizing ASL as much as possible, was both respectful to the Deaf community and helped us practice signing as much as possible. I could seriously go on and on about the strengths of the course, I learned so much about ASL and the Deaf community and was deeply interested in the subject matter.",

                "I absolutely loved this course; it was the highlight of my semester by a long shot. The workload was manageable and very very fun! I was actually able to make friends in my class even in this virtual setting, and Professor Guynes was by far the best professor I've had so far."

                "I think all of the practices succeeded! The biggest difference for a class like ours, had it met in person, would've been more conversational practice with each other. However, Dr. K had us in small groups that would often meet during class time to practice vocabulary and work on assignments together--with our mics off--which allowed for almost as much engagement as we would've experienced in an actual classroom. The video instruction outside of class time was a really good way to supplement learning without being able to meet in person.",

Also, Dr K's use of screensharing to have Powerpoints support her signing helped out my peers and I understand directions and class activities. Of course, this is not an ideal setting (and I am sure we would all rather be in a seminar room together), but Dr K did a great job adapting to make the course virtual.",

                "YES!!!!!! This was hands down (haha, pun intended) my favorite class of the semester, and I fully recommend it to anyone considering taking it. Dr. K is a gem--she is a wonderful professor and a kind person, and she will even bring her dogs to class from time to time. Yeah. It's as great as it sounds. I'd been wanting to take ASL for a while before coming to college, and I am so glad I got to start with a professor like Dr. K. The material is intellectually stimulating without being excessive or ridiculously challenging. Learning how to sign is a lot of fun, and you will see and feel your progress after just a week or two of taking the course. Take this class--you will not regret it.",

                "Absolutely! Dr. K is one of the most kind and considerate professors I have ever had, and does a great job of teaching this course. You really learn a lot in such a short period of time.",
                "Absolutely. Whether you are looking to fulfill the language requirement with the ASL track, or are interested in getting an introduction to ASL for practical use, this class is perfect. There are brief assignments due each day of the week, but they are very purposeful and interesting, never just busy work. I would recommend this course to any Yale student. In addition to learning ASL, I am SO glad I now know so much more about the Deaf community so I can be more understanding and respectful of any Deaf individuals I meet. I could not recommend this class more.",
