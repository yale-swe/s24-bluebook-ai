It also gave me an insight into how to examine sounds linguistically.",

                "I wish we had gone through more difficult and complicated datasets in class. The practice we did in class was usually significantly easier than the psets.",
                "The class is really flexible. Professor Natalie is very understanding and gives you basically infinite time to complete each pset. This class is designed to maximize the enjoyability of the learning experience and minimize pressure, and it's really helpful.\r\n\r\nHowever, the final project and the language squibs not being regularly checked creates no incentive for us to do anything during the semester. It would be better if the weekly reports can be mandatory.",
                "Strengths: highly structured but not too demanding of a workload\r\nWeaknesses: I personally have a harder time in flipped classroom courses and would prefer introductions to subjects by the professor themselves first. However this course was suited well to flipped classroom and was not as stressful as other flipped classroom environments I have been in.",
                "Strengths: reasonable workload, good in-class handouts, Natalie and Sammy are so so lovely. Weaknesses: sometimes it felt like we were going over the same material for a little too long, didnt get to Optimality Theory, which I was looking forward to",
                "Weakness = final paper scheduling is quite rushed. \r\nStrength = lots of help through the course.",
                "This course is really well structured in that there is an overarching project you are working on and problem sets that help you figure out how to approach the problem set.  Lecture was always helpful to run through examples of the ideas present in the problem set, and it is always well taught and goes through a variety of examples.  I do think the flipped classroom approach sometimes has its limits, especially with some of the more complicated concepts that we had to tackle, but they usually did a good job going through the ideas in class by examples so it almost always worked out.",
                "I really like how we're given problems to solve during the class, because it helps with the psets a lot. I wish there was a bit more lecture-style teaching just laying out the basics, to give us a refresher on the terminology in the textbook readings. The language sketch is a very cool project and allows students to take things in different directions based on their interests.",
                "Strengths: extremely engaging, well-presented course material, office hours, great feedback from TA\r\nWeaknesses: if any, professor disorganization (though this, apart from on one frustrating occasion during finals week, did not significantly impact the course). grading system was sometimes frustrating, but written feedback was good and the system did at least help me get over some of my perfectionism, which actually ended up making the class less stressful (i.e. if you did everything correctly, you were given a 90%; nondescript \"above and beyond\" points were hard to earn/there were no real \"guidelines\" for earning them, and trying purposefully to earn them was both often unsuccessful did not always help with my learning)",
                "This was a very well-organized course that covered a good amount of material. At times, it was hard to connect the reading to the problem sets in class (and Oden was not very easy to navigate) so I think having some sort of cumulative resource available for when students are working on the homework would be very helpful."

                "As a more syntax-heavy person, I can't say I enjoyed this class maximally. However, it gives a really nice taste of phonology and linguistics in general. You have no choice as a ling major :) For non-ling majors, do take it if you want to take a serious look at something you may take for granted.",
                "I would recommend this course as someone who had never taken a linguistics course but found the subject of linguistics to be very intriguing and interesting. I had no idea what phonology was, but found that Prof Weber is highly engaging and made class time very enjoyable. I found that I was very interested in the class and would invest a lot of time in the class. \r\ntldr, Would recommend this class for someone looking to see if they truly linguistics but may not want a broad overview class such as Intro to Linguistics",
