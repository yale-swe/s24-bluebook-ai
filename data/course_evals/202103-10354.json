                "I thoroughly enjoyed reading the books and I think I have now scratched the surface on reading about colonialism. The novels, poems, and plays selected by Sunny were all terrific choices that melded beautifully with one another.",

                "The class taught me to deconstruct how we understand literature and English entirely.  It was a reminder that so much of our curriculum and culture is the product of an establishment that tends to either minimize or ignore minority voices.  I learned to immerse myself in so many challenging works that revealed the heartbreaking consequences of colonialism and capitalism, but just as often kept the door open for hope and healing."

                "When things got really busy in the middle of the semester I semester I struggled to do the readings things and really think about them but when I did have time to delve deeper into the readings they were really lovely I especially liked the short stories and poems that is poems that professor xiang chose. It was good at first when the reading was less but I think for me a grain of wheat would have been better if it came a little later when id have more time to really read it.",
                "Often, I didn't see the connecting thread between this class and the texts we read. Every text seemed disparate (which is great for variety) but even during our discussions, there wasn't much talk about how these texts were related to one another or how they were chosen. They seemed to have just been chosen to fit this \"worldly\" narrative. I suppose the variety of texts was both the strength and weakness of this class.",
                "Strengths: kind, engaging, and supportive instructor. I loved that we had a collective participation grade. Weaknesses: There is A LOT of reading and I wish students were given more specific prompts/directions for the essay assignments.",
                "Our class discussions were wonderful. Professor Xiang came up with engaging questions for every work and the class was lively, engaging, and fun. I think the only change I would make would be to reduce the amount of texts, especially the poems and shorter prose, since we rarely got to discuss everything and it would be more worthwhile to focus on a smaller amount of texts.",
                "I liked the class. The discussion post every week on top of all the readings somehow felt onerous but other than that the workload was not too bad- a TON of reading but that was expected. I also appreciated how Sunny was quick to adjust for circumstances and she is very flexible if you communicate in advance. The project at the end was a total blast and extremely fun to do in the last couple of weeks. I don't think there's much room for improvement except that it would be great to have written feedback on the second paper, but I might be the only one who feels that way. The readings in the class are also all quite devastating and brutal. I think the arc of the class covers a lot of interesting work, so I don't think we're overly focused on one particular kind of brutality. However I would not be opposed to some work that is more lighthearted.",
                "I wish Professor Sunny had allowed for the discussions to be a little less facilitated by her. There were times where I felt conversation would've been more productive if the conversations were more student-led. However, most of the novels were really interesting.",
                "Very wide span of literature was very engaging. While the writing required was a bit more demanding, I think in the long run that will work to my advantage. I don't think it had any major weakenesses.",
                "I loved this course!  Coming from a previous year in which I had studied mostly canonical works, this class really helped me re-approach the world of literature.  It was a true joy to sit in every seminar and to sit with ways of thinking that I had never thought possible.  Everyone had something insightful to say; Professor Xiang created a safe, collaborative space for all of us."

                "Yes especially if you are considering the English major. I really appreciate that professor Sunny does not provide really nitty gritty feedback on essays check she gives more holistic feedback feedback that helps you think about the essay overall and more questions about it Rather than tearing apart little details little details. She is also just a delightful person and I love her icebreakers and also our  Class just was really cool so I love them.. Professor Sunny also always brought brought interesting questions questions to class and and made us really think about the texts I liked her ERM perspective",
                "As far as English courses go, this one pales in comparison to other offerings. However, it is one of the required courses for English majors, and it wasn't too bad with that in mind. This class wasn't inherently interesting though, and felt that the variety of texts  and lack of connection between the texts  made for an unfulfilling education about any of these narratives. Unfortunately, there was no time to get in-depth about each culture of the \"world\" literature so if you are looking for that, this is not the course for you.",
                "Yes! But keep in mind that the reading material can be traumatic and extremely difficult to emotionally process.",
                "This course is wonderful and I would highly recommend it. The texts are engaging and I had never read any of them before, which is often not the case in other intro English courses. Professor Xiang is brilliant and leads a great discussion.",
                "Yes! If you're very interested in colonialism and imperialism through literature, this is an incredible introduction from an experienced and thoughtful teacher. The students in the class my semester were also brilliant and everyone seemed to read every single piece. You have to do the work in order to do well, but it is very straightforward.",
                "I would recommend it if you are unfamiliar with \"ethnic literature\" or post-colonial lit as a genre. However, I don't think I learned anything particularly new from this course, just more of what I already knew myself to be interested in.",
                "If it is taught by Prof. Xiang, definitely!",
                "Yes, I think it exposes students to a lot of different cultures and literature that isn't necessarily represented in Western socities. It is a fairly demanding class, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend to those looking for an easy writing class.",
                "Yes!  Having this class opens so much of your perspective.  Every class, we've come up with more mind-blowing ideas and connections than you can count.  I am so grateful I took this course--you leave with such a deeper appreciation for stories and the voices that share them.  Our readings this semester showed me how to treat every text--every work of language and art--with grace and humility."
