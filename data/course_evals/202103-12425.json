                "Strengths: interesting material, Professor cared about students\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: one of the most disorganized professors I have ever had. I felt like we could have covered so much more content if the class had been better planned out and he was able to answer questions more concisely or direct people to other resources. There were multiple times every class period during which I would zone out because professor was going down a rabbit hole answering questions for other students that were not super relevant.",
                "absolutely terrible. very unclear lectures, unclear office hours, unclear questions, unclear guidelines, unclear problem sets\r\n\r\nplease make lectures recorded",
                "Good amount of work, problem sets and quizzes were not overbearing, responsive professor/TAs",
                "Strenghts: I thought the psets were generally well-designed. They gave me an opportunity to practice more advanced R coding and I liked that they were based on published research. The slides and handouts were also great and super clear.\r\nWeaknesses: the class is a lot more work than I imagined with 6 psets, 6 quizzes, midterm, final, and an empirical project. We were promised alternating psets/quizzes each week but for the first half of the semester there would be a pset AND a quiz almost every week. I also feel like the instructions for the empirical project were too broad for us to actually learn much from it. At this stage of learning and with a tight time/word limit, I would've preferred a more narrowly defined project that allowed us to focus more on econometrics methods rather than finding and cleaning data. It was also sometimes unclear how the section materials related to the lectures, but the actual section content was super well-explained. Some questions on Ed were also left unanswered.",
                "Very boring, and pretty uninteresting material. Taught in a structured manner with labs though.",
                "Strengths: Problem sets, quizzes and exams are fair and follow the material we learn in class. Class content draws from real papers so that we can see the real world applications of the methods we learn. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures sometimes feel unclear and too dense with notation. Lectures also move fast and are not always comprehensive. I would've preferred that new concepts were introduced via the whiteboard so that it's easier to follow.",
                "Good problem sets, but the lectures are pretty dry",
                "Strengths - good TA Weaknesses - very hard to follow because of the structure of the class",
                "The instructor was excellent and did a great job of walking us through each topic using examples. The course can be dry at times, but is relatively easy to follow and it is well-taught.",
                "Content is very fast; could have more interactive assessments.",
                "I personally found the class very hard to follow. The content was all over the place, and the lack of textbook or supported readings meant that if we were confused there weren't many other resources to turn to for information. While I appreciated the labs and the example studies used to support the learning, I wish we went through some of the more theoretical content more slowly, as I feel like we glanced over some of the most important content very quickly.",
                "Strengths: psets are good practice for the material, the number of assignments (psets and quizzes) meant it is hard to get behind, the applications in R were helpful for visualizing material that is sometimes quite theoretical\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the second half of the course didn't seem as organized and got a lot more theoretical than the first half, so more applications and demonstrations would have been helpful to see how these things actually work; sometimes the prof's explanations of the more theoretical side sort of went down a rabbit hole of statistical notation and were difficult to follow. the number of assignments was at times a bit overwhelming, but generally manageable."

                "No, I do not recommend this course, especially if you want to learn actual econometrics. I highly suggest you take courses in the Statistics department first, as they are better facilitated towards student learning of stats methods, coding, and the math required.",
                "Gives a good insight into econometrics, further than ECON 117",

                "It depends. I would recommend this course to economics majors. The class provides a deeper dive into the econometrics concepts learned from 117, and the end-of-semester project was a good way to apply the econometrics methods taught in the class. The material is useful for anyone interested in economics research and more quantitative work in economics. I would also recommend this class to students who want to gain more experience in R.",

If you're interested in the more theoretical parts with fewer applications in R, then the second half will also be interesting to you. I personally enjoyed the course up to around midterm when it got a bit too theoretical for me with fewer applications."
