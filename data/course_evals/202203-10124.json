                "Learned a LOT about congenital heart disorders, but perhaps more pressingly, there were several experimental and research processes he taught us which are both not commonly known and which are important for any researcher to learn. Nondimensionalization comes to mind as a pragmatic tactic that genuinely simplifies studies, and the overall approach of the class to addressing questions and proposing novel solutions is both refreshing and highly useful.",
                "Gained a breadth of knowledge regarding cell sourcing, congenital heart diseases, immunology, and biomedical practices.",
                "Cardiovascular heart disorders, treatment, history of it, procedures, etc. For the first half, you just listen to him lecture and the second half you have two weeks to come up with a project with a group. Project is very flexible.",

                "A broad overview of the biological and biomechanical processes at play during the progression of congenital heart disease.",
                "Such a wide range of knowledge in biomedical engineering, specifically congenital heart defects and graft development. The end of semester project was a fantastic challenge in synthesizing all the little individual things you learn and adding your own research to create something new. It's a really refreshing and explorative way to learn science, I highly recommend this class."

                "The strength was the modularity of the course to fit student interests.",
                "Prof. Humphrey is an incredible teacher and his teaching is the real strength of the course. The information was insightfully delivered, especially considering the vast range of student disciplines in the classroom, and problem sets were very manageable and all oriented around gaining practice in critical (and practice-needed) skills.\r\n\r\nBecause the course is problem-solution-based, it often felt to us that the problem (an open question with incredibly serious contexts and consequences) was simply too big to address as newcomers to the field. We could suggest solutions, but without benchtop resources, everything seemed hypothetical and unsubstantiated, especially in contrast to the many trials and failures we learned about in class. Having more concrete expectations and models for the final project, and for our learning goals in the class in general, would be much appreciated.",
                "Course material was wonderful and everything on the syllabus was well taught. However, the curation of the material was definitely very unique so you have to learn in directly from the professor and there is no other place to refer to the set of content as a whole.",
                "Strengths: interesting and didn't need a background in biology (he went over it). \r\nWeakness: math was more difficult than expected. final project was slightly rushed but turned out fine",
                "The course was very engaging and informative. It was laid out very well and was open to students needs for learning.",
                "The fluidity and customizability of this course made for a uniquely interesting and relevant semester. All things considered, I enjoyed the content and pacing of the course, with the only notable exception being the somewhat jarring transition from traditional lecture to group-led discussion, as well as some confusion with the specifics of the final deliverables.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Humphrey is a genius and a fantastic lecturer. The material is very engaging and rewarding. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Advertised as a team work based class but a very small portion of the final grade depends on the team based project. A bit unorganized at the end."
