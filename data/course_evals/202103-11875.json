Peer tutors were amazing and there's a ton of support for student learning in this course - which is awesome. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not really any I can think of. It's a pretty standard course.",
                "This course has a really good support system, with so many professors and office hours and Peer Tutoring hours. One weakness of the course would probably be that each class was different, so some classes would fall behind I think. It all felt so rushed, but I don't know how to improve that.",
                "Weaknesses: it varies depending on the section. The explores do not help and lectures move fast\r\nStrengths: learn math \r\nImprovement: I would change the explores to due after math class and make it a recap of the lecture with some practice problems rather than it being a preview of the lecture.",
                "This course was pretty average. The strengths definitely lie in the peer tutors. The weaknesses would be that the teachers are so obviously brilliant but the knowledge doesnt necessarily trickle down effectively.",
                "Strength - very consistent work/problem sets, never any confusion about what you have to do for assignments.",

                "no noticeable strengths or weaknesses",
                "I had a very hard time learning the material in class. Most of what I learned came from the text book (which I spent HOURS AND HOURS reading), and peer tutoring which I tried to go to every day (shout out to Billy and Erica THEY WERE THE BEST)!! At the beginning I did not get a lot out of class, but later lessons got better and better. Especially as lessons became more interactive and we had more time for group work I started to really enjoying class and learning a lot!",
                "Many of the students in the class had already learned all the topics in high school, while many others were learning concepts for the first time. This made the class dynamic more difficult for all students as some easily understood topics in class and others were lost.",
                "Math 115 is a very well organized course and I felt that all resources provided actually helped me to better understand the material. The problem sets and explorations were helpful and useful aspects of the course. Professor Barnes, to whose office hours I went to, as they fitted well my schedule, is also a major strength of the course as he is very approachable and it is obvious that he is an expert in calculus but also loves it and thus could explain well and in an engaging way any questions I asked him. Although review sessions were a smart idea, only one conducted by Professor Diethorn was useful. She summarized the whole syllabus for the midterm in 2 hours and that is exactly what somebody can expect at a helpful review session. All other review sessions were conducted at a slower and less engaging pace. To solve this issue, all review sessions could be predominantly theoretical. After the theory would be reviewed then separate practice sessions could be conducted, if necessary."
