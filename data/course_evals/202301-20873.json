                "A great survey of the history of Europe during the High Middle Ages. Professor Fancy asks his students to consider what it means to label something as \"medieval\" and to consider what separates the peoples of the 14th century from those of today. In terms of specific movements and events, we learned about political tensions between the Catholic Church and medieval monarchs, the investiture controversy, the Renaissance of the 12th century, the rise of Gothic Art, the Black Death, the Papal Schism, the Hundred Years War, and finally, the movement towards the Renaissance of the 15th-16th centuries. In section, we were expected to read many primary sources, major medieval works like the Lais of Marie de France, the Letters of Peter Abelard and Helose, etc.",

                "I learned about European political history and conflict of 1000-1500, but also a lot about social organization and religion. I developed a much greater understanding of life during this period and how it connects to establishments that have persisted to modern day.",
                "I expanded my knowledge of medieval Europe, and also learned much about how this period is connected to the past, as well as how it can be placed within the context of the broader world.",

                "Fancy does an incredible job at making this course both accessible, intellectually invigorating, and an exciting experience for everyone. His genuine care for his students' progress is evident through the frequent office hours he holds for his students, and in the classroom, his enthusiasm for the course material brings out the complexity and beauty of the Medieval world. I really enjoyed being able to share my thoughts in lecture, and Fancy tries to make sure that students are able to share their interpretations of certain historical quotes and ideas. It was also very interesting to make connections between medieval questions of ethics and those of modern day society, and Fancy is not afraid to be blunt with his opinions and his explanations.",
                "great professor and TA",
                "This is the best course I have taken at Yale in my 3 years here. I am a STEM student but was completely engrossed in this course and how it was taught. This is much different than other history courses I have taken in the past where you don't have to focus on every single date and every single person mentioned rather you are taught about the underlying concepts that are intertwined with the figures and events. Another difference about this course is that it's not linear. You are going back and forth throughout the time period, which seems like it would be confusing but helps you make sense of everything much easier. Professor Fancy is a very thorough, efficient, kind, and funny lecturer and my TA Constantin was extremely kind, helpful and patient when it came to discussion sections and assignments. The assignments themselves aren't too demanding either, yet they still are able to be thought-provoking and useful. When it comes time for the exams, I don't feel like I have to study to memorize much because you really learn the material the way it's taught in lecture and in the discussion sections. Also, I am not the best at writing historical or literary papers but my TA was extremely helpful with feedback and I feel like they helped me understand the concepts much more rather than simply regurgitating.",
                "Really solid lecturing and discussions. I think a bit more emphasize on dates though make might things more grounded.",
                "This is a truly great course",
                "Lectures were very good and super interesting. I also really enjoyed section, I think the reading were interesting but I would have appreciated more in class engagement with the primary readings.",
                "I wish this course had given us midterm feedback/grades at the midterm. The grading was quite harsh (which is good for learning) but it made it difficult to gage how well we were doing.",
                "The lectures are presented like essays, and are incredibly organized and purposeful. The readings are not stressed, but include a balance of textbook and very engaging primary sources. Section was super interesting and fun and gave an opportunity to delve into the material from a more personal lens.",
                "Strengths: Great teaching, great teaching fellows, and great support for people of all levels of comfort with history in general and medieval history in particular. I would highly recommend this to anyone just starting out in history or just interested in the topic, from any background.\r\nWeaknesses: If people are looking for a very deep dive into medieval history and the period in question, this probably isn't the best type of course for them. The course took a lot of time to focus on methods of doing history and thinking about broader questions, which was definitely a good thing, but it often came at the cost of time to spend going deeper into key detailed chains of events. There were many times in the class where I didn't feel like I was gaining more than a cursory idea of the period in question.",
                "Both the lectures and sections were incredibly engaging and I feel like I was able to grasp the big ideas really well. \r\n\r\nBecause the course was followed thematically, rather than chronologically, certain specific concepts could be hard to remember or understand.",
                "Loved this course and didn't see any glaring weaknesses.",
                "The lecturer was fabulous.",
                "Professor Fancy is an unbelievable lecturer who truly engages with students, asks questions, close reads texts in class, and drives the course forward. I enjoyed writing the two required papers and the prompts are broad enough to warrant garnering your own research. The readings are very manageable and supplemental section texts help further explore the topic week by week. The weekly assignments are a good commitment mechanism and assist your progress; however, the Friday due date does require you to be more organised. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the course.",
                "Lectures were compelling and interesting. However, the approach of each lecture as a discrete unit with its own thesis detracted from a sense of chronologic continuity which I had hoped to gain.  I enjoyed that section focused on analyzing primary sources and didn't feel repetitive with lecture. Readings were sometimes a bit long and decreased engagement.",
                "Readings are insanely boring.",
                "Strengths: The course was very engaging and lectures were always well prepared\r\nWeaknesses: There should be more material that can be used to review lectures and study for exams",
                "One strength of this course were the readings for section as they expanded more on the topics from lectures. \r\nOne weakness of this course were the slides from lecture being posted a bit after the actual lecture. It would be better to post the slides right before or right after class.",
                "strengths:\r\n- the TAs were really good and very helpful\r\n- course structure: assignments were spread out so not too stressful to complete\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- lecture structure: lectures were not structured in a clear way. instead of being an interactive/engaging lecture it was just a very long prewritten speech. the material was not conveyed in an understandable way. it was more like instead of learning actual facts about the middle ages we were told random anecdotes about figures in history. instead of it being a history class that you learn about real events that, it just felt like it was a class about what the medieval ages means to you. if you missed writing down one thing the professor said you were at risk for not being able to complete the assignments. also, lectures followed a loose chronological order so it was hard to keep track of when and in what years certain things happened. \r\n- exams were very difficult and essay questions were not really connected to what we had learned or discussed",
                "The lectures are incredibly engaging and fun, but the course feels like it lacks an overall direction. Themes run throughout the class but the period is so long that lectures can't really go in depth about too much.",
                "Strengths: entertaining lectures, interesting content\r\nWeaknesses: the entire class is a series of simplistic narratives about history that doesn't do justice to how complicated history actually is"

                "Please take this course!!!! Fancy is one of the best professors that I have had at Yale so far, and the genuine care he has for his students makes this class truly a wonderful experience. Sure it's the history of Medieval Europe, but that's exactly why you should take this course. The issue with modern day society is that we see the Middle Ages as a period of ignorance, cynicism, disease, and blunt warfare. Yet, what Fancy will teach you is that the Middle Ages were far more complex than think. The issues that plagued medieval historians and leaders are practically the same as the ones we see today. The only difference separating us from the medieval is our notion that we are \"modern.\"",
                "absolutely! super good class!",

If you have a free slot in your schedule, you should take this course. It's not overbearing with work like some Humanities courses and the topics are actually interesting, and if you don't think they will be then they are made to be interesting regardless.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Fancy is so engaging and interesting, this course will definitely change the way you look at history in general, not just mediaeval ages and is genuinely so good. Can't recommend it enough!",
                "Yes! Regardless of background, too. Be a bit comfortable writing and youll be in a solid place.",
                "Yes!",
                "In a heartbeat. To any student, not just history majors",
                "Yes Professor Fancy is a great lecturer! I made the mistake of not taking a class with him until my senior spring. If I had taken this class before I would have made sure to try to get into more of his classes.",
                "Yes! I think Professor Fancy is a very engaging lecturer with insightful points!",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Birth of Europe was my favorite class I have taken so far at Yale. Professor Fancy is an amazing lecturer and the material is really fascinating. Middle Ages history is so culturally relevant, and Professor Fancy focused on relearning the concept of \"medieval\" through a well-rounded, comprehensive syllabus.",
                "Great lectures, great teaching fellows, and great support for people of all levels of comfort with history in general and medieval history in particular. I would highly recommend this to anyone just starting out in history or just interested in the topic, from any background. The class especially emphasizes primary source analysis and thinking critically about historical narratives. It is both an introduction to medieval history and an introduction to thinking about history in general. The lectures were excellent and engaging, and office hours were made available and encouraged throughout the semester.",
                "Definitely! It is a great history lecture that will challenge you intellectually, while not leaving you feel over-worked (especially if youre not a history major).",
                "Yes, I took it as my first history course at Yale and really loved it. Was a lecture of perfect size because the professor could still interact with the students and sometimes would hot call students.",
                "Yes. Professor Fancy was an A-grade teacher. Each class was like a performance, and the history itself was riveting. I would recommend this course to anyone.",
                "I would thoroughly recommend that every History major take this course. It shines an interesting light on a historical period that's often overlooked or perceived as boring.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes! Professor Fancy is compelling and entertaining. If, like me, you are coming into the class with a very limited understanding of the middle ages, then you will gain a lot from the course. It is great to explore niches in history which are less popular! The assignments are interesting but not too challenging.",
                "Yes. Lectures are excellent. Workload is not too high. Lots of interesting questions raised.",
                "Yes, Professor Fancy's class was always engaging and medieval Europe is an important era in History.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone wishing to improve their historical writing skills.",
                "This is a great course, especially if you have any interest in the Middle Ages.",
                "i thought this would be a cool and interesting class that i could actually enjoy. ended up being a big time suck. the essays and readings for discussion were fine, but the exams caused me more stress than my CS exams. thee questions were so random and far off from what wee'd learned. they were so hard to study for because the class wasn't very fact based, it was more anthropological and anecdotal than actually historical. i would recommend finding a different class if you're interested in the middle ages.",
                "YES so interesting best lectures and prof Fancy is incredible person to meet and learn from",
                "I'm not sure. It really depends on your preferences: I know that a lot of people like this class, but it was honestly my least favorite history class I've taken at Yale. The biggest issue is that the professor prioritizes entertainment ahead of literally everything else, including historical accuracy and nuance. Instead of relating the actual complexities of the past, he dumbs everything down to fit into lazy narratives that he can tell with dramatic flair. For example, I once heard him tell a student after class that he purposely left out information about St. Francis in order to fit his narrative betterbut his job shouldn't be to sell us on one particular narrative, it should be to tell us all the possible narratives and give us the tools we need to sort through them and make sense of how they relate to one another. You can also tell that he has a bit of an overinflated ego, which makes his lectures even more grating. That's not to say that there's nothing good about the course: the lectures were certainly entertaining (although cringy), the workload of the course was reasonable, and the grading seemed mostly fair, although the feedback on essays and exams was not very good. So it really depends on what you're looking for in a class. If you want to actually learn history, this class might not be for you, but if you want a relatively easy and sorta fun class and you're willing to look past the professor's cringe-inducing style, then go for it."
