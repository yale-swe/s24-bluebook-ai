While taking the course, I learned and read a lot of material that broadened my knowledge and formed my beliefs of Indigenous Politics. Most of the readings were very insightful and presented perspectives and information that were new.",

                "I learned so much from this class. We looked at key thinkers in decolonial studies and covered many aspects of Indigenous people's relationship to the settler state  the ongoing structure of colonialism and dispossession, social/human geographies, biopolitics, infrastructures, water politics, gendered violence, resurgence and hopes for the future.",
                "I learned central theory to Indigenous studies including discussing settler colonialism, difference of indigeneity, slow violence, breath and air, feminism, infrastructure, and biopolitics. I have learnt so much from this semester also about the overlaps of Indigenous Studies and Black Studies and other forms of solidarities. I also enjoyed how we discussed not just Indigenous struggles of North America but also in the Pacific, Oceania, and Palestine."

It is well-structured, thorough, thought-provoking, open to disagreement and discussion, and insightfully, powerfully and compassionately delivered.",

                "Professor Hobart is an amazing professor. She was incredibly understanding of her students and was very thoughtful about the questions that she posed for discussion. I also appreciated the time that she took to explain the context for historical events and for theory, allowing me to get a better grasp of the content. Additionally, the readings and the content we had in class was all purposefully picked by Professor Hobart."
