The course was incredibly strong in generating content and giving feedback on works in progress in the fall. In the spring, though, there was comparatively less to do. I enjoyed when we used the course time to analyze existing films and increase our shared cinema vocabulary.",

                "Strengths- small class size allows for individual attention, but also great class collaboration.  The course is super engaging and fun.  The class is set up in a way that we are constantly thinking about (and improving) our senior projects.  \r\n\r\nweaknesses- none, it was sometimes difficult over zoom but overall great."
