                "Thanks to Prof. Alexandrov's Spanish for Heritage Speakers courses (I & II), I am closer to fluency than at any other point in my life. I feel confident that I could be dropped into any Spanish-speaking country and be comfortable in my ability to navigate my way around, make new acquaintances, and be productive. I can now comfortably read and write in Spanish, as well as maintain long and complex discussions with others in person and over the phone. Listening to music and watching movies in Spanish is not only more enjoyable, but something I can understand with greater competency.",

                "It's hard to say how this course could be improved. The two biggest problems I noticed in the course were student attendance and full group engagement (though small group engagement was very good). The inconsistent student attendance was confusing to me considering that each day the lessons we coveredbe them literature or grammarled directly into the next days' lessons. The few times I had to miss class across both semesters, it took a work on my part to catch up to the next days lesson.\r\n\r\nThe class is almost entirely a positive experience in my opinion. Prof. Alexandrov's direct approach, array of subject matter and examples, and interactive format created an environment where the teaching was very effective. We bounced between grammar lessons, news articles, films, and a book. All of these were rounded out with regular writing assignments, some formal and some informal. The result was a very effective method of learning Spanish, and one that is both lasting and sets a foundation for continued growth.",
                "Biggest strength students being comfortable to converse with each other. I appreciated the non judgmental environment. I would say the only weakness was that the workload could get overwhelming.",
                "Very tight knit class with engaging conversations and the environment always felt safe and welcoming. I honestly can't think of any improvements. There was however a ton of homework for this course.",
                "Such a pleasant experience for all students, only improvement could be to have more conversations face to face.",
                "Range of topics, class activities, and projects",
                "Having never taken a heritage class before and having a group of classmates that did not make me feel embarrassed about my Spanish, this class was more than just a place for learningit was a safe space for me. One strength of the course is the incredible warmth of Professor Alexandrov, who pushes us to better ourselves in Spanish while covering important topics such as racism, environmentalism, and Covid19. After taking this course, I feel that I have improved in my Spanish ability in addition to my knowledge about Latin America, which I learned from first-hand experiences from my peers themselves. \r\nFor this class to function, all students must be comfortable speaking to their peers in Spanish without embarrassment or fearthis is one thing that is especially difficult for many still-learning heritage speakers. Nevertheless, it is much easier to speak to someone who you may see as a friend instead of a classmate. One weakness of the course is that if the natural dynamic of the class is not already extroverted enough to get students talking freely with each other, conversations are stale and do not bode well to learning. I would recommend spending a large amount of time at the beginning of the semester doing randomized partner to partner icebreaker activities/prompting conversations where the students need to learn things about each other, because it will facilitate closeness and greatly improve the functionality of the class."

She understands how language operates, how learning a language operates, and what the regular pitfalls are from people trying to learn a new language. If you have a connection to the Spanish languageespecially a cultural oneand you're not fluent, you should absolutely take this class. I cannot recommend it enough.",
                "Yes, definitely. It was the first Spanish class I truly felt improved my Spanish abilities.",
                "For sure. One of the best languages classes I have ever taken and one of the best professors.",
                "I would 100% recommend.",
                "Yes! Great classroom environment and community class",
                "ABSOLUTELY! You must take this class if you genuinely want to learn more Spanish, expand your vocabulary, and generally feel more confident/comfortable with the language. It's definitely a higher workload but it's also a high reward! While there are often 1-2 things assigned for each of the 3 classes a week, it is homework that ultimately helps propel your Spanish and is usually catered to you/your classmates' weaknesses.",
                "Yes!!!!!!!!!!!! Please take this course, and please make efforts to be active within the seminar setting. If you are unsure about your Spanish abilities going into the course, as long as you thoroughly complete the workload and spend a little time practicing, you will be confident in your abilities leaving the course. I also strongly urge the Spanish department to create an L5 heritage course. My peers and I see a large need (and gap!) for upper-level heritage courses. As taken in an informal student-led poll on the last day of class, we love this class so much that we would most definitely take an L5 heritage course with Alexandrov."
