                "I learned about theory in detail from several of the foundational authors of sociological theory. I developed skills on how to closely read difficult texts from different time periods. I gained insight on how these texts apply to modern contexts.",
                "This course gave me a comprehensive knowledge of the major social theorists from Hobbes Locke and Rousseau through Marx and Weber and into the late 20th century. I learned to critically evaluate how we conceive of societies, the assumptions we make about their emergence, and the methods used by people to elaborate ideas concerning how people organize themselves and each other.",

                "Strengths: interesting readings, lecture outlines were very helpful, and professor was engaging\r\nWeaknesses: grading for the papers consisted of whether or not you hit all the key points, which students were not aware of before submitting the midterm paper.",
                "strength: very structured\r\nweakness: not engaging at all - straight lecture with no engagement",
                "Lectures are detailed but I wished that there were clearer expectations or guidelines for the midterm and final essays. It felt like a lot was expected in the essays and lecture notes importance was understated for the midterm paper.",
                "The main strength of this course was how the professor had a straightforward organization and approach to his lectures which makes note taking and understanding the readings very easy to follow. I think this course could be improved with more tips on how to approach these difficult texts at the onset.",
                "The content was amazing and I really enjoyed myself. I found that the essays and the weekly reading responses were pretty well organized\r\nOne downside of the class was that it was unclear what the essays were supposed to discuss. While we were given prompts, they were very broad and were not focused, meaning that you could feasibly write anything. However, I found that the professor expected certain arguments or comments to be made, but did not inform the class what he wanted to see, so many people ended up being conflicted between restating the course content and coming up with their own ideas about the texts we read. Multiple students I spoke with agree that a rubric explaining what we are graded on would be very helpful, because then it would be possible to answer all the professor's prompt questions fully in the way he expects while also coming up with our own interpretations and analyses.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- TA\r\n- Discussion sections\r\n- Sociologists chosen\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The lecture wasn't engaging \r\n- No participation time in lecture",
                "The selections of readings were enjoyable and informative, and the lecture notes helped to fill any gaps and expand on ideas drawn out in the readings."

Papers were a little stressful at times, especially the midterm paper. Overall, lectures were engaging because they served as a check of your own understanding of the readings.",
                "no unless it is for your major",

                "I recommend this course to anyone interested in the history of ideas and the theoretical works of literature that have prefaced modern sociology and the ways we think about societies. I think it is a cool class and enjoyed the content",
