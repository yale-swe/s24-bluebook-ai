                "Prof breaker needs to go! Siggy should have taught the entire course.",
                "The class has a fairly intimidating grading scheme, because your only grade is what you get on exams, and there are 4 exams throughout the semester, each worth 25% of your grade. I wish the class had given us homework assignments, because I don't know if all of the hours of studying and practice I put into the class will be reflected in my grade. Also, not having homework assignments made it difficult to prepare for exams, and I was more stressed out for these exams than tests I'd taken in any other class, simply because I didn't know what to expect.",
                "Strengths \r\n- I like how it's split into 2 halves with 2 different professors because it keeps the class from getting stagnant \r\n- non cumulative exams alleviate a lot of the stress from this very memorization-heavy class\r\n- I like the connections to real life\/medical situations \r\n\r\nWeaknesses \r\n- I really would have appreciated PSETs or more practice problems to better keep up with the class and prepare for exams...having no PSETs made it a lower workload class generally, but a lot of time\/studying\/stress right before exams",
                "I really disliked how our entire grade was based on midterms. Would also an ed discussion page.",
                "The first half of the class was very well organized by Prof. Nachtergaele and it felt easy to make connections across different concepts. However, the second half with metabolism was difficult to follow and see how the topics were connected based on the order that they were taught in.",
                "I really like the structure of this class: 4 non-cumulative exams (with helpful practice exams posted before each exam), no psets, no final. This structure makes a traditionally very stressful class much more straightforward and approachable. The first exam was similar to Biol 101, the second exam required some memorization, and the third and fourth exam were more conceptual and required an understanding of why certain things happen. I appreciated that tests were mostly conceptual and did not require knowledge of the names of certain enzymes or intermediates but rather an understanding of how they work.",
                "You definitely learn a lot from this class, and the workload is pretty light (other than exam weeks). The one weakness is that the two professors have pretty different teaching styles which makes the switch from one to another a little bit annoying. Also, the material increases in difficulty quite a lot after the second midterm.",
                "The strengths - it's nice to have just the midterms as the only grades. Lectures were in general helpful, though in the second part of the course, they sometimes went quickly\/were confusing. \r\n\r\nOne tough thing was that the course felt like it did a 180 at the midpoint, not only because the professor changed, but because it felt like we were suddenly being asked to internalize and understand a much, much larger\/more complicated scope of material in the same time frames.",
                "The first half with Professor Nachtergaele is well organized and a good overview of topics. The first two exams felt fair and I really appreciated Siggy's pep talk about success and failure and her path to STEM. Her office hours were also great and welcoming. \r\n\r\nThe second half with Professor Breaker had very poorly organized lecture slides. It was hard to recognize how disorganized the slides were at first because of how little I understood during the lecture- it was only when I went back to teach myself all the content that I could see that the topics didn't follow a logical progression. Breaker repeatedly says he is very enthusiastic and that's why he gets off topic- just don't include tangents and *head explode emoji TMI* slides! It's not cool or interesting when there's such a crushing amount of information to learn. The fact that there's only 4 exams and no other assignments makes it difficult to come back from doing poorly on an exam. Even though we were responsible for knowing the intimate details of metabolic pathways and arrow pushing reaction mechanisms, the Breaker exams seemed to test more on chemistry concepts that he had only touched on momentarily. The tests do not reflect student learning and effort very well.",
                "Very fast paced class. Not having HW was challenging, i think Psets would help students gain feedback before exams",
                "The course was very well taught. However, I feel that it would have been beneficial to give students more practice problems before exams.",
                "Breaker is a wonderful lecturer and makes the class fairly engaging. The course is taught in a way that makes the material manageable and well designed for student success. In particular, administrating 4 midterms instead of cumulative exams allows students to focus on key concepts instead of cramming detailed information. The main weakness of the course is that the time-allocation in lectures is often questionable. For example, lectures will go into great detail for one reaction, but then gloss over steps in key pathways.",
                "The course was a low workload course, which was helpful, but it meant that all of the grade was based on four exams. The structure of the exams was good in that each was non-cumulative and there wasn't a final, however it was intense to not have any other assignments to gauge your understanding of the material.",
                "Wasn't always clear what was the most important thing to understand from the lectures.\r\nThe first half of the course was taught quite well organized, and the second half was also interesting but perhaps had too many tangents and less organization.",
                "First half of the course was organized and relatively straightforward. Second half it was a huge challenge to determine what information was relevant and what wasn't, especially considering Professor Breaker consistently urged us \"not to try to memorize everything\" yet created tests where exactly that was needed.",
                "I thought the lectures were engaging and well organized. I would have liked some problem sets or other assignments to guide us in exam preparation; the format of having 4 exams each worth 25% of our grade was a bit stressful.",
                "strengths: professor naghtergale taught well and had clear and concise slides\r\nweaknesses: professor breaker dragged on in his slides and did not make it very clear what we did and did not need to know, his slides were unclear and often overwhelming",
                "Switching between professors can be jarring, especially given their two different teaching styles. However, once you adapt to the structure of their lectures and tests, the class becomes very enjoyable. A weakness though, is that the curve in the class is also not very well explained to students. Very few people understood how their test grades would translate to letter grades, and it was unclear how the curve was distributed other than students being told that \"half the class\" received above a certain mark.",
                "I think one huge strength is that its 4 non-comprehensive exams and how practice exams are made available a week in advance. However, I think the course could be improved by providing a more smooth transition between the two sections of courses.",
                "Siggy was the biggest strength, Breaker was the biggest weakness. Siggy was encouraging and did a fantastic job of keeping the lectures accessible. Even without the lecture, her slides were fantastic and taught the material well. She went at a fast but manageable pace. She was approachable and emphasized that, even if it doesn't make sense right now, it would help us as we continued our education and lab practice. Breaker was much less supportive and his lecturing was far less enjoyable. His slides were overwhelming and he didn't have an engaging lecture style. I would often catch myself zoning out or drifting off, even when I tried hard to pay attention. His focus on the minute details of every mechanism really made it hard to grasp the big takeaways. There wasn't clarity. I had to try to learn all the material from the (unhelpful) slides before the exam and it made me feel like going to lecture was a waste of time. \r\n\r\nThe structure of the class with the extreme inflexibility was awful. I had a very difficult event occur the night before an exam and my only alternative route was to take the cumulative make-up exam at the end of the semester...I had heard horror stories about the final so I decided to push through and study until 3am, crying over my family situation throughout. I wouldn't wish that on anyone. There was also a lecture after Thanksgiving break when I was quite sick, but I brought myself to class because (as far as I knew) lectures weren't being recorded...Even with COVID stuff...I sat down and the first thing Breaker said was, \"If you're sick you should stay home and I will send you the recorded lecture.\" I was infuriated...What was I supposed to do? Get up and walk out then? If I had known lectures were being recorded I wouldn't have come. Its as simple as a canvas announcement BEFORE class.",
                "I WISH THIS COURSE COULD HAVE HAD RECORDED LECTURES. If you fall sick, oversleep or are just a little concerned about the density of the lecture hall due to COVID-19, you are absolutely screwed because there is no way to make up the lecture information that you've missed. Also, I wish we had clearer instructions for what was expected of us on the exams. One professor wanted answers focused more on biology\/memorization while the other wanted chemical reactions. I did, however, appreciate how the professor tied the concepts we learned in class to the real world.",
                "Strengths: no final\r\nWeaknesses: no homework pset so you dont have extra practice with the material, no required sections, office hours were very minimal, grade all dependent on four exams which is scary",
                "The course relies exclusively on exams for grades and they are very difficult considering the amount of material covered",
                "One strength was that there wasn't homework so we could just focus on the content. One weakness was switching professors half of the way into the semester it was difficult getting used to another teaching style with new content.",
                "Strengths- I really enjoyed the lectures by Professor Nachetergale she was engaging and the order she discussed things seemed to make sense\r\nBreaker's lectures tended to be more confusing simply because of different vocabulary that was not always necessary or a seemingly haphazard arrangement of slides",
                "the second half was not as structured and hard to follow, the exams also had a lot of trick questions",
                "The first half of the class was very well taught. Prof Nachtergaeles lectures were clear and easy to follow. It was obvious she cared about her students learning. The second half sped up a lot and was significantly more difficult. However, I dont think the level of difficulty can be attributed to just the metabolism content as Prof Breakers lecture slides could be disorganized and overwhelming at times. I think the way metabolism was taught should be entirely revamped as it was very unclear how to study for test content. For example, it shouldve been more clear what the big picture concepts were instead of focusing on small details that we never encountered again.",
                "The first half of the course was straightforward in its presentation and content. For the second part, the information was more dense although Prof. Breaker's slides were a little confusing at times, I think the additions of symbols indicating information that was beyond the scope of exams helped with studying.",
                "strengths - good lectures, material was often from lectures\r\nweaknesses - record lectures please, maybe more assignments to balance out tests",
                "The 4 exams, counting for 25% of the total grade can be good but bad.",
                "I wish there were other assignments rather than only exams so that we can have more practice and so that exams dont count for all of the grades. The 2nd half of the course with Professor Breaker was more difficult than the first half because we went through much more content at a quick pace.",
                "the course could have recorded all of its lectures, went super in depth so could have highlighted the more important information",
                "A strength is the fact that the information is really interesting and you feel as though you are learning everything about cell biology. There are four tests, so you have a greater chance to do well if one goes poorly. A weakness is that sometimes I felt like too much info was covered. Students could not fully grasp certain subjects because they simply did not have enough time. I wish some info was removed and more important cell bio subjects were touched on in greater depth, so that we could fully understand them.",
                "The strength of the course is the professors and their openness to providing guidance to students. The weakness was possibly the TAs grading harshly at times when the answer was technically correct.",
                "They tell you that you don't need to memorize mechanisms or structures, but you really do need to memorize some. This is a great foundational course for further work in cell bio.",
                "First half of the class with Prof. Nachtergaele was much better and clearer in terms of the material being taught and what we should expect to be tested on. The second half of the class with Prof. Breaker was more challenging and hoping changes can be made so that the material would be taught better especially with letting students know what will be tested on. I also wish the class was more accessible and kept our health in mind because we werent told until the last couple of weeks of class that lectures were being recorded and if people were sick and shouldnt be attending class that they could ask for the lecture recordings.",
                "lots and lots of info in a short amount of time, could probably benefit from mandatory better taught sections and psets",
                "-I think it was harder knowing what was important during the second part of the semester",
                "Good course. I like the format",
                "The lectures were extremely rushed. There was not enough time and resources given for students to process the large amount of information.",
                "strengths: you get through a lot of material. Weaknesses: There are only 4 exams and no other assignments which means the course load isn't that much up until the week of exams. Also, the professors switched midway through the semester and which meant adjusting to new types of exam questions.",
                "the course is decently well structured but is a very basic biochemistry course, perhaps by nature it is not that engaging",
                "Strengths: easy; broad overview; fair tests; Nachtergaele is a wonderful teacher \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: easy; a lot of review from prereqs; second half of the semester is very disorganized, lots of extraneous\/repetitive concepts",
                "It was difficult to engage with this close closely as it was a lecture, the slides could have been a little more specific and there should have been small optional homeworks to guide students in what way they should learn the material. However, it was extremely informative and I learned a lot and I am very thankful that  the slides were posted to canvas to help review and study for exams.",
                "Sometimes unclear if what the important points we were meant to learn and understand, however I think it was a good and relatively comprehensive amount of information given considering the amount of time allocated to teach it",
                "The course unfortunately feels like two separate classes, largely due to being taught by two different professors whose teaching styles differ significantly. The class could potentially be improved by ensuring a unified style of teaching throughout the semester.",

                "No, only take it if you need to. You want to stay away from Prof. Breaker. Siggy is great the first half of the course was terrific",
                "You probably have to take it for your major\/pre-med...but it's honestly not that bad! More interesting\/applicable to medicine than most other pre-med reqs (gen chem, orgo, physics). Make sure you study a lot for the exams since they make up your entire grade. Nachtergaele was a great prof, and her exams really matched the practice exams, so try to take it with her! Breaker is also a better lecturer than most other STEM profs in my experience, but his exams were harder to prepare for\/more unpredictable",
                "No if it's not a requirement.",
                "I found this class to be a lot more interesting, applicable, well taught, and fair than general chemistry and organic chemistry. I would recommend it! And the four exam no final was realllyyy nice!",
                "I highly recommend this class to premeds, to biologists, to chemical biologists - really, anybody who finds the way the body works at a cellular level interesting. It has really helped me understand the work I do in my own lab. The first half somewhat overlaps with Biol 101 and requires some memorization; the second half is more mechanism and organic chemistry based and very interesting. If you approach the class from the perspective of finding the material interesting and wanting to know how things work instead of memorizing, you will enjoy the class and do well. The weekly workload is relatively low because there are no psets and exams are not cumulative (and there is no final). The week of an exam, though, do make sure to clear your calendar for professor and peer tutor review sessions and to go through the provided practice exam. Studying is easier if you rewrite the lecture slides in your own words so you can focus on what's important!",
                "Most people take this course because they have to, but I would recommend it anyways. It's a solid biochemistry course that gives you a strong foundational understanding of important biological pathways.",
                "The grading is straightforward and the topics are interesting,  but the mid semester switch up is tough. I'd recommend, but probably only if you need to take biochem anyway.",
                "Not unless you have to.",
                "I absolutely recommend this class. Grading on the exams is fair, and lecture slides have everything you need to know and are clear, interesting, and not too full of information. Genuinely learned a lot without the horrible busywork associated with so many Yale classes.",
                "Yes, especially if one needs it for their major\/ premed requirement.",
                "You're probably taking biochem because you have to, probably for pre-med. The course material is extremely interesting, and well-designed for student learning. A lot of people go into biochemistry expecting the worst. This is super unnecessary! It's a great class if you enter it with an open mind.",
                "Take this course if you have to take biochem. Otherwise, I don't really know why you would take it for fun.",
                "Yeah",
                "Only take it if you have to",
                "Yes! I thoroughly enjoyed this class and found it to be very interesting. The course has given me a newfound appreciation for the intricacy of physiological mechanisms and has really changed the way I study biology. Also, the professors are both incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, which made it an enjoyable experience.",
                "overall enjoyed the course but professor breaker needs to improve his teaching style",
                "You will need to take this class if you are pre-med. Odds are you're deciding between this and MBB biochem. Take this one. The content is interesting, and even though things move quickly you can still do well if you just show up to class.",
                "Out of the two different biochem courses, I would really recommend this because it's only one semester and its 4 non-comprehensive exams so you finish the last week of class. Additionally, there are no problem sets or weekly work so it's totally up to you how much work you do and prepare beforehand.",
                "No. Obviously don't take this class unless you have to.",
                "If you have to take it take it. If youre premed, take this over the MBB biochemistry. Still a difficult stem class, so dont take it out of enjoyment",
                "Yes if they are pre med or have to take it for MCDB.",
                "This class does not have any work aside from the exams however does require extended periods of studying for the tests",
                "if you have to take biochem for premed requirements try not to take it with Breaker",
                "Im not sure. I would assess the pros and cons of both courses offered to see which fits your learning style more.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course, especially if you are premed\/MCDB major. This course has a bad rep, but honestly it is not as bad as some people might make it out to be. Yes, there is sometimes a lot of condensed information, but the exams this time around were actually fair and did not require route memorization. As long as you can study efficiently, you will do fine.",
                "i would only recommend this course if it's for a major requirement or for pre-med",
                "I would recommend this class over MB&B 300 based on what Ive heard from other students, though I wouldnt take this class unless its required.",
                "yes if they need it and are interested",
                "I would recommend this course if you want to learn how molecules are synthesized and about cellular respiration. It is very difficult and contains a lot of information, but it will help you understand the true chemistry behind our bodies.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course as it is very informative and it was one of my favorite courses at Yale.",
                "I mean, it's a prereq so kind of have to take it. But yeah, it's a pretty good course.",
                "Only if you need biochemistry for a requirement.",
                "yes but only if you need it for your major",
                "yeah it's a good course",
                "Yes! One of my favorite premed courses",
                "i would recommend this course if it were a requirement otherwise this may be too high of a workload",
                "Take this over MBB300 if you want a relaxed, broad overview of biochem without having to put in too much time or thought. The tests are fair but studying is entirely independent as there are no regular assignments and the practice tests are hit or miss. I personally felt like much of the knowledge crammed into the last four weeks was pretty irrelevant\/uninteresting\/repetitive to previous concepts and the course might be improved by focusing down on the more important stuff.",
                "This was a very good pre-med course. I learned a lot about how vitamins and co-enzymes function within the body and it gave me a good perspective on body function.",
                "Yes if you like biochemistry and biology",
                "no."
