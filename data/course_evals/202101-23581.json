I especially liked our early-in-the-semester practice of bringing in photographs (from our own families or elsewhere) that we felt resonated with the readings and presenting them to the class. There was often an emotional element to these presentations that I found captivating.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I felt that our discussions were a bit tangential and directionless, which made it occasionally hard to stay engaged, especially over Zoom."
