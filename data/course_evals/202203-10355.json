                "How to write a collegiate essay; gained a better understanding of what it means to be an American; gained a better understanding of U.S. history. I also feel as though this course greatly opened my mind and taught me a different way of thinking.",
                "This course gave me a greater understanding of U.S. history and the legacies of underrepresented Americans. I learned about events that I had not heard of before, and I was able to practice writing in a college setting for the first time.",
                "Skills: What questions to ask when analyzing primary sources, and how to have a productive discussion where we offer ideas and respond to one another \r\n\r\nIn terms of knowledge or insights, I gained new knowledge of events in United States history that were never discussed in prior history classes. Although most were rooted in some form of oppression or racism, it was still fascinating to see that there are patterns with government behavior. Additionally, through our class discussions, I was able to learn about the differences in the way that American history is taught in other states.",
                "As far as skills go, I learned how to analyze and interpret primary sources, how to determine\/differentiate what is a primary source and what is not, how to compare and contrast primary sources from different point of views, and how to cite in Chicago.\r\n\r\n     As far as knowledge goes, I learned about so many American historical events that I did not know prior to taking this course. I was very excited to take this course since it seemed that it would be more of a critical history of the United States. Of course every single event in American history cannot be covered, but it is very interesting to learn how some critical things were glossed over or not even mentioned in my APUSH class in high school or even any other history classes I have taken for that matter. In. What Makes an American?, I learned about the Wilmington Riots and the Oklahoma City bombing. I learned about the contributions of Asian Americans on the transcontinental railroad. I learned about Mexican-Americans, their influence on the states out west, and how they were forced from their settlements during the Gold Rush. \r\n\r\n     Upon each reading or image that was assigned, I learned something that I did not know before. I am happy that I chose this as my first year seminar and that I was placed in it.",
                "I gained new insight on American Identity. I think the course really highlighted the conflict between history taught to students before college and some of the reality of what people had to go through. The courses structure allowed my classmates and I to have meaningful conversations about who the term American really includes and how the nation portrays itself globally in contrast to how citizens view ourselves internally.",
                "I learned how to read and analyze primary documents from U.S history, determine the motivations behind a primary source, and compare different arguments on the same issue (Native American removal, Civil rights, immigration, etc.) Besides these useful historical analysis skills, I also learned how to have discussions that lead to a greater understanding of topics. My writing has also improved as I learned how to use primary documents and the authors behind them to construct concrete, persuasive arguments about an impossibly vague topic: what makes an American?",
                "This course taught me to how properly analyze historical documents through a critical lense. It also showed me how to have beneficial and thought-provoking conversations regarding sensitive topics. It also gave me a more thourough understanding of inter-group relations throughout US history.",
                "I developed a great deal of knowledge about the history of this country and therefore a greater under of why certain things are the way they are in the US today. I also learned how to evaluate primary sources"

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: fantastic professor; Dr. Akiboh is brilliant, insightful, and empathetic. She creates a supportive, safe environment in class. The feedback she gave me on my essays was very thorough and extremely helpful and specific. All the readings were chosen with great care. I also loved the seminar style of the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the readings could be a bit long, especially towards the middle and end of the semester",
                "I think the daily readings and biweekly discussions were useful and interesting. I liked that we had a mixture of small-group and whole-class discussions. I did not find the reading journal particularly helpful, but I can see how it would be useful for others.",
                "Strengths: a variety of different kinds of sources, some are dense, some are easily comprehended, perspectives vary from common people to government officials. The discussion isn't restrictive, meaning that we can share personal stories, reactions, and other sources\/information while also presenting discussion questions and analysis of the readings. This class requires that you journal about your insights which is really helpful in exercising that continuity muscle \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Although this class is a writing credit, we were only able to do two papers (a third for the final assignment was an option but was not encouraged). The quality of feedback on what we did write was great, but I just wished we had more opportunities to work with different prompts and goals with writing.",
                "The strength of this course were the sources and topics that Dr. Akiboh chose to assign, as well as the seminar design of the course. I really did not talk that much, but my opinions were usually voiced by someone anyways. It got very juicy when someone occasionally respectfully disagreed with someone else, and I enjoyed that a lot.\r\n\r\n     The only weakness is that sometimes, the readings assigned were just a little bit too much. I would sometimes just go through the readings and pick and choose a section to genuinely annotate, analyze, and take notes on. On the plus side, for the long readings through, Dr. Akiboh would give us from Thursday until Tuesday so we would at least have the weekend to read and analyze them. I just sometimes had to prioritize documents I found more interest in if I was on a time crunch or if I had an exam in another one of my classes the same week. I am not good at proposing solutions for things like this though because the class was still very much a great class, and we would go on to discuss every topic anyway if we did not really get the background we wanted beforehand.",
                "The course covers a wide variety of US Historical Eras, allowing us to discuss so many different citizens perspectives throughout history. I think this jumping around is a strength because it allows students to monitor how US identity changed and how different groups of people changed their attitudes toward the country. This also allowed for comparison between the Eras, which I really liked because that meant our conversations in class would be more nuanced and we can also notice trends or read between the lines of laws to see how it affects people later on. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the only weakness is the class we had about moving west\/the Mexican-American War. I think the main reading should connect a bit more to the video we watched, so that one class discussion did not have a fluid transition between the two introduced topics.",
                "The course allows students to take more control of their learning. Professor Akiboh made it clear that she understands that we are capable of interacting with the material and facilitating learning for each other. The readings in this class are interesting and each module has a completely different feeling or structure from the last; it does not simply jump from historical points, but between different intrinsic American conflicts (the role of laws, the role of race, the role of religion, etc.). The only issue is that sometimes our class discussions would take a direction I did not expect and could not contribute much to. For example, we had a discussion on early American immigrants where I expected to discuss the American Dream but where we instead talked about the role of American religion. Still, that was an interesting conversation that the students chose to pursue.",
                "Because of the layout of the class (new reading everyday), there is a fast paced nature that keeps you engaged at all times. The topics form clss to class also seem to form a pattern that allows you to more effectively draw connections from one event to another while still being able to appreciate the uniqueness of each occurence. The student lead discussions also lead to a more inviting and warming landsape to share ideas and thoughts. The only weakness of the class is the length of the semester since we could not expand even further on some  new topics.",
                "Strengths: very interesting content, lots of opportunities to contribute to class discussion \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: honestly none that I can think of!"

                "YES!! Any student, as long as you're committed to the class. Any student who puts a good amount of effort into this class will have a return on investment. Obviously this class is learning about American history, which is great for any potential humanities or political science major, but there are opportunities for introspection and connection building with other students. That took this class to the next level, and made it accessible for anyone regardless of potential major.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I feel that the content we learned in this class should be things that everyone taking American history should know. Especially in the midst of certain states erasing Critical Race Theory in classrooms, it is imperative that someone can take a history course such as this one. It is also a great course to take for a writing distributional requirement.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Akiboh is an incredibly bright instructor who designed a very interesting and engaging set of readings for this course. If you want to learn more about US identity, I think the way she designed the class highlights the experiences of many different groups in their journey to be included in the term American.\r\nAdditionally, this course offers a great opportunity to improve your writing. Professor Akiboh gives detailed feedback, and is very helpful if you ask her questions.",
                "Absolutely. The class is just plain interesting. In this class, you cover topics of American history that are rarely taught in class or talked about in daily life. For example, we had a unit on the Puerto Rican Independence Movement when I didn't even know Puerto Rico ever had one. I don't know how Professor Akiboh manages to find such detailed, unknown primary sources or how she bands multiple of them into a cohesive unit about an overarching development in American identity. This class completes the task of teaching you something new and encouraging you to look at the United States from a different perspective while not shutting out appreciation for the changes the country has undergone.",
                "This class is a must-have of you want to better understand where racial and minority distincitons come from in the US. The course is also very thought provoking with its central question of what makes an American since it has a complicated answer. This class was the highlight of my semester.",
                "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course. The topics are extremely interesting and Prof Akiboh is extremely knowledgeable, engaging and fair."
