                "So entertaining and engaging, really fun work, awesome class.",
                "I like that we would watch the episodes before class. The readings were short and concise so that I really got the point of what each one was saying.  The class was not always the most engaged. Some students barely spoke, so I wish it was more of a class discussion rather than us just one on one responding to Professor Semmel.",
                "Strengths: very engaging, the history portion of the course tied really well into the TV show, the structure of the course made a lot of sense and aided in engagement",
                "Prof. Semmel was definitely the course's greatest strength. He's a fantastic professor.\r\n\r\nI think there should be a bit more structure. The readings were interesting, but we didn't do too much with them. I also think there should maybe be a few specific things from the episodes to discuss, at least at the start, so the discussions feel a bit more structured.",
                "Definitely fun watching the show and discussing with piers. I thought the workload was good, but fair",
                "Strengths - loved the show very interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - readings werent that relevant",
                "A strength is the discussion based nature of the course, which allowed us to explore topics which interested us in depth. I would have preferred more required engagement with historical research. It's interesting to google various plot points as they appear, but having assignments or readings that explore the historical accuracies of the show would have been very cool.",
                "Strength: Very chill and nice class discussions, light and interesting readings.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The class can feel a bit unstructured at times. You are not going to learn a lot of hard-core knowledge. Most of the class are simply spent discussing episodes of the crown. Do not take this class if you find the TV show boring or mediocre."

                "Yes! This was a super engaging class and it was super fun watching The Crown along with several other movies in the class. It is a class that requires several hours of commitment each week, as we went through 3-5 episodes (3-5 hours) plus several readings a week. However, it was worth it and I learned a lot. We had three papers throughout the class, and none were too difficult to write, though I would not recommend it as a fifth \"gut\" class as the time commitment is quite high if you truly want to engage in the class.",
                "I would, if they're interested in the show and/or the monarchy.",
                "Yes, I loved this course. Professor semmel was great and the topic remained engaging throughout the semester",
                "So interesting for anyone that doesnt know about this history and hasnt watched the show",
                "Yes - very interesting and fun to take",
                "Yes, as it was a very interesting course that allowed me to disengage from my psets and think about history, screenwriting, direction, and looking at a television show as a kind of text available for analysis.",
                "Yes! If you love the Crown and are interested in the British monarchy, definitely take this class. Professor Semmel is great!"
