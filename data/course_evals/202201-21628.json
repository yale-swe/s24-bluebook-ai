I learned about linear spans and linear dependence, how to determine if a set of vectors are linearly independent, and the consequence of linear dependence or independence on the properties of a vector subset. I learned about functions and linear transformations, what it means for a function to be injective, surjective, and bijective, and how that influences the behavior of these functions in proof and problems. I learned about the matrix representation of a linear transformation, the properties of a matrix, how to perform matrix multiplication  and how it differs from scalar multiplication  , the conditions under which a matrix is invertible and diagonalizable, how to invert an diagonalize a matrix, and how to use different matrix operations to reveal properties of matrices in proof and problems. I also learned about eigenvectors and eigenvalues, how they are determined from a matrix, and how they can be used to diagonalize a matrix, solve systems of linear equations with matrices, and how they can prove properties of a matrix when used in proofs. One of my favorite aspects of the course was how the material is applicable in a wide range of disciplines. While we learned about the structure of matrices and eigenstates, I was able to use these objects to solve relativistic and quantum mechanical problems in my physics class. The interconnectivity of linear algebra is fascinating, and the way in which we built each topic from the ground up using concrete derivations and solid proofs definitely helped me better understand the material and be able to use it in other contexts. Our use of proof writing in derivations and problem sets will help prepare me to take other proof-based mathematics classes down the road.",

However, we spent much less time on how to manipulate the matrices themselves, and the class was less computational than 222. In my opinion, this was a good thing; you can always just use a calculator these days."

We ran a little behind and it sometimes felt a little disorganized, but going to office hours and working with the textbook allowed me to follow along and learn well from the course.",

                "The grading of tests is very different than the grading of the psets.",
                "Strengths: The content was relevant and applicable to many courses, the teacher was committed to the class, THE TAs were absolutely amazing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: learning proofs had a steep learning curve, and it was difficult to get a handle of proofs while only working with new material in the proofs (but that felt necessary as there is a lot to learn in one semester). There were many different variables at times that made the concepts more confusing (an example with numbers first was most helpful). Also, while this is not the fault of the teacher, in class I was mainly just trying to copy down what was on the board without actually learning the content.",
                "Strengths: lecture notes helpful, office hours well structured\r\nWeaknesses: Pace was a little too fast at times and a little too slow",
                "The teacher did not always teach correctly and got confused",
                "The exams were fair. Homework was challenging, yet it helped you learn.",
                "Problem sets were doable and fun, office hours and proof writing workshops were amazing. There was some incongruence between the class material and first midterm,  but Ebru recognized it and fixed it for future exams.",
                "Strengths: Ebru was very understanding about the fact that proof-writing and theoretical linear algebra are pretty difficult to grasp. She dropped the weighting of the first midterm from 25% to 10% (unless keeping it at 25% benefited your grade, obviously) after a good number of people bombed the midterm, and the succeeding exams were a lot more reasonable. Additionally, Ebru was not really focused on if you were using proper proof language and structure and was more focused on if you were making valid arguments with your proofs, which is how an introductory proof-writing course should be. Ebru is also very kind and pretty funny if you get to know her. Ebrus office hours were great, and while I have a few things to say about her lectures, she was pretty helpful in office hours, so if youre struggling in the class, go to her office hours with some practice proofs and just run through them with her. Also, Linear Algebra is a really cool subject, and while I love Calculus, learning Linear Algebra is kind of the point where everything in math seems to tie together and make sense in my opinion. Also, the benefit of taking a theoretical class like Math 225 is that there isnt as much emphasis on computation, so any computational problems are really just to see if you know how to do the math, so you dont have to worry much about getting computational problems that are easy to trip up on because of how annoyingly long they are.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nOne thing that really annoyed me was that it took the TAs around a month to grade each problem set (this is not an exaggeration), so you were barely getting feedback on your proofs in time for exams. We even had a problem set due 3 days before our final, which only added onto the stress of studying and was pointless because it was obviously not graded in time. Also, there were no practice exams for the 2nd midterm and final. We only got practice problems to do in the book, but you couldnt check your answers because they were never sent out, so Im not really sure how those would help. There should be a lot more resources for writing proofs for practice given that this is an introductory proof writing course. Also, Ebru was not the best instructor, but before I say more on that, this was her first semester teaching the course, and she was open to suggestions on how to make the experience better, so if she continues teaching the course, I definitely think she can make it better. One of my criticisms on her teaching would be that lecture often moved way too fast for students that have never been exposed to Linear Algebra and the way she taught the concepts didnt really align with our textbook, so you could only look at her lecture notes (which were extremely incoherent) to review the material. I think that either she needs to make her lesson plan align more with the textbook or make her lecture notes a lot more thorough and detailed. I dont blame the pacing of the course entirely on her, though, because honestly, this course tries to accomplish way too much in one semester given that its supposed to be an introductory Linear Algebra class. Teaching all of the computational and theoretical aspects of Linear Algebra from elementary Set Theory to Spectral Theory while also teaching proof-writing is not really achievable in one semester if youve never seen Linear Algebra before unless youre Srinivasa Ramanujan. We actually didnt even get to Spectral Theory, and Ebru said in an office hours that this was because she was trying to take the beginning of the semester slowly so that we could grasp the fundamentals better but that she eventually had to speed up if we were going to cover all of the topics specified in the syllabus. I thought her idea of taking it slowly was great because the theoretical component of this course takes some time to digest. Math 222 or some form of computational Linear Algebra should be a prerequisite for a more thorough coverage of the theory in this course.",

                "This course was very theoretical, and much of the problems were proof based. I didn't get much practical understanding of how matrices apply to things.",
                "This class was very good at covering the derivation of each theorem, mathematical object, or concept, connecting it to material that we learned earlier, and using it as a springboard to begin our investigations of other concepts in the course. I think having a study guide that details the essential theorems for each unit or section of the syllabus would help focus our review of course material and would help make these theorems and concepts more accessible whenever we need them.",
                "exams could be better calibrated to the constant; first midterm proved challenging, but final was very easy. I wouldn't have minded if all the exams were like the first one, so long as there was ample time.",
                "This class should not be allowed for students who have not yet taken multivariable calculus.",

                "The course was wonderfully organized, content-wise, to give students a very deep understanding of the material. Problem sets were fun but a little unpredictable; sometimes they wouldn't be comprehensive reviews of the week's content, other times they would ask you for a proof that seemed unreasonable to expect students to generate on their own (we often referred to the internet, TAs, or even asked the prof for the walkthroughs of those problems)."

I don't know if Ebru will teach this course again, but she was a good professor who cared about the students and really tried to teach the course as best she could. I think that the issues she had this semester was because it was her first time teaching the course. Just note that she will use words like \"clearly\" or \"I already said this here\" before answering some questions. She had explained that she is not trying to be rude, this is just how she adds a verbal pause or how she checks in with herself that she remembered to say that earlier.",

                "Yes",
                "It's definitely hard, but if it's required for your major it's not horrible. The material is interesting too",
                "If I had to describe my experience with this course in one sentence, I would have to quote Tyrion Lannister: I found it surprisingly beautiful...in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way. Honestly, Linear Algebra is a really cool subject, but Id be lying if I said this class isnt hard. A few reasons to take Math 225 would be: you need it because its a requirement for your major, youre deciding between Math 225 and Math 222, or youre a computer science major (linear algebra is not required for CS, but it helps A LOT, and if you didnt know, Linear Algebra is really important in implementing complex concepts of various mathematical fields into computers). I say that you should take Math 225 if youre deciding between Math 222 and Math 225 because Linear is probably the only math subject where knowing why the math works is actually pretty important in being able to apply the math. I would only recommend Math 222 if they change the structure in a way that they actually cover the theory behind the techniques in Linear Algebra without including the proof aspect. However, I will also note that Math 222 is easier because it lacks the proof aspect of 225. Overall, though, both classes are not great in terms of teaching quality, so be prepared to teach yourself most of the content. Proof writing is what makes this course difficult because most people have never written a proof before taking this course, and you essentially get a two-week introduction to writing proofs focused on simple number theory at the beginning of the semester and are all of a sudden expected to know how to produce proofs on Linear Algebra concepts like youre in Good Will Hunting. The only people I know who found this course on the easier side had taken Linear Algebra before. In other words, taking this course without any exposure to Linear beforehand is difficult (as a warning, there are a good number of people that fit this profile in the course, so you will have to work harder than them). Unfortunately, you cannot take both Math 222 and Math 225, so you dont have the choice to get some exposure to the computational aspects of Linear Algebra before taking this theory-focused course. This course also lacks the resources of the introductory math courses at Yale, so dont expect to find as much help as you could in a course like Math 120. Also, your experience in this course is going to be a lot different than any other math class youve taken if youve never taken a proof-based course because there is no algorithmic approach to solving proof problems. Any question in this class regarding writing a proof is problem-solving in its purest form, and you cant get by with plugging and chugging and simply accepting that the math works like you could in previous math classes (a little tip: DO NOT try to just memorize theorems and think that is enough. You should understand why the proofs of those theorems work and maybe even try to prove them on your own in creative ways because when writing proofs, you really need to have an understanding of everything in order to draw connections and solve problems). I still think this course is better than Math 222 from what Ive heard, though, so definitely take it if you need to take introductory Linear, but if you don't need to take Linear and don't have that much interest in the subject, \"fun\" is not how one should think about this course. Also, make sure you have enough time to commit to the class because, seriously, you will need to teach yourself a lot of the course material. The computational aspects are pretty easy to learn through YouTube, but to get better at writing proofs, you really just have to practice a lot.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested, even if you don't intend on entering a STEM major. You will get a fantastic treatment on the core aspects of linear algebra and a great introduction to mathematical proof-writing here at Yale. I believe this class prepared me well for more math classes here, especially those that emphasize proofs. I was able to apply the material I learned in this class to other courses I was taking, and I definitely believe the proof-based approach to learning the material helped me understand it more in-depth. Many of my friends in the course who are non-STEM majors excelled in this class. The class's learning style combines elements of logic, critical reasoning, and problem solving that are emphasized in many fields such as philosophy and English, so students interested in fields such as these were able to do really well in the course. Overall, I think this was a fantastic class, and I would definitely recommend to anyone interested in linear algebra or proof-based mathematics.",

                "This was a fun introduction to a proof based math class. I would recommend it to another student that is interested in futhering their math studies. We did not get past diagonalization and eigen-things, so if you want linear algebra for its applications this is NOT the class to take. Also the tests were proof based, so if that's not your thing, 222 is more computation based, and might be a better fit.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in Linear Algebra",
                "Highly recommend this course with Ebru IF you are willing to invest a significant amount of time attending office hours, etc. There are a couple of pretty intense content sections where things don't \"click\"; you have to be willing to work through those. In 222, a more computational class, you just have to apply rules and follow instructions to solve problems. In this class, 225, you have to actually deeply understand why you're doing what you're doing. This was HIGHLY rewarding for me and some of my classmates, but others might find it unnecessary."
