                "Strengths - consistency (had the same format each week with assignments, lectures, etc) so we knew what was expected of us \r\nweaknesses - not enough practice problems before the exams",
                "It is very compressive, and requires spending a lot of time.",
                "This course is very straightforward, an aspect that can be seen as both a strength and weakness. On one hand, the course follows a predictable flow and logic, building on previous concepts in a way that is easy to follow. On the other hand, the concepts can be dry, but Tolga did a great job of including interesting examples and stories to engage students.",
                "The strengths are that the professor and the TA are very professional and can explain the concepts and calculations clearly, which really helps on the understanding of microeconomics as well as the homework and the exams. The weakness might be that the zoom online video has quite much something repeating from the lectures, which might be reduced more and can therefore talk about contents on the book more.",
                "Strengths\r\n-pre-recorded video lectures were very well made and easily understandable. \r\n-Problem Sets graded quickly and good feedback was given. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-daily pre-class lectures were the same as live lectures, using different and interactive examples or covering specific topics in depth would be better. \r\n-classes always went overtime, about 35 min. Keeping to the schedule posted to the course selection website would be better.",
                "I thought the course was excellent-- the pacing was a little tough after the midterm, but all in all not too unmanageable.",
                "overall the course is well structured and ample extra learning time was offered to students to clarify \r\n\r\nthe biggest weakness is just how rushed it is, to the point of it being extremely difficult if not impossible to keep up with all of the reading and videos and lectures, especially right after the midterm: but this might just be the way summer session classes are",
                "The course is incredibly rushed, especially the second half after the midterm. They should give more time to the second half. The clarity of what needs to be learned is pretty good on the homework side, but the midterm and especially final did not match what was stressed by the the homework to learn. The homework is light but focused, which is nice. What was taught in lectures or office hours sometimes contradicted what the textbook said, which was extremely unhelpful. Feedback on graded assignments was minimal at best and not usually helpful. Textbook reading and pre-recorded lecture watching are required, making actual on-zoom class near-useless. Many things that were actually difficult, i.e. things that show up on the homework and tests, were only explained well by the OPTIONAL office hours, which were mandatory to attend to be able to succeed, at least for me and many others. In addition, the syllabus lies and says class is 1 1\/2 hours long, when it is actual 2 hours long at least, usually longer.",
                "Weakness: The classes were basically the exact same thing as the recorded lectures.",
                "I think we could have spared watching the lectures twice (once for homework and once in live class). I would have preferred watching it for e homework and then spending class on applications and questions but not re running though the entire lecture.",
                "Strength: Nice introduction to microeconomics, which is something pretty useful for everyone to know. Although the course was somewhat conducted in a hurry due to the tight summer schedule, we had time to go over every topics and I do not think anyone would miss much from taking the class during summer instead of a regular semester.  Weakness: For the quantitative part of the class, there were not enough practice problems. The more theoretical part of the course material could also be explained better. Although almost all exam questions come from concepts covered in lectures, there is still pressure to read the textbook, which in some cases makes things more confusing since the textbook does a poor job in explaining virtually everything.",
                "The course was very well facilitated for student learning, and Tolga was a very engaging professor.",
                "Strengths: lecture videos were very thorough; lots of helpful supplemental resources.",
                "Absolutely no weaknesses. Strengths: Incredibly knowledgable and hilarious professor who made the two hours class fly by very quickly. Great balance of discussion and lecture to keep the entire class engaged throughout each chapter. Great examples brought in by both the professor and TA to relate complex economic topics to simple everyday\/relatable scenarios."

                "I would recommend this course to another student. It changes the way one approaches the world and presents an interesting way of thinking about problems. As a believer in a liberal arts education, I think it's important for people to have a feel for many different disciplines to build a holistic understanding of the world. This course will provide students with a proficiency and basic literacy in economics, something that regardless of future life plans, is important to have.",
                "Yes. Because its important for anyone to be equipped with some knowledge on economics or finance, and Professor Tolga will lead you smoothly through those basic things and is very helpful as he applies the concepts in the real life in every aspects, from stock to human relationships. Hes experienced and will give the university students a good guide for society entry.",
                "If you need to take micro, I'd definitely recommend taking it over the summer. You have to grind for 5 weeks, but then it's over, and you learn all that you would've in an entire semester. Tolga is also great at making the class as entertaining as it can be, and his prerecorded lectures were super helpful in getting a better grasp of the material. Fernando was a great TA as well.",
                "I would recommend taking the class, but would probably encourage taking it during the school year rather than during the summer. The professor is fantastic and the material is interesting, but all of that gets tainted by the mad scramble to keep up in the summer I think",
                "I would absolutely for the low amount of work, if the teacher and teaching style was different. It is still a much easier social science credit than most others, so I still possibly would anyway.",
                "Yes! Great intro to Econ. Although I would suggest to take it during the normal term as it felt a bit crammed in summer session",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they need the course to fulfill a prerequisite\/requirement for their major(s). In my opinion, introductory microeconomics does not deserve a precocious course space during a normal semester, so one might as well get it over with during the summer. If the student would like to fulfill a distributional requirement or simply to explore the topic, there are better options at Yale.",
                "Yes - even over the summer, the material is spaced out well and Tolga is an excellent professor.",
                "Yes, Prof. Koker's teachings are engaging and full of practical examples.",
                "Absolutely yes!!! Even if you aren't an economics major I would highly recommend taking this course so as to familiarize yourself with the principles that govern our very own economy. Always a great credit\/skill to have under your belt."
