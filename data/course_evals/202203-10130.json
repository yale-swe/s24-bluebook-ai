This included some of the fluid mechanics and electrochemistry behind their functions, the fabrication process, various components such as sensors, and clinical applications. We also learned a bit of intuition behind the business and financial side of biotech.",
                "Not a whole lot, I feel I understand the fabrication process for microfluidic devices and have an idea of what the industry looks like.",
                "I learned a lot regarding private industry in terms of biomedical devices, and the importance of knowing how health markets emerge.",
                "The whole field of microdevices and the small parts that make up groundbreaking biotechnology devices. I learned about the process of writing a grant proposal and how to pitch to biotech companies.",

                "What I came away with was a deep insight of the bio micro-device fabrication process. Specifically microfluidics. We learn a lot of other material along the way but the micro-device fabrication process is highlighted especially since we were able to go in and tour fabrication labs at Yale.",
                "I learned a lot about micro device fabrication in this class and the process used to determine what the best microfluidic template would be. I also learned about the math that governed some devices and the process used to create different devices."

                "Lecture slides were very crowded and not comprehensible without context or further explanation. Also a bit dry.",
                "The course covers a ton of information, so you really get exposure to a wide variety of material. Dr. Fan is very knowledgeable and incorporates in-person lab components, which helps to better understand the technology. However, because there is so much information it can be fast-paced and difficult to grasp at time.",
                "Strengths: So much interesting content and as a BME student you will NEVER take another course that teaches you more about actual current topics and cutting-edge technologies in the biotech industry! Dr. Fan is absolutely amazing and it's a privilege to have him teach this course - you can tell he's very passionate about what he does and is so knowledgeable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There's a lot to cover so this isn't necessarily something that can be fixed, but the lectures could get very overwhelming and repetitive. A bit more students engagement would have been nice.",
                "This course was super disorganized. Rong Fan is obviously an extremely experienced and impressive engineer and is very knowledgable about the industry and the course content, but I was really confused most of the time about what we were expected to know or take away from the lectures.  I think it would be really helpful for him and for students in the future if he developed a list of goals for what he wanted us to know.  \r\nThe midterm exam was shockingly difficult and seemed to expect that we had memorized every single slide of the first 13 (or however many) lectures, which I think was an unreasonable expectation especially considering we had a grand total of one (1) pset to prepare us. Not to ask for more work, but it would have been useful to have more checkpoints along the way or just something to give us a better representation of what the exam would cover. He sent a list of questions but again it was basically to know everything he had ever mentioned in class, which wasn't super helpful actually.",
                "I believe a huge strength of the course was exposing the students to technologies that are relevant to private industry and academia in a way that was easy to understand. A minor disadvantage of the course is that sometimes they would be too much Contant, such that the professor would skip various lights given that the amount of the class was not enough.",
                "The content was sometimes a lot to get through. I appreciated that lectures had plenty of review, but I wish the assignments were more spaced out to allow intervals of consolidating what we learned.",
                "The course isnt homework heavy which is a strength and a weakness. Because of the one midterm lectures felt lol was important but were still interesting.",
                "I think the class set up was very conducive for learning the material as some concepts built on each other. I also liked that our final project could include material from any point in the class. I liked that we could use what we learned and spend time investigating a topic we were passionate about. The one thing I would say is that the guidelines for projects and the midterm were unclear. I was unsure of what we were supposed to do for the project and had to use the example given as a complete rubric. I also believe the midterm was not reflective of course material as we had to look up the concepts in more detail in order to have comprehensive study materials.  I did appreciate that we were given a study guide."

You learn so much real-world applications and cutting-edge devices as opposed to the academia side of things. Western blots and PCRs are so outdated, but this is the first course that actually tells you that.",
                "I would probably not recommend this course.  I think the professor is very knowledgable so I consider it a bit of a shame, because he definitely has a great perspective to share and we could stand to learn a lot from him, but the course is just very disorganized and that really doesn't work for me as a student.",
