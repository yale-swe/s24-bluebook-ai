    "I like the grading policy and distribution, but I think widespread appeal and interest in the class could be improved.",
    "I would have liked to do more work in class rather than so much lecturing",
    "It feels very hard to do well on the exams because they are not similar to the practice exams",
    "I thought the course was great, generally. The problem sets were fair, as were the exams, and lectures were good. My only complaint would be the fact that we used webassign. Webassign sometimes took off points for really frustrating simplification reasons, and I also had to pay a ridiculous amount of money to access those homework questions.",
    "Good course but have more similar types of problems shown in class as to the exam questions.",
    "I got a lot better at math",
    "Strengths are that material needed for the tests are clearly presented in class. Weaknesses are that the test material is much harder than what is generally studied in class and the examples worked with throughout the course. Also the textbook is not easy to read or understand."
