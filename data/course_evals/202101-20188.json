This class overall has made me a more critical writer not just in humor but in all types. I personally had ignored things like texture, structure, voice, and more when writing, and this class used humor (one of my favorite things) to open my mind to it. We covered a variety of aspects of comedy writing, from short exercises to the longer essays. We really hit many of the bases (if not all of them). I learned a lot about how my creative process functions as well."

                "Strengths - Workshops were very useful and class discussions were very well guided \r\nWeakness - Writing humor to be graded can be very difficult",
                "Some strengths: the material is just fun in a way that other classes can't really be by virtue of content, readings are generally quite light, class discussions are very focused on building concrete skills, you get to read other students' very funny work, and Ryan's feedback is usually pretty detailed - he'll help you identify your strengths as well as any missed opportunities for humor in your essays. I would say both a strength and a weakness of the course is the amount of writing you have to do. You're constantly practicing and improving, but it's also super time consuming. I honestly think that the course workload could be reduced, and it wouldn't really hurt learning outcomes - for me, the humor challenges looked fun in theory, but in practice I thought having to do them every Sunday night was actually quite stressful, so I think it would be nice if more of them were optional. The course already has nine graded essays (with four of them involving revisions), so adding topical jokes/humor challenges/language challenges/text presentations/workshop response letters is just...a lot. And on a different note, I felt like the syllabus/assignments had a bit of an imbalance toward ridicule, and I kind of wish that brand of humor had been less of a focus.",
                "Wonderful readings! Though I think lessening the reading load and really honing in on a few would be more productive. Also loved the essay structure!",
                "Strength- Professor Wepler's enthusiasm. He does such an excellent job creating a fun class environment, even over Zoom. The weekly writing assignments kept me writing, even when I wasn't feeling it. There also were many small writing challenges throughout the semester, which were fun exercises without being overbearing/too much work. \r\n\r\nWeakness- I can only talk about what makes something funny for so long before getting exhausted, and I think that's true for most people. That's the natural obstacle to this course, but I think Prof. Wepler does a great job managing that.",
                "Strengths: breadth and depth of comedy writing topics covered, professor Wepler's appreciation for everyone's individual sense's of humor and the helpful honest feedback, the workshops in class with peers analyzing your piece were awesome \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: you only get 2 in class workshops, and it does feel like a monster of a class often, however this can be alleviated if you are on top of your game and plan accordingly."

You will definitely leave with a better sense of what you find funny and what your strengths as a humor writer are, especially if humor writing is something new to you. You may also make a lot of funny friends. However, I wouldn't recommend taking it in a semester with another high workload class or another writing class. If either of those are the case but you still really want to take it, I'd definitely recommend taking it credit/d/fail so you can be less stressed out about missing more than one humor challenge or something like that.",

                "Absolutely. This course was a ton of fun and a great opportunity to flex different writing muscles than what you'd do in every other writing class at Yale. The class keeps you active, but the work is never overwhelming. Professor Wepler is an amazing teacherpassionate about the material, super encouraging, and a genuinely kind person. His office hours were one of the highlights of my week!",
                "I would recommend it to another student that isn't afraid of doing the work. In a normal semester it might be easier to avoid burning out on the work and overlapping assignments. It's fun to get to know the sense of humor of the other people in the class and learn more about yourself and what you find funny. If you're just looking for an easy writing credit, this probably isn't the right class for you, but if you want to try something new this is a good opportunity.",
                "Absolutely, if you can get in, you have to take this class. The ratings are right, it is a LOT of work because you are constantly producing content, but it is so rewarding and enjoyable of a class. I never zoned out in class, which is something that is usually impossible. Professor Wepler is insanely great and appreciated my dark humor and loves it when boundaries are pushed. If you like comedy or write comedy or whatever, this class will be so amazing for you. I personally learned so much about my creative process since this class gives you structure and deep analysis of humor strategies. In person, I imagine this class can only get better with live and audible laughs. Again though, DO BEWARE if you do not have time for this class, do not take it. I took 5.5 credits this semester and it was honestly too much for any normal semester (the only thing that saved me was that it was a COVID semester with nothing else to do on campus)."
