    "Definitely. Peter Jones is the best professor at Yale I have encountered. He loves teaching and encouraged me to tackle hard problems.",
    "It's not a classic rigorous math class. You will learn some new things but most of the time it will feel a little confusing and a bit hand-wavy.",
    "Yes. If you make the time to meet with Professor Jones outside of class, it helps solidify your understanding and makes the class more enjoyable. He's a really great professor and you can learn a lot by meeting with him outside of class.",
    "Yes. you can learn mathematical knowledge for further study."
