   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures are good, office hours are plenty, problem sets doable, grading fair. Don't really have any grievances.",
    "I think there could be more practice and review problems as well as more organized comprehensive review sessions. Beyond that, I loved this course.",
    "No complaints",
    "Strengths: JDRS is probably the only person who could make stat interesting, the homeworks are actually helpful for understanding the material, office hours are helpful, slides are easy to synthesize, good overview of stat\r\n\r\nWeakness: since JDRS has a teaching philosophy where students are asked to \"forget the grade\" and just focus on learning, less motivated\/confused students (me) aren't going to go the extra mile to actually learn to do stat since I can get a good grade without actually learning anything. I learned where information was in the slides but couldn't come up with anything off the top of my head. I found it really difficult to keep when to use what straight in the class.",
    "Strengths: it's a relatively easy QR credit because there are so many opportunities to get help either from TA's or JDRS. Also, JDRS is super funny and tries to make people as engaged as they can be in a massive intro stats lecture. Weaknesses: the course moves super fast and Minitab is pretty annoying to use.",
    "It is very easy to never go to class. Everything is video recorded and all exams are take home. You SHOULD go to TA office hours for problem sets, because they are SO helpful; however, it is not necessary to get good grades.",
    "Weaknesses are that the lectures sometimes feel very long. But strengths are that JDRS genuinely wants us to learn and do well and he definitely shows that. He makes exams very fair but challenges us on the problem sets.",
    "Once you get lost, you're basically screwed so stay on top of your work. JDRS isnt the best at explaining things in different ways if you dont understand them from the original explanation.",
    "This class is incredible. JDRS is a funny, passionate teacher who brings in real-world examples and jokes to help you remember statistical concepts and how they're used. He's a great lecturer. Material is in the perfect level of depth where you understand enough to know why things work, even if you maybe can't rederive it yourself. This is maybe the only true introductory course I've taken at Yale. We actually started at the beginning and built from the ground up, so I feel like I have a strong foundation moving forward in statistics!! The take-home tests are perhaps the best and worst aspects of the class - low stress but also you can put as little or as much into this class as you'd like.",
    "I think this course was excellently structured to facilitate student learning and covered just about the right level of material. I honestly would not change this course.",
    "Good that the lectures are online. be ware that the S&DS 103 track is super frontloaded and all open note , online tests. Incredibly easy to get an A if you do the bare minimum. you learn a lot and the lectures are clear, interesting, organized. DO NOT CREDIT D IT... JUST TAKE IT FOR A GRADE ! you will thank me later.",
    "The TAs and professor make it very easy to do well in this class. If a student makes the effort to attend office hours, labs, and lecture then they will likely gain a solid understanding of the material and finish the class with a solid grade. However, as with any lecture of several hundred people, it is easy to get lost in the background. No one is holding you accountable for keeping up with the material, so if you are not a disciplined person it is easy to get behind.",
    "It was very well taught and managed by JDRS.",
    "Love that all the lectures are recorded so you can when to watch the lectures according your schedule.",
    "One of the most valuable things about this class is the video recording of class and other sessions. If you are a bit late to class, are sick and cannot make it, or need another explanation, it's all there. The use of Piazza was really helpful too. The TA's were very helpful too. I think improving the midterm\/final reviews to better fit the contents of the midterms and finals would be really beneficial.",
    "Strengths: Video recorded lectures! So clutch Weakness: video recorded lectures are honestly a double edged sword cause it's so easy to not go to class and fall behind",
    "Good course! Loved that it could be streamed, and the Professor was super helpful and accommodating.",
    "The largest strength of this class is its accessibility. With video recorded lectures and online quizzes, the course can bend to your schedule. There werent many weaknesses-- statistics is just dense. I have minimal suggestions for improvement.",
    "Strengths: video-captured lectures so you could watch them any time and fast forward the speed. JDRS was an engaging lecturer. Take home exams were a positive as well. Weaknesses: homework did not have a standardized grading procedure and grades varied widely among TAs, sometimes TAs were not helpful during office hours, and I did not enjoy the canvas quizzes, which are somehow factored into our grade.",
    "I loved the optionality to view lectures online, with attendance not even encouraged. JDRS is great.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is its online (open-note!) exams and the fact that the class is video recorded. Even if you decide to go to every class, it's still really useful to be able to watch things over again when you find yourself confused.",
    "Strengths: JDRS makes lectures fun and interesting. Great QR\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lectures were a bit dry, but that is the nature of stats",
    "I loved that the lectures were recorded online. Because I am a very busy person, I appreciated the fact that I could watch the lectures on my own free time. The organization of the course was also good and made sense.",
    "This class is very well taught and organized. Sometimes there wasn't much focus on equations, but I don't really know how important those are considering much of the work with them was done automatically by a program. \r\nI have a very clear understanding of statistical concepts and how different methods compute different outcomes. There are so many useful skills I have been exposed to in this class. It covers a lot of ground with many many many applications. The integration of concepts and programming was done really well, I am glad I took this class. \r\nI am also very glad this course was recorded even if I went to lecture, I would constantly be going back to rewatch sections or play back slowly difficult concepts.",
    "Nothing; really loved the recorded lectures and the amazing character that is JDRS",
    "Well-planned and executed. Great and accessible slides, many ways to get help, fantastic professor and online resources.",
    "strengths: lectures are recorded so you can always go back and listen to a lecture that you didn't quite get in the first place",
    "Strengths are JDRS. He is a charismatic instructor that makes you want to watch\/go to class, and his notes were very helpful and straightforward. Weaknesses are that Minitab is not a useful program so you can't translate any of the technical knowledge into any job. It could be improved by shifting towards SPSS as the main software package and putting a greater emphasis on the social sciences application aspect of the course.",
    "The online learning model works great for students!",
    "I think that things went quickly and the homework assignments were hard to do without a TA",
    "Its very fast-paced, so be prepared to make yourself study to catch up. The exams are very generous though - for 103 all the exams were take-home and open notes.",
    "The strength is definitely Professor Reuning-Scherer's enthusiasm and incredible lecturing style. The main weakness is the difference in support systems. ULAs for the course were incredibly disengaged and unprepared. For people who could not make TA's office hours and could only rely on ULAs, it proved a great disadvantage.",
    "A strength of the course was that it did not move too quickly through the material and everything was more comprehensible because of real-life examples. I wouldve enjoyed more direct feedback about my assignments and tests.",
    "Strengths: the presence of JDRS, a fantastic professor who keeps engagement at a high even in a lecture, very helpful as well\r\nall classes in his section (103) are video-captured, but I highly recommend coming to class to stay focused",
    "- the course is very well structured\r\n- all materials are available online",
    "Easy to fall behind, but office hours and optional labs are extremely helpful",
    "While the video lecture format (and not being forced to go to lecture) made it nice to be able to go over explanations, it made it too easy to procrastinate",
    "The course materials are incredibly well organized and lots of things are kept online which is helpful.",
    "I appreciated how the lectures were video captured so we could go back and review what was said in class. I thought the problem sets were also well designed to help you learn the material and grasp the core concepts that would later show up on exams.",
    "I found that it was possible to do fairly well in this course without having a full grasp of the material which was not ideal.",
    "I dont feel like I gained much from this course as assessments didnt reflect course material that we reviewed through problems but rather vague and general statistics information that made it hard to apply what we learned.",
    "A strength of the course was the online lectures, which worked very well with my schedule when I could not make it to class.",
    "The course covered a ton of material and moved really quickly, but JDRS was great at keeping lecture interesting. I also really appreciated that the courses were streamed online and I often watched them on my own time so that I could pause it and take notes and rewatch certain parts of lecture that were harder for me to understand.",
    "This course is incredibly flexible in that all the lectures are videotaped and available on Canvas. The midterm and finals are take home and open note, which I found to be amenable to my schedule yet still challenging.",
    "Strengths: All the information and lectures were presented in ways that were easily accessible. There were tons of opportunities for getting extra help from TAs and office hours. The class was live streamed, which was really nice. Lots of important statistics methods were covered. I also really appreciated that the midterms and final were take home because I felt as though a closed book exam setting is never how statistics is actually done in the real world. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class moves very quickly.",
    "strengths - recorded lectures, professor JDRS's enthusiasm, the application based nature of the homework, structure of the course \r\nweaknesses - the information available to us about the midterms, it was kind of last minute and didn't;t leave enough time to prepare. the number of TAs was also really great, but a few weren't actually able to explain to me things covered in lectures and so on.",
    "I like how the lectures were recorded, it saved a lot of time and allowed us to rewatch parts that we needed to. Lecturer is very engaging, clearly very experienced with the material. Overall the course is pretty organized.",
    "Very practical, but moved through content a bit too quickly.",
    "The grading and TA system of this course is truly a joke. The TAs were unbelievably inconsistent with their grading, meaning very similar responses could receive no points off from one TA, and 3-5 points off from another. Each TA should grade one question of the pset for all students (if this is too much for the first half of the course, then at the very least it should be the practice in the second half when the class splits up) in order to have consistency across students. This is how every other class employing student TAs that I have been a part of functions, and the fact that this isn't already the practice in this class is ridiculous. Not to mention the fact that TAs were unhelpful and often inaccurate in their grading and feedback, to the point of basic addition errors. If a Yale class is going to ask students to be TAs, they might as well work out a system where they can do it semi-acceptably.",
    "The strengths of the course was the structure and the lectures, especially the way the lectures showed how statistics can be used to solve real life problems in many fields. Some weaknesses is that there was a bit too much repetition sometimes.",
    "This course was great about making academic resources available through optional labs, extra sources, and office hours. It could be improved by providing explanations to quiz questions. Also, sometimes during the lectures I had difficulty discerning which mathematical elements were central to understanding the  concepts and would be tested, versus those concepts that were only meant as educational aids.",
    "grading was great since so much was focused on your psets. If you do the psets (well) you'll be fine! JDRS is also a funny lecturer and very engaging. Biggest strength of the course was the video lectures! just don't fall behind!! I was surprised how easily i learned despite my fear of QR courses. Weakness is we have to fit a lot of content in a short amount of time, but i surprisingly NEVER felt anything was too impossible or out of reach.",
    "I thought that course was structured well. This course did have discrepancies in how the PSETs were graded. It made doing really well on a pset be entirely dependent on who was grading that pset regardless of how many office hours you went to.",
    "I loved how the classes were video captured! It really helped me because it allowed me to spend more time working in my research lab during the day and I watched the videos at night.",
    "Strengths: JDRS puts all of his lectures online, which meant that I was able to take a class that cut into what would have been in-class stats. I could speed forward or go back as much as I wanted, which was such a tremendous help whenever I caught myself zoning out or just needed to better understand a concept. JDRS is also a very engaged professor. This class could have easily been taught in a monotonous robot-style, but JDRS puts in the effort to make stats as fun as stats can feasibly be. Lastly, the online exams were super helpful! If anything, they made me feel like I was actually forced to learn more and apply the concepts rather than just do brute memorization for an in-class exam.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I kind of wish we could've learned probability more in depth or for longer. For someone who didn't think they'd like stats too much, I was really fascinated by what we learned. However, I felt like a majority of the probability unit went right over my head.",
    "The whole online format for me was really a plus.  It really depends on your learning style, but as someone who is more independent the online format was conducive to my learning style. As long as you keep up with the lectures and go to office hours (which are a huge plus) you should be good to go.  JDRS has this class so streamlined and it shows.",
    "I think this course was very well organized. I really liked that there were videos you could watch because you could go back to something you wanted to clarify or repeat something.",
    "I appreciated that we did not have to buy a textbook for this course, as this was very helpful to me financially. I also appreciated that all of the work felt like it was important to developing my understanding of statistics - I did not feel as though there was busywork. I also liked that the schedule of office hours was so clear. \r\nIt was nice in many ways to have the lectures video recorded, as this allowed me to get lunch. However, I am conflicted about how I feel overall about this, as I feel like I did not interact much with my classmates.",
    "Strengths: pace, lecture capture, abundance of TAs, p-sets not too bad, enthusiastic prof, etc.\r\nWeaknesses: terrible TF, too many students in the class, horrific exam questions, unstandardized grading practices across TAs.",
    "enjoyed set up with online homework, class, tests and quizzes.",
    "Would be good to have more office hour appointments closer to the due date of the problem sets. Professor was really good",
    "Online videos were very helpful. Not much more to improve."

    "Yes",
    "yes, professor Reuning-Scherer is absolutely amazing, this course is very flexible, and a great introduction to statistics.",
    "Definitely. Very useful skill for any field",
    "Ok yes, but I guess really take advantage of the fact that JDRS actually cares about your learning so don't just focus on tests and homework and actually try to learn the stuff if you care- go to his office hours, labs, etc",
    "If you need a QR and you're not a math person go for it. If you really want to engage with stats at a higher level or want to major in S&DS I'd look for a higher level class.",
    "Yes! It was a great, low stress way to learn basic statistics.",
    "Yes! A good basic introduction to statistics. Be aware though that you only learn how to use minitab- which apparently isnt super helpful in other stats courses as there is no coding involved.",
    "Honestly, there's probably easier QRs out there if you're looking for a gut QR.",
    "This class is the magical trifecta that every student hopes to hit: low workload, high reward, and video-recorded so you can watch from the comfort of your own bed at 2x speed!!!!! Like Khan Academy but infinitely better. Every Yale student should take this course. I have learned so much from this class, and it's made a lot of my other classes easier to understand as a result, from econ to bio. Stats is everywhere, and I didn't even realize it until I started learning about it. Warning that you'll only get as much out of this class as you put in though - midterms are open-book, so it's easy to not pay attention in lecture and still do fine on the exams. I would recommend paying attention though!!! JDRS is really funny and wants you to succeed.",
    "Yes, I could encourage any student who wants to gain a higher level of understanding of statistics that they encounter in other courses and reading materials.",
    "yes, good way to learn statistics in a non-stressful environment",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a student seeking to gain a basic understanding of statistics. Even a non-data science major can benefit greatly from the material covered in this class, as statistical models are used in a variety of other disciplines as well.",
    "I would, especially if you're looking to get a taste for what statistics is really like. It's really a great course for anyone wanting to dip their toes or even explore the field as a major.",
    "Yes. Very useful and entry-level stats course. JDRS is a great instructor, and he organizes the course in a way that won't make you stress about grades but still facilitates you to learn the knowledge.",
    "I would. I think this course is a good introduction to statistics, as it should be. It really sets a base for those who do not plan on taking statistics any further.",
    "If you wanted to get an introduction to statistics, yes. The stuff we learned was overall pretty interesting",
    "Yes! Good intro to stats and gives you what you need for todays world in the general workforce",
    "Yes - easy QR credit, great for skills requirement for CGSC majors too. Be sure to take 103 with JDRS and not one of the other intro classes!",
    "I took this course because of my major requirement, and Im sure most do, but it was a pretty good comprehensive introduction to statistics so I have no reason to not recommend it. I wouldnt consider this course a gut, but with a light enough course-load and enough motivation, it is easy to survive.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to people who want to learn basic statistics in preparation for more advanced courses.",
    "Absolutely. JDRS is wonderful and there is so much help available if you need it. The course is designed to help you learn and succeed.",
    "I would really recommend this course to another student, especially with JDRS! His office hours are very useful and he is immensely helpful for understanding concepts and the psets. The online exams are fair but take caution that they are still comprehensive exams for the most part so don't rely on just using on your notes to do well. I found that the best way to study was to study as if I couldn't use my notes and then to just highlight any hard topics that I might be confused on for the actual exam.",
    "Definitely. If you need a QR, take stats with JDRS! Every class is video-captured so you don't have to go to the classroom if you don't want to.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, because you actually learn so much without as much stress. Stats is very necessary in all different fields of research, and these skills are worth having.",
    "Yes, it is really helpful if you are someone who hasn't had much experience to statistics or programs using statistics. there are so many applications to what you learn. The course is well organized and the TAs were very helpful throughout the process.",
    "Sure; for those actually looking to pursue statistics or even for those who need a QR credit",
    "Yes, especially S&DS103 out of all the 100 series classes.",
    "Yes; great introduction accessible to everyone (including if you don't have prior statistics knowledge, which I did not)! However, does not introduce to statistical software\/programs unless you choose to do so, which I believe few do",
    "Yes, it teaches you very useful skills especially if you're looking to do research in the future",
    "I would recommend it if you did not take AP Stats and aren't looking for a coding based stats introduction.",
    "Yes take it!!!!",
    "This is ultimately a very good class. JDRS is a great teacher and so clearly cares about his students. The material is basic  intro stats. But the way he teaches it facilitates learning to the point that he makes it so easy to go to class (either in-person or online) but also necessary to keep up with work. You will learn MINITAB software well and have a good time. Very good QR credit where you'll actually learn something",
    "Its a good intro course",
    "Yes, course was designed to facilitate learning and truly benefit the student",
    "Yes, but only if they are 100% certain that they are able to hold themselves accountable. It is incredibly easy to fall behind based on one bad week, so people should go into it knowing that they have to be consistently present.",
    "Yesif youre looking to learn basic statistics, this course is great and not that complicated! The last five weeks after splitting into sections are definitely easier than the first eight, but everything is useful. Expect a large lecture course, but if you need help with material there are tons of office hours and lab periods to help you out! Every lecture is also video recorded, which is very nice because you dont need to attend the physical class if you dont want to.",
    "Yes, with JDRS this class is pretty great. He makes stats much more enjoyable than expected. His classes are all video-captured, so you can easily stay on target. Exams were open note because of JDRS's philosophy, which makes sense. He says you'll never be given a stats problem without your resources in the real world, and he's right. Overall, it was a great experience for a stats class.",
    "Yes, great introduction to statistics that equips you with all the necessary basic statistical skills.",
    "Definitely! JDRS is an amazing lecturer and the information taught in this class is important",
    "If they have the discipline to watch all the lectures, would recommend",
    "Most definitely! If youre looking to learn stats, its a great class to take.",
    "no",
    "Definitely would recommend as an introductory stats course. You learn all the foundational concepts that you need for further stats courses, and JDRS is great at conveying the material.",
    "If you are into stats, then yes! otherwise, I found it hard to engage with the material without a base level of interest.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this to someone who does not have a lot of knowledge in statistics, but who wants to gain knowledge and be around an awesome professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who wants a great introduction to statistics, but I will also say that you need to really put a lot of work into the course to get a lot out. If you watch every lecture and go to office hours, youll learn a ton.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student of any discipline seeking to begin to learn statistics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is looking to get a basic understanding of some general statistics methods. The class definitely moves quickly, but it is manageable and there are lots of opportunities for getting help if you don't understand something.",
    "yes!!! a really great intro stat course, especially if you're humanities inclined\/ don't really know what statistics is about and so on. take it with prof. JDRS if you can, he's such a great and enthusiastic professor! He makes concepts very easily accessible, understandable and just enjoyable. I found a lot of the topics we covered pretty interesting and look to take another stats course in the future!",
    "Sure. Its a pretty easy QR credit if you need it.",
    "Its a pretty good class although I just took it for a QR, and Im not sure how much of the knowledge I will retain in the future. Johnathan is great!",
    "Yes. It's a great introductory course for learning statistics.",
    "yes! JDRS is an excellent teacher",
    "Definitely. It's an awesome class, and JDRS is great, clearly has a passion for teaching, and does an unbelievable amount to provide learning resources for the students.",
    "Yes I would since it is a good introductory course to statistics, a very important field for many majors.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this as a survey course, useful to many disciplines. Its good for students who need quantitative credit, good for those interested in any social science, and I found the skills to be very applicable.",
    "i would definitely recommend this course to someone looking for an interesting and useful QR (especially PLSC majors who want to know what is actually going on in quantitative literature!)",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. Especially if taught by JDRS, the course is possibly as engaging as statistics can get. This is a great QR credit if you need one and are not really a QR kind of person.",
    "Yes, S&DS 103 was great. It was structured like the first half of the class, with video capture.",
    "I definitely would. Stats is a useful math. If you're in a major where they collect any sort of data or show some sort of data graphs, it's great to actually be able to contextualize what those graphs mean; you'll feel much more secure in the methodology of data presentation.",
    "Yes! Please take this course as an intro to stats! It's pretty low stakes yet you gain a lot of important insights. JDRS has this course really figured out and presents info super streamlined and conducive to learning.  PSets aren't bad, office hours are a huge plus, and exams are not hard either... they're open book.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course or someone who just needs a QR credit because at the end of the day you do learn a lot. I would also recommend it to people who need a ma tbh credit for their major.",
    "Yes. Statistics is very useful and this was a great way to get a basis in it.",
    "Sure - easy to follow, can watch at your pace on lecture capture, TAs help with p-sets immensely, and the exams are the only difficult part.",
    "yes. basic, simple QR credit for non stem kids.",
    "Yes, helpful even if not required for your major",
    "Yes if they need to fulfill a statistical requirement."
