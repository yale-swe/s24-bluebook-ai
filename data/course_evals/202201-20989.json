He teaches in a very understanding and relatable way, and he meets students where they are for the most part in terms of their musical context before the start of the course. I would say that having only 30 min. section with one other person was a bit strange at times and may not have been as helpful as a bigger section with a bit more time.",

                "My only complaint about this class is that some extent of ear training is assumed. This makes the class harder to keep up with if you have none, but Dr. Adam is very understanding and accommodating!",

                "Wouldn't change a thing!!",
                "The course is super relaxed and still helps you improve at sight reading/dictation from whatever level you started at. Dr. Adam made the class very low pressure. No weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: Practicing everyday, class sessions were very practical and emphasized practicing as a way to get better\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Course goals/objectives/expectations were not clear at the beginning; started very quickly and barely received guidance on how to approach the different exercises",
                "+ This class was originally the \"section\" of MUSI 210, and Professor Adams tries to keep it true to its dynamic, practice-based roots. He keeps lecturing to a minimum, and includes some sort of sight-singing or rhythmic practices in most every class. This was a very enjoyable 50 minutes each week.\r\n- Professor Adams has a peculiar, almost vindictive attitude towards people with perfect pitch. Under the theory that they should learn to recognize notes \"the normal way\", by gauging the size of intervals, he made us transcribe dictations in a different key than they were actually played in. This caused quite a few headaches for the fourth of the class with some degree of absolute pitch -- as it forces you to actually fight competing impulses, where one part of your brain says \"that's a C#\", but the other says \"no, he said this piece was in C!\" The only solution, as far as I can tell, is to practice suppressing your ear \r\nfor pitch, rather than learning to use it to its fullest potential. I know Dr. Adams just wants to \"even the playing field,\" but the result triggers a sort of psychological warfare which actually disadvantages those with some degree of absolute pitch."

The TA, P. Bixby, was also very helpful.",
