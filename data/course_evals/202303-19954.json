I gained new tools for research, and a better ability to comprehend new sources. I gained deeper insights into the field of AI, specifically concerning its ethical impacts and implications.",
                "I developed my writing and research skills. I learned how to thread different topics together and thought deeply about can be classified as an author. \r\n\r\nI also learned how to use AI. Before this class, I was hesitant to use ChatGPT because I was unsure of what was considered plagiarism. I was also unsure of when to use google and when to use ChatGPT - I've now learned some of their different use cases.",

A greater sense of enthusiasm from my fellow students would have made the discussions more enjoyable.",
                "The strengths of this course were the interesting topic discussions and independence to choose what those topics were. The P3 research papers were the core of the course and it was a great experience to hear everyone else discuss their own independent fascinations concerning applications of AI. The instructor's feedback was also wonderful, both in discussion and on essays. The weaknesses of this course were simply the first half. The course appears to be advertised as essay writing for STEM majors so they can improve their writing while researching relevant topics to their field of interest. The first half of the course felt more like humanities majors exploring AI, with extensive focus on concepts such as authorship, creativity, and originality in essay writing and art making.",
                "Strengths: interesting (very relevant) topic, engaging readings (that were not too long so you could actually read them)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this class pulls a lot of STEM majors trying to get a writing credit, so class discussion were often dry, with only a couple kids consistently speaking",
                "The strength of this course is its content and its instructor. I felt that the content was very engaging and interesting, and I had a sense of confidence that each reading assignment was going to be stimulating. I also felt that Professor Glaser was an amazing instructor in both creating the curriculum and providing feedback in our work. I could see some improvement in collaborative work, as some collaborative assignments weren't that helpful, but I do not think that is the fault of the professor."

                "I would recommend this course for students who are STEM majors and\/or have a strong interest in AI applications and ethics. It's a well structured course that would prove helpful to anyone who took it, but I think only those specifically interested in the subject should greatly consider taking it.",
                "Yes - the topic is really interesting and relevant. However, the course title is a bit misleading. Students should know that there's a big emphasis on deep philosophical questions (ie. what is an author? what is creativity?) and less time spent on actually analyzing\/using AI-produced writing.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The course was fun and stimulating, lecture was interesting and engaging. The topic itself is quite niche, but I feel that everyone would benefit from this course in this day and age.",
