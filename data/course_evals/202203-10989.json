I would also appreciate clearer guidelines and more feedback throughout the semester.",

Professor Nelson is great and I always had a good time in class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses  it would be helpful if students could get more feedback on their work rather than just point deductions without any reasoning as to why we lost points.",

Although the course is aimed at juniors and seniors, I think it is better designed for earlier researchers. Additionally, the course was easy but grading was quite obscure.",
