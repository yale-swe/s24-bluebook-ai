   "comments": [
    "Reading scientific papers and breaking down figures, connections across cytoskeletal systems and between cytoskeleton and disease",
    "I was able to practice reading actual biology journal articles and learn more about the different experiments and laboratory techniques used to answer different types of research questions.",
    "Learned so much about how to read scientific papers with scrutiny. Learned some new experimental methods as well.",
    "My scientific paper-reading skills improved phenomenally in this class. It is definitely a self-motivated course, and we all pushed ourselves to understand more about the papers every single week. I feel like I know an incredible amount about this field of science now (cytoskeletal dynamics and proteins).",
    "Cytoskeleton and diseases!",
    "How to read and analyze cell biology papers; especially how to understand figures and read papers effectively.",
    "This class was instrumental in helping me develop a systematic way to read scientific papers. I learned how to read papers faster and think about the methods\/figures more critically. Reading the first paper and doing the reading response took 6 hours but by the end of the semester I learned how to read more efficiently and take away more from each paper. Also, I learned about various parts of the cytoskeleton and how each is implicated in a disease pathology and I learned new experimental methods which I presented on.",
    "I learned about how malfunctions in various cytoskeletal components can be linked to diseases and disorders. It was fascinating to make the link between dysfunctions at the protein-level to large-scale diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's).",
    "I feel like I learned so much in this class. Most importantly, I learned how to really breakdown a paper and track the thought process of the researchers to understand why they did what they did and what it actually means. I also learned many experimental techniques utilized and just overall vital information on the cytoskeleton through the lens of the papers that first discovered them.",
    "how to read scientific papers, analyze figures, discuss them thoughtfully with my peers",
    "I learned so much about how to critically read and analyze scientific papers, how to identify key experiments, and about both classic and new methods in the cell biology field. I learned a lot more about the cytoskeleton than what I had previously learned in the cell biology course, and it was all super interesting!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Dean C is super understanding of seniors taking the class, HW is essentially completion based - she will expect you to be engaged in class and have read the paper, and otherwise facilitates great discussion",
    "Strengths: participation was really equal, which made it easy to want to participate in class. Additionally, the structure of the class was really reliable in that I always knew what was expected of me, and once I figured out how best to prepare for class, as long as I put in that amount of effort each week, the workload was really manageable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I really enjoyed reading the papers at the end of the semester that we got to vote on, and I wish we could have had a few more weeks of that.",
    "Dean C was the best part of this course. She is so supportive and wanted to make sure everyone understood the concepts, first and foremost. There was only one paper a week, which was so manageable. The reading responses were a bit time consuming but were a very thoughtful challenge. I could feel myself improving with comprehension every single week after reading and writing about the papers.",
    "None! Dean C is really really open and transparent. The only minor downside is that she is a little slow with grading.",
    "A definite strength is that you get so much practice reading papers! I went from taking 2 days to read whole paper thoroughly to a few hours and my level of comprehension increased dramatically!",
    "Strengths: Dean C is so supportive and tells really fun stories from her research career that relate to the papers we read, this class was very structured and allowed me to constantly practice reading and analyzing papers, it is low stress since there is no exam so I was able to learn in a supportive environment, the other students in class were friendly\r\nWeaknesses: the 9:25 am class time was rough since I'm not a morning person, but it was worth it",
    "A big strength is Dean C; she made the class incredibly engaging, while also selecting papers at an appropriate amount of difficulty. She also struck a good balance between presentations, discussion, and Q&A. The only weakness I can think of is that for me, it was a bit hard to jump into a class based on reading scientific papers; perhaps a bit of a crash course into how to read a paper as well as a handout of common terms could be useful. However, I did develop this skill greatly throughout the semester, so this is certainly not a necessity to implement.",
    "I really thought it was very well laid out. The papers were great, the discussion was great, and I liked that a different group was supposed to present the background and significance each week rather than doing it by yourself each time. Perhaps a bit more guidance could have been given on the final spotlight paper, but other than that, it was all well defined and well run.",
    "The strength is the other students in the class, who drive lively discussion of the papers and are genuinely interested in learning about the topics. A weakness is that a couple times the papers were a little on the dry side."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, for MCDB seniors",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it was a different way to learn biology than the other lectures we have to take for the major. It was also a really great way to learn more about lab techniques, which I definitely wish I had known before about before I started to work in a lab.",
    "Absolutely. Dean C is the best. If you can get in, take the class.",
    "100%. It is a great upper level MCDB course to take and is perfect with senior year. It is much more manageable than other upper level MCDB courses I've taken.",
    "100%! dean C is awesome and it's nice to take a bio seminar. I liked reading one paper per week and really getting to understand the experiments and why the authors chose to do them (Dean C is very insightful)",
    "YES!",
    "Absolutely! The work load is very manageable and as an MCDB major its important to have practice reading paper, presenting papers, and writing spot-light\/ reviews on literature! You get to practice all these skills in this class in a low stress environment!",
    "Definitely fill out the form to get into this class-- the roster is determined by lottery. This class is so worth it-- it was both intellectually challenging but also a supportive environment to learn",
    "YES",
    "If you are an MCDB senior looking for your senior requirement, go for this class! It is much better, in my opinion, to take a seminar to fulfill it because you do not get many opportunities to take seminars in this major. Plus, Dean Chandhoke is so sweet and smart and made the class very enjoyable.",
    "i wouldn't say this is a low-workload class--it may have been for others, but i wasn't used to reading primary literature, so reading the paper for each week would take me a really long time. that being said, i think doing that week after week made it easier and helped me become more familiar with how to read papers, which i appreciated.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any MCDB senior who has a genuine interest in learning about the cytoskeleton, or wants to become more proficient in reading, analyzing, and discussing scientific papers. It's a great class to take and has a pretty low workload, which is a bonus."
