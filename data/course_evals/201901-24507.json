    "this course provided me deeper insight on the foundation of systemically oppressive forces.",
    "I learned a lot about the spatial formations of prison, plantation, and ghetto, individually, and when connected to one another. I also learned more about ways to historicize modern understandings of these places, within the context of the histories discussed in this course.",
    "In this course I developed my speaking skills and my analytical skills. I learned a lot about the three spaces that name this class and the ways they have continued the oppression of black people throughout history and today.",
    "i learned a lot about the prison abolition movement and the fluid, atemporal connection between the plantation, prison, and ghetto spaces."

   "comments": [
    "At times the readings seemed superfluous, but the content overall was great, and the student-led classes were insightful\/interesting.",
    "I really liked that the course involved three student-led seminars at the end of the semester, as I felt this allowed all of us to show the ways of thinking that we'd learned throughout the semester, and allowed us to learn from one another. I also liked how open-ended the final project was, leading to a more creative way of thinking than I've traditionally been able to use in other courses.",
    "strengths: lots of opportunity for student leadership, good readings, interesting videos and podcasts used in classrooms as discussion points\r\n\r\nweaknesses: felt slightly unstructured because so much of it was led by the students"

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in the levels to which oppression against black bodies exist, yes; I would say that this information could be found in an easier class though.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as a way of learning more about the three spaces and historical subjects of prison, plantation, and ghetto. The readings for this course are great and taught me so much about these spaces, and the open-ended discussion contributed to greater knowledge production for everyone in the course.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who wants to understand the current prison system and concept of the ghetto through the lens of slavery and the plantation.",
    "yes if they're interesting in the construction of space and power"
