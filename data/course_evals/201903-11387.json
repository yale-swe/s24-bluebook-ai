   "comments": [
    "I learned how to dictate music both harmonically and rhythmically, and I greatly improved on my ability to identify chord qualities, sight-sing, sight-read in general, and generally hear music in a more analytic fashion.",
    "I learned how to evaluate intervals, recognize chords, sight-sing and listen to both harmonic and rhythmic dictation. Even though I have had experiences on these topics before, this class gave me a lot more confidence in them: especially with harmonic dication.",
    "I got better at sight singing\/rhythm reading, hearing intervals and types of chords, and rhythmic, melodic, and harmonic dictation. I also practiced lots of piano!",
    "musicianship skills: dictation, sight-singing, interval practice, musical hearing (chord types, intervals, etc.)",
    "I filled in a lot of the gaps in my ear training that I had been struggling with from intervals to 4 part dictation.",
    "I learned to hear intervals, chord inversions and different 7 chords. I learned how to do formal harmonic, melodic and rhythmic dictations. I practiced my sight-reading, learned about logical chord progressions and am now able to play more on the piano!",
    "Learned dictation skills, auditory skills, and piano skills. Very helpful for me as a non-music major who is a musician but does not have a strong theory background.",
    "I learned the basics of sightsinging, dictation, and music theory relating to rhythm, melody, and harmony."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One of the strengths of this course was its pace. I felt that it was paced reasonably well so that we could really master each topic as it came along. I can't really think of any ways to improve this course. Professor Conlee did a really wonderful job with providing us practice material as we went along with the course to aid us in learning the concepts as they were introduced. I do wish, however, that we would have learned more about different chord qualities than major, minor, and diminished, as I feel that this is one of the concepts that most of the class picked up on pretty quickly.",
    "The class is very engaging and the professor was incredibly kind and understanding. She taught the topics well while also providing many opportunities to practice them both in and out of the classroom. Her exams were not unreasonable at all, and she also tried to tie the topics we were learning in the class to our personal interests. I guess one weakness is that after the midterm, more challenging topics were introduced, however, we were not given as much exposure to them. This made them seem more difficult than they actually were, and made the final harder than expected.",
    "It's a good environment to learn in, very friendly professor and classmates. No weaknesses!",
    "Strengths: low-stakes environment. good practice of harmony and other info.",
    "Course was taught very well and was a decent amount of work for me because I didnt have much ear training background.",
    "A major strength was the focus on more than just classical music. It was easier for us to relate to and hear genres like pop, rock, rap etc. Also the in-class practice dictations and listening were super helpful. The class could have gone over more theory but I understand that you are supposed to take it with 210 (it just doesnt work for a lot of peoples schedules to take both)",
    "Strengths: Jade... duh",
    "Strengths: having homework for every class forced me to practice material, so I never felt too behind; class was paced at a level that was too slow at some points and too fast at others, but it averaged out well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: felt behind at times because other students were taking 210 and I was not; maybe a section with only students not taking 210 would have been more effective; keyboarding lab was unorganized and therefore confusing at times"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. I would recommend this course to anyone who is not super comfortable with sight-singing or who has had little formal training in music but wants to learn more. If you are already somewhat comfortable with sight-singing, dictation, major and minor modes, basic chord qualities (major, minor, diminished), etc., you may find skipping to MUSI 219 more rewarding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student at Yale who is interested in improving their ear-training skills. It might be a little bit simple for people who have had extensive experience in music theory before, however, it is still a valuable class to take because no matter what, it will definitely teach you new things.",
    "Yes, it was great! Not difficult and I learned helpful musicianship skills.",
    "If you want to improve musicianship skills, then yes. Great if you're in an acapella group and want to improve.",
    "Yes, if you are a musician then I would highly recommend taking this course.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, Jade is a fantastic, helpful professor who really enjoys being in class with learners. She will gladly set up meeting times to help you with your skills if needed. Overall, it was a great experience.",
    "Yes! for someone who missed studying music, this is a really great course to do so in a low-stress way that doesn't take up too much extra time! It's also a nice change of material for studying compared to other classes you'll take."
