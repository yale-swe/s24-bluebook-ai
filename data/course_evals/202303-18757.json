Although I learned a lot of this stuff in high school, I believe the education was very superficial. I felt that I was being consistently challenged, and it really helped to change my perspective on the amount of time and effort I put into learning the key concepts. I found myself having to learn how each topic interacted and connected with other ones within the course. Overall, I felt the most challenged in this course and I enjoyed it the most out of all my courses.",

                "Not if you do not have to take a math. If you do, I would definitely recommend this over 112. That said, though it is a well-structured class with wonderful professors, definitely consider time commitments. Prior evaluations do not note the mandatory 1-hour weekly dedication to a workshop, the ULA hours in the evenings you will want to go to every once in a while (they are helpful!!), office hours you will also find yourself attending here and there, and potential 1-hour dedication to a peer tutoring session. I enjoyed what I learned as a student who hadn't previously taken calc, but definitely just consider the time outside of the classroom."
