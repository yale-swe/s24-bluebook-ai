I can't really remember any specific techniques that he named, and lyric writing seems just as difficult and mysterious as it did before I took the class.",

                "Professor Korie treated students differently based on whether they were theater\/music majors or not. He gave the \"serious\" writers a lot more screentime. A more specific curriculum would also have been nice. The guests were interesting, but they took up too much time that we could have spent learning lyric writing techniques.",
                "I thought this course was excellent. One stand-out strength is the real-world nature of it, especially having guest specialists attend our classes and give live feedback. \r\n\r\nWe did an overview of the genres of musical theatre and opera in class, and were assigned listening from both genres for homework, but I still feel I am a little lacking in broader knowledge about each genre. There are many musicals and operas I haven't seen and don't know anything about. Maybe one way to address this would be to have a shortlist of say 20 of the most \"must-watch\" from each genre, and have the students pick one, watch it in full, summarise it and present back to the class the next week? That way we could all learn the key plot and numbers from the major musicals in a high-speed way, from each other."

You won't listen to shows the same way, you'll gain an appreciation for OPERA of all things. Professor Korie brings in a bunch of really great guest teachers that are wonderful and giving."
