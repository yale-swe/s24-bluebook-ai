                "Strengths: The course was very interesting (the material and books were honestly fascinating and a pleasure to read). The discussions were also lively and engaging, so the seminar went by very fast. The diversity in topics was also fascinating; the blend of political science and anthropology was super cool. The guest speakers were also fascinating to listen to and talk with! \r\nWeaknesses: This course felt very disorganized at moments. Assignments were constantly being changed (instructions were contradictory, etc)\r\nand readings were switched on short notice (which made it hard to deal with the assignments). Additionally, the class time wasn't well divided, so we would often briefly skim certain readings or run out of time.",
                "I liked the readings that we had to do and the papers were manageable as well.",
                "A lot of the time, we weren't able to discuss all the readings and instructions for what the professors were looking for in terms of grading for response essays and presentations was relatively unclear. Some of the content was very interesting and the class would have great discussions.",
                "I think that this class was very focused on the topic, which was great! Although I do think one area of improvement could be better communication about the response papers/what was expected of us for them. I really enjoyed the readings and the student presentations on them. The discussions were interesting and I appreciated the digitally interactive nature of the course which worked well on zoom."

The one thing I would say is to maybe keep in mind that certain elements of the course are very much a \"work-in-progress,\" which can be quite frustrating when you're just trying to do your coursework. That being said, I still enjoyed this seminar. If you're interested in learning about genocide or mass atrocities and memorialization, I would say take it. Just know that this is very much not a classic poli sci class.",

We focused less on learning about the mass atrocities behind the memorials and more on the memorials themselves (and the idea of memorialization."
