                "The idea of \"first\"s in literature allows for us to engage with a great variety of material, both within the readings and the meta-context surrounding it. Most of the readings were classical works as expected, and some are works by celebrated authors before they came into fame, but the course makes all of them interesting - the seminar format encourages us to candidly discuss the entertaining and sometimes ridiculous details embedded within these novels. The greatest strength of the course, however, is by far Seamus. His understanding and chill nature makes coming to class always a relaxing and fun time, and it means that you can focus on doing your best without worrying too much about deadlines. If there's something that you are either struggling with or want to work on, you can easily get an appointment with him, and he'll set you on a really clear path. The only area of improvement I could see for the course is in its organization; more time could be dedicated to a wider range of works on the syllabus rather than the one extended novel and research paper assignment.",
                "Strengths: Seamus is an amazing and incredible professor. His care and understanding for our class was beyond that of any other professor I have had! He was always available to talk to us outside of class about our papers and would give us feedback on drafts. The feedback that I received on my papers were incredibly helpful. I would highly, highly recommend taking a course with him. Weaknesses: None!"

                "If you are looking for a nice, chill environment to discuss readings with people and get a writing credit while learning real ways to strengthen your language skills, definitely take this class! Keep in mind, though, that this is a class where you should be completing your readings in full in order to make the most of it, but I've found that the amount has been mostly manageable even during busy weeks in the semester. (Also, do make sure that you've kept up with at least one TV show because class discussions usually start with them)",
