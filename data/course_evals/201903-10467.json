   "comments": [
    "I learned about various physiological systems in the body in much greater detail than I have ever been exposed to in past science classes. It has made me see the human body in a different light and think about problems in new ways. This course was very interesting.",
    "Knowledge of body systems (in quite a level of detail)",
    "Point to a part of your body and I could tell you something about how and why it functions; in addition, I could tell you what it does in relation to other organs\/systems in the body.",
    "A really good understanding of the mechanisms of the pulmonary, cardiovascular, sensory, and digestive systems.",
    "I learned about the various organ systems in the body and how they are regulated.",
    "I FEEL SO KNOWLEDGABLE ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY. IT REALLY ALL CONNECTS. It is a scary amount of information thrown at you, but honestly, it makes conceptual sense and makes you re-evaluate your entire life and everything that happens from that point forward. Everything in your daily routine will trigger you back to a physio lecture. The tests are really not as scary as you think. Like there is a lot of info, but the exams are not nitty gritty.",
    "I learned more than I thought I could.",
    "I learned a ton about human physiology but also how to reason through a problem and look at it holistically and incorporate a wide array of information.",
    "Lots about human physiology! Definitely a great course if youre interested in the material but there was a lot to know.",
    "Understanding human anatomy, the complex systems and how they are all connected. Super interesting course and amazing professors. A TON to memorize... You get what you put into the course.",
    "How the body works",
    "Very interesting medical knowledge about how the body is supposed to work.",
    "General and basic\/intermediate knowledges of the body and its processes\/functions.",
    "I learned a lot about systems in the body, and how they function.",
    "Physio",
    "This class teaches you how the body works at both the systems level and cellular\/molecular level.",
    "Learned how to think about systems of the body",
    "This course was a comprehensive and fascinating introduction to and overview of how the human body works, from a cellular level up through a systems level. It began with a review of basic cell physiology before building that knowledge, combined with physical laws, empirical observations, and anatomy, to understand how the body maintains its internal environment and responds to the world around it.",
    "I learned so much about how the human body works. You truly learn an incredible amount of information in this class.",
    "This class was one of the most stressful and difficult classes I have ever taken -- but also one of the most rewarding classes. The material was interesting and I seemed to be mind blown in every single lecture. I definitely learned a lot about the human body at the microscopic level and how to ask the \"why\" questions and problem solve on a deeper level.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of how the human body functions through each organ system. Good for premeds",
    "Great foundation on the different systems of the body (cardiac, respiratory, nervous, endocrine, digestive, renal, and a couple more). You learn a lot about the body and how it works. Really interesting, solid class.",
    "A detailed understanding of the human body- overall knowledge about human physiological systems",
    "I learned human anatomy and physiology."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There's so much information that this course covers. The learning objectives at the end of each lecture were helpful for knowing what we need to study, but sometimes the powerpoints were very helpful when looking back at them. If they had a little more information or guidance in them, it would be much better.",
    "Strengths: material was relevant to anybody in the biomedical field\r\nweaknesses: inevitably heavy in material, but was manageable since instructors and TAs genuinely cared about learning. Just don't underestimate the amount of material and be ready to spend about 2 credits' worth of time.",
    "In general this course was comprehensive and fast-paced. Exams were incredibly fair, and the TA's were great. I liked Dr. Campbell's and Dr. Saltzmann's lectures; it's clear that they integrate student feedback into each iteration of the course, and the course style was near-perfect.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I was annoyed with was the content. I wish we had spent more time on the reproductive system and bone ossification and less time on the kidney. Dr. Aaronson was wonderful to talk to, but I think his lectures could have gone faster so the main points wouldn't have been lost (I got so, so bored in the kidney lectures). I wish connections between the systems we learned about were emphasized more in later lectures (even just a quick reference to how this would affect another system would be interesting - i.e. cardiac and pulmonary). I also wish slides would be available to students further in advance! At the beginning of the course, I took notes before the lectures. Slides were posted later and later throughout the semester so I had to stop doing that.\r\n\r\nOverall this course was a comprehensive overview of the body. As a non-premed, it's a bit of a bummer to take it with pre-meds because it airs on the side of an anatomy\/physiology course instead of engineering, but the profs were awesome and the content was clear.",
    "Strengths: the material is interesting. the professors (saltzman and campbell particularly) are really good teachers. they are passionate about the material and approachable in terms of questions and they seem invested in the class. the book was helpful for things you didnt understand, but not necessary. section was actually helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I dont think the guest lectures added much. I think the class went too in depth for certain systems (i.e. six entire lectures on the renal system) while barely covering other systems. the grade distribution should be balanced a bit more in my opinion, because 80% of your grade being in exams is really tough if you arent a good test-taker. the exams themselves were not terrible, but they would be immensely better if you just held them at night from 7-9 or something because 50 minutes was not enough time to complete the midterms satisfactorily. It makes it easy to make dumb mistakes because you dont have the benefit of time to read carefully, and thats not representative of what you know at all. And on the subject of exams, multiple choice questions were worth too much. 3 points per question is brutal for all-or-nothing questions, especially for ones that had options like: two of the above, three of the above, etc, where you might know some but not all and you dont get any credit for that.",
    "The organization of this class is phenomenal. With such interconnected systems, it is easy to get lost, but I think this course did well in introducing the systems one-by-one. Additionally, the learning objectives and weekly quizzes helped me synthesize all the information. I do wish there could have been more practice exams or problems for the tests though. Both professors are amazing. Honestly, the course could be improved if there weren't any guest lecturers, and either Professor Campbell or Saltzman taught all the lectures. Also, I think sections should be an hour rather than 50 minutes because we would almost always run out of time to finish the material.",
    "Strengths: the lectures, the quizzes\/grading format (10\/20 + attendance at discussion section gives you 100%), the professors",
    "I loved having the lectures available to follow along with on my own device in class. Also, the TA sections were helpful and all of the office hours. It was clear that we could have help if we just reached out.",
    "Its a great class just a ton of information. I think it would have been helpful to know more clearly the level of detail we were expected to know before going into the first exam.",
    "A strength and weakness of this course is that a lot of material is covered. The human body is very complex, but this course gave a good, detailed overview of physiological systems. I think that this class did a great job covering a lot while also going into sufficient details. It was also really cool to have guest lecturers who speak on topics that they are specialized in. \r\nPiazza was also quite helpful, and the professors (including the guest lectures) responded promptly and gave very good explanations. \r\nAlso, it was evident that Professors Saltzman, Campbell, Boulpaep, and Aaronson were passionate about what they taught and it really came through in the lectures.",
    "Strengths were feedback on quizzes. Weaknesses were having to know so many facts just to do well on the multiple choice \/ true\/false questions on exams.",
    "Weaknesses: Some of the guest lecturers were not great, but Professor Saltzman is unreal. You never get your tests back, which is very annoying and there are barely any practice tests to take to prepare yourself for the real ones, which was often frustrating. Beyond that, the TAs are super helpful and the professors always have office hours.",
    "there's a lot of material here, and that's definitely a strength! i'm walking away feeling like i understand much better how the body is put together. i think i would have liked to see more clinical cases (like the ones in Dr. Holt's slides) and more integration of all of the body systems.",
    "Strengths: \r\n- Provided in-depth overviews of the topics, instructors were quick to clarify additional questions\r\n- Topics connected well\r\n- Weekly quizzes provided opportunities to refresh knowledge\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Strong emphasis on memorization rather than critical analysis\r\n- Textbook was poorly written and often only made the subject more confusing\r\n- Some of the guest lectures were rambling and largely incoherent",
    "The course is just a lot of material to learn, but nothing that can't be handled.",
    "Very difficult but incredibly well taught. Honestly I do not know any ways it could be improved. The only thing I could think of is telling the guest lecturers to have less slides in their presentations in total.",
    "Honestly, it was great. I enjoyed almost all of the content, even if it was really hard at times to study all of it. Learning how the body works is super super cool, and I found myself applying concepts I learned to everyday life. That being said, some of the lectures were dry.",
    "Good teachers bad book",
    "This psets and sections are well designed to make you learn the material.",
    "Strengths: the professors and TAs did a really excellent job in trying to teach us so much material in such a short time; Weakness: there is so much material but that can't be helped",
    "Cannot see any of the tests. Very difficult to learn from mistakes. Not sufficient test preparation material.",
    "Strengths: Really good lecturers talking about fascinating material and doing so really well. A lot of material is covered which is awesome, and we even talk about how things are known pretty well. The professors do a great job of answering questions, even tough ones, like the \"whys\" of biology. Even the exams were well made, testing just the right type of understanding, not relying too heavily on memorization, but demanding a lot of the students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because there is so much material, it is a really difficult course, but in many ways, this is a strength, because the difficulty is backed up by good teaching. We don't spend as much time as one might want to on every topic, for example only one lecture on the liver and only one on the reproductive systems, but you can hardly blame the course, just because there is so much to learn and its an impossible task to cram everything in.\r\n\r\nIt could be improved by more clarity between the professors and students about how the class is graded. Additionally, it would be great if the professors continued to think critically about how they structure the course and how they can restructure it year to year to continue improving it.",
    "Strengths: professors, TAs, material.\r\nWeakness: for the final, we were given very little direction about what the test would look like and how to best organize our studying. With the amount of material we were expected to know, it would have been very helpful to have some idea of what we were walking into for the final, mostly in regards to the short-answer questions.",
    "Strengths -- a few different professors taught the course and all of them were amazing. I love that there were different lecturers for different systems. I also really like the course material this year -- it was hard but not insanely impossible. The professors mentioned they had adjusted the course based on last year's feedback and I think it really REALLY helped. I felt like the tests were fair and the material we were asked to absorb and retain was also fair.",
    "The information on the slides and review sheets could definitely be organized better.",
    "The strengths and weaknesses have to do with lecture. For the most part, lectures are remarkably clear and engaging and easy to follow (if you get yourself, that is, to be awake from 9:25-10:15). They also at times are jam-packed with material and information (especially true of the endocrine lectures and those on the heart). I wish the scope of the class was kept more narrow, that we were at times taught less.",
    "A lot of material- difficult that it is presented by different professors with different teaching styles. The quizzes each week help distill the important information.",
    "It is extremely difficult but I learned a lot."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is fascinated by the human body and all its processes and would like to develop an even deeper understanding.",
    "Yes, the material is great and instructors\/TAs genuinely care about the material. Quizzes will help you understand\/remember the material better, so although you do get to bump up your grade by going to sections you should spend time on them for your own sake.",
    "This is one of my favorite courses ever, so naturally I would recommend to everyone. You learn literally everything about the human body in such depth that you are actually able to appreciate the incredible organisms we are, and if you are ever taking the MCAT, please, do yourself a favor and take this course!!!!! Plus, Professor Saltzman and Professor Campbell are incredible people and everyone should take a class with them.",
    "This is the only one of the BME classes at Yale so far which I can say has been incredibly taught. I learned so much about what occurs in the body, how it is regulated, the clinical effects, and the purpose of these systems. The class isn't really a BME class as much as it is a pure anatomy and physiology class, and it can get boring if you haven't looked at the lecture material beforehand. But all of it is essential to know. I never truly read the textbook and because I knew the general systems from AP Bio, going to lecture was enough to get a grasp on what the base concepts are. The profs provide lecture objectives at the end of each lecture which is useful, because there is a lot of content (I didn't personally find it overwhelming though). Homeworks are fair, and discussion sections are useful if you get a good TA. Plus Dr. Campbell and Saltzman are both incredibly accomplished and it's really cool to learn from them!",
    "Yes! One of the best STEM classes Ive taken at Yale. The regular workload is pretty light, but studying for exams takes a lot of work, because there is a lot of memorization involved. If youre at all interested in medicine, youll find it really interesting, and engagement always helps!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone vaguely interested in biology\/medicine\/anatomy\/etc. It is one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Yale. It is a lot of information, but you learn so much by the end of the course.",
    "Absolutely, especially if you are considering medical school. EVERYTHING you learn here will be useful later, and it was honestly just so much fun to learn  about how our bodies work.",
    "Yes! Absolutely! If you have any interest in humans!",
    "Yes, it is not an easy class but very interesting and it is amazing the amount of information you end up learning.",
    "This is a great class for anyone interested in physiology or working in any capacity in biology in the future. There's a lot of information, so it definitely takes up a large portion of your time each week to review every lecture and make sure concepts are being understood, but the payoff at the end is really high.",
    "yes, even though it is a lot of material to learn, it is very well taught.",
    "If you genuinely love the human body\/diseases\/applying math to understanding the biomechanics of the body, take it! If you are willing to put in a TON of time to understanding concepts, take it! Otherwise, it is a very challenging course and often not rewarding (in terms of your performance given how hard tests are).",
    "definitely! especially if you're pre-med; while the level of detail certainly surpasses that reqd for the mcat it feels really good to have this foundation on which to build during med school.",
    "It depends. If you have the time and memorization capacity, then this course will be great for learning how the body works. Otherwise, be prepared to put in many hours memorizing the various systems and structures and often having to go to YouTube to relearn some of the lectures.",
    "Any student who wants to be pre-med should take this course before taking the MCAT.  Sure it is a lot of work, but it is totally worth it to take the class, as the material is really interesting.",
    "Yes absolutely, especially if they are planning on taking the MCAT.",
    "Yes, if you are willing to work hard to learn a lot. Also if youre premed, or deciding on it.",
    "Wholeheartedly recommend, the single best life science class at Yale in my opinion. Its also one of the toughest, but well worth the time & investment for any whore interested in learning how the insanely complex human body actually works. \r\n\r\nWarning: do not take alongside Physics 180, the midterms\/exams for the two courses are always a mere 12 hours apart.",
    "Yes learn a lot",
    "Yes.  If you are pre-med or want to understand the body, take this class.",
    "Absolutely, especially premeds",
    "This is most likely one of the most work intensive and difficult classes you will take at Yale. However, one of the best taught and worthwhile experiences as well. Highly recommend if you are interested in the biological sciences.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anybody who has a clear interest in the functions of the human body. For those preparing for the MCATs, there is so much information that you learn that applies.",
    "No, too much information to learn, class not focused on how to make you think",
    "I HIGHLY recommend this course. A lot of science lecture courses at Yale are mediocre, but this is the best one I've taken for sure. It is challenging, but it is backed up by great teaching and fascinating material. The professors are approachable and the TFs are generally knowledgeable and helpful.",
    "Yes, most definitely. But know it is a ton of work. You really need to put in the time to learn the material. But the material is so interesting you won't mind (most of the time).",
    "Yes, if you are someone who is looking to challenge yourself and is interested in truly understanding the human body and how to really THINK on a deeper level and try to piece different bits of information together to solve a problem -- this is the class for you.",
    "Great course for premeds!",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is curious about the way we work. It is a great, important class if you are at all interested in the body or medicine. Many of the lectures were presented from a clinical lens, of sorts, such that various medical \"vignettes\" were shown. It's not an easy class by any means, but if you pay attention in lecture and keep up with the material each week, I promise you will learn so much and do well.",
    "If the person has to take it then yes otherwise I would say they shouldnt take it as it is a huge time suck to memorize the amount that needs to be known.",
    "Yes. It is challenging but worth it."
