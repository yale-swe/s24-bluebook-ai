One weakness would be the pretty sizeable workload, especially during the last unit, which stressed me out since we had long readings due while my other classes were also having the final midterms and projects. I also wish the course taught more grammar topics.",
                "Meeting everyday is extremely taxing, especially for grad students. I would suggest the asynchronous day be on Friday to make the course more accessible to graduate students. \r\n\r\nBetter use of canvas - it was often unclear what assignments were going to be due in the upcoming week and assignments were often added at the last minute, making planning difficult. Anything due should be listed under \"assignments\"",

I also greatly appreciated the focus on projects and participation in tests and quizzes, which helped me to focus on long-term improvement instead of optimizing for tests.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It was much better than my Spanish classes during high school, mostly due to it being actually  taught *in* Spanish and having a smaller class size to allow for more opportunities for each student to speak. This was also the most practice I've actually had speaking Spanish, which was definitely helpful. I also learned more about global issues, which was interesting, though sometimes it was a bit difficult to come up with responses, not because I couldn't translate my answer into Spanish, but because it was difficult thinking of an answer. Also important to note, the workload was much higher than what I was expecting.",
                "yes! Feel like I really improved my language skills, I liked the structure of the learning - more conversational and engaging than just learning grammar",
                "Only if filling a language requirement.",
                "The structure is ideal for a language class. The class has no tests or quizzes and focuses instead on conversation and projects.",
