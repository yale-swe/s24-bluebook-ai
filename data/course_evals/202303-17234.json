                "Strengths: Lectures were very engaging. The content felt motivated. Weaknesses: The final project's simulator and setup had so many errors and bugs. Sometimes the zombies would deal no damage or walk through walls. The lidar sensor was not aligned with the plane of the ground, so the detection for the back was worse than the front. Webots was bug prone. However, those aspects aside, I do have to say the final project was very cool and fun.",
                "Strengths: interesting lectures\r\nWeaknesses: lectures did not totally prepare us for homeworks\/project",
                "The lectures were interesting but I wish there was more support for going back through missed lectures. I also wish the grading was faster. however, overall the content was very interesting.",
                "lectures are fun and a blast to go to -- I wish there were more coding assignments",
                "The strength is that its a very engaging class. Scaz is an amazing lecturer and his lectures are very well done and almost present like stories every time. The weakness is that there is a general lack of feedback in this class. There are 3 psets, 1 project, 1 midterm, 1 final so there aren't many opportunities to get good feedback and understand where you stand int he class.",
                "Strengths: Good lectures, relevant topics to society, really vital to any computer scientist or roboticist Weaknesses: project was not really taught, requires a lot of previous knowledge about coding, use of libraries, and project management. Midterms and finals really reliant on good cheat sheets but manageable with a good one. Psets not super relevant to exams and not well detailed instructions",
                "The lectures were very engaging and interesting and the final project was extremely interesting to tackle.",
                "Strengths: Class is well organized with all lecture slides being posted to canvas. Tests aren't too challenging, especially with a thorough cheat sheet. Weaknesses: The three psets (2 psets and a final project) didn't necessarily feel like they led into one another. This made the final project feel like a bit of a completely new type of problem we were supposed to have experience with.",
                "I liked this course. It is quite manageable for most of the semester, but be aware that the final project is quite difficult. The exams also test the most minute details, which can be a bit frustrating at times. But otherwise enjoyed the content.",
                "Course was great overall without any weaknesses.",
                "weaknesses:\r\n- it is a history of robots, not a class of robotics\r\n- lecture topics were so abstract and difficult to follow. felt like every topic was disjoint from the previous topic. the lectures themselves did not facilitate learning, they were more like long monologues which if you didn't write down every single word you would not succeed on the tests. lecture slides were also not helpful at all\r\n- psets were very confusing since the topics were so abstract. never got clear help from TAs. \r\n- tests were a mix of memorization of random facts like some roboticist's name form 1970 (which doesn't actually test my knowledge about robotics) and difficult unfair questions\r\n- the final project is so unrelated to anything we did the entire semester. you have to learn how to program a robot in some obscure robot simulation environment that is really difficult to use and understand. no help or introduction was given in class about how best to approach the project or how to even use the simulation. we had to do a tutorial as part of the project but it was obviously not that helpful. also, you choose your own groups for the final project so if you don't have friends it really sucks because you'll be stuck with a random group.",
                "The strength for the course are the professor's lectures. Scaz is an amazing lecturer and he makes the course material very easy to follow. However, a big weakness is the final project and how unorganized it was. I understand that it's meant to be open and to test the students' ability to take on open-ended projects, but so many people had issues with simple things like running the programs or having to translate the given code into a different language.",
                "This course is strong in establishing the history of intelligence in robotics, as well as introducing different system architectures and learning algorithms. It would be great if there was a little more direction and feedback for the final project, however.",
                "Fantastic lecture. Scaz is a great charismatic guy, especially when it's about a topic he likes (robotics). Exams are a bit tough. Also, he should record lectures. There are things he says that will be asked on the exam, but aren't visible on the notes. The project is another huge weakness. It was fun, and honestly was a selling point of the course, but I barely had enough time to do it and the skills taught in the course were entirely adjacent to the necessary skills\/coding abilities you need to code a proper robot. I also got stuck in a pretty bad group for the projectthere needs to be some solo component to grading.  It's not that this class is difficult  if u take notes and show up to EVERY lecture, you'll do fine. The psets are completely arbitrary, exam scores are directly proportional to attendance, the project sucks, and the TA's are bad.",
                "The lectures were very vivid and engaging.",
                "The course material was interesting, but especially towards the second half it felt more like each lecture was disjointed, covering a completely new thing, which was a bit jarring. The first half was more geared towards architectures and as a result was more coherent. Also, a huge issue for me was the lack of practice tests or study guides or any such material to study for midterms off of. After taking the midterms, they felt a bit unfair given the lack of any prep material. The office hours were not always that helpful for students struggling with homework, and homework was sometimes rough because we didn't go over enough real examples in class. For example, for subsumption, REX, etc... we should've practice making those architectures in class on a variety of examples, instead of once on a problem set. With almost no material to practice on, of course applying it during the tests would be very tough. The WeBots project was fun, however we didn't really get enough preparation. Going over a less basic Webots tutorial in class would helped so much. And finally, we STILL did not get our webots grades back, even though the class has been done for a while. Overall the material was interesting, but the classes format especially with tests and assignments really negatively effected my experience.",
                "Fantastic lectures and PSETs, really interesting material. Would have appreciated some more guidance on the final project, but overall very well taught."

Scaz is a huge figure in the field and he often tied in personal stories that made lecture more interesting. Homeworks were also manageable in content - there was nothing outrageously new or unexpected on any of them.",

                "I do not recommend this course. Everything from the topics covered in lecture, to the actual lectures themselves which were not very good, to the psets being so confusing and obscure, to the final project - everything was so difficult, and not a good way like \"this is challenging and difficult but i'm learning a lot\" but more in a \"no one understands what to do for any of the homeworks or how to study for the exams and we get no help from anyone\" way. also you don't learn about robotics so if you're interested in that i wouldn't take it to actually learn about that.",

If you are looking for a course that goes in depth for all of these different topics, this is not the course to take.",
                "I would. However, I'd let them know this is the CS class they will do the least amount of coding for. It's more of a history of robotics lecture with a coding project.",
                "Not particularly, not much is gained and the problem sets are somewhat irrelevant.",

                "Absolutely. Makes you think differently (and technically!) about fascinating problems without being so different or technical that it's impossible to grasp without a background in robotics, CS, or math. Really a sweet spot course."
