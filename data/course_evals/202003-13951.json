I learned how to integrate historical knowledge with the reading and writing skills I've developed in my other English courses, and the specific attention to ensuring that our interpretations of texts were grounded in historical or other fact was really helpful. Overall, the course expanded my reading skills by placing greater emphasis on a mix of close reading and high-level reading and improved my writing skills with Professor Mohamed's guidance."

Definitely a heavy volume of reading, so it is helpful to have friends in the class to fill in the gaps...good classic literature placed in historical context !\r\n\r\nWould not mind a few more graded assignments earlier in the semester, but I guess this is pretty standard for Yale",

Having a few discussion questions distributed to the class beforehand so that we could guide how we read is an idea, this could help us stay engaged (a more difficult task than usual in Zoom university)",

                "I would definitely recommend it, with the caveat that \"land, liberty, and slavery\" here focuses less on chattel\/plantation slavery in the Americas and how property was developed in an exclusionary manner, and more so on English thought and politics that gave rise to colonialism and slavery in the New World. If you're looking for the former, you should probably go look at the AFAM\/ER&M\/AFST course listings one more time; if you're looking for the latter, you've 1000% come to the right place. Professor Mohamed is so engaging, guides discussion well, gives clear and thoughtful feedback, and on the whole truly cares about his students and their well-being. The readings were highly insightful if at some times difficult to understand, and I'm so glad to read Locke and Hobbes in this class' historical discussion of their thought.",
                "Yes if you want to get a background in classic political thought like Hobbes and Locke. That was my main motivation and I definitely received that! \r\n\r\nAlso great literature for the most part as well.",
                "Yes, absolutely! Professor Mohamed is a wonderful teacher and really makes the class worthwhile. The material itself is quite interesting, even if the texts are a bit challenging to dissect at times, and I believe you can get a lot out of the course."
