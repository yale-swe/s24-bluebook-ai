                "The strength of the course is its engagement with the students and the many ways it forces you to think of things differently",
                "Overall, the course went very well; most of us knew no Yoruba coming into the first semester of beginning Yoruba, and throughout this semester, we got more comfortable with the vocabulary from the first semester while learning some additional vocab. I think there was less new material in the second semester but we spent a lot of time reinforcing what we'd learned in the first semester which was very useful. It was also just a very fun class to be in and a supportive environment for learning. Professor Adesola is very approachable and knowledgeable and provides a lot of readings/material on Canvas to supplement what we do in class. We had some problems with attendance, so I think a stricter policy about lateness to class and late work would probably help the whole class stay on track so we can learn as much as possible.",
                "Strength: the Professor. He is a true gem, deeply invested in student learning and a patient and supportive language instructive. Extremely accessible to students and presents the complexities of the Yoruba language structure in a student-oriented, accessible manner",
                "This course does a great job keeping everyone engaged",
                "The course has mostly strengths. Generally, engagement is higher since students are continuing to learn a new language, and the professor facilitates this engagement!"

                "Absolutely. This class is really fun and we are able to learn a lot. I think that the rate of learning is definitely slower than L1, but there are new activities introduced that I think really cemented the foundation that we had built.",
                "Definitely! This course has been among my favorite classes at Yale. The professor is very knowledgable, patient, and fun, and you can really get out as much as you put into this course. Grading is not harsh so it is not very stressful, but you have a lot of opportunities to practice the language and all the resources needed to learn.",
                "Absolutely! Especially if you are learning to Get closer to your culture!",
                "I would recommend this course to other students who are interested in not only learning the language, but who want to understand the culture as well",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. The language is beautiful, the class engaging, and the professor is the best professor I've ever had."
