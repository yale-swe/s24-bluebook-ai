    "I learned how to approach self-driven research better.",
    "I developed my writing and research skills.",

It gave valuable skills and the opportunity to learn how to do research and write a personally driven paper of this length, through various workshops, readings and guest lectures.  The assignments helped push us forward in our projects and did not allow us to procrastinate on everything until the last minute, which was definitely a good thing, and I appreciated the help, support and knowledge I got in this class both from the instructors and especially my peers."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths: it was nice to see seniors in the major gathered together",
    "The course did a good job of forcing you to do the dirty work in developing and shaping an academic project. Towards the end, since most of the work was more independent, it didn't always feel necessary for the class to be the full hour and fifty minutes.",
    "It seems that it is geared much more towards students doing year-long projects.  The timeline of the course went that way, and several days we ended up just \"using the time to work\", when several students simply couldn't use that time for anything (research had to involve archives, or interviews, or something like that).",
    "It gave me the emotional support I needed to actually start writing. I think Doug readings for this class is ridiculous when you are expected to have a reading heavy final project. The readings were just distractions from doing the important work of the class  my thesis. QuanTran is a gem though and incredibly organized and intelligent and she led with both strength in how she structured class and grace in how she handled sticky student situations.",
    "The themes covered in the course were helpful. Although I appreciated some of the workshop time, I often felt like the amount of time that we were given to work on our personal projects was too much. In the future, it may be good to have this time more collectively, or doing other things.",
    "geared toward students writing full year theses - strength for those who are writing one, weakness for those who are not",
    "Talked through the process of developing a longer thesis project. The class was really good at this. I think that more of the class could have been spent discussing the literature review. What is the purpose of it?  What are some great examples? What makes them great? I found that in the end writing the lit review was incredibly helpful for my project and the direction it would take but if we had begun earlier it would have let me refine it much more than I was able to.",
    "This was a very strong course.  The seminar style of it meant a lot of opportunities for interpersonal engagement and group work, with the professor\/TF and other students, which I found very helpful.  The setup and nature of the class were very good for facilitating and supporting progress and growth on the research project, and it was a very supportive environment that improved my work a lot."
