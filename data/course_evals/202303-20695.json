This was preferred over some classes that I have taken that read a book\/week because I feel like an expert in the books that we read, and I truly believe that we were able to do justice to the books. We also got a lot of insight\/context from those articles that we read which made the reading experience much better.",

This resulted in interesting discussions each week. She created a positive learning environment that encouraged a supportive atmosphere among students."
