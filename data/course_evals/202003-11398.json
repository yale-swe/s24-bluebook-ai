I also significantly improved my writing skills, trying different styles of writing and receiving specific and personal feedback.",

I also enjoyed learning about Life Writing and its universality, how we are surrounded by all forms and modes of what one might consider autobiographical or life writing.",

                "This course helped me develop various writing skills, such as stating and supporting claims. Additionally, I learned how to conduct research for a research paper, and this course strengthened my overall confidence in academic writing."

                "The main strength of this class is its level of organization and the diverse selection of texts. The class can be further improved by providing more opportunities to practice writing and more texts to analyze so that students get more perspectives on the topic discussed.",
                "Some of the readings were kind of confusing because they were unrelated. I would read some of them and expect there to be a connection for next class but sometimes it wasn't there so I didn't understand that part. The discussions were very good and brought many interesting points to me that I hadn't thought about before.",
                "I liked the size of the class because it allowed for more thoughtful discussions.",
                "I think it was really strong in the sense of it being a small live seminar where all were encouraged to participate and share their ideas. I do think that, at times, some individuals in the class would overpower class discussion and others wouldn't speak, so maybe if there was more of a balance of voices, the class would be even better.",
                "Strengths: Fantastic instructor who is very knowledgeable and eager to help students learn and work at their own pace to understand the material; Reading material was culturally diverse and socially relevant; Many opportunities to seek and receive assistance with your assignments; Feedback is very clear and effective; Professor is very flexible and accommodating to students and the class environment\r\nWeakness: None, I enjoyed everything about this class."

Because we read so many works from different writers and historical figures from diverse and different backgrounds, I was always engaged in class and was never bored.",
                "Yes, absolutely! Professor Galindo is one of the best instructors I have ever had. She is incredibly kind and intelligent and cares very much for her students. Her understanding of the course material inspires students to approach the reading with a unique and fresh perspective. I was hesitant at first to enroll in the class because\r\nI thought I would not enjoy the material, but Professor Galindo easily transformed that hesitation into the utmost enthusiasm. She cares that students not only understand the class material but that they also are able to apply the learnings to their own lives, be it personally and academically. Best class this semester!",
