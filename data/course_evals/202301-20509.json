Importantly, a development of Mandarin to the level of being able to converse on specific topics such as the environment, marriage, school, advertisements etc. which was definitely a progression from CHNS 130. Additionally, presentations and projects allowed practicing of Chinese speaking, listening. Skills-wise, the organization of the course provides a structured approach to the course, where you knew everyday what the task(s) were and could follow your progression through the course and topics covered, having an opportunity every few weeks to assess your knowledge in quizzes \/ writing tasks."

                "This course is very effective at quickly teaching new vocabulary and grammar, and getting students speaking, listening, reading, and writing more fluently. I wish that classes on Fridays met in person so that students could get an extra day to practice material in class.",
                "Excellent instruction.",
                "The course was well planned, but for the asynchronous work it would be nice to know more than one day in advance what the assignment was or what partner groups were in case we were busy Thursday night. Overall, the workload was a lot and it was really stressful and difficult to complete sometimes, but it was necessary to us students to make a major improvement in our skills.",
                "I think there is a lot of homework that could be lowered because some of it feels like busy work. Especially towards the end of the semester, we had a bunch of projects to do on top of studying for the final exam that I think could've been lowered.",
                "The small class size is very nice and conducive to learning and individual attention, but perhaps it could be interesting to do more readings from outside the textbook?",
                "Strengths: Highly structured course allowed for clarity over exactly what we were supposed to do each day. With how much content we had to get through, this was a really effective way of making sure all the sections were coordinated and there was no disparity in knowledge prior to exams etc. Additionally, the trips to the art gallery and diversity in asynchronous work tasks ensured there was fun variety in what we were doing over the course of the semester. Very fortunate to have a brilliant teacher as well (see below)\r\nImprovements: On occasion, I would feel like class was just trawling through grammar structures without much opportunity for engagement and practice  I was just repeating sentences and creating simple sentences that used that grammar point. Not entirely sure how this could be addressed, but I did feel that a lot of the grammar I learnt in the days right before the exam rather than during the lesson. Also, I do wish there was some emphasis on remembering how to write characters (similar to CHNS 120) so that I could go into future courses with a stronger writing ability (I realize that handwriting is less and less a crucial part of learning Chinese to converse in China, but regardless it would be nice)."

It demands a lot of time and effort, but the classes are very enjoyable and the growth in language skills is enormous over the course of the semester. If you have made it to L3, you should try to at least take this course; it really takes your Chinese to a new level.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to seriously learn Chinese.",
                "I would recommend this to someone willing to put in a lot of work to improve their Chinese. It is a serious commitment and is not very flexible at all about late work. However, you learn a lot in this class and meet a lot of amazing people! The teachers are all great, too!",
                "Yes, keep studying Chinese!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It will improve your Chinese in a productive and encouraging environment",
                "As this is a follow-on course, I think students who take CHNS 130 should definitely continue on  not only is the structure the same (and the textbook a follow-up) such that the adjustment is not difficult, but also it is very enriching to be able to learn highly specific vocabulary that allows one to start having proper discussions in Mandarin."
