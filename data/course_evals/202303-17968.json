In general, this class was quite low stress, which helped make the learning more enjoyable (after all, we experience enough dukkha anyways). No particular weaknesses come to mind.",
                "Perhaps this can't be fixed, but some of the readings were extremely boring.",
                "Great course, and the order in which each topic was taught fed really well into the next one. No weaknesses",
                "Strengths: easy A if you put in the work, and very interesting. No glaring weaknesses.",
                "A 10 page paper and a final in a lecture is a lot.",
                "This course was great and super interesting there is nothing I would change. The material is sometimes confusing but that's because Professor Greene is choosing what to teach because not everything can be taught on the subject.",
                "Professor Greene is great. His lectures are engaging, well-organized, and clear.  Professor Greene also is willing to answer any questions (very approachable) and even set up a meeting if his office hours don't work for you.\r\nWeakness: A lot of people are taking this course because of the low workload, and that makes discussion section less engaging.",
                "Great class. The lectures were super engaging. Enough assignments to keep you on top of the material, but it was never overwhelming.",
                "Professor Greene is an engaging lecturer, and he fits a good amount of content in fifty minute classes, keeping me focused during class. I wish the class covered how some of these Buddhist ideas are put into practice a little more, as we did not do a lot of that.",
                "I found the lectures fun and humorous, Prof. Greene is a skillful educator and occasionally asked profound questions that made us really think.",
                "Amazing class. Because there were no assignments besides the exams and paper, I felt completely stress-free about the course and came to class super engaged in the lectures and topics. I knew that I was learning out of sheer interest, and not because I had to learn to complete a pset.",
                "strength = very interesting\r\nweakness = a bit boring",
                "I think it is structured well with great TA's which encouraged engagement in section. The assessments were well considered to encourage learning of concepts, whilst allowing the student to dictate level of commitment/engagement, which I think is a great characteristic for a course.",

                "The course was well organized and it was clear what the expectations were for assignments. The lectures were interesting but readings were sometimes pretty lengthy.",

                "Variety in the readings was a big strength of this course for me. There was a healthy mix of primary and secondary texts which helped with comprehension. There were also some documentaries mixed in which a nice way to break things up occasionally. Lectures are very much based in the texts so can sometimes get a bit dry, but Prof. Greene often points out interesting questions or contradictions which definitely reward paying attention."

The grading is very reasonable, and the workload is not too much so long as you don't fall behind on lectures or push your paper until the last minute.",
                "Fun, interesting course for those curious about Buddhist thought.",
                "Yes! Especially if you are interested in philosophy or Buddhist thought. Some of the topics were quite eye-opening for me and made me understand the world and my own culture a bit differently. Might be quite a few terms that you are unfamiliar with or might have trouble memorizing, but as long as your show up to lecture consistently, you'll catch on. Would be hard to follow the course without showing up to lecture!",

                "Yes it was a super interesting change of pace.",
                "If you are looking for a relatively easy and interesting class, then yes. Buddhism is interesting, and Professor Greene is a good lecturer. If you go to class, you'll have some fun and learn interesting stuff. But a lot of people take the class just because it easy, and that makes discussion section less engaging.",
                "The material was really interesting and I learned a lot about Buddhism but the class still felt chill. I felt like I could keep up by listening to lectures without doing the readings. Coming from a STEM major, this was one of my favorite classes at Yale and complemented my other classes quite well. The quiz and exams were reasonable, graded nicely, and required studying but nothing beyond 5-10 hours. We are also given the terms and passages to know ahead of time, which helps narrow the scope of the exams. We also had a 2,000 word essay where we could choose one of a few prompts.",
                "YES! One of my favorite Yale classes. If you have any interest in religion or buddhism, you have to take this class. The lectures are so engaging and interesting, and it's a low workload. You'll learn a decent amount without being stressed. Really enjoyed this course and would 100% recommend it.",

                "absolutely",
                "Yes. This is a very low-workload course that provides effective enlightenment on the foundations of a major world religion. If you'd like to understand a little more about the Buddhist canon, and don't want to increase the workload of your schedule, this course is for you. Underclassmen and upperclassmen will thrive in this course.",
                "Yes! A super engaging and interesting class. I promise if you show up every day you will learn SO much about Buddhism. On top of that, the workload was very light and made the class even more enjoyable. Undoubtedly one of my favorite classes taken at Yale.",

                "Yes",
                "Yes, this course was very engaging and provoked a lot of thought.",
                "Yes, if you are particularly interested in understanding Buddhist culture. Otherwise, it's a complete waste of your time. If you're looking for a gut this isn't it, this should be a class you actually want to show up to and learn from as it was/the readings were quite interesting",
                "Hands down 100%. It was my first philosophy course as a STEM major and was a great intro to the practice. I will be taking more in the future!",

                "yes! I wouldn't take it if you have absolutely no interest in the subject matter, but it's worth the while even if you're a little curious.",
                "Yes!! This course is an engaging and fun way to learn about Buddhism.",
                "Definitely! I went in with no prior religious studies course and came out with a decent foundational understanding of Buddhism and its history. Very doable, most everyone regardless of major should be able to come into this class, do well, and learn a great deal."
