    "Didn't come away with much I didn't already know, but rather this course helped me tie up some loose ends in understanding. In the end, I think it's meant to serve this purpose. If that's truly the case, the course is working as intended.",
    "literally none. I wish I took linear and diff eq instead.",
    "I learned how to use math from calculus to linear algebra in problems for physics.",
    "This course served as a good review of advanced topics in mathematics that are necessary for any physics student",
    "Cool new methods of integration, linear algebra, and differential equations.",
    "Mathematical methods of physics",
    "Math for physics",
    "The course provides a brief but fairly comprehensive overview of advanced applied mathematical concepts (dif EQ, linear, etc.). You won't necessarily know how to completely do a math problem you might see in an advanced physics or engineering class, but you will definitely gain a decent understanding of how to start it (which is certainly useful).",
    "Basic review of mathematical physics. Great review of linear algebra, differential equations, differential calc, etc.",
    "I learned how to solve partial differential equations by separation of variables, and I learned how to compute integrals by extension to and integration through the complex plane.",
    "This course largely covered math with which I was already familiar, but it also introduced me to linear algebra concepts, matrices, and differential equations.",
    "I feel like my overall mathematical abilities improved and my ability to think about certain mathematical concepts was enhanced by the perspectives that were offered in the course. You don't necessarily get a \"deep dive\" into all of the topics covered in the course, buy I feel like it does certainly equip you with the basics necessary to continue in higher level physics\/chem courses and would be a nice supplement to quantitatively heavy courses for which you feel like you might need extra preparation.",
    "The class covers basic single-variable calculus, some rudimentary but useful methods in complex analysis (contour integrals, residue theorem etc.), glosses over multivariable calculus and vector calculus (this class is NOT a substitute for Math 120), provides a very good introduction to the essence of linear algebra and matrix theory, and finally covers basic methods in the solution of differential equations.",
    "I learned how to perform a few mathematical operations useful for physics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course could be more intellectually challenging. A room full of physics majors perhaps doesn't need to spend two weeks dwelling on single-variable calculus. This time could be better allotted for introduction to more rigorous concepts.",
    "There was too much emphasis on early information, and not enough on later chapters. Although the course is supposed to be available to students without much math background, most, if not all of us have it. The most difficult topics were definitely abstract vector space and differential equations, and these received about the same amount of class-time as partial derivatives, a topic nearly all of us had seen.",
    "you literally spend the first half of the semester doing math equivalent to Math 112 and math 115. Then, the last three weeks of class he actually touches on linear and diff eq. \r\n\r\nthe only highlight of this class was professor baker himself",
    "The strength of this class is how the topics are organized. The weakness is how little time we had to cover the last topic.",
    "This is a survey course of a wide array of math topics. Some of the areas were certainly interesting, but we don't spend a long time on any one topic. I think the course should assume that students have taken at least through multivariable calc (as I think all of us had) and skip the beginning chapters of the book. We would get a lot more from this course if we had more time with all the new topics and didn't review calc at all. Also, the physics and astro departments need to stop telling students that this course is an alternative to a differential equations course. We spent approximately a week on differential equations and do not have the knowledge that a true diff eq course gives. Be upfront about this being a survey course of MANY math topics.",
    "Very well taught by the professor. The professor takes a lot of time to ensure that students have their questions answered about the material.",
    "Great course would recommend !",
    "I wish all my professors were like professor baker in that he is such a kind and caring professor. That is honestly the most important thing to me in taking a class because it makes me feel supported and feel much more comfortable asking for help. That being said, maybe the course material could be taught a little better (I really dont like the Shankar book) and could benefit by being a little more challenging in exams.",
    "Prof. Baker really cared and was a good teacher. The PSets and exams were definitely fair. My only comment is to devote more of the class time to the last two chapters, which are significantly harder.",
    "I think we could have spent a little less time on calculus and a little more time on differential equations and linear algebra.",
    "This course could be improved with less emphasis on elementary math material and a different textbook.  At the beginning of the year, I was told by the DUS of the Physics major that this course, 301, would suffice as a substitute for two individual courses in linear algebra in differential equations.  This was an outright lie.  For anyone with any intentions of pursuing an advanced degree, 301 is next to useless.  I, for example, feel like I just wasted a class slot in one of my final semesters at Yale, and I intend to take linear and differential equations anyway, despite having just completed this course.  Midway through the semester, Professor Baker confirmed what we all knew and informed us that this class is no replacement for a whole semester's worth of linear or differential equations.  We spent about three weeks on math that was new -- that is, math not covered in Math 112, 115, 120, or any other prerequisite course.  I struggle to understand why such a large portion of the semester was dedicated to reviewing math of which all of us had a firm grasp.  There was absolutely no need to spend so much time going over the basics of differentials, integrals, and vectors.  Without prior knowledge of these topics, we would not be physics majors or be allowed to even take 301.  So why were they covered in such depth??!\r\n\r\nAnother decided weakness of this course is the Shankar textbook.  It is unambiguously the worst and most unhelpful textbook I have ever encountered in my entire academic career.  I understand that SHankar is a respected Yale professor and that he crafted the textbook specifically for this course.  But it is a horrible resource that provides over-detailed, confusing explanation, shockingly few relevant examples or practice problems, and an arrogant tone of instruction that assumes a vast amount of prior knowledge and asks questions that are often the furthest thing from straightforward in helping to hone the appropriate skill or technique.  I cannot even recall the number of times I pored over the same puny area of text relevant to a particular practice problem, searching for something that would perhaps help me begin or even understand what I was being asked to do.  I cannot recall the number of times I was forced to visit Professor Baker's office hours simply to clarify why I was being asked to do something in a problem.  I cannot recall the number of times I slammed this book down or bent its pages out of sheer frustration with its smugness and absolute lack of assistance.  I have read other SHankar books, and they are not written in the same condescending, confusing way (thought they do seem to uphold the trend of bad or nonexistent practice problems).  Please change the required book for this course, for the sake of all the students who will have to take it in the future.",
    "The course is well organized because it follows the path outlined in the book. The professor is good at offering alternative ways of understanding this material so you can rely on lectures if the book is not clear. The Psets let you cover all the skills you will need to know. However, there was a bit of a time crunch towards the end due to scheduling conflicts, and I think overall spending maybe only 1 lecture on the first two chapters is more appropriate, especially if we still get the same psets and read the book content.",
    "You can get as much as you want out of this class depending on how much effort you put in. The textbook is well written and goes pretty deep into many topics, while the lectures (and exams) barely scratch the surface of these topics. So you can get away with just learning what is covered in lecture, or you can read through the textbook and learn a lot more. Overall, the class is low-stress and low-stakes; don't worry at all about your grade.",
    "The professor and TF are very kind and care deeply about the students, and that means a lot. However, I think that it would be a good idea to list Math 120 or the equivalent as a prerequisite to the course and then cut out the part of the course dealing with that material, allowing us to go more in-depth into the rest of the course."

    "Only if you have to take it, really. Or if you want to tie up some loose ends in your linear algebra\/vector calculus understanding, which is sort of how the course helped me.",
    "No. Please, don't take this class. Take linear and diff eq instead",
    "I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "Yes! this course was an amazing way to brush up on math.",
    "This class teaches a lot about mathematical methods and the professor is a great teacher!",
    "Definitely",
    "Yes because professor baker is so funny and kind and you really wont find many professors like that in stem if any",
    "Definitely take this course if you want a basic overview of the mathematical concepts on the syllabus. Prof. Baker is really nice and wants people to succeed.",
    "I would recommend this course if a student is looking to strengthen and review their math skills before entering higher level physics.",
    "Not really, no. There are better courses to take to learn these things, or even just the internet.",
    "I would not recommend this course.  It is poorly structured, its textbook will make you want to pull your hair out, it covers material that is too easy for three-quarters of the semester, and you would be better served by taking separate semesters of linear and differential equations.  I wish I had.",
    "Yeah, if your goal is to acquire some extra skills\/concepts in math in order to supplement other physics\/chem courses, take this. You can't expect to get a full understanding of each of the topics covered in this class just in 1 semester, but you can get a lot of the foundational concepts necessary to go deeper into these subjects.",
    "If you want to put in the time to properly read through the textbook, you can get a lot out of this class. Even though the material covered is not comprehensive, the textbook and exercises are written in a much more formal style than any of the elementary courses in the math department, and working through the book gives you some mathematical maturity. \r\nOn the other hand, you can get away with barely doing any work in this class, and you can do well without really learning much.",
    "The course fulfils the distributional requirement and is not difficult at all, so in that sense I'd recommend it. However, in terms of learning, I felt like I did not come away with as much knowledge as I could have."
