I also enjoyed learning how to effectively write three different types of essays as I look forward to my academic career. Discussion was often productive, and classes spent peer editing or learning writing strategies were helpful.",

The course has no clear weaknesses except that we only read 1 book in full. I think it would have been nice to read a few more, but I am grateful for the amount of content we covered by doing excerpts."

                "Yes, absolutely. I thoroughly enjoyed this course. My writing skills improved and we read materials that I would have read for pure enjoyment outside of class. Professor Card is fantastic at designing classes that allow students to discuss readings and engage in meaningful conversation. I learned a lot from my peers about how to interpret passages through these seminar classes and really enjoyed the discussions that were held in this class. Learning about Yale through a literary lens was super cool and gave me a greater appreciation for the place I get to study, but also a greater awareness of its flaws and what the institution needs to change.",
                "Absolutely  it is both incredibly interesting and helpful toward developing reading and writing skills. Texts and topics studied are useful in both the world of literature and as a tool for reflection as college students.",

                "YES! Prof. Card is amazing and the content of the course is so interesting.",
                "Yes! I adore this course and Professor Card. This is a great college English class for students of all grades. The reading list was fun and class discussions were great as the topics were relative to most if not all of the students."
