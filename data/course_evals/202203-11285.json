I also thought the tests were very fair.\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked more feedback on our oral exams, because I was left not knowing what speaking skills I needed to work on the most.",

                "I think this course is fine for people that want to learn Japanese. The pace is the same as previous levels and it does introduce lots of new topics and provide lots of opportunity to practice. It is unfortunate, however, that as of right now only one professor teaches all sections of L3.",
                "I would recommend it only if you need it for a distributional requirement. There is a lot of work, and many of my peers, and I concur, that the workload is much higher in this course than in previous or later Japanese studies and the payoff is minimal.",
                "Yes, if you would like to improve your Japanese in a fast-paced and immersive atmosphere then take this class. It's also a great way to meet other people who also enjoy learning Japanese.",
