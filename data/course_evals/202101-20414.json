                "Professor Marcus is incredibly engaging, passionate about Italian film and culture, and in-tune with her students. Her excitement about each film was contagious and the course material was never boring. I think the films that we covered were all phenomenal and I had only seen one of them before. The structure of the course is very well thought out and consistent (no surprises or random increases in difficulty!). The expectations of the students are very reasonable and well-communicated. You don't need ANY prior experience with film, Italian film, or Italian language to take this course. I think this is a rewarding course to take for anyone that is interested in good films or Italian culture! The only weakness I can think of is that sometimes we would have to cram two classes into one day because of the \"Spring Break Days\" that were sprinkled throughout the Spring 2021 semester (although this was somewhat unavoidable if we wanted to cover all of the films).",
                "Most of the films are amazing and worth watching. To analyze them in an academic setting improves the experience greatly. But writing four papers and a final exam seems like a little too much assessment. Integrating technology better into the course could improve the learning experience.",
                "Strengths: great selection of films\r\nWeaknesses: could show us more examples of film critique",
                "The course features amazing films and really interesting analysis",
                "Strengths: Contents of the course tie together very well.",

                "I love this course. I wish I could have taken it in person. No weaknesses.",
                "The lectures were great fun, and the movies were as well! I wish we could have watched them together, but I did really enjoy watching the films in the comfort of my own room."

                "I think Zoom certainly made it difficult for the discussion times during the course to be as open/lively as Professor Marcus wanted. She constantly encouraged the class to engage, comment, and unmute but most of the time only 2-5 people would actually talk out of the 20+ in the course. Perhaps additional discussion sections added to the course or extra time for small breakout rooms would facilitate more participation during virtual learning.",

                "Absolutely! This was my favorite course so far! If you love anything about Italy or Italian culture I highly recommend taking this course because it is a lovely tour through Italian cinema facilitated by a professor who is enamored with Italian film herself. In addition to the films discussed throughout the course, each week we received a filmography for each director (a.k.a. even more amazing films to watch in your free time if you want!). As a student of Italian language this was a very useful supplemental course for me (even though it is taught entirely in English, many of the films are in Italian with English subtitles and hearing so much Italian really reinforced my learning throughout the semester). I give this course \"Cinque Stelle\"!!",

You will come out of the course with a better understanding of Italy's impact on the world and the immense power films have on individuals and society.",
