    "Strengths: Professor Xiang is awesome. She is very nice and very helpful, and the comments that she gives on the papers are insightful. Also, we read a lot of great literature. I enjoyed coming to class.",
    "I think it would be cool if the syllabus related to each other a little more.",
    "This course is very engaging if you're interested in American literature, and I enjoyed being able to discuss the books in conversation with authors, time period, and other writers.",
    "Heavy reading assignments are both its strength and weakness. Discussion is one of the strengths; Sunny is a great discussion leader.",
    "The strength of this course was the small class format and the excellent teaching that allowed for productive and illuminating discussion. The weakness was that the volume of books and literature we read did not allow for as close a reading of the texts as I would've liked."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Prof. Xiang is a great teacher; she is helpful and nice. Also, you get to read a lot of great American literature. It was one of my favorite classes to come to. The workload is manageableon average, it took me about two hours to do the reading for each class. The most hectic it got was when we were reading Moby Dick and writing a paper at the same time (each reading of Moby Dick was about 80 pages, which, for me, came out to about 4 hours of reading per class). It was still manageable, though, and Moby Dick is so incredibly good that it was completely worth it.",
    "Yes! Great class.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone considering the English major, it's a good introduction.",
    "If looking into the English major, yes. It is a great survey of several important and interesting texts. The essays (specifically feedback) are a great learning experience and definitely a manageable workload.",
    "I already have recommended it to multiple people!"
