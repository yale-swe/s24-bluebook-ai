                "The course exposed me to valuable texts spanning the last few decades of Black liberation movements. It was great to get to read and discuss these books, especially as they focused heavily on Black feminist perspectives. I learned a lot about the timeline of Black political and social rights in America.",
                "Strengthened ability to analyze authors' methodologies and arguments, recognizing change over time of various topics. Learned how to articulate thoughts about complex topics in a round-table discussion setting.",
                "History of the Civil Rights Era up to the Black Lives Matter era; critical thinking skills related to modern politics/ diversity; exposure to key scholarship",
                "I gained a better understanding of Black feminist literature and thought post-Civil Rights.",
                "A much deeper understanding of voting rights in the US; a broadened perspective of the injustices Black people have faced in this country; learning about radical thinkers and realizing they arent as radical as we were taught; better understanding of the Black Lives Matter Movement, the horrors and reality of voter suppression in US elections, and the current fight for equality and Black lives. Very grateful for these new perspectives and all the books we read - they were relevant, often recent, and written by Black women which I think is important that this class centers their voices",
                "a broad understanding of 20th century Black liberation movements",
                "In this course, I learned about the history that created the context for the Black lives matter movement. Specifically, I learned about the way that intersecting identities have played a role in movements since the civil rights movement, and about the challenges in creating a movement that encompasses multiple marginalized identities. The skills I developed in the course were analyzing the methodologies of authors, utilizing the index and bibliographies of books written about history, and researching and writing a paper about history and social theory. The main insight I drew from this course is that the civil rights movement, segregation, and even slavery are not a part of the remote past, and have direct impacts on the lives of people in the present. Furthermore, I gained insight into the extreme difficulty of challenging a social hierarchy, and I learned that while movements in the past have certainly made gains, none have achieved the structural change that is tru7ly necessary to challenge the roots of racism in society.",
                "This course gave me the vocabulary and deeper understanding to discuss civil and human rights issues in America with greater confidence. I learned and grew so much throughout the duration of this class, and it also led me to re-evaluate the ways in which I may be able to contribute to movements related to social justice."

            "comments": [
                "The course was very based on student discussion and not so much on the background of the eras the books were written for. Although the discussions were great to have, I felt the class lacked a purely informational aspect. However, the books we read and the topics we explored were very enlightening and interesting and Dean Lafargue always led an engaging discussion.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lafargue is extremely flexible which was super helpful, made sure course was about our thoughts in relation to the texts and not him lecturing\r\nWeaknesses: having an almost 2 hour seminar at 9:25 isn't always conducive to full-class discussions",
                "The books assigned in this class are amazing! I would have hoped to see the class talk more about them. and this class had way more assignments than my other classes. i think 3-5 assignments is pretty standard, but we had a lot more to do for AFAM 227",
                "Overall, this course covers and interesting period with interesting material. However, discussions were sometimes disjointed, and the amount of reading assigned really undermined our capacity to have real substantive dialogues about the material. Less reading would enable better comprehension of each text because it felt impossible to complete each book while staying up to date with other themes in the class.",
                "Loose seminar format. Student presentations framed half of the class period, followed by meandering lectures from Professor or discussion. While I liked the student presentations for the most part, I felt like sometimes they didnt prompt great discussion or they took almost the entire class period. I would have appreciated more professor led discussion I think. But I did enjoy the discussions and the presentations raised some interesting topics. This was the first time I took a class where the professor didnt talk much about the assignments and referred us to canvas for most of the information. I didnt like this because the expectations for the assignments were sometimes unclear/loose. However, all of assignments did provide for a lot of flexibility on what topic we wrote about it. Not a hard class to do well in if you complete the assignments on time and in line with what we are discussing, which is always something I appreciate. Stress about the grade did not hinder my engagement and interest in the class. I also loved reading all books written by Black women.",
                "strengths - the syllabus draws from a variety of great Black feminist texts; weakness - the discussions could have been more guided; would have appreciated more guidance on the assignments, which were sometimes too open-ended",
                "One of the strengths of this course was the contemporary literature that formed the basis for the topics of discussion. I felt that I was learning about the contemporary dialogue surrounding these issues, which engaged me with the modern-day implications of the history that was presented. However, I also felt that the selections could have been targeted at specific issues, which might have helped me develop a more concrete takeaway from the course. Another strength of the course was the role the students played in investigating issues and in sharing their opinions with the rest of the class. I had never taken a course like this before, and I learned a lot from my experienced peers as they presented on topics about which they were knowledgeable and shared their experiences with activism in their personal lives and their opinions on the material and on contemporary issues."

                "I think this course was great for a survey of events of Black liberation movements and the texts were very interesting and engaging. If that is what you're interested in, then this is a great course. If you're looking for a more information-based class rather than a discussion-based one, this probably isn't the best class to take.",
                "Absolutely. The reading may look daunting but is actually really manageable because you can skim/skip chapters and really focus on the main arguments or read parts that will help you write the assignments. Professor Lafargue is also the main reason why I liked it so much. He was also super relaxed and understanding. He also has OH often so if you're ever confused or want more feedback that option is open. I was the only first-year in my class which at first I was nervous about, but really only felt intimidated by my classmates who always seemed to know exactly what to say and how to say it. This actually led to me being more of a listener during class, but helped me write better and served as a learning experience.",
                "yes! everyone at Yale should take this class",
                "I would recommend this course to someone interested in an intersectional approach to understanding the post-Civil Rights Black Liberation Movement or anyone particularly interested in Black feminist literature and theory.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in the topic and willing to do the readings. You will get a lot out of the course if you are engaged and choose interesting topics for your papers/projects. It could be an easy course to coast through but the material is really important and not a good topic to coast through. If you are okay with looser guidelines when it comes to assignments, this is also a good course for you. Material is really important and I loved reading books entirely written by Black women.",
                "I would only recommend this course to a student who is familiar with politics, social science, or history classes, and would like to develop a focus in the contemporary Movement for Black Lives. I did not get as much out of this course as I could have if I were more comfortable sharing my opinion in a socratic discussion format in a topic in which I was not already well-versed. I felt that my class was dominated by students who were already experienced in this topic, and I would love to see a course format that is more welcoming to people who are looking to gain exposure to this valuable material for the first time.",
                "I would recommend this class to every student at Yale. Unless you've already read all the books on the syllabus, you should take this class to gain a better understanding of this country we live in and how we can best contribute to making it a safer, more just place for the people who live here."
