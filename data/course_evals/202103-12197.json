                "This course was one that opened my eyes to the idea of liking science, and it taught me very relevant information for today's world. Even more, it showed me just how important it is to know about climate change for any person in any field, since its effects will be felt by everyone. In terms of skills, this class showed me how to look for relevant information amidst long, dense science papers.",
                "Lots of knowledge about Earth's climactic systems, the mechanics of climate change, and the impacts that we can expect from it.",
                "A lot! Essentially, most of the year is about how the earth generally operates, and how humans are disrupting that delicate system. Also, you learn a lot about wastewater treatment plants (take the course to hear what I'm talking about).",
                "I learned the science behind climate change and its impacts--ranging from ocean currents to wild fires to the cryosphere changes. I practiced synthesizing scientific research papers into easily-understood terms, and writing precisely.",
                "This class is a great introduction to the science behind climate change and makes really clear the ways in which human actions and natural systems are interacting and leading to future climate disaster. Weekly reading/writing assignments helped to build skills of reading scientific papers and turning that information into readable summaries that anyone could understand. This is a very valuable skill that they make you practice a lot.",
                "I gained a good grounding in the basics of climate change science, enough to explain in conversation with friends and family.",
                "I think I did gain a basic understanding of climate change, which is something everyone should have.",
                "Learned about the basic science and mechanisms between climate change and climate phenomena.  Learned about the silicate weathering cycle, hurricanes, El Nino/La Nina, ocean currents, forest fires, atmospheric circulation, coral bleaching, extreme weather events, emissions pathways, carbon capture and sequestration methods, some geoengineering such as Stratospheric Aerosol Injection.",
                "I learned an overview of how the Earth's climate system works, how climate change affects those aspects of the climate system, and what actions we can take to prevent irreparable damage to our planet.",
                "Very comprehensive overview of climate change & its related impacts",
                "EPS 101 allowed me to critically think for myself when confronted with information about the climate crisis. Through constant engagement with journal articles, scientific data, and lectures, I was able to grasp the complexity of the climate crisis. As someone who is not involved with STEM courses daily, EPS 101 was a nice introductory class into the science behind how we understand and manage climate change.",
                "An nice overview of the issues arising with today's changing climate, and ways that it can be remedied.",
                "I gained a real handle on climate change science in this course (especially the first half) and feel that I know have a good understanding of the basis of weather, the greenhouse effect, and a host of other climate-change related phenomena.",
                "This class expanded my scientific knowledge and writing skills.",
                "I learned about various parts of the Earth's climate systems and how climate change is affecting them. I also read various scientific articles and wrote responses to them.",
                "I learned about a broad overview of topics relating to how climate change works, what exacerbates it, and potential solutions/mitigation tactics.",
                "I developed a strong foundational understanding of major climate issues that face the planet today and the processes that cause them. I am able to properly articulate how anthropogenic climate change is affecting the planet and how it will cause catastrophe if not mitigated. Finally, I have a strong understanding of the various methods to combat climate change, from reducing emissions to earth engineering possibilities.",
                "I learned about general climate patterns and how they are changing as a result of human activity / emissions. Gave me a solid understanding of how certain climate processes / forces drive both longterm and short term whether.",
                "Through this course I learned not only about the science behind the changing ecological processes associated with climate change, but also how to practice writing about these changes through our weekly writing assignment. I think that this class did a wonderful job of teaching me not only what is happening, but also helping me work on the tools I will need to talk about solutions.",
                "I learned about the causes and effects of climate change, as well as how the climate works and some potential solutions to climate change.",
                "I learned so much about climate change, the Earth's physical qualities and processes, emerging technologies and research about weather, climate, and the future, and how we might make progress on these issues in our lifetime. Almost everything that was covered in this course was new to me, and I feel like I am leaving this class with SO much general knowledge about the planet.",
                "I developed my ability to understand climate systems, read and analyze scientific papers, and synthesize my ideas on environmental science in writing.",
                "I learned about what is causing climate change and what can be done to mitigate it in the future",
                "I learned about the scientific evidence for climate change and how to talk about global warming and reducing emissions. We discussed various aspects and effects of a changing climate, how the Earth's systems work, and potential geoengineering solutions.",
                "I developed a basic understanding of climate processes.",
                "I developed vital information about climate change. It changed my perspective on looking at daily events and news and other topics such as economics.",
                "I developed a solid understanding of climate change and the scientific processes behind it. As a humanities major interested in climate issues, I feel much more comfortable explaining climate change to a lay audience.",
                "General knowledge of Earths climate systems and the outside influences that. Size change.",
                "I learned so much about the way that climate change works and how great a danger it is to humanity and the planet itself.",
                "I learned about various climate phenomena and scientific concepts related to climate change.",
                "This class will give you the power to understand the fundamental science behind some of the modt pressing climate issues of today. You will be empowered to speak knowledgeably and confidently about climate change to both family and friends. You will under the basics of different weather phenomena, the greenhouse gas effect, geoengineering, and much more.",
                "I learned a lot about the science behind climate change and gained an appreciation for the difficulty of climate science and predicting future climates. This class also provided an insight into the vast number of things humans do that influence the climate (deforestation, forest fires, burning fossil fuels, agriculture, etc.) and the far-ranging impacts of these changes (more flooding, more drought, more destructive forest fires, loss of coral ecosystems, loss of polar ecosystems, etc.).",
                "I had an incredible overview of the science and policy behind Climate Change. This is a great course for non-STEM majors looking to understand salient climate issues.",
                "I learned about the physical science of climate change, as well as the key conferences, policies, and technologies that are being developed in response to its challenges. I also learned about the limitations and uncertainties surrounding climate science, which limits what we do or do not know about how rising temperatures will reshape our world."

            "comments": [
                "This course does well in encouraging students to apply their learning within the weekly assignments and to explore their areas of interest. Some concepts were difficult to understand from a place of little science background, as there were often terms I didn't know, but the professors seem to be aware of this and constantly try to use common English.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Timmermans's lectures, assignment format was nice, content flowed together pretty well\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Dr. Planavsky's lectures, the assignment grading scheme, slides not that useful for  studying and few other review resources",
                "Only strengths. Two of the kindest professors ever. Chill class environment. Thoughtful weekly writing assignments. Great class and you learn a lot.",
                "I think this course could have been improved with a discussion section. I think if the material was solidified by discussion with my classmates, I would have struggled with harder concepts less. I think the weekly one-page assignments were a strength of this course because they encouraged me to find connections between topics in lecture and think critically about current events.",
                "I thought the professors were both engaging, but the lack of even bulleted text on the slides sometimes made it harder to follow along. Also the content seemed to assume a basic level of chemistry that I didn't have (or remember).",
                "Both Prof. Timmermans and Prof. Planavsky are super nice and understanding. I think sometimes Prof. Planavsky seemed to teach the class like he thought we were all EPS majors, when in fact most of us were not EPS majorsmostly probably not even STEM majors. I attended every lecture but still relied on the lecture slides as study material. Both in class and when studying, I noticed the slides dont have much explanatory text and instead are mostly images, very busy diagrams that only make sense once you understand the concept, and complicated equations that we were told we did not need to know. Before the midterm, I kind of freaked out because there was so much material that had been covered and it felt like we either skimmed over a subject or went way too technical on it. Everything was fair game and there was so, so much content that hadnt been thematically connected, and the assignments were not synthesis-of-lecture-material-problem-sets. HOWEVER, I LOVED THE ASSIGNMENTS. That really is the big strength of this class. I really have never been able to make it through a scientific paper, and I feel like I am walking away from this course far more comfortable reading scientific research and synthesizing it into jargon-less writing. I think that will be incredibly helpful in all of our careers, even if we dont go into STEM. It will also generally make us more informed citizens. Also, the midterm ended up being totally fine! When the profs said reviewing the slides would prepare us, they werent lying. The questions werent gotcha or too in depth. Based on the review session, it sort of seemed that was because Prof. Timmermans stopped Prof. Planavsky from asking questions that were way too complicated. But overall, both Profs really seemed to care about us doing well and understanding the material.",
                "Strengths: good overview to a lot of important climate topics.  Engaging professors, the content was clear, and workload was very manageable.  Exams were very fair. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes I wish we went more into the hard science of things.  But I guess that is the nature of an intro course.",
                "This course gives a really nice overview, and I feel like I have a solid general knowledge of climate change. There were some things that I wish we had covered in more detail, but, given that this is an introductory course, I think it was ok that we skimmed over them in order to cover a wide range of topics. There were times when the professors seemed to assume we had prior knowledge of the material when we did not, but in general this course was catered very well to non-stem majors and those not familiar with the specifics of climate change.",
                "Strengths: overall interesting content and assignments.\r\nWeakness: Towards the end of the course the lectures were mostly just graphs and charts that were each briefly discussed and I didn't feel like I learned anything for the last 3rd of the semester.",
                "The course curriculum was strong, I have no feedback to give.",
                "The base level knowledge provided through this course was a strength; everyone leaves having gained something from the information presented to us. I think the instructors did a really good job creating a well-rounded image of a multi-faceted issue. One of the critiques I have is that I wish the instructors would have personified the land a bit more. From an Indigenous perspective, while it is important to know the science behind the climate crisis, it is also imperative to recognize the land as a living, breathing being. If students are taught that they have the resources to \"fix\" the land without even considering the land's autonomy, our solutions will fall short. We cannot put ourselves above the land; it is a symbiotic relationship where we listen to each other and our needs. I highly recommend both professors read Robin Wall Kimmerer's book \"Braiding Sweetgrass\" to get a better understanding of what I'm trying to convey here.",
                "The grading structure of the weekly assignments was unideal, as the additional \"5 points for demonstrating understanding of the subject\" felt subjective based on the TA grading the assignment. Else, the class was well structured and both professors are reasonable.",
                "I loved the 2 different perspectives our professors brought to the course, but felt that the alternating weeks schedule at times cut up the course material in weird places and messed up the flow of the course.",
                "The lectures are great and very engaging, and the assignments are a great way to summarize and engage with material. Clarity on grading was the one weakness but was cleared up by the end.",
                "The course material was very interesting and broad. However, the structure was opaque and unsettled. The grading scheme changed multiple times throughout the course, and rubrics were not provided for the assignments, making it difficult to understand how things were assessed and what scores meant. At various times, my assignments were critiqued for not being scientific enough or, conversely, for having too much jargon. Of course both are legitimate critiques, but there was little indication of how to successfully navigate the competing tensions. Because it was not clear how these various factors contributed to grading, grades seemed relatively arbitrary. On the class structure itself, while the material was engaging, there did not seem to be much continuity or development from week to week. Lectures did not consistently build upon each other and the course seemed a little directionless.",
                "Strengths: A good range of topics were covered, the material feels important and relevant, and the lectures were generally quite interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It sometimes felt that lectures could be better organized. We would also sometimes spend a lot of time at the beginning of class going over minor housekeeping issues and then end up rushing through the lecture as a result. The grading policy changed multiple times throughout the course and was quite confusing. It was also unclear who to go to with questions about grades - the professors often deflected questions/the final say to a teaching fellow instead.",
                "The course did a good job covering the main areas of climate change's causes and consequences in a manner that was easy to understand for someone without much background knowledge. The main weakness of this class was the slide show presentations. The presentations were almost all graphs and diagrams taken from the internet with few to no accompanying text. This made review very challenging because without any context it was hard to know the details of what was being discussed on a given day. Of course, taking copious notes in class helped with this issue, but sometimes the content was so much that it was hard to keep up even by taking notes.",
                "I like the format of having two lecturers -- it keeps thing engaging and provides a weekly change of pace. \r\nI think the course could be improved by including more information on the slides so that students can go back and review concepts for exams and assignments more easily. Or, recording lectures would also allow students to more easily review content covered in class. \r\nI found the grading on the weekly homework assignments somewhat arbitrary and did not get much feedback. Also, sometimes the weekly assignments did not have a clear connection to the topic being covered in class that week.",
                "Professors Timmermans and Planavsky were fabulous and I appreciated the clarity in their slides and willingness to answer any questions in office hours. The material of the course was very fascinating and well presented and it was amazing to learn about work happening right this second. My only suggestion would be to perhaps offer a small sectional meeting every few weeks in which students could discuss the lectures in a small group.",
                "Strengths: This class covered a lot of content on an interesting topic. Lectures were both interesting and informative; some incorporated current events, which was a good addition. \r\nWeaknesses: Assignment instructions could have been more clear",
                "I think that the course was overall well done and the lectures and readings went together very cohesively. I also liked the format of weekly writing assignments because they kept me engaged with the material. I would say that the course could be improved by having clearer expectations for the writing assignments, for example, having a rubric of the different elements that would make up an excellent paper. I think that the expectations were initially left loose so as not to stress us out as a class, but then when we received our assignments back, we would realize that the expectations were a bit more stringent than we thought. Ultimately it is less stressful if we know exactly what is expected of us so we can deliver strong essays. However, I do think that both professors were very understanding and receptive to feedback, which was another major strength. Overall, I really enjoyed the course!",
                "Strengths are the lectures and assignments for homework\r\nWeaknesses focusing too much on certain stuff like models",
                "The material covered in the course is fascinating and both professors are super knowledgeable and engaging. The one weakness of this course for me was that expectations for homework assignments were not always clear, and the TAs were not always able to help answer questions about those assignments, although they were very helpful for clarification about the course material.",
                "The lectures were often disorganized and the grading system was hard to understand.",
                "Strengths: engaging professors, well-structured lectures, predictable weekly assignments and exams \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think I wouldve liked more instances in lecture where students were asked questions or had the opportunity to speak. That got better throughout the semester, but couldve started off stronger.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting topic, all the information was applicable and Im glad I now know what I do. Weaknesses: Lectures could end up going on tangents, wasnt always clear what we were supposed to be taking away",
                "I really liked how they kept everyone engaged, even when the majority of the students were not STEM students, and they were open to criticism and to acknowledging and correcting when they did not explain something well. One weakness I think would be the weird grading of homework assignments.",
                "Professor Timmermans is very knowledgeable and flexible, and the material is interesting. However, the format of the class is unorganized at times.",
                "Strengths: This course does a good job empowering students to be literate on climate change and general environmental topics. The assignments provide a good opportunity to dive deep into a subject while getting practice reading scientific papers. The topics covered were broad but still indepth enough to be interesting, useful, and engaging. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: because the class is taught by two professors, it can sometimes feel disjointed or unorganized. Noah in particular could sometimes go too far into specific complicated concepts that were less useful to a 101 lecture. As will be expressed by others, grsding for assignments was very confusing for many students, and should be changed in the future. Still, tests were generally fair.",
                "This course was highly interesting and the involvement of both professors in different lectures provided students with a more diverse perspective on the topic. Also, the assignments each week were interesting and fun to research.",
                "I liked the first part of the course very much, and that was when my exposure to the science was really extensive! I did feel like the second part couldve been a little more structured or maybe bring in more science. It was somewhat harder to stay engaged because the scientific concepts were a bit sparser. I do think that the assignments were very useful though!",
                "I liked this class and the instructors. I thought the earth sciences portion of the class was well-taught, but I was struggling a little to keep up with later lectures (e.g. on geoengineering, COP26, etc.) because they were often a little technical. It could get a little hard to follow along with the graphs and diagrams. Overall, I thought that the teachers, and the TAs, were incredibly helpful and kind, and they always made themselves available to answer questions. The impression was that the instructors were really there to help you along and that they wanted to see you succeed, which was good as a student who had basically zero understanding of science and had barely taken any science classes at Yale."

Timmermans is definitely the highlight, so it's Clea to me that a lot depends who is teaching. Content seems pretty standard intro science fare, but of course with very important implications for other fields, which are discussed at points.",
                "Yes! It's a great way to learn a lot about the world around you. Also, the assignments are all writing (no psets). While class is more general, the assignments make you dig into something specific and learn something. It's all such a great balance.",
                "Yes! To be able to understand the future of our planet for whatever major you are in is extremely important.",
                "Yes! Take this class, the course material is a huge bummer but you learn a lot and feel really well equipped with climate knowledge going forward. The professors have their strengths and weaknesses, but they're both great people and care a lot about what they do. The weekly assignments are kind of a pain but you feel like you get better at the skills they ask of you as the semester goes on. The biggest thing is just make sure that you ask questions when you are confused because the professors could not tell when you are confused but they will do their best to answer your questions. If their response doesn't answer your question, ask again. Also take this class with your friends, it will be much more fun that way.",
                "I think once the professors iron out some of the wrinkles with grading, provide more structure to assignments, and maybe make more detailed slides, this would be a great class for non-STEM majors.",
                "If you need a science credit, then yes! Youll gain a basic understanding of an important subject, gain confidence in understanding scientific research, and while it wasnt really clear until the midterm, you can worry more about understanding the material because of its importance than you worry about your grade.",
                "Yes, would recommend!  Primarily because EVERYONE should know about the science behind climate change in order to develop greater personal understanding and to be able to educate others, including climate deniers.  Tbh, this course was depressing a lot of the time.  But I'm glad for the wide range of topics we covered.  I particularly liked the last two weeks of the course when we focused on geoengineering, carbon capture and storage, and carbon dioxide removal.  I'm personally invested in these topics and I think the general public MUST be made aware about them ASAP.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It gives a really good overview of climate change, which is vital information to know in today's world. It is also not a ton of work. The assignments usually did not take longer than a few hours a week, and the exams were not too difficult. Definitely an interesting and not too difficult course for non-stem majors looking for a science credit.",
                "Absolutely! I would definitely recommend the course to another students, especially if taught by Professors Planavsky and Timmermans. In terms of content, the class was thorough and comprehensive. It expanded my basic understanding of the natural world around me, as well as climate phenomena. Professors Planavsky and Timmermans are also fantastic, clearly extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the class' topics.",
                "If you are interested in climate change and want a low commitment introduction to it, yes.",
                "Yes, I found it interesting and worthwhile",
                "Yes, I think it is a great course for anyone who wants to be more knowledgeable about climate change.",
                "I would heartily recommend this course to a student that wants a relatively low-commitment but high-reward class, and learn climate science from 2 experts.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Its not an easy science but, but its a very doable class for a non-STEM person and really important material to know.",
                "I would recommend to someone familiar generally with scientific principles (say, a good grasp on high school chemistry, not necessarily AP--I never took AP chem) and interested in the scientific workings of the climate. A decent general overview of the EPS field, but probably not the course for you if you need a lot of structure, clear feedback, or are looking for more specific developments.",
                "Yes, this is an interesting science credit that isn't too technical but still feels useful and interesting (not a pointless gut). At times I wished I had more of a science background (would have been easier to understand certain concepts) but certainly doable without any science knowledge. Class organization could have been better but hopefully they will iron that out. I'm not sure if I would take it if I didn't need a science credit.",
                "I would recommend this course to any non-STEM students who want to take a meaningful class to fulfill a science credit requirement. If you attend class and pay attention, you can learn a lot about the workings of our climate system and the major threats to it. However, if you don't attend class consistently and take notes, the slides are very hard to follow on your own. The course is also a very fair level of work, with weekly assignments that get easier as you get the hang of writing them.",
                "Yes, I would recommend if you want a science class that is not too technical. I liked that is was not too much memorization, but rather about understanding greater trends, concepts, and forces.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I went into this course as a humanities person interested in policy application of climate science. Now, after taking this course, I have realized that I am much more interested in the research and science aspect than I thought. The class does a wonderful job of teaching you the science you need to know, and also having you practice talking about the science through the weekly writing assignments.",
                "Yes!! This is a perfect science credit. As a senior and a non-STEM major, I was looking for a science class that felt relevant and important to my other studies at Yale. This course was exactly that. Mary-Louise and Noah are very aware that most people in this class are taking it for a science credit, and so the material and assignments actually feel doable, productive, and helpful. Practicing writing about climate science for a general audience really felt like a valuable skill to learn, particularly for those interested in politics, journalism, economics, etc. I can't recommend this class highly enough. Sometimes the lectures can be a bit confusing, but never to the detriment of learning. Grading in this class is not a source of stress. This feels exactly like what a science credit should be.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It provides students with an comprehensive introduction to climate science that is engaging, fascinating, and rigorous.",
                "I would--it was a great introduction to climate science, and I learned a lot!",
                "Yes I would it helped me gain new insight\r\nAnd the professors were good",
                "Yes! If you are interested in climate change or the environment, take this course. Especially as a first year or if you're not sure if you are interested in majoring in science, this is a great introduction to the topic. After taking this course, I am considering switching to a STEM major.",
                "This is an excellent course for humanities majors interested in developing an understanding of climate change. For STEM majors with a background in physical science, the course would probably be underwhelming, but would still cover things like geoengineering that are less commonly taught. In my opinion, this was not a gut course- the weekly assignments took me at least 3 hours a week to complete well, and the midterm was pretty rigorous. Definitely worth it!",
                "Yes absolutely. Was very intretesting, workload was very manageable.",
                "I very much would recommend this course to another student, even a humanities major. This class has me thinking about adding something climate related to my own major so it really had an impact on me!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in climate change as long as they are willing to do some writing.",
                "Absolutely take this class. No matter what you study, a basic but strong knowledge on climate change is a must for every 21st century citizen. Most lectures were engaging and overall I am really glad I enrolled.",
                "Yes!! I loved this class so much. Favorite class of the semester.",
                "YES. This course and the professors were amazing. Each week covers a different topic about climate change so it provides a good general overview as to what climate change is and why it's an issue. Also, while it is a science-designated course it is well-tailored to non-science majors.",
                "Absolutely. So important to take this class to truly understand climate change.",
                "Yes, it's a good science credit that teaches you something without being too demanding or stressful."
