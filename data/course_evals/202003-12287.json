The first half of the course focused on scientific computing methods, such as Simpson's Rule and Monte Carlo simulations, and their applications. It also introduced basic Python programming as Python was the language we used for all assignments. The second half of the course focused on basic machine learning and other data science techniques. The course focused more on exposure rather than completeness due to the issue of time, so most of what I learned was introductory. Nonetheless, the course had interesting assignments that effectively tested and cemented my understanding.",

By the end, we were proficient with various data science libraries (pandas, numpy, mathplotlib, sklearn) and could execute the knowledge mining process on real world problems (final project). Machine learning is presented as a powerful tool for scientific exploration with its limitations.

                "Well done physics dept on this one -- a very solid lab course.",
                "Strengths: The workload was well-suited for a half-credit course, as most of the assignments could be completed in class. The material covered also allowed for an expository survey into machine learning and its uses, which is good knowledge for any computational work one might encounter in the future. Prof Nagai was also happy to help, although his lectures did at times get somewhat repetitive, as he simply read aloud content on the slides.\r\nWeaknesses: The first few weeks was an unsuccessful meet-in-the-middle attempt to introduce Python  way too fast-paced for beginners and a boring repetition of familiar material for others. This course would be much better off if it dived straight into the content and spent more time on more advanced simulation techniques and packages before spending the other half of the semester on machine learning.",
                "Professor Daisuke was very open to suggestions for adapting the course to better suit student's needs. The lectures were engaging and there was a clear emphasis on how the material was useful for research. One of the few weaknesses of the course was simply the online format is hard to adjust to.",
                "I think it was a mistake to say that no programming experience is required. The first few weeks were a waste of time for students already familiar with programming and later weeks were way too difficult for students without previous experience.",
                "Perhaps more opportunities to practice coding (which could be optional) in addition to the problem sets could have been useful, but overall I thought the course was excellent.",
                "Strength: Nice and helpful professor and TA\r\nWeakness: Slightly boring",
                "Strengths: virtual format translated perfectly for the subject matter, very relevant to modern scientific measurement and data handling.\r\nWeaknesses: not many; honestly even as a brand-new coder I found the class straightforward-- as long as you put in the work to learn what you need to learn, you'll do great, which is personally how I think all classes should be.",
                "Strengths: The lab session was really instructive and the TAs were great. Also for each lab you are put into a group which really helps foster collaboration and makes the problem solving more enjoyable. Furthermore, the workload was very manageable but still enough to make you feel like you knew the material well. Weakness: if you have no programming experience at all the lectures move quite fast and often I didn't understand how to implement concepts until the weekly lab. However the lecture slides are a great resource to refer to and as long as you ask the TAs for help you'll be fine.",
                "Strength: Coding is fun! And the assignments were interesting, not too easy and not too hard, and fun to do. TAs were super great and helpful to talk to. Also it's broken up into two sessions which is better than having one super long session.\r\nWeakness: Lecture a bit boring, can be just as helpful to read the slides independently.",
                "I very much enjoyed this labI felt like what we learned was readily applicable to any kind of physics or science work I may do in the future and it will be incredibly useful to me later on. I also liked how we had the lecture time and then the lab time, as it broke up the time we spent sitting in front of the computer. The TA's were extremely helpful and approachable, so it was easy to ask questions and get assistance. However, I wish we could have gone more in depth; at times it felt like we glossed over topics because there is such a large volume of material we go over.",
                "The instructor and teaching fellows were very effective in providing as much help as possible to the students. The material was also interesting and generally presented in an engaging format. The lectures could sometimes feel a bit long and drawn out due to a lack of activities or class discussions. The assignments were generally well-structured and effective in cementing understanding. However, a couple of assignments did feel short, making it hard to feel confident in the material the assignment covered.",
                "An excellent introduction to modern computational techniques in science. Although the class was designed as a virtual lab to accommodate the constrains of this academic year, its content was exceedingly relevant (it should remain as a separate course since it fills a gap critical for physics majors). The depth in which numerical integration and differentiation were explored is a clear strength of this class. I enjoyed exploring what improvements could be made to the algorithms and feel like I have a thorough understanding of how they work. The PSETs were the proper difficulty as to be challenging yet rewarding, with cool connections to higher level physics. The machine learning component of the class was a great overview for beginners. Professor Nagai is super knowledgeable and enthusiastic! He breathes this subject and will make you spontaneously smile as you zoom through the lecture.\r\nThe vast range in background each student brings to this class is the largest challenge. Personally, I enjoyed the selection of content and found the lectures to move very quickly (in his excitement, Professor Nagai can really click through the slides). We needed a lot more time for the in-class exercises. It helped me to review and take notes on the lectures after class. However, one of my lab partners had not worked with Python before and was rightfully overwhelmed when we covered nearly all of it in the first three weeks. I would recommend getting comfortable with Python basics (data types, control structures, functions, etc.) before this class starts; it is not really an \"introduction\". On the other hand, some students were very good programmers and wanted to see more of machine learning and harder exercises. To improve the class for everyone, I would offer some resources in the syllabus for students less comfortable with Python to work through before the class and extra optional exercises for the experienced (this was a good feature added toward the end of the semester).",
                "Strengths: Engaging lectures, very reasonable workload, nice to stay with one lab group the whole semester.\r\n\r\nImprovements: The problem sets could be worded in more clear ways."

                "Absolutely! For those who have little or no python experience, the learning curve at the beginning is a bit steep, but by about the fourth lab I would say most students were running on a similar level. If you have some python experience, the class is still helpful as an introduction to certain methods such as Monte-Carlo simulations and machine learning techniques, which are still very important skills for research in the sciences.",

                "I would recommend this course to any student who wants a broad and functional introduction to scientific programing. Python is a great first language to learn and this course introduces you to a lot of advanced topics in a really accessible way. This is a great option for students who only need to learn to program for research and other purposes. However I wouldn't recommend this course as an introduction to CS. The skills gained in this course are very practical and application based and thus doesn't cover a lot of the typical base skills for CS.",

I learned a lot of basic concepts in Python programming for physics, so it was a great introduction to data science and machine learning topics. This is not really a substitute for a computer science class, however, and it felt like the vast majority of the students in this class had already learned how to program and had experience with data science and machine learning. Regardless, the work felt useful and meaningful, and the tasks not overwhelming at all, as compared with other lab courses I have taken.",
                "I think that the relatively low workload and interesting material covered make this course recommendable to other students. It does not demand a lot of working knowledge about physics, programming, or data science, which makes it even more accessible to non-STEM students. The assignments were not incredibly challenging and both the professor and teaching fellows were always eager to help in any way they could.",
                "YES, this class is essential to the modern physicist! Numerical methods and machine learning techniques are important tools used in research and across higher science. I truly learned some much this semester. This class really needs to become permanent. Also, Professor Nagai is amazing and definitely the one to take this class with! His excitement permeates the lectures and is contagious. The only caveat is that you should be comfortable with the basics of Python before the class starts; otherwise, you will have to scramble through the first couple weeks to which all basic programming is compressed.",
