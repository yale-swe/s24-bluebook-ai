   "comments": [
    "Before taking this course, I had very little understanding of different types of identity and the complexities involved in being ascribed or self-proclaiming an identity. This course really helped me become more open-minded, more aware of issues I had never noticed before, and more in touch with my own identity. In addition to content-related knowledge, we learned how to analyze a variety of sources including social science research (ethnography studies), op-eds, films, and even fiction. My writing has also improved over the course of the semester.",
    "Better outlook on life and identity, and good practice in writing",
    "By taking this course, I was able to improve my argumentative writing abilities and learn more about how to effectively create an argument. I also learned a lot more about identity than I was expecting to learn as the class covered a broad range of identity issues and topics.",
    "I improved my writing immensely, and I had the opportunity to read a variety of works that I found very engaging. I really enjoyed the small class size and Professor Homans' ability to guide conversation in a way that wasn't intrusive but also was supportive.",
    "How to write an argumentative essay with a set easy to follow structure.",
    "I came into this course wanting to be a better writer in terms of organization and structure and I feel like I've definitely achieved it. The subject matter in this course was very interesting as we dealt with the various ways' identity' and 'the self' are defined in different contexts. When writing about subject matter like this though, you have to be logical and direct in you thoughts and claim and I feel like by the last essay I had learned to finally do this concisely.",
    "Through this class, I learned so much about the definition of identity, different forms of identity, and various identity struggles pertinent to different societal or cultural groups. I learned how to think critically about identity, questioning the factors that make it up and can influence it. I developed the knowledge-base to properly hold a discussion of identity, something very valuable in our world today. I also really developed my skills of how to construct an argumentative paper, from having a clear problem being addressed, a claim and a motive, and clear and logical evidence.",
    "The class helped developed a stronger understanding of research-oriented writing and moreover offered valuable insights regarding how to develop a cohesive paper with effective sources, arguments, and overall cohesion.",
    "I learned how to be a more effective writer. I learned to push beyond the facts and underscore the \"why\" in my writing. I also gained valuable skills in deep reading of not only fictional works of literature, but also academic and research-based writings. Moreover, I learned how to incorporate fictional and non-academic works into academic writing.",
    "As a student who didn't write English paper before, I really developed my writing skills and feel more confident in taking other paper-intensive classes.",
    "I learned to write essays that are much more polished than I ever had before."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The variety in sources, subject content, and viewpoints was great. Class discussions were also very thought-provoking and educational. Research papers were extremely interesting, as people wrote about topics that they were passionate about, so it was fun reading and discussing different papers. \r\nPersonally did not find weaknesses in the course.",
    "One strength is that I did learn a lot about how to conduct research for papers, write good arguments, carefully analyze papers and passages, etc. \r\n\r\nOne weakness is that I did not learn as much as I was expecting in terms of writing style and grammar. Understandably, it is difficult to fit in lessons about this when much of the course is focused on how to create an argument. In the future, I believe that a little more attention could be focused on style and grammar as well as how to create an argument.",
    "This course was phenomenal. I loved it in every single way. I think our class was quite close as a group, and we all loved Professor Homans.",
    "In general it is hard to teach writing ability, particularly with only four papers, but I felt the class did a job job of pointing out the key features that make a strong essay.",
    "I feel like the strength of this course is that you get out of it what you put in. If you do the reading, really think critically and allow yourself to be open to criticism you can really practice building stronger arguments in both writing and speaking. In my particular seminar, it was very low pressure, so you could just do the bare minimum and get by just fine. But in order to get the most out of it and to really improve as a thinker and writer, do the readings, sit down and find a purpose to your writing assignments, and take advantage of Professor Homan's office hours",
    "This course was very well structured. The different sections of the course were distinct and equally interesting, and Professor Homans always did an amazing job of guiding our discussion. The material could not have been more fascinating, though the readings were a bit hefty at times. The workshop style of peer-editing was very beneficial, and also helped contribute to our sense of community in the class. I could not have asked for a better seminar.",
    "This course is a really great course. The small class size and seminar style is extremely conducive to student learning. The workshopping of papers in the format of the entire class reviewing students' papers is wonderful and truly leads to improvements in students' writing.",
    "Prof Homans is like a mother and she is always encouraging and considerate.",
    "This was a great course with an amazing professor who pushes you to try your best and to improve your writing in ways that are unimaginable."

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend! Very thought-provoking course that teaches you a lot.",
    "Yes, if you want an overview of the most recent views of anthropology and a course that challenges your world views, this course is for you.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are looking to learn more about argumentative writing and\/or want an introduction to what writing classes in college are like. If your main goal is to improve your writing style, a different course might be better.",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this course. It is a great way to learn how to write better. I think the small class creates a sort-of community that makes you feel comfortable in your writing and feel welcomed to share ideas. The class is highly cooperative, with very little competition between students if any. This class was one of my favorites so far.",
    "Yes. It will provide the necessary skills to write at a college level.",
    "If you manage to get in, I would absolutely recommend taking it. It was easily the best experience of my freshman year. Prof. Homans is excellent, and the workload is spaced out evenly enough that you actually have time to enjoy what you write.",
    "Yes! The subject matter is really interesting and applicable (I feel like I came away with a different outlook on self identification) and became a stronger writer along the way.",
    "Yes! Take this writing seminar! Professor Homans is absolutely amazing and the material is fascinating. The readings she selects made us reconsider what identity actually is, as we explored historic definitions of identity and modern conceptions of identity. We read and discussed pertinent identity struggles among different societal and cultural groups, and through our discussion I developed a better sense of what I believe identity is, as well as the ability to articulate my own identity as I never would have imagined. She gives amazing feedback on your papers, and the class is an environment of encouragement and learning when it comes to peer-editing. Definitely my favorite seminar at Yale.",
    "The class is a valuable course for individuals without a developed understanding of how to write an effective paper.",
    "Yes. This course is amazing. This course allowed me to learn not only in an academic manner but also a personal manner.",
    "Definitely take this course! It will lay a solid foundation for future Yale careers.",
    "I would recommend this course even if you were a good writer in high school. It is a lot of work but definitely worth the skills you gain."
