I came closer to answering some of the most fundamental questions that plague us like the role of suffering and happiness in our lives as well as what is a life worth living to us. I learned how to recognize when Im making universal vs subjective claims and to always have that distinction in mind.",
                "I learned about various visions of a life worth living through texts about different lifestyles and religions. I also reflected on what a life worth living meant to myself, my peers, and the Yale community.",

                "The strengths of this course were its inclusivity and its subjective nature. The insights I gained from this course definitely affected my other courses in literature and philosophy but also impacted my daily life by helping me define my values and goals. The weakness of this course was the plenary. I believe the plenary could have delved much deeper into the specific traditions rather than giving a brief summary. Although I appreciated how the course invited speakers from each tradition, sometimes I felt like they were too vague or were hesitant to be brutally honest.",
                "Strengths: the guest speakers and lectures were engaging and interesting, so were the readings! Weaknesses: would have been helpful to have an overview of the weeks topic in lecture before discussing it in seminar.",
                "Strengths: Great instructors and TFs all around. The class also offers a lot of diversity in thought on what makes a life worth living. Since Yale has so many people of different backgrounds, this class really gives you a neat perspective on the depth of the individual and the peculiarity of how different cultures approach a life worth living.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. I liked the discussions and all. I don't think theres a significant way this could be improved.",
                "A lot of readings! This could be a great thing, but I found that some materials never mad it into the discussion, so it could be cut down.",
                "Amazing course for discovering yourself.",
                "Range in topics and course structure was really great! I think the strength of the discussion relies a lot on the section leader and your peers though, which may be a weakness or strength. I also really liked the assignments and thought the workload was pretty light. I'm glad I have record of my thoughts and hopes at this time in my life and I think the length of the papers does a good job of encouraging us to be succinct but still think deeply about the prompts.",
                "I liked the readings and the classroom discussions--the format worked well. I think engagement in plenary was a bit low--I feel like the course was not set up for students to take plenary seriously."

                "Yes, this course is definitely a must for upperclassmen because it helps you define your focus in life after college and is a welcoming space to reflect on your college years.",
                "Yes, but shop the different sections and get to know the TFs. Youll be spending a lot of time learning from and with them.",
                "Yes, this is a great class, and it challenges you to think about your existence in ways you probably never have. It's somewhat like a philosophy class, but it's a bit more relaxed, and I think the grading is more lenient. You get to cover a lot of interesting traditions and also witness how much they've changed over time. The workload is manageable, and the readings are so interesting that I wouldn't really consider it work. There is also a retreat where you get to spend a day with your classmates in a remote area, which I thought was fun. The class is well-structured, and speakers are brought in for each tradition to enhance your understanding of them. I think you'll enjoy the class, regardless of your major, as long as you're truly interested in exploring and analyzing what it means to be human and what gives your life and others' lives purpose.",
                "I would. This is one of those courses where you can gain a lot that is useful for outside of the classroom.",
                "Yes! I will now be leaving Yale with a more open mind and a more stable outlook on life.",
                "Absolutely. Something you should take if you want to learn about yourself",
                "Yes, although the people who choose to take this course I think I generally quite self-selecting. It's a fun class work-wise and it prompts you to be introspective regularly throughout the course of the semester, which is nice. And somewhat therapeutic!",
                "Yes I would because it made me rethink how I approach my life and add value to my life."
