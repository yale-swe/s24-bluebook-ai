                "This was a general overview of time travel as a concept in science fiction, physics, and in historical research. I learned about the history of Time Travel, a lot about new and upcoming media, and different ways of thinking of time travel.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. I learned a lot about different ways to view history and to interact with it, while also learning about specific eras, locations, and periods.",
                "The course is a unique course. It allows one to be frustrated with the dimension of time, and within it - history - through special and different from the usual 'spectacle lenses'. The course makes it possible to change and expand the way we look at our history, past and future. I learned how to present the past - in a way that would serve the purposes of my presentation, research or agenda. I learned about the importance of the show itself - about the effect of conveying the message. Most of all - I learned about independence of thought, creativity, criticality and how to enable 'fresh thought'.",
                "The course exposed me to a plethora of new conceptspaleoclimatology, what it was like to live in the Victorian age, the physics of time travel, collectivism and social capitalmany of which I have become deeply interested in. More generally, the course taught me the value of interdisciplinary thinking in confronting some of the biggest questions of our age, especially those to do with emerging technologies and representations of the past."

                "Strength: Great readings, Professor Gaddis is a delight, as usual.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the class was more seminar based, where students could bounce ideas off of each other. At times, it felt like a lecture.",
                "It was a solid class! Your experience will vary wildly with your preparation. There's not a ton of incentive to actually do the readings, and if you don't do them. You won't get too much out of the class. You'll still probably do fine on the assignments, it just won't be that engaging. \r\n\r\nBut if you have the bandwidth to fully prepare for each class section, it will be a truly terrific class. The workload is super manageable, and Professor Gaddis is a legend.",
                "Strengths: Interactive\r\nWeaknesses: Did not engage with a ton of the reading\r\n\r\nCould have done a better job of incorporating more of the reading into weekly discussions. Sometimes I read the book for the week and we wouldn't talk about it at all. Maybe less reading for the course, so people are more motivated to do all the readings.",
                "S: What a unique subject to be able to discuss and study. We covered a lot of different themes, had excellent readings, and had a lot of freedom in our assignments and projects. The movies were also entertaining. The biggest strength is telling people I'm taking a class on Time Travel!\r\nW: We had a lot of guest professors and student speakers, and I would have liked to have more of Gaddis teaching. I think if we a main text that we worked through and Gaddis taught through it would help tie together the different subjects. I think we spent a bit too much time on certain subjects (video games and tech), and a lot of time on student presentations.",
                "I really liked the people that came in as guests, and the interactive classes and discussions. One weakness is some of the readings could be quite hard to finish in a week with other courses on top.",
                "I liked the different approaches to time travel that we looked at each week;the guest lectures were intriguing, I would have liked to hear more from Gaddis himself",
                "The course has a number of significant strengths that make it a fantastic course. \r\n1. Professor Gaddis - undoubtedly the best professor at the university - as a lecturer, and as a role model. \r\n2. The course participants - the undergraduate students (I was the only one who studied as part of a master's degree) - are intelligent, original and creative. It's an experience to study with such a group. \r\n3. The syllabus - enables a comprehensive learning of the subject of the course - from the presentation of the history of wars, natural disasters, sociological phenomena, etc. Varied syllabus, excellent reading materials, fascinating guest lectures. \r\n4. The course assignments allow integration - rare in the academic world! - of freedom of thought, creativity, and independence. \r\n5. Finally, this is not a classical or didactic course. He collapses in independent thinking, with a sober and critical view. Its added value is tremendous, much more than in other 'conventional' courses.",
                "Strengths: The reading list was excellent, containing a few books and plays that I've always wanted to read and many more that I had never been exposed to but enjoyed immensely. The guest lecturers were highly engaging and really supplemented the class discussions led by Professor Gaddis. The writing assignments, particularly the final project, were all very flexible, which allowed me to focus on the aspects of the course that I was most interested in. Professor Gaddis is a wonderful instructor. His interest in the topic of time travel and all of the concepts that fall under it was infectious, and he shared fascinating insights about all kinds of topics.\r\nWeaknesses: None. This was one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale."

I think you have to come into it wanting to do a specific project or study a particular part of time travel to get the most out of it, it helps to have focus for the assignments. The class can feel a little slow, and some classes are more interesting than others. I would definitely try to do as much of the reading as possible, especially the fiction pieces.",
