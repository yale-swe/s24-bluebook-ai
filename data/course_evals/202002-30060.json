   "comments": [
    "We read 10 Shakespeare plays and analyzed their plots, themes, symbols, etc. I also became more comfortable writing essays due to the *very heavy* writing load.",
    "This course taught me to read and understand Shakespeare. Beyond that, Prof. Brisman places a focus on clear, concise writing, so my grammar and attention to detail improved as well.",
    "This course was an intense, fantastic study into the histories and tragedies of Shakespeare. I learned so much about reading both quickly and in depth, as well as how to write with deep focus about a single theme, word, or phrase.",
    "How to deeply analyze Shakespearean texts and think intensely about meanings of passages, words, and phrases. A lot of critical thinking.",
    "My essay writing skills have greatly improved during this course.",
    "This class helped to truly immerse me in Shakespeare; we read quite a few plays in a short period of time, but the fast pace keeps you fully immersed in the text  in the words, the language of Shakespeare's characters  and allows you to build connections across the plays and the course.",
    "Starting writing English papers with a question and then building towards a thesis at the end. Understanding of literary ambiguities and 1600s English."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "You receive a LOT of feedback on your writing and specific suggestions about how to improve. However, the class moves at an incredibly fast pace. Reading two plays and writing two essays every week is very daunting and you burn out towards the end.",
    "I think this class would have been better in person rather than over Zoom, but I imagine this won't be a problem in the next iteration of the course.",
    "I thought that this was a very strong course generallyespecially considering that it was intended to be held in person this summer. Professor Brisman struggled with the Zoom sometimes, but it really was a fantastic experience, which I'm frankly glad COVID allowed me to enroll remotely in from home. It can be exhausting to sit for three and a half hours and talk about Shakespeare, but if you engage with the texts and with the class it is definitely worth it.",
    "I think there should maybe be three skips for the mini-essays because it was really hard to juggle long essays and mini-essays at the same time. I thought the pace of reading the plays was fine and the mini-essays in general were nice.",
    "The pace is a bit grueling. I appreciate the intensity is part of what makes this course so immersive, but I do question whether 8-9 hours of class time with twice weekly writing assignments is the best or only format for showing progress and engagement with a text. I also wish we could have had an actual full screening of one of the plays; it was lovely seeing multiple video clips in class and discussion sections, but difficult to analyze them out of the context of the rest of a production's staging decisions. I also think the option of preliminary or rough draft deadlines for the longer essays might have been helpful. \r\n\r\nThe strengths of the class definitely lie in how comprehensive the readings are  nine full plays, nothing left out  and the wealth of knowledge and prospective Professor Brisman brings into the classroom.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- Great selection of plays\r\n- Great teaching fellow\r\n- Great feedback on essays\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- My writing and understanding of Shakespeare improved drastically, but it took until the last week of class for me to evolve my writing to the specific expectations of Shakespeare analysis (this is more of a personal weakness than that of the class, but including some Shakespeare criticism as suggested readings at the beginning could help)"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I am really glad that I took this course and now I have a very solid understanding of Shakespeare and can actively participate in pretty much any conversation about his histories \/ tragedies. The reading list is the major benefit of this course. You have to, however, be prepared to put in an insane amount of effort. You might regret your choice to take this class while it's going on, but you will absolutely 100% be glad that you took it in retrospect.",
    "I would recommend this course with a caveat. Over the course of 5 weeks, students have to read 10 plays and write approximately 30 pages of critical analysis. This means reading a play and writing about 3 pages every 3.5 days for 5 weeks, and if my impression is correct, most students also watched film versions of the play before class, and had read secondary literature. All this is to say that this class is a major commitment, and consequently, I would recommend this class only to students with a serious interest in (or love for) Shakespeare.",
    "Definitely! If you are not particularly interested in Shakespeare, this likely is not the course for you. It's certainly not a \"gut\" class. But if you have ever wanted to learn more about his plays or are interested in studying English or drama, I would highly recommend taking this course as a deep dive into some of the most important works in the English language.",
    "I would recommend this course to another English student looking to fill the historical requirement.",
    "Yes! One of the best courses I have ever taken!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course: beware of the workload, enjoy the reading!",
    "Yes, I would. My reading comprehension and analysis drastically improved. The professor also explored modern American politics when he felt a moment in the text called for that connection."
