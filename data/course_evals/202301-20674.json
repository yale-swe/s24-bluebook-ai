                "I gained a much stronger knowledge of lie theory through this course. Skill-wise, because of the heavy reading requirement, I felt I became a much more efficient reader of mathematical texts and was better able to digest written materials.",
                "Math 470 is independent study, so the topic/skills/etc. are largely dependent on what you choose. If you have some topic you'd like to study that's not listed as a course (in this semester, it was Lie groups), and you know a professor who'd be willing to supervise a study, you can ask them to organize a Math 470 project/course for you. The structure will probably vary based on topic/professor, but the way it worked for us is that we were assigned readings from some textbooks, and we'd discuss them in class meetings once a week. (We had about 5 people doing the study together. Doing the study with other students/friends can help y'all bounce ideas, etc.) Our professor assigned us biweekly problem sets. Overall, this was a great opportunity to learn something outside of the course listings in a relatively more chill environment. This experience helped me learn how to learn math more independently, i.e. without the same structure as lecture - e.g. how to read textbooks, fill in the gaps in details in textbooks, etc. Content wise, we covered about as much as another math class in the same amount of time - i.e., we basically finished a textbook and a little more, so I'd say that the intellectual gain is substantial as well.",
                "You'll learn basically whatever you decide to explore/put on your syllabus! In our case, I learned what Lie groups and Lie algebras actually are, became comfortable with the classical Lie groups and Lie algebras and their properties, and got introduced to representation theory by applying it to Lie algebras. I also got practice with writing a mathematics paper and giving a presentation to other mathematicians, which was really fun."

                "I did enjoy our meetings and thought they were very productive, however, I think I would have learned the material better had we met more often.",
                "Strengths: small class size/independent structure of the class = more opportunity to work closely with a professor and students and cover different material at your own pace. This means you can really take a quality dive into material. Also you can choose the general topic! And overall I found the environment more chill than a larger/lecture class with more bureaucratic structure (e.g. we didn't have to take exams.)",
                "By design, the course strikes just the right balance between structure and flexibility that you'll get to explore topics to your heart's content. Doing math in a seminar style with a few friends and the professor is so fun and enriching, and I wish more math classes at Yale offered such an opportunity. Also, having biweekly (rather than weekly) problem sets and a final paper rather than a final exam was really nice, and I think I actually learned a lot more this way than I would have with the alternative."

Find a topic you want to learn more about and a professor you think might be open to sponsoring a project - this experience is great for learning how to learn math more independently, and can give you a deep dive into a topic of your choice. Meeting with a professor in a smaller setting also allowed me to ask more questions and to really dive into the details of material; I'd say a great part of this course is being able to work closely with a professor and other students.",
                "Yes, of course! Assuming you have a cool topic in mind, grab a few friends, find a good professor/mentor, and work on some cool math together!"
