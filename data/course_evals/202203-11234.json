                "Got a great fundamental understanding of general chemistry concepts and also a nice introduction to organic chemistry concepts that I'm sure will serve me well next term. My quantitative reasoning improved, and I also picked up some good study habits for chem-specific problems."

                "The content per chapter seemed uneven a lot of times.",

                "Great class, best chem class i've taken at yale",
                "Strengths: Caitlin! She is amazing. She is by far the best professor I have ever had for a Yale intro STEM course. I hated Gen Chem I, but she made me excited to learn in Gen Chem II. She is so understanding and accommodating, and it is so clear that she truly cares about our learning through her personality and all of her policies.\r\nWeaknesses: The units feel a little disconnected from each other, especially towards the end. Nuclear chemistry was interesting, but I didn't love having it lumped in with the introductory organic chemistry at the end of the course.",
                "I really enjoyed the separation of topics into smaller exams rather than one midterm and one huge final. I think sometimes the reading quizzes towards the end of the course did not line up with the reading itself.",
                "The grading system seems nice at first until you realize you might have to take over 8 exams and write a paper if you're shooting for an A.",
                "strengths: great professor, organized well, conducive to learning, organized in a way that rewards improvement",
                "I thought it was a good course",
                "The course was well taught, but it would be nice if the test had a longer format",
                "Strengths: Professor Davis, the grading scheme, small class size.\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "I think Prof Davis did a great job with this course. Some might say the retakes are weaknesses of the course as they end up taking away from the other midterms, but I think they are a strength because they emphasize the importance of studying properly the first time. Michael was also great in the class. The resources for this chem are, in my opinion, better than the first gen chem.",
                "Strengths: clearly taught, extremely thoughtful, fair, and thorough professor, ample opportunities to FULLY learn the material, not just \"get by.\" I loved the smaller \"leminar\" (lecture/seminar) class size, and it was so nice to have such an engaged professor who catered her teaching to her students' needs. I felt really seen and valued in this class which was so so nice and it definitely helped me actually learn what I needed to learn,. \r\nWeaknesses: Honestly none. This was a really great STEM class. I do wish it met twice a week for 1.25hr/lecture, as I think the material might be better covered over a longer lecture, but I know that this is the long standing structure of gen chem so no biggie."

The small class size allowed for more one-on-ones with the professor. The grading scheme promoted learning by assessing what you did wrong and a goal for improvement after every exam.",
                "I think you have to take it, but if you can try to take it with Prof Davis and Michael. Together they are fantastic teachers who will meet with you and explain the problems and concepts very well. I probably got more out of this gen chem than the first one (not saying a lot, I don't remember a lot from the first gen chem).",
                "Gen chem is gen chem  there are no bells and whistles  but Professor Davis is actually awesome. She renewed my faith in the idea that I belonged in STEM at Yale after some really rough semesters in large lectures but I so appreciated all the care she took to make sure we were learning. I feel like I have a great foundation going into organic chemistry and she made the class super fun. Pretty much everyone is in Gen Chem because they have to be for pre-med or another prereq, but taking it off-sequence with Professor Davis really is the way to go."
