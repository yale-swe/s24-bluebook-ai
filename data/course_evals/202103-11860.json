On the soft skills side, I learned how to give an efficient and entertaining science presentation and how to write in the style of a scientific paper. However, my biggest take-away from this course is that doing physics research requires a lot of grit and a lot of patience. There were many times during the semester when the experiment simply did not work and I eventually I learned to take it in stride and carefully zero in on the issue. That's what being a scientist is all about.",
                "I sharpened my programming and data analysis skills by working on the labs.",
                "I learned how to create longer-term experiment plans, collect and analyze data, and how to estimate more complicated or nuanced uncertainty values. I also practiced writing formal laboratory reports and keeping a lab notebook.",

            "comments": [
                "One strength of the course is the ability to chose your labs for the semester. You can work on experiments which you find truly interesting. Another strength is that you have the time to delve deep into each lab. Unlike 205L\/206L, you have time to really understand what's going on in each lab. A third strength is that there is a lot of room for flexibility. Many of the labs will not take the entire 24 hours of class time allotted, so you can explore extensions to what is in the lab handout. You will get out what you put in, so if you do not take the opportunities to do additional projects you will not get much out of the course. A final strength is that the professors are very kind, knowledgable, and patient. They will remind you why you love physics! One weakness of this course is that some of the labs are unbalanced in workload, although this is not too much of an issue because you will find opportunities for more work even in the lighter labs.",
                "The strengths of this course include the excellent help we received from Professor Lamoreaux and the exciting quantum cryptography lab. The main weakness of the course stems from the unclear lab handouts, often containing unclear wording and\/or typos. This caused confusion often that was cleared up by the instructors, but the handouts should still be updated to read better. Further, not much insight is given in conducting the data analysis, which required help from the instructors or outside sources.",
                "Strengths: fun labs, cool physics, very reasonable workload. Profs. Maruyama, Lamoreaux and Cahn were all helpful and supportive. Weaknesses: Although this course is a writing credit, I felt that we did not receive a level of feedback on our lab reports comparable to that in other WR courses. I would have liked to have gotten more specific suggestions and guidelines on how to produce good scientific writing. The Ising Model lab is kind of tedious.",
                "Overall, this was a very good course. Strengths: The labs were interesting and challenging. I had the chance to experience in-depth labs in areas of physics that I am less familiar in. Plus, there were only three labs in the semester, so I had the time to fully develop each experiment and analysis instead of rushing to get a lab report out every week like in 206. This lab is a more mature, better paced version of 206. Weaknesses: There was not much instruction on how to go about estimating uncertainties, so we were largely left to figure this out on our own. Also, there was no instruction or guides on how to use Python or Matlab, so I had to pick up a lot of those programming skills on the fly. It ended up working out, but it would have been nice to know going in. Also, the \"how to give a talk\" talk felt rather patronizing",
                "Strengths: expertise of the instructors and willingness of the instructors to help you out, enough flexibility to accommodate for experiments taking longer than usual or things going wrong or unexpected, and the way you have to work independently with your group to troubleshoot things",
                "The experimental labs were very interesting and well-organized, but the computational lab was a little confusing.",
                "Strengths: This course is VASTLY better than the intro sequence. The labs are (mostly) enjoyable and interesting, and that they allow one an entire month to work on them actually allows one to get a deeper understanding of what is going on. Professors Maruyama and Lamoreaux really care about the labs and will go out of their ways to help you (especially Lamoreaux). And it gives one a writing credit! Weaknesses: I cannot really blame them, but the TAs do not care even a little bit. If you need help, do not bother them - they are happy talking with each other about their research. Go straight to the professor leading the lab. Most of the labs are well-outlined and explained, but some are a little bit less so. I was excited about the concept of the mini-lectures, but they were extremely surface-level, poorly done, and generally a complete waste of time.",
                "I really enjoyed the collaborative atmosphere of the class  both with lab partners, and the TAs\/instructors (who were all extremely helpful). Lab was always engaging and mostly fun, even when it was challenging.\r\n\r\nSome of the lab manuals could be improved  there are many typos and confusing\/misleading sentences. Generally speaking, it takes the first week of each lab just to figure out what's going on and what you're supposed to be doing.",
                "It was a great course thats highly applicable to current physics research",
                "strength: nice professors, can choose own lab; weakness: lab doesn't really have a strong set of instructions and are often wandering in the dark"

                "I would recommend this course to another student. If you haven't done physics research before, this course will show you what research is like. Even if you have done research before, this course will give you the opportunity to experience research in new contexts. You can get a sense of what it is like to work in AMO physics, particle physics, and solid state physics, all in the span of a semester.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in delving deeper into the experiments related to the concepts they learn in physics courses. This is a moot point for physics majors who are required to take this course.",
                "It is a requirement of the intensive physics major, but I would strongly recommend this course to non-intensive majors as well. The workload is reasonable and the flexibility of lab choice makes it easy to learn about a field of physics that you find interesting. You don't really need to have taken 420 to complete this course. Having an introductory knowledge of the basics of statistical mechanics is probably enough to understand the physics of the required Ising model lab.",
                "I'd say so. The labs were interesting, and the skills in data analysis, error analysis, and experiment planning and organization are invaluable for any physicist. I think my biggest takeaway from this lab was in keeping a detailed online lab notebook even for computational projects, which I started doing for my own research after doing so in this lab. Make sure you know some Python and Matlab going in, and be attuned to your uncertainties and how to estimate them from the very beginning, it will save you a lot of trouble.",
                "Yes; this class is so much better than the intro physics labs and a must-take for intensive physics majors",
                "Yes! I thought the experiments were fun and a really encouraging way to explore physics beyond the typical lecture course.",
                "Yes if you are interested in developing experimental skills.",
                "For the most part, I really enjoyed this class. It is a fascinating material and through the struggle (which almost entirely takes place in the course) one does learn a lot (unlike 205\/206). The workload is actually probably less than any other physics course I have taken at Yale! I would recommend this course to any physics major (intensive or not) or anyone with the prerequisites (you do *not* need 420) who needs a writing credit.",
                "It's mandatory for the Intensive Physics track  not sure I would have taken it otherwise, but I am really glad I got the chance! The experiments are genuinely cool and it requires very different skills from lecture courses.",
