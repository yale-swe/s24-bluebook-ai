                "I learned how to critically evaluate different approaches to biography. We thought philosophically about the best way to capture a life in words. I gained new experience writing in a biographical narrative, and testing out different ways of doing so.",
                "This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale - you learn critical skills about doing archival research as well as develop g your writing skills and learning about the gendre of biography. You spend the entire semester dedicated to one research project.",
                "I learned so much about biography as a genre, and how it relates to history, sociology, fiction writing, etc.",
                "This class taught me how to critically think about what a biography is, how to responsibly research and also how to conduct interviews. After taking this course I have an expanded view of the field of biography and also an understanding of the author's role in any work.",
                "I had never before considered trying to write biography, and its now one of my primary project goals. I hadnt ever considered the field as anything more than an attempt to gather facts, but there is so much more to biography, to the conventions and the ways in which they can be broken. There is a way to balance intense research with creative expression, and it can be done through biography."

                "I don't think anything in this course should be changed. I loved the class in the YUAG and listening to Paul Berry play music.",
                "The course had a very high work load which may not be ideal for every student taking the course with others. I found that my interest and my observed interest of others depended on their passion for the subject they were writing on and passion for Biography. I had less of these two factors so the work load was a bit intense for me with a book to read each week. That said the exploration to a new and untapped kind of writing was exhilarating and I thoroughly enjoyed the new ways Professor Roffman would ask us to think about Biography, ask us about our own thoughts, and the best part was the visitors she would invite to tell us about biography.",
                "Strengths - Professor Roffman is incredible, such a bright light. She approaches working with each student a little differently, and helps you generate wonderful new ways of thinking about the person you choose to write the final project about. This course also had so many visiting biographers and class trips, that it truly felt like we were getting an immersive experience in the world of biography.",
                "The class is clearly structured into two sections - reading biographies and writing biographies. However, you are doing research and reading other biographical works at the same time throughout the semester. In this way, Professor Roffman ensures that you are developing both skills and uses the readings as paths to developing your own biographical style.",
                "I love Prof. Roffman's style of teaching. I love the selection of texts, the guests she invited, and the feedback she gives. I can't think of any weaknesses of the course.",
                "Professor Roffman is absolutely incredible and brings in a ton of guest speakers. These conversations are invaluable because you have the opportunity to talk with biographers who are currently at work on projects and hear about their experiences at different parts of the process.",
                "I thought the reading list for this course was excellent, as were the questions posed to make us challenge the purposes of biography. I think we could have possibly been challenged to write even more earlier on, but I thought the course was generally excellently structured so wouldnt want to disrupt that."

                "Yes!",
                "Yes absolutely, this was a great course for the self-motivated and passionate student interested in learning about a niche subject. I would advocate for anyone who is at all interested in taking the class to push themselves and try it even if they don't know if they will like it. There is space for everyone in Prof Roffman's class and you get to choose who you write about which takes some pressure off being in love with everything about the class (which as I am, most people would say they DID love everything about the class).",
                "Please take this class! It is a once in a lifetime experience to get to speak directly to the wonderful course guests Professor Roffman brings into the class. She has so many wonderful connections in the field, and this class expands to cover so many different types of biography, including modern biography, traditional biography, cultural history, etc.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student who has a clear idea about who they want to research going into the course. The class jumps really quickly into the biographical research, so it is crucial that the student knows about who they want to write about before taking the class.",
                "Absolutely! If you're interested in learning more about biography and working on a personal project, this class is the perfect place for it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who wants to tackle the biography format and is willing to be open minded about what the field of biography means. It is an incredible opportunity to learn how to research thoroughly and also how to express that research in a creative format.",
                "Yes for sure. That being said, this is a course oriented around a single independent research project. If you have no strong interest in researching a single person for an extended period then you probably wont enjoy this course so much, though I dont doubt you would still learn valuable skills."
