                "The course offered a really great balance between the past and present of American foreign policy. We engaged with foreign policy decisions and events in the latter half of the twentieth century, and connected them to the current moment to help frame our thinking about the consequences of those decisions and their political impacts today. The memo assignments were really formative, and taught me how to propose solutions and write about situations in a concise way, which I know I'll take with me in the future.",
                "A lot  - writing, critical thinking, american history",
                "I learned the brevity and structuring necessary for policy memos. I learned a lot about the history of foreign policy. I really enjoyed talking with Howard Dean. He has an encyclopedic knowledge on a lot of this stuff, really enjoys getting to know his students, and chooses great readings.",
                "Robust 20th century foreign policy discussion",
                "I learned a lot about the history of US foreign policy and got insight into the factors that affect that kind of decision making. The real strength of this class, however, was the people in it and the personal experience they were able to bring to each discussion.",
                "Knowledge about how to function in a large bureaucracy and the personnel management required in foreign policy decision-making.",
                "This class gave me a chance to engage with broad foreign policy topics. We approached learning about foreign affairs from the perspective of individual politicians instead of engaging with abstract IR theories",

The material covered a wide variety of foreign policy events and issues from the administrations of President Truman to President Obama, with special emphasis on their relevance today. The make-up of the class was also terrific. Few, if any, weaknesses.",
                "Strength: Howard is the best!! He prioritizes building a class community and learning from one anothers unique experiences. I loved hearing his stories and how they inform his views today.",
                "Howard was great! The class was very interesting and engaging",
                "I would like to see a little more structure in the discussions. I appreciate that Howard let the students talk about what was on their mind, but frequently we went off on rabbit trails that avoided some of the key issues in the readings.",
                "Strengths are Howard! No real weaknesses",
                "The main strength of the course is Howard. He's fantastic. The main weakness is that discussions were disorganized. Students were free to voice whatever topic they wanted. Sometimes it was fruitful, but often the discussions got boring because of this.",
                "I loved this class. It was everything I wanted from the Global Affairs major. Howard is amazing and he takes the time to get to know the students on an individual level. One minor critique is that for me, some of the classes felt a little bit unorganized because discussions would go off into tangentsstill great learning experiences nonetheless."
