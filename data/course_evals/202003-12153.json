On the other hand, Prof. Fortner is a great instructor when one-on-one, and is extremely accommodating, which was an underrated trait until the pandemic happened haha",
                "There is a lot of content to cover but it is well broken up and the book is very easy to follow. The problem sets are challenging, but it feels like this prepares us for the exams. The three exam model feels appropriate for the material also!",
                "Strengths: its a class that really builds on itself  once you figure out the initial thermo stuff, its kind of all repetition from there. Fortner does a great job of pointing that big picture out.\r\nWeaknesses: can rush over some derivations, but theyre not that important."
