                "Getting to bring in a new poem a week was an awesome format. I was enough to make the poem feel weighty but not overwhelming. I also liked getting to poke around poems to bring in something I found online or in a book every week, it was a very valuable experience. I wish that the poems we were allowed to bring in could be from a wider range of authors, perhaps going further back in time. I also with the format of sharing the poems we brought in could be a little different because sifting through ~14 poems in an hour meant that we didn't get to focus too much on any one. I also wish the format of critique was a little more open, perhaps more done in small groups, which was how we edited in the last class. I found that format more helpful then the formalized, everyone speaks once and author speaks last version we used in most of class.",
                "Strengths: writing a poem every week is very helpful in being consistent with your writing practice, I also enjoyed the workshops and felt people had helpful feedback, I also enjoyed getting to know a bit about each other through the anthology poems we would bring each week, office hours with Professor Zarin are quite helpful Weaknesses: you don't get much feedback on your work unless you are in workshop or go to Professor Zarin's office hours outside of the midterm and final check-ins"

                "Yes, I would. If you want to develop a consistent poetry writing practice, this course will help you do just that. I appreciated coming out of the course with about 13 new poems that had received notes either in workshop or office hours.",
