                "A great strength of this course is definitely Su Laoshi. From what I could tell, he's just as passionate about teaching as he is with Chinese in general. He is very personable and with his opportunities to each lunch with him every Friday, you really feel like you get to know your classmates and Su Laoshi a lot better. Su Laoshi also often incorporates his knowledge about China in general, and I really enjoyed him recounting stories. \r\n\r\nAs for an improvement, I think one thing that I would've enjoyed learning about more is the etymology behind new words we learn, such as why a certain word is written the way it is, as well as perhaps more time being spent on simplified vs traditional chinese.",
                "The course is incredibly well-designed, and Su Laoshi makes learning Chinese very interesting and rewarding. A lot of the course material was designed to help us learn useful things and learn them in a way that sticks. In my opinion, the only thing this course lacked was practice on handwriting Chinese, but the online Zoom format accounts for most of that, and I imagine that there is more practice with handwritten tasks during a normal semester."

                "Yes, for anyone that is considering the possibility of interacting with China in the future, or is just genuinely devoted to learning the Chinese language.",
                "Absolutely, especially to students who dreaded learning Chinese as a kid. This class has probably been my favorite class at Yale so far, and you will never go wrong with taking a class with Su Laoshi. The class is engaging, incredibly rewarding, and dare I say... fun.",
                "Yes! It is a wonderful way to learn not just Chinese but also maintain intellectual interest through discussion of idioms and societal issues.",
                "I would only recommend this class to students who already have a really strong foundation because the course is very unstructured and relies heavily on pre-existing knowledge or extensive outside help (from parents or tutoring options). This is an \"easy\" class if you're already good at Chinese and don't need to learn language skills from class -- most of our time was spent with the professor telling personal stories, and we never went over grammar or vocab, despite each having over 100 vocab words on average per chapter. Besides exams, it felt relaxed because deadlines for assignments were flexible, regular homework assignments weren't graded with corrections, and most textbook exercises were done in class. However, there wasn't much detailed explanation or applied practice that's more typical of other Yale language courses (as someone who took 152 and 153). The professor himself is very nice and caring, but his expectations of what you're learning from this class is less about skills and more about exploring higher level concept about Chinese culture and society with topics like government corruption, migrant workers, etc -- it's a class about bringing new interesting topics into discussion. For example, essay and presentations assignments are graded mostly on how new and exciting the content is rather than how well the vocab and grammar introduced in the textbook is used. So, if you're already good at Chinese and just wanna vibe with a professor that tells stories, take this class. If you feel like you're still in need of building up your language skills, I would not recommend unless you're willing to make it your biggest priority."
