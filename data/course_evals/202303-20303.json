                "quantum chem, basic orgo, solid state chem",
                "I learned a more in-depth version of many of the concepts in AP Chemistry. We also covered basic Orgo and Solid State Chem, which allowed me to tie together all the concepts we learned.",
                "I learned about advanced topics in chemistry: quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, and solids.",
                "Atomic and molecular orbitals, organic chem nomenclature, basic organic chemistry reactions, solids (lattices, packing structures, etc.), transitional metal chemistry",
                "lots of chemistry nuances, especially about quantum mechanics, how to read scientific articles efficiently, and approach stem thinking well",
                "The foundations of a great intuition for chemistry, expanding my idea of how the discipline of science functions, new approaches to learning and applying what I've learned",
                "I learned about basic quantum mechanics, molecular orbital theory, organic chemistry, transition metal complexes, extended solids, and band theory, among other topics. We covered a wide array of interesting concepts. I also think I got better at applying complex topics to solve application-based questions. I appreciate that Professor Mayer also talked about diversity in the sciences (or lack thereof) and added interesting enrichment readings to our PSets about the transition into college, among other topics.",
                "I gained skills in quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, and solids. I learned a lot on an individual level across these disciplines, and was also able to combine some ideas across the three.",
                "Knowledge: in-depth understanding of key topics such as quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and solid-state chemistry. \r\nSkills: time management and critical thinking (especially while working through problem sets and tests)\r\nInsights: exposure to fundamentals of chemistry",
                "I learned a lot of chemistry, a lot of it was new (e.g. organic chemistry, quantum mechanics).",
                "From this course, I gained a great understanding of how different types of chemistry interact and relate to one another.",
                "I developed a lot of critical thinking skills and learned to really understand chemistry and course material on a deeper level. I further developed my passion and interest for chemistry and I really loved learning and the effort put into the class was palpable. The test questions are very fair and truly test your ability to think about the material on a deeper level.",
                "Quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, transition metal chemistry, and solids chemistry",
                "I learned SO much in this class. It is more like an introduction to all branches of Chemistry than a typical general chem class. It starts with quantum mechanics which becomes a basis for all the other topics of chemistry. This foundation is crucial to understanding the subject, and it's hard to see how I could understand any chemistry without it. It helps you think much more like a chemist and predict a lot of the trends we learn throughout the semester. Professor Mayer also covers organic, transition metal, and solid state chemistry, which were all very fun to learn and gave me a good understanding of paths I can take as a chem major. The section on organic chemistry focuses a lot on molecular orbital theory, which I think will be very helpful for organic chemistry. The psets push you to develop an intuition for how to explain chemical phenomena and really excited me for chemistry. I'm so happy with the things I learned in this class.",
                "Expanded my knowledge on known chemistry concepts using quantum mechanics and tying everything back to orbitals. Learned a lot of theoretical chemistry that will set the base for a lot of what I do in the future. I learned a lot from inorganic to organic chemistry, even though I had already taken the IB course in the past. 163 did, in fact, expand on a lot of the concepts that I was previously acquainted with such as band theory, cubic structures, organic mechanisms, etc.",
                "Prof. Mayer relayed extremely dense information regarding quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, and solids in a digestible, comprehensive, and engaging manner. He truly helped me strengthen my understanding of these concepts on a deeper level and how they relate with each other.",
                "I have never learned so much in a chemistry course before. The class dives into three main units: quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, and solids. CHEM 163 is a conceptual rather than math-based course (there really isn't any math at all), so it really helps build your intuition as a chemist.",
                "I gained a solid conceptual foundation for a variety of chemistry topics. This course teaches you how to approach chemistry's more open-ended questions and provides knowledge that can be applied to real world problems."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Amount of help/office hours. Prof. Mayer, the TFs and the peer tutors (especially them!) are all very accessible and easy to approach with questions about exam topics, psets, or anything else in the course. The lack of quantitative work makes it easier to focus on the conceptual side of each topic, which is helpful considering many of the topics (QM especially) are conceptually very difficult at first. Weaknesses: sometimes the psets can feel excessively long, but usually there feels like there is a purpose to each question. The exams are fair, but there are always a few questions that you really could not have prepared for by reviewing the course content.",
                "strengths: mayer is fantastic. truly passionate about teaching and the material. psets were of manageable length. weaknesses: im not 100% sure whether i buy yale's vision for \"advanced gen chem.\" this felt more like a special topics class.",
                "The strengths are: interesting content, good preparation for future chemistry classes, and small class size. \r\nThe weaknesses are: an extremely fast pace and some inconsistency/confusion surrounding the content. \r\nI suggest evaluating the content and eliminating what is not as necessary, which will allow students to absorb and understand the content better.",
                "This course covers a lot of information, but it is possible to keep up by going to discussion sections and carefully reading through the PSets. Additionally, the three midterms is a lot, but it makes studying for the final slightly easier at the end of the year.",
                "Strength of this course is that the content is very interesting, and the peer tutors are very helpful. A weakness of the course is that the exam questions are very difficult and confusing, and it always feels like such a step up from the problem sets.",
                "Strengths: by taking this course instead of regular gen chem, you can skip over the basic chemistry (atoms, ions, etc.) and jump right into new information! The professor is really nice and passionate, and there is a great peer tutoring system.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the beginning of the course can be somewhat difficult - not only are you (likely) taking your first college chemistry class, but the information is very conceptual and non-intuitive. As the class progresses though, it definitely gets easier to handle.",
                "good material, but pace was a bit quick sometimes",
                "I loved this course so I am biased, but I think its just an incredibly strong course and any weaknesses are just intrinsic to the great aims of it. I wish we covered even more depth into the organic chemistry aspect and that pre-midterms we got more than one practice midterm",
                "The peer tutors and the TFs were a huge strength in the course. Without the added enrichment outside of the lecture, I would have really struggled with the homework assignments. My understanding is that the PSets were purposefully structured this way so that we would most likely have to seek our help to deepen our understanding. The size of the course (40 students) was also a big strength. This made me feel more comfortable asking questions in class and created somewhat of a communal \"we're in this together\" feeling. A weakness was that the lectures were sometimes disorganized and too fast. In particular, I remember not understanding the lecture on carbocations and Sn1 vs. Sn2 at all. I think the TFs were aware that sometimes Professor Mayer was moving a little too fast. I think the course could be improved by doing a better job of slowing down and summarizing what we learned. The course was definitely challenging, but it supplied us with the necessary extra help resources to improve our understanding.",
                "This course is a great continuation to high-school chemistry and gives a lot of good information that will help with later specialization in chemical fields.",
                "Strengths: tests and problem sets are more focused on conceptual applications of topics learned in class, great in-class demonstrations that really explained the concepts learned in class, review sessions before each tests were amazing\r\nWeaknesses: problem sets were slightly long, lecture slides could be organized a little bit more as they were quite lengthy and often contained digressions, very fast-paced class, achieve homework due every week was also quite lengthy considering it was worth a very small percentage of the final grade, hard to know your grade until the end since the entire class is curved",
                "I love that the class was challenging enough to the point that I'm being pushed to really learn but not pushed too hard. I think a weakness would be some clarity or directionality of what to study of the exams and final (wished we got more practice than just one practice exam).",
                "It covers a very wide breadth of interesting course material in a manner that emphasizes understanding rather than rote memorization. Another strength of the course was the support available throughout the sister. The TFs and Peer Tutors are amazing and really helped me learn the concepts.",
                "The peer tutors are an amazing resource and super helpful! Office hours are great for strengthening your learning and vital if you want to best prepare yourself for the difficult material the course presents.",
                "This course really introduces you to many topics in the field of chemistry and ties the material into current events, research, and other fields of science. It makes learning a lot more fun and gives the whole class a sense of direction. The discussion sections were extremely helpful and so were the weekly pset help sessions as well as review sessions led by the Professor Mayer, the TFs, and peer tutors. The psets were very long but pushed you to learn a lot and were pretty fun. Professor Mayer is very kind and is always willing to help students and offer opportunities. Weaknesses are that usually content for the tests is taught all the way up to the day of the exam, which could be a little stressful.",
                "It sometimes goes very fast on important info and very slow on other less relevant info. I like that quantum mechanics was first.",
                "Strengths: Through the assignments, outside resources, in class questions, etc. provided to us throughout the course, Prof. Mayer utilized a variety of methods for us to develop our grasp of the concepts. Additionally, Prof Mayer eagerly answered questions, which removed my anxiety regarding asking questions and seeking help.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I dont really have anything negative to say about the course",
                "As for strengths, there were excellent resources outside of class time for facilitating learning. The peer tutors this semester were amazing, and it's really helpful that both the TFs and Professor Mayer himself hold office hours each week. As for weaknesses, I feel that at times we went through content a bit too quickly, even for a class marketed as fast-paced. (This was especially noticeable in the second unit, orgo, when we began to fall a bit behind Mayer's content schedule.) Overall, though, I still think the class was excellent.",
                "The lectures are very dense and conceptual, so the material can become obscure and overbearing when studying for exams. However, there was a strong support system for reinforcing the material covered in lectures, including peer tutoring and discussion sections with your TA."

                "If you have a strong interest in chemistry, yes. If you just want to get your gen chem requirement done, then I would suggest taking Chem 161. If you are interested, however, despite the increased difficulty and workload it feels very rewarding and deepens your understanding of chem topics that you will see in the future if you continue taking chem courses.",
                "yeah! if you've taken ap in high school and done well, take 163 over 161. if you have the option to take 174, do that instead.",
                "I would recommend this course as the topics were complicated but still engaging and interesting to learn about.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. It is extremely difficult and Chem 161 fulfills the same requirement and is a lot easier. Take that even if you scored well on the AP exam.",
                "Yes! While I certainly had trouble at first (unit 1 is a little hellish and the P-Sets are no joke), I feel like my chemistry knowledge grew significantly and I feel like am more equipped to take college level STEM courses. That being said, if you are just looking to get chemistry out of the way, take regular general chemistry. This class is definitely harder.",
                "yes, as it teaches a lot about chemistry and well, at that matter",
                "Absolutely please take this course if you are willing to try and put effort into expanding not only your knowledge of chemistry but your mind as well",
                "This course was definitely challenging, but I would recommend it to a student who is genuinely excited about learning advanced chemistry topics, especially if they've already taken AP Chem. This course is definitely a step up from CHEM 161 and I would advise a student only take this if they're actually excited to learn and challenge themselves. If the goal is just to fill a prerequisite, then CHEM 161 might be the better choice.",
                "I would! The TFs were incredible, the lectures engaging, and the course material challenging yet fun.",
                "I think it depends on the level of chemistry that you have had before. If you have studied chemistry before and are very interested in the material, this class is the one for you! You will feel very intellectually challenged and gain a lot of exposure to various fields of chemistry. However, if you are new to chemistry, I would suggest 161/165 as 163 is quite fast-paced and challenging.",
                "I think that if you did complete ap chemistry in high school and want that challenge or planning to major in something related to chemistry, I feel that this class might be useful as it sets you well for future chem classes. But, if you're not really looking for that academic challenge, chem 161 is a good option (fits the same requirement).",
                "Absolutely. The course was intellectually stimulating, and I learned so much from the course, developing a greater love for chemistry.",
                "YES! I really enjoyed Chem 163 and the professor and TAs are great! While it is difficult, you will really like learning the material no matter the difficulty. It is truly rewarding and there is a full support system from the teaching team that wants to see you succeed through the challenging course.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless you are very interested in a wide range of chemistry .  I think that the Orgo unit will probably be useful for pre-meds, but not much else. This course is much harder than regular gen chem and requires a lot of effort and studying.",
                "If you have already taken IB or AP Chemistry, TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!!! It expands your knowledge sooooo much further than 161 would, and for me it fueled a passion for chemistry that I am very excited to continue exploring.",
                "Yes. Especially if you are already going into gen chem with an expanded chemistry background, it will be very interesting and will develop a lot on what you already know. A good refresher too!",
                "Yes, I would defined recommend this class, as it truly strengthens your foundation and expands upon your current understanding of chemistry, even if you already feel like you have a solid grasp of the basics.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course! Just note, though, CHEM 163 is not for the faint of heart; I did end up spending a disproportionate amount of time on this class, but ultimately it's my favorite one I took this semester. As far as difficulty goes, the class content is definitely challenging, but very enriching. As for PSets, I do think it would be very difficult to complete them (at least correctly) without going to at least one peer tutor or TF office hour or professor office hour each week; however, going to these sessions encourages you to ask good questions, and also helps you learn not just from the instructors but also from your peers. \r\n\r\nI was very nervous to enroll in CHEM 163; I'd heard a lot about how hard the class was with little benefit. But having completed the course, I'm so so grateful that I decided to take it. This is easily the most intellectually rewarding chemistry course I've taken so far, and I would have felt like I was missing out/was not being pushed had I decided to take regular gen chem. It's quite a time commitment, so keep that in mind, but if you're on the fence about CHEM 163 I would absolutely say you should at least give it a go. Professor Mayer is very passionate about what he teaches, and it's a great class overall.",
                "I would only recommend this course for students with a strong background in Chemistry who have a genuine interest in the subject. If you are new to chemistry and/or don't have extensive experience and are just taking the course to fulfill a requirement, I would stick to Chem 161."
