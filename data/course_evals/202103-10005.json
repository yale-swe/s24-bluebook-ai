                "I gained insights about what it means to work in the food service industry, the history of Chinese restaurants in the U.S., the interplay of trauma and eating disorders, and much more.",
                "As the title of this class implies, I learned about the intersection between food, identity, and desire. I learned about the labor behind food (e.g. in restaurants, school cafeterias), the importance of food and food practices, how identity (including race, class, gender) is reflected in food, and that desire can be interpreted in different ways.",
                "This course showed the intersection between food and class, gender, race, and sexuality. I gained a greater awareness of the world around me and the ways that our identities are linked to food and how food represents so much more for many people. The class included memoirs and fiction, short academic pieces and haunting pieces of self-reflection. As someone who hasn't thought that much about the connection between self and food, I learned so much. I think this would be just as generative for someone who was already very familiar.",
                "I really learned how to think creatively and engage with different mediums meaningfully.\r\nI also feel as if I gained much more vulnerability and grace with regards to talking about food.",
                "I learned so much in this class! It really opened my eyes about the complexities of food's role in our society (note: super complex) and also allowed me to explore my relationship with food further.",
                "I can't say I learned any totally new skills, but I definitely took a freer approach to writing a paper and also this was the first class in which I ever wrote an interview paper, so that was really new and fun.",
                "I truly learned to think in a new way. I feel more comfortable with my ability to explore complex topics about my own desires and identity!",
                "Overall, I learned so much about food, identity, and desire in this class from a number of perspectives I have never encountered in a college class before. It was very refreshing to be able to talk about these topics in a way that did not have to be super academic or intellectual but could just be rooted in personal experience. I really enjoyed learning about Indigenous food-ways and African-American food-ways at the beginning of the semester because I feel like it gave us important framework to carry through the rest of the class. I think my favorite unit was when we read three books (two memoirs and a novel) because the prompted a lot of deep personal emotions related to the class themes and I think some of the best discussions we had. I also learned a lot about food as work and about the politics of food service jobs which I thought was really interesting and important to learn about especially within the context of the pandemic. This class had a great balance between talking about food in a larger socio-political context but also in very specific cultural and personal contexts as well, and drawing the connections between the two contexts.",
                "Looking at food and identity from a variety of perspectives. Really interesting pedagogy and engagement in the classroom about sensitive topics and cultivated a very expansive environment.",
                "I learned so much about how our food practices connect to our identity. I have never really thought about what a recipe might mean to the person who wrote it or what it might show about them. This class totally changed my worldview on food. I think we often don't think about the labor that goes into preparing food either. This class is so incredible.",
                "I learned so much about food and how largely it impacts every aspect of our lives, especially desire, gender, and identity. Id never been exposed to this classs style of kitchen table discussion and really liked how much of the class focuses on sharing from your own experiences.",
                "I leaned so much about how to engage in meaningful discussion around food and just meaningful discussion in general.",
                "i learned about the intersectionality between food, identity, and desire through a series of excellent readings and cooking demonstrations, historical background to a variety of dishes! there's no way i can simply list all the insights i developed from the course, but one critical one is the importance of empathy. i did not realize the amount of judgment i had for others and for myself until this past semester, and this course was one of many factors that allowed me to feel like i grew more as a human being.",
                "Although I believe most people could generate some type of response about the ways in which food, identity, and desire intersect, this course gives students the time and space to really delve into the ways in which these three concepts impact people in all different ways. Food can be used as a way to inflict self-harm, or self-control, maybe even self-healing in times of grief. Food can be used as a means of bringing us closer to people, culture, or home as a part of our identity. And food can be deeply ingrained with our desires for ourselves, others, and our society. This course is an introduction to all of these things, and the discussion-based format allows students to focus on the areas that interest them most.",
                "I learned so much about the significance of food as it connects to history, race, class, gender, etc. This class has inspired me to dig deeper into the history of food."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The assignments allowed us to have fun, be creative, and explore areas of the course topics that we found compelling. Weaknesses: I wish we could have done more embodied cooking experiences. I know that covid presented a lot of challenges and I'm grateful that we could do this course in person regardless, but the embodied cooking was really memorable. I also would have liked to spend more time thinking about food in terms of food deserts, hunger, food justice, etc. not just in terms of cooking and restaurants.",
                "Strengths: amazing professor; GREAT class format - I LOVED the kitchen table discussions because they led to really engaging conversations; embodied food practices the first few weeks made learning fun/engaging; interesting readings; paper topics were very interesting/engaging/fun\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: can't think of any!",
                "Really only strengths! Such a great class. The syllabus was perfect. The first couple weeks focused on historical basis for food and its connection to race, class, and indignity. This was a great building point for the rest of the class. This was maybe the first class where I felt like I was truly doing the readings simply because I was fascinated by them. The memoirs were gut-wrenching and page-turning and so generative for class discussions. Much of the discussion in class was in small groups which took a lot of pressure off and allowed for lively and thought-provoking conversations before returning to the larger class. Finally, the projects at the end helped make the learning our own and created a bonded class environment.",
                "Strengths: pedagogy of the class, meaningful readings for the class that were genuinely wonderful to read, guiding discussion questions taught me how to frame questions creatively and reflect introspectively",
                "Strengths: The format of the class. We read before class, break into small groups that really facilitate discussion, and then came together as a class. It was almost always interesting and engaging. \r\nI have no complaints.",
                "I think one of the strengths of this class was its format. We would discuss readings in \"kitchen tables\" (i.e. groups of four or five) and it was truly much easier to let myself struggle with ideas and grapple with concepts in the texts we read.\r\n\r\nI think in that same vein, one weakness of this course was that I didn't really get to know many people outside of my \"kitchen table.\" We were definitely allowed to sit wherever we want, but many people sat with the same people over and over, and it sort of lead to our discussion styles becoming very repetitive and predictable, as everyone at my table sort of knew or could predict better and better how other people would contribute to discussions.",
                "I think one major strength of this course was Professor Trumpler's dedication to intentional pedagogical choices that make the classroom actually feel like such a warm environment and less institutional/academic. There was an emphasis on group discussions which made class very fun and engaging and fostered long-lasting connections between students. Additionally, the readings were very fascinating, and though sometimes long, they weren't extremely or unbearably time consuming to complete. I also loved the embodied practice we got to do as part of the class, and while covid made it slightly difficult, I wish we had gotten to do more of it. The assignments (two papers and one presentation with a partner) were very doable and flexible. Personally, I think that the exercise of doing the assignments and planning them was extremely effective in helping me process course themes, and even if the final product didn't feel like a masterpiece it was okay because it was still thought provoking. \r\nI think one weakness of the course might be that we covered so many topics sometimes there wasn't a huge amount time to sit with something and reflect because we only had class once a week and every week we usually had a new topic or reading to discuss. I think that the assignments gave some space to delve back into a topic more in depth, and another way to address this might be to allow 10 or 15 minutes at the beginning of the class to return to previous weeks conversations (we did this sometimes which was nice, but if it was a regular thing it might be more engaging since students would know it was happening).",
                "Strengths: very interesting course material and very interesting discussion. \r\nWeaknesses : felt like sometimes the focus was overly on applying tough concepts to personal experiences and cultures, and sometimes it felt hard to have that expectation constantly vs being about to distance a little more or not choose to share.",
                "No weaknesses.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Cooking in class, tasting food in class, talking about food in class. We also sat at little kitchen tables that really allowed us to get to know everyone in the class. It was so wonderful being in a class where you actually got to know everyone. I also love Prof Trumpler. She is brilliant! It was just such a comforting environment, but also one that was very intellectual.",
                "Strengths: very comfortable class environment\r\nCons: expectations for essay assignments and the final project are lax so it can be worrisome for those who prefer structure (like rubrics etc.)",
                "Strengths: professor Trumpler and her wonderful approach to the class. Our location in a spacious kitchen and seating around kitchen tables. The wonderful readings and engaging guests. The highlight of the class was getting to learn from my other classmates.",
                "dr. trumpler is amazing and one of the most caring professors you will meet at yale. i felt that she was dedicated to not only helping me understand the material but also develop critical thinking skills. it was not until this course that i realized how often i was simply following instructions and fitting myself to a rubric to get better grades as opposed to truly thinking and incorporating my own personal experiences into the material that i am learning. as a stem student, this course made me realize the impact of implicit and explicit expectations / judgment on others as well as ourselves.",
                "The structure of this course is an incredible strength. The \"kitchen table\" discussion allows students to consider complex topics in small, judgement-free settings. Sharing out discussion topics to the class is also a way to expand the broader knowledge for everyone in the room. The interdisciplinary nature of cooking together, discussing topics in small and large groups, listening to guest speakers, and creating our own presentations also kept the class interesting and the students engaged. \r\n\r\nWhile most of the assignments were very flexible in terms of topic, allowing students to focus on their interests, the readings were just as engaging to me. I can't remember taking another class for which the reading did not feel like homework. I often left the assigned books for later at night, as a way to relax before going to sleep. And because the readings were so engaging, I often found myself talking about the assigned readings with friends in the days leading up to class. One of my favorite takeaways from the course is simply that I have started to love reading for fun again, which I haven't done much of in many years.",
                "Professor Trumpler is the major strength of this course. The class environment is very affirming and welcoming for people of all lived experiences, and the embodied practice component was a major plus."

                "Yes! If you are excited to have challenging and fun conversations about food and identity and spend two hours each week being self-reflective about these themes, this is the place for you.",
                "I highly recommend this course to everyone! The structure of this class is so great; the kitchen table discussions were very engaging and very low-stress because it's only with a couple of other students instead of the entire class and professor. The atmosphere is also very low-stress (we could even make tea/coffee before each class began). During the first three weeks of class we cooked different (simple) foods which was very fun and relevant to the themes of that week. Before going into this class, I had seen other class reviews that said this class had a low workload. However, the readings are actually pretty long/comparable to other humanity classes (especially in the second half of the semester). BUT, they were all so interesting and I never felt bored/annoyed that I had to do the readings for this class. For example, we had a series of 3 weeks where we read 1 book each week. I'm so grateful for this experience because the books were amazing and led to really great discussions in class. The papers and final project were also a lot of fun (and manageable) because we could pick our topic and explore anything we wanted to! If you like food and want to explore how different identities/desires affect food practices, then take this class!!",
                "Absolutely! One of my favorite classes at Yale! I had very limited knowledge or background in food and its connection to self and identity and the class was so thought-provoking. The best part are the small group discussions which take up a majority of class and allow you to get to know your classmates and dive into vulnerable and fascinating topics. Professor Trumpler is deeply kind and wants every student to feel safe and supported. Perhaps the best part of the class was that I was able to forget the grade and learn and read for sheer enjoyment. The grade is mostly attached to essays and projects which are open-ended and thought-provoking, which allows the reading and discussions to feel open and lacking pressure for the first time in a long time.",
                "100% would recommend this to class to anyone!",
                "Yes! This class was very low-stress but kept you engaged in the discussion, and you really get to know your classmates.",
                "I definitely would recommend this course to someone who is looking for a fun seminar to sort of explore the WGSS department for the first time, especially since Prof. Trumpler is so kind and sweet. I think for someone who is looking for a rigorous deep dive into food studies that this probably isn't the right course, but for someone who's looking for an interesting addition to their WGSS courseload or a fun elective on a topic that is not really taught much, this is a class I would recommend.",
                "Absolutely. If you get the chance to take this class DO IT. I could go on for hours but trust me a class about food and love and identity and sex?? It doesnt get any better than that",
                "Yes! I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in thinking about how food relates to our lives both in an academic/intellectual sense but also on an interpersonal and introspective level as well. I think this class does a really good job of approaching all the themes from many different perspectives and scales and also gives students a decent amount of freedom in how they chose to explore the topics through the papers and final project. It truly feels like there is no right or wrong way to make connections and all perspectives are equally appreciated.",
                "Yes, very good class and would recommend it to anyone because everyone has relationships to food, identity, and desire whether they know it or not.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It's so well taught. And also you start to look at food differently. Food is a passion for many of us, but it's crazy how we think it's our passion but we don't actually think deeply about it.",
                "Yes, its a good gut where you actually learn things that make you a more conscientious human.",
                "Absolutely!! One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. I was so excited to go to it each week and left feeling very fulfilled. It was so engaging and rekindled a love of learning and reading.",
                "please, please, PLEASE take this course. this is one of those courses that will apply to every aspect of your life because of not your major but the fact that you are a human being. we all have to eat, and so we are all affected in a variety of ways by our perception of food and the perceptions of those around us.",
                "Yes! This course is great because you almost learn without realizing it. The work does not feel like work, because it's fun. And yet, you walk out with a whole new understanding of how food, identity, and desire relate and shape each other. The structure is unlike any other course I've taken at Yale, and it allows students to feel at ease and confident in voicing their ideas and opinions. I would highly recommend this course.",
