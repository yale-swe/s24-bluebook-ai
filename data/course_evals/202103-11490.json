Never before had I been in a class where only Spanish was spoken.",

                "The course is well structured for students who come out of L2 Spanish. Additionally, Sebastian does a great job of connecting with each student, outlining academic goals, and providing a structure beyond the standard syllabus. Sebastian's enthusiasm ensures that the class is engaged regularly.\r\n\r\nI am a native Spanish speaker and can speak it fluently at a higher level than an entering L3 student. My lack of writing experience placed me in L3, but I was able to catch up fairly quickly and, at times, found the course to be slightly slow for my development. My instructor did recognize this and recommended me to L4, but this was turned down. At times, I found myself actively not participating in class so the rest of my classmates would have the opportunity to do so. I could see that their pace was entirely appropriate for their Spanish proficiency level, though. If I had been allowed into Spanish L4, I would have found this course more challenging (or as challenging as my L3 peers found it to be).",
                "STRENGTHS: the professor Sebastin, who lets us improve our Spanish in any way we wish (skits, creative writing, poetry, conversation in and out of class, even improv) and is a caring, mindful professor who youll look forward to seeing everyday! I found a perfect balance of oral, writing, and listening practice in this class, along with a blend of formal and informal assignments. No weaknesses for me! While the flow of assignments is steady in this class, its manageable and comes at a predictable, piecemeal pace. In the beginning of the semester I felt at times that we could have done more full-group discussion and public speaking at times, but both these ramped up as the semester went along. Overall, I found Sebastins methodology of blending the informal and formal modes of writing and discussion very helpful.",
                "there were some miscommunications on what work was expected to be turned in for a grade. It could be improved with an improved use of the canvas assignment system where all the graded assignments were posted. There was an available weekly syllabus but the assignments sometimes were assigned differently in class so the syllabus was no longer accurate. Maybe a link to a google document that would update if the instructor changed information would be an improvement. Also some of the VHL assignments were not well graded in that they were often looking for a specific answer that was not readily clear and there wasnt enough info to figure it out.",
                "Strengths: Great resources and the professor offers great, fast feedback. Whenever I emailed my professor, he would answer within minutes (hours at most). \r\nWeaknesses: At the beginning and middle of the semester, the course work was extremely heavy (about 3 hours of work per day). It lightened up toward the end which was very helpful. Also, Supersite is not a necessity. We paid for a program when the optional worksheets that our professor gave us assessed the same knowledge\/ contained the same material.",
                "The course is great at teaching the linguistic structures and how to apply them. It is also great with giving enough time for assignments and breeding a conducive learning environment. One weakness is that sometimes the class feels like it drags due to us meeting 4 times a week.",
                "There were plenty of interesting and engaging assignments but the workload was quite a lot. I also would have liked it if groups for projects were mixed up or randomly assigned.",
                "A strength is its use of student participation and interaction to learn a language.",
                "Strengths: focus on both language and culture, engaging projects, focus on learning rather than assessment-taking\r\n\r\nWeakness: slightly disorganized (did not follow syllabus)"

He went above and beyond (karaoke, office hours, encouragement) to get to know us as people and get us to know each other (you will make friends in this class, which is honestly one of Sebastins goals). This is the kind of class where the professor will come up and compliment your interest in dragonflies, or ask you how a poem made you feel. Sebastin values honest (and dramatic!!!) expression, growth, music, and the discussion social issues. If you do too, take this class. Youll definitely grow as a student of Spanish!",

I have made friends in that class and we have all bonded over dinners\/ outside meetings.
