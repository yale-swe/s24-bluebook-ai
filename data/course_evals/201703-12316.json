    "Reading the novel in its original language was a complete delight. Learning to analyze not just the text itself, but the text within the context of what was occurring at the time of publication and the controversy surrounding it really helped further one's analytical skills. \r\nFurthermore, focussing on the details, while also learning how they associate with the rest of the novel in a larger context was an important skill which was learned.",
    "Skills: reading critically and writing literary analysis in Spanish.\r\nKnowledge\/insight: profound insight into the history and content of El Quijote, and relevant history of Spain. New appreciation for the language and the novel.",
    "More insight was gained on the historical significance of Don Quijote on literature as a whole and the small intricacies of the novel which make it a classic.",
    "I developed a greater reading comprehension in Spanish.",
    "I developed my skills in understanding and writing Spanish.",
    "I feel like this class helped me to learn a lot of new vocabulary in Spanish, in addition to helping me develop literary analysis skills that I did not have in my native language. I feel like this course gave me a very solid background in Spanish literature and literary analysis in general.",
    "Everything Quijote!",
    "Enhanced my knowledge of Latin American literature by taking a great course of the foundations of the modern novel."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Some of the strengths, as mentioned in my previous response was how encompassing the analysis was. The professor made a concerted effort to address everything which occurred within the reading for that class and make note to the class any subtleties which they might have missed.\r\nThe only drawback which i noticed was the fact that, much of the time, the classes were lectures and the professor did not engage very much with the class. In future, a greater effort might be made in involving the students to answer questions or pose topics of discussion rather than a lecture on what the professor found interesting.",
    "Strengths: Very rewarding to read the book, interesting insight into the work and Spanish literature and history that couldn't have been gotten elsewhere, autonomy in writing assignments (which were very  manageable in length).\r\nWeaknesses: not much discussion in class.",
    "The course was well taught and there was enough reading to keep students busy but not over-encumbered. In all, the course was great and there are little to no changes that should be made.",
    "I believe that this course struggles to balance lecture with student input, and feel that it should be organized as a seminar.",
    "I enjoyed the lectures very much, but sometimes they became difficult to follow. PowerPoints would have been more engaging",
    "There were many strengths to this course: interesting material, engaging lectures, not too heavy of workload. The only real weakness of this course was the syllabus itself, which was not entirely clear about which chapters would be covered in which classes; chapters were laid out by week, but not by class meeting time so knowing exactly where to read to was a bit confusing. However, there were very few weaknesses with this course. It was a very good class and I would highly recommend it.",
    "He fact that this course is almost exclusively lecture based is both its strength and weakness. Gonzlez Echevarra has so much great stuff to say about the Quijote, but that sometimes comes at the cost of student participation. Overall this was my favorite class this semester. It was fascinating to be able to devote so much time to a single, great work of literature.",
    "The stengths are the great in depth discussion of the novel while the downside is there are no reading checks."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is a marvelous course and the professor did a wonderful job in explaining everything to his students well.",
    "This is an excellent option for an L5 class if you like literature. Great to read a key work of western literature in its original language, very interesting analysis.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students but mainly to those who would be excited to not only read Spanish literature but to truly learn from it.",
    "I would recommend this class for people seeking a fun class to fulfill their L 5 Spanish requirements",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class. The class is very interesting, RGE is a great professor, and I feel like I learned a ton. The essays were not too long at all, and as long as you keep up with the reading, you'll be fine.",
    "More than just about any other course Ive taken at Yale. Yes! Please take this class and read the Quijote. Its the best thing Ive ever read.",
    "Yes! Read one of the best books ever in the original!"
