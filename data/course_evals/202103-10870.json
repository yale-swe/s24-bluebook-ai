                "I deepened my knowledge of many areas of general Chemistry and gained an appreciation for many different areas in the field. The course developed conceptual knowledge of Chemistry as was its intention and spent little time with mathematical calculations.",
                "This class taught me, most of all, how to think differently. Professor Mayer challenged the way I thought about chemistry, and in the process introduced me to a more in-depth, conceptual way of thinking about chemical concepts. I also learned a lot about taking college exams. In my first semester, I felt like this class was a good introduction to appropriately in-depth, difficult exams that challenged me to open my mind about what we learned in class.",
                "This course taught me how to think outside the box and challenge myself intellectually.",
                "This was a great course and I learned in depth about many different chemistry topics and I like how experiments were blended into lectures.",
                "I developed a lot of knowledge on chemistry, as well as skills in reaching out for help, studying, and connecting concepts.",
                "I started developing the ability to apply learned material to questions that oftentimes do not look like anything we covered in class. I also feel much more comfortable combining knowledge from various topics in chemistry, like quantum and solid-state chem, and using it to solve a problem.",
                "I gained a deeper understanding of chemistry, specifically of quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, transition metals, and solid state chemistry. The concepts we learned were really in depth, but they all were tied together pretty nicely. I really enjoyed this class.",
                "I developed a deeper and more conceptual understanding of several major concepts of chemistry such as quantum mechanics, organic and solid state chemistry, and more. I was challenged to make conceptual connections across the units of the course and other scientific fields. Learning to read/skim relevant scientific articles to find desired information was a skill that I also developed, as recent and interesting articles were integrated into the weekly p-sets.",
                "I learned so much about rather niche topics of chemistry such as transition metals, solids, quantum mechanics, basic organic chemistry, etc.",
                "I learned how to take basic chemistry concepts and apply them to unfamiliar topics. We developed skills of combining many seemingly disparate chemistry fields to create a more well-rounded understanding of chemistry.",
                "I learned a great deal about Quantum Mechanics and Organic Chemistry. Professor Mayer also taught us about real-world problems related to chemistry/ chemistry's applications in the real world.",
                "Reinforcement of my knowledge from AP Chemistry\r\nDeveloped experience in fields outside those covered in AP Chem: Solid state chemistry, quantum chemistry, metallic chemistry, some organic chemistry.",
                "This course covers a wide breadth of information and will ensure you have a thorough understanding of a lot of chemistry concepts ranging from quantum mechanics to organic chemistry. Since the course minimizes any quantitative analysis you have to do on either homework or exams, it ensures you build a strong conceptual understanding and intuition behind the topics covered.",
                "I learned about Organic Chemistry, which is something I have never learned about or expected to go into as a Gen Chem course.",
                "I learned about quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, solid state chemistry, and transition metals. I also learned how to apply knowledge from class into real-world applications.",
                "I learned a lot about quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, transition metal chemistry, solids, and metallic band theory.",
                "How to think critically, and I learned how to appreciate overlapping concepts in chemistry. Moreover, this class has also caused me to appreciate the implications of science on current world issues such as sustainability and climate change.",
                "I learned:\r\n-Quantum Mechanic Chemistry( Particle in a Box, Periodic Trends, Radial Distribution, Contour Plots, Psi/Psi Squared/ R squared Psi Squared graphing\r\n-Organic Chemistry(Simple mechanisms {SN1 and SN2 reactions}, Isomers {stereochemistry, structural, optical, etc}, functional groups, biochemsitry, organic common names/structures, nomenclature, application to substances/pharmaceuticals)\r\n-Inorganic Chemistry( transition metal complexes {delta o gap between the t2g level and the eg level, reason for d orbital splitting, strength of ligands, coordination numbers, strength of transition metals during bonding (high spin or low spin})\r\n-Solid Chemistry (ionic solid structures, Molecular solids structure{diamond and graphite}, Octahedral and tetrahedral holes, shapes of solid structures {simple cubic, body centered cubic, face centered cubic, hexagonal closed cubic}, interlocking lattices, lattice energy, unit cell containment numbers, nearest neighbor distance calculations, coordination numbers of one ion)\r\n-Materials Chemistry (Band theory{strength of bands, band gap, excitement of one band to another, p-doping, n-doping, circuits/filling positive holes}, Silicates, isomorphous substitution, intrinsic defect, extrinsic defects)",
                "I learned about topics in quantum and classical mechanics, organic chemistry and mechanisms, and transition metal complexes. I would say there were a lot of unique insights to be gained.",
                "greater knowledge of topics in chemistry including quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, transition metals, and solids",
                "I learned that chemistry is beyond the basics and this course really forced me to think above and beyond. I also learned how to best study for exams (especially because I did not expect this level of intensity coming from high school)",
                "Knowledge of basic organic chemistry, transition metals and solids, and quantum mechanics as it relates to chemistry. In terms of skills, I learned how to study better on my own and with others and use the problem sets to enhance my understanding of the content.",
                "I learned how to connect concepts in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and solid state chemistry or metallic bonding. Through the course you develoip this web of knowledge, and there are suprising yet beautiful connections that abound, especially as you get further into the material. All tests and problem sets are written by Professor Mayer in such a way as to teach you to think like a chemist. I went from hating AP chem to loving 163. Oftentimes, problem sets would connect to current papers or issues in a wide variety of fields (COVID research, agriculture, climate change, healthcare, weather modeling, ect.) which introduced some fascinating applications of what we were learning in class. The course is a lot of work, but everyone I have talked to develops a love a chemistry through taking it.",
                "This course really helped me understand quantum chemistry and its underlying connections to all other areas of chemistry, from transition metal chemistry to organic chemistry. The way Prof. Mayer teaches forces you to understand the content conceptually and extend it logically, which I appreciated.",
                "I deepened my understanding of general chemistry and explored advanced chemistry concepts I hadnt learned in high school.",
                "Some organic chemistry, transition metal chemistry and how many elements on the periodic table interact. I learned about reactions and synthesis.",
                "I learnt a lot about visualising concepts and understanding that sometimes theres no clear cut reason to certain things, and sometimes you have to use other disciplines to gekonfijte understand some concepts. I learned how interconnected things are if you really look critically.",
                "I developed the ability to connect different topics of chemistry and be able to gain a further appreciation of topics that were taught in my chemistry classes in high school.",
                "varied conceptual understanding of chemistry; very much extended my understanding since AP Chemistry",
                "This course covered the basic introductory information for each track of higher-level undergraduate Chemistry, including organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry. It helped me develop thinking skills that allowed me to consider questions of chemistry in broader perspective.",
                "Chemistry on the conceptual level. How to think outside the box and connect seemingly disparate concepts.",
                "I have developed a thorough conceptual understanding of the topic covered by the material. I have also developed the ability to apply these concepts to unfamiliar situations. I have also gained exposure to scientific literature and real-life applications of chemistry.",
                "This course gave me an overview of the chemistry major and introduced how branches of chemistry intersect.",
                "By taking this course, I learned how to think outside of the box. I made connections between seemingly disparate topics in chemistry. This class challenged me in so many unique ways. I became more knowledgeable on how the topics we cover in class relate to real-life applications. Above all, this class pushed me to extend myself beyond what would be learned in a traditional chemistry classroom.",
                "I developed my time scheduling through this course. Since the work and times were sectioned off into lecture, section, written problem set, and online problem set, I had to schedule heavily when to work on what for me to be able to ask questions and be prepared",
                "I loved the material this class covered it was such a unique opportunity.",
                "I learned a great deal about basic chemistry topics. In addition, as I was a first-year, the course was a good introduction to dealing with problem sets and science at a college level in general.",
                "This was a great class. I really like how it went beyond high school chemistry because I learned so much new information even though this was technically an intro class.",
                "This class was very unique in that I learned chemistry in a conceptual way. It was not a standard intro science class where we followed a set textbook or even a set list of topics. The curriculum taught us to connect widely different subjects and work through real world problems.",
                "I think taking this course was able to show me aspects of chemistry that I've never thought about or learned before. It was definitely not just a review of high school AP chemistry, but a deeper and more in-depth look at chemistry from multiple different aspects. At the end of the course, I was able to build connections that were able to interrelate different aspects of chemistry. I have also grown exposure to organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and quantum mechanics.",
                "Work on molecules and atomic bonding, basic quantum mechanics concepts, introduction to organic chemistry, and an overview of transition metal and solid chemistry.",
                "I gained a much deeper understanding of chemistry through this course. Beyond just calculations of chemical equations, I learned about why different chemical substances behave the way they do and what makes them interact differently with other substances. I also gained some useful organic chemistry skills that I know will be extremely helpful when I take organic chemistry classes in the future. I was also able to learn a lot about transition metals and solid state chemistry, which I had never had any exposure to in the past.",
                "I developed critical thinking and study skills. Professor Majer taught a complicated course, but he encouraged the class to think about chemistry with a new perspective.",
                "I was introduced to lots of advanced topics in chemistry. The course made me want to take more chemistry classes in the future. I also learned the important of taking advantage of a class's resources (peer tutors and TFs in this case). I learned about the necessity of forming a study group.",
                "I developed a broader understanding of Chemistry. I was able to learn about difficult concepts and concepts that had not been extensively taught to me before in AP of IB Chemistry. I can now see more connections within the topics of Chemistry.",
                "I learned about Quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, solid-state chemistry, and the ways in which chemistry can help us in the sustainability movement.",
                "I learned about chemical bonding and structures, as well as explanations behind trends in chemistry.",
                "In many ways, I think that this course taught me more about what I don't know about chemistry - I entered the course convinced that I had fully grasped the fundamentals of chemistry, which was in many ways disheartening because I didn't understand why I should study chemistry if everything was already discovered and proven. This course actually made me think about the conceptual basis behind chemistry and to understand what the limits of our knowledge are, something which has made continuing with my studies in chemistry much more appealing."

            "comments": [
                "There are not many changes to this course I would propose. The material is taught at an appropriate speed for an advanced course, the exams are a fair assessment of the material taught, and there are plentiful peer tutor hours to get help on problem sets before submission. My only complaint is that the problem sets are graded much later than they are submitted (I still haven't received a grade for problem sets turned in in late October). Beyond that, I think the professor should audit some of the discussion sections because my TF was not a great help for developing further understanding of the material.",
                "Strengths: engaging lectures, problem sets helped reinforce important ideas well, peer tutors and TF's were great and super helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes Professor Mayer glossed over key concepts, and they were left ambiguous when completing problem sets. Asking the TFs/peer tutors helped a lot!",
                "The strength of this course is that it is more conceptual based and therefore a unique way to learn chemistry. However, this is also a weakness because there is some level of learning that teaching style involved.",
                "The lectures were good, sometimes the professor could go through the slides too quickly but could always see them posted online. Also, I think having a sheet of the organic compounds we had to memorize would be helpful vs just having some listed in class but like a sheet we knew we needed for a test would have been nice for midterm 2 and the final exam.",
                "The strengths of this class are that the peer tutors and TAs are phenomenal. I would say the content itself was sort of confusing in terms of its placement in the chemistry sequence. I feel like if you take this class, you have gen chem, but you obviously need more since you are not in Organic. I think that the content could be more based on that idea and focus more on gen chem concepts that would be needed later for many students who want to take the MCAT. I think the organic stuff was good since it is a primer for next year, but I think quantum was unnecessarily challenging. I also think the exams themselves are a weakness. I think that the questions could be much more straighforward, and I wish professor Mayer could have come to our exams and seen the amount of questions people have on the exams.",
                "I think a strength and weakness of the course is the various types of chemistry you learn. In this class, we cover quantum, organic, and solid-state chem, which can be a lot for one semester, especially for a gen chem class. The strength of this is that prospective stem majors or pre-med students can get a quick intro into the different chem classes they'll need to take, which can help you decide if you want to continue on the track you're on. The weakness of this is that the final for this class is very rough considering the wide array of topics covered. The lectures are also not extremely structured, so it's very easy to get lost and off track. I would strongly suggest going to peer tutoring for this class (it's how I survived the course). The psets aren't too bad, especially since the peer tutors are phenomenal. I also loved my TA, so that helped keep me motivated.\r\n\r\nOverall: I love how much this class challenged me, and I feel like I'm more set for the pre-med track than I ever have been. However, I had lots of moments where I had zero idea what was happening. I would not take this class if you have a really heavy schedule. This class can be extremely rewarding and enjoyable but only if you can dedicate the time to it.",
                "I really liked that we had the chance to learn really complex topics and struggle with the ideas in class without worrying too much about our grades. The way the grades were set up, individual problem sets weren't worth many points which allowed us to honestly try to figure things out for ourselves. There were also enough tests that our grade wasn't dependent solely on one or two of our performances. Weaknesses of this course may be that the lectures sometimes were scattered or we would get hung up on an idea that we weren't going to be tested on, but there wasn't a concept that we couldn't approach the professor or the peer tutors with and get help on.",
                "Strengths: The amount of help this class offers is great, but also much needed. There are many peer tutors who help so much with the problem sets, and the TFs are great because they are there to ask questions if asking Prof Mayer is too daunting. \r\nWeaknesses: This class was presented as a general chemistry course, but it really wasn't. I took AP chemistry in high school and thought this would be an advanced, more in depth version of that material, but about 90% of the material in this class was completely new. I also don't think the topics we covered are \"general\" since they are so unique to this class. The first unit was quantum mechanics, which is a topic most chemists do not learn about until their third year of undergrad. It was definitely a hard class.",
                "The strength of this class is the enthusiasm of Professor Mayer. Every lecture was highly engaging and interesting.",
                "Strengths: The TFs and Peer Tutors for this course was amazing! Chem was the most challenging course of my first semester due to the amount and difficulty of content but these resources were outstanding. In addition, classes were always organized and accompanied by Lecture Figures that were always accessible to students on Canvas. Practice exams, PSETs, and Achieve homeworks made it easier to understand what was emphasized in class.\r\nWeaknesses: I would say that the Achieve homeworks were not always necessary. PSETs every week were enough work in itself and Achieves often involved math-related questions which were never to be seen on exams. Also, sometimes harder concepts were quickly taught in class whereas it would have been better at times to go through these areas more slowly and just skip over easy sections that we all already knew.",
                "Stengths:\r\ndetailed and organized coverage of material\r\nextremely well timed to match with exam dates\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nhas a midterm the week before the final exam",
                "The course covers a lot of information, which makes it really interesting but also really overwhelming at times. However, I think there are a lot of opportunities to seek help, whether that be from the peer tutors, Professor Mayer's office hours, or the TF's office hours. The psets are difficult and you usually need help to finish them, but there are a lot of resources available for this. The exams were difficult but there are a lot of resources available to prepare for them. Professor Mayer is always eager to answer questions and help students gain an in-depth understanding of the contents of the course.",
                "A strength were the discussion sections and TFs. A weakness was the contrast in level of challenge indicated by the course description and the actual class. I do not necessarily think this is the professor's fault, but it can be very disheartening to come in expecting a significant challenge but assuming that you will be in the same boat as everyone, but then realizing that while you are actually behind many (or even most) of the other students who have already taken multiple chemistry classes and organic chemistry before.",
                "Strengths: The resources offered in this class (peer tutors, TFs, and professor) were all excellent and provided a lot of helpful feedback and support, especially with the difficult concepts in the class. The lectures were very engaging and were delivered in a way that made very difficult concepts easily understandable. The discussion sections were also organized in a way where we could get help on things we needed help with, rather than having a predetermined lesson plan, which were especially helpful for problem sets/exams.\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of times, the topics on the Achieve homework were taught on the day it was due or after the due date, meaning that I frequently had to teach myself the concepts.",
                "Strengths: Professor Mayer is super engaged and passionate, and students gain a deep understanding of chemistry concepts they didnt get in high-school. The problem sets push students far in their understanding, giving them appropriate preparation for the exams. The peer tutors are super helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, the course feels like its trying to cram too much in too little time. Often times, the class will learn a whole new concept within the last five minutes of class.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Mayer, the peer tutors, the TFs - all incredible resources. Everything about this course is excellent because they are dedicated to supporting you through review sessions, discussion, office hours - everything. The only weakness (?) is that the material is difficult and you need to work hard, but if you are motivated you will do well.",
                "It is very difficult to learn the content without supplemental help. There are no tutors that are able to help struggling students for this course.\r\n\r\nThis course teaching chemistry from an entirely different perspective that strengthened my understanding of basic concepts. This course is very interesting and engaging.",
                "The class was nice because it was interesting to learn in depth about topics you don't learn in class in high school. But I also felt that the class was a lot about compiling random knowledge. It was a lot of scurrying to figure out what I needed and didn't need to know. I also felt that while we went in depth in topics, we were always barely scratching the surface, and only learning parts of certain things.",
                "Amazing teachers, peer tutors, and teaching fellows. Content is reasonably hard and a lot of work.",
                "Strengths: very fascinating material \r\nWeaknesses: grades are largely based on test scores, which can either make or break your grade.",
                "Strengths were definitely the peer tutors and TFs (fantastic resources!) I was never really engaged with the lectures although Prof Mayer is a really interesting person, but that probably was a function of my own learning style.",
                "This course would be very difficult for someone who has not yet taken AP Chemistry and a lot of basic chemistry knowledge is taken for granted. That said, it made me fall in love with the subject in a way I never expected. Additonally, while the material is hard, there are a multitude of resources: Professor Mayer is available by email basically anytime, wonderful TAs that actually want to be there and explain SN2 reactions for 2+ hours, and so many wonderful peer tutors. I have made some of my best friends in this class. \r\n\r\nFuthermore, a lot of people are probably trying to decide between 163 and 161, the two general chemistry courses. The tests in this one are MUCH more conceptual. 163 is timed and involves lots of number crunching. I have never touched my calculator in 163. Instead my tests are covered in essays and drawings. In this class, we dig below the surface and get to the nuances of how different chemical forces interact, really answering the question of: WHY. Highly recommend, esp if Mayer is teaching!",
                "I really liked the course, but it would be helpful if problem sets were graded in a more timely manner because the feedback would have been helpful to study for exams.",
                "A weakness in the course was how the class felt like it was being taught more outside of the actual classes. A lot of the problem sets were not on material that was recalled from class. I usually felt like I had to learn how to complete the problem sets on the spot instead of recalling what I was learning in class. I felt that a weakness in the course was that the I didnt feel like I was tested on my ability to understand a taught lesson but whether or not I can extrapolate correctly and think in a certain way. Another weakness was that the course covers a lot of material, much of which is not standard general chemistry knowledge. While I do think that a strength of this course was its uniqueness and the way it challenged people, it was very hard to learn the material in the right way. I would probably suggest that we do more examples and practice during class instead of only learning the theory. This way, the peer tutors and TFs arent solely responsible for helping the students understand how to answer questions.",
                "The content is definitely a strength, as well as the peer tutors too. I think a weakness would be the way lessons are recorded because its hard to see whats written on the black board",
                "Some of the strengths of the class were that it provided a great intellectual challenge, however it is easy to argue that it was too much of a challenge. The workload for this class greatly exceeded all my classes and I felt like this class took up a majority of my time that I spent on academics this semester. Also, some of the topics taught in this class go beyond what's considered general chemistry which can also be seen as a pro since the class is meant to be challenging, but for those that planned to learn general chemistry at a faster pace, this is most certainly a con. This class was also taught at a very fast pace, which made it exceptionally hard to keep up with the information taught in the class, and led to many students quickly trying to understand all the concepts just days before the midterm exams. This class could be improved by narrowing down the topics taught in the class and teaching those topics more in depth and slower so the students can have a better grasp on fundamental chemistry topics.",
                "psets reinforce understanding without being daunting in work amount, discussion section is very useful; no obvious weaknesses other than maybe you could sometimes see in Gradescope which problems of the pset were going to be graded versus which weren't (only some of the problems were to be graded each week plus a completion grade) and I think the idea was that that was supposed to be unknown",
                "The workload was very time-intensive, but it did help significantly with learning the difficult material. The professor, peer tutors, and TFs are also great.",
                "This course was marketed as a general chemistry course but it was not gen chem, it was a survey course of quantum, orgo, solids, inorganic.\r\nIt was great for me because I am not continuing in the chemistry track but premed students did not feel like they learned enough gen chem.",
                "Prof. Mayer was very reachable via email and in person. He truly made an effort to get to know the students. Since the class size wasn't very large, we had closer interactions with ourselves and the Teaching Fellows, Prof. Mayer, and the peer tutors. I believe the peer tutor sessions and review sessions are a strength of this course. A weakness would be that it may be helpful to have peer tutoring offered more than just 3 days a week. Since most of the peer tutor sessions align with the days that discussion sections are scheduled, it would be helpful for students if some evening help was offered Wednesday-Friday. This would make it easier to get help before the weekend.",
                "I really had no problems with the way the course is set up. Professor Mayer was amazing throughout the whole semester. The peer tutors were essential for me but overall it was an amazing experience.",
                "Th lectures were not very clear sometimes and the class was highly reliant on peer tutors. I wish the lectures made more sense. This class does have great material tho!",
                "peer tutors are fantastic",
                "I really appreciated that the course was taught conceptually, with little focus on numbers and calculations, and Professor Mayer's lectures were interesting and valuable. I also appreciated the wide and unusual range of topics we covered - for example, I think very few general chemistry classes cover quantum mechanics in as much detail as we did, and I found that unit fascinating and really helpful in understanding later topics. The problem sets were challenging but made possible by really supportive and helpful teaching fellows and peer tutors. The exams were difficult, and perhaps my only suggestion is a little bit more preparation for the final, which I found more difficult than I was expecting. But on the whole, I thought it was a fantastic course.",
                "Very well organized. I did a lot of active learning because I learned the most by doing homeworks, so I was actually excited to do the homeworks because I knew that I would be learning something really interesting and useful by doing them.\r\nI do think that discussion sections are pointless and shouldn't be required.",
                "There were so many strengths. Very few weaknesses. One of the biggest strengths was the pset homeworks. They were so application-based and great preparation for the tests.",
                "The strengths of this class was how it was challenging. I couldn't just get by the class and actually had to study very very hard just to get a decent grade (around average). I don't think I've ever worked this hard just to get barely average which I think is kind of an advantage because it has taught me how to really study and how to really work for a grade. A disadvantage is probably how the class name was a bit misleading. I did not expect the class that I took. It was definitely not what it's named. It should be named something a bit different. Another weakness is how fast paced the class was. I realized at the end when studying that some topics were brushed on really fast and not as in-depth as I wanted them to go in.",
                "The course provides plenty of support for students, through Professor Mayer, the TFs, and the Peer Tutors. However, it felt that sometimes it was unclear what information was going to be tested and what information was just for posterity.",
                "I think this is overall a very strong course because it creates a balance between lecture-style learning in class and collaborative learning through the PSETs. There is also a wealth of additional materials that is provided to help supplement the lectures and PSETs. I have no suggestions for how this course could be improved.",
                "The professor was very interesting and had a clearly outlined mission of what he wanted his students to take away for his class. The teaching fellows were incredible. Both the professor and his TFs were super friendly, approachable, and accommodating. One weakness of the course was the spacing of information and midterms. The organic chemistry section awkwardly spilled past the organic chemistry midterm and the last day of classes was extremely stressful because it felt like a whole new unit was quickly taught in one day. The class could be improved by having a clearer outline of what was being taught each day.",
                "The course is A LOT of work and is very conceptually challenging. This isn't necessarily a weakness, but I needed to put in like 10 hours a week to keep up with the material. Every lecture was too fast for me, so I had to go through and review everything, then spend an enormous amount of time on the problem sets. Some people in the class struggled less, so it might depend on the person.\r\nOne really cool thing about this course is that it introduces you to chemistry concepts you otherwise wouldn't learn for years. It made me want to take more chemistry.",
                "I think that a strength is the content. A weakness is that there is a quick turnover to understand difficult topics.",
                "This course had fantastic support from the teaching fellows and the peer tutors as well as enthusiastic instruction from Professor Mayer. I always looked forward to coming to class because Professor Mayer made sure to broaden our understanding about each topic instead of narrowly focusing on each unit individually. However, at times I found it difficult to prepare for exams that I felt were more challenging than any of the work we did during class. I wouldve loved to have access to more practice problems to get ready for evaluations",
                "The introductory material in this course, quantum mechanics, could have more time dedicated to it before moving on to newer topics."

            "comments": [
                "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in developing a further conceptual understanding of Chemistry. It provides a nice primer for Organic Chemistry as well. Do note, if you haven't taken a full general chemistry course (like AP Chem) before, it will be a lot of extra work! That said, if you are deciding between Chem 163 and first-year Organic Chem, I think it is more worth it to take Organic because you place out of two semesters of general chemistry and two semesters of lab. I think the class serves a very small niche group of students and it would be more beneficial to encourage more students to take the first-year organic chemistry class (and maybe develop an advanced/non-advanced first-year organic chemistry class).",
                "Yes, especially if you want to learn a lot of chemistry in a short amount of time. I never knew I could learn so much in one semester. The concepts are challenging and it is going to be tough at times, but totally worth it and Professor Mayer is great!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I personally struggled a lot with the content, but Professor Mayer, the TFs, and Peer Tutors worked very hard to provide excellent resources and one-on-one help.",
                "I would for sure, I thought Mayer was a good professor and I liked how it was three times a week but for less than an hour which allowed me to be more focused and productive.",
                "Not really. I think it is challenging and fun in the way that you are learning about things you might not get to learn about unless you go into super high classes in chemistry, but I think for someone who has taken AP chem or similar, you should try your best to place into organic chemistry. This class just added a lot of stress to my life, and I am not sure it was worth it for me as someone who is premed and not going into chemistry.",
                "If you have some prior chemistry experience and are interested in pursuing a stem major (especially if you're thinking about also taking organic chem sometime), I would strongly suggest this class. That being said, we don't do too much gen chem, so if you want a refresher this is not the class for you. I really loved Professor Mayer and can feel that he truly enjoys this class. That being said, he does go off on tangents sometimes. So, if you're someone that gets easily overwhelmed when a class doesn't follow a clearly linear syllabus, this class could stress you out. Overall, I don't regret taking this class and feel like chem 161 would have been boring in comparison.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who needs general chemistry. I found that this course's set up and testing situation was more favorable than 161.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who has a fairly strong background in gen chem and is able to review some topics when necessary. This course is best suited for students seeking a more conceptual (and perhaps more challenging) take on general chemistry. Be prepared to be confused at times, and be comfortable being wrong, asking questions, and finding extra help when needed.",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if they are looking for a unique, challenging chemistry course since the topics covered are quite niche but interesting. If you want general chemistry course, do not take this class and take normal general chemistry instead.",
                "I would recommend this to another student that has a strong foundation in chemistry from high school. Also, the class gave me a great community and friends in my first semester.",
                "Yes. Professor Mayer always stops to answer student's questions and truly cares about you, your opinion on his class, and your life. Not only will you meet fellow Chem-interested students but you will absolutely adore the Peer Tutors and TFs. It was all around a class that you would expect to see at Yale.",
                "Yes, if you did well in AP chem and are passionate about learning more chemistry, then this course is for you.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in chemistry. Although the course has a heavy workload, the topics covered are pretty interesting and you build a really strong understanding of foundational chemistry concepts.",
                "If the student was already familiar with many concepts in general and organic chemistry and prepared to take that established knowledge into higher levels or different fields then yes.",
                "Yes I would. I think this class is a really good class for someone who is interested in learning chemistry in a deeper level than what is traditionally taught, and it exposes you to a lot of interesting concepts. It's not an easy class, but it's very interesting and rewarding if you're willing to put in the work.",
                "Yes, especially if that student has taken AP or IB chemistry in the past. The course is designed so that students are expanding upon and learning different things than they had learned in high school. Professor Mayers passion for the subject is clear during every class period.",
                "Yes - if you took AP Chem and have a strong foundation, this is a good choice. Make sure you take advantage of all the resources (peer tutors, discussion, Office Hours, etc.) at the beginning of the year and then reduce what you attend once you've figured out how much extra help you will need to succeed in the course.",
                "Yes, it provides a unique outlook and fosters a unique appreciation of concepts that one would be very familiar with from a-level/ap chem. Moreover, you will see that there are not necessarily any black/white scenarios and that many things work together in creating reactions and chemical properties.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course with the premise that you really have to work hard to keep your head above water if you come from a not so good science background. It is challenging, yes, but the content is so interesting. I believe it is worth it.",
                "If a student is really firm in their knowledge of chemistry like after taking ap chem, then this class might be interesting. Make sure you have time to attend the peer tutor hours. They are very very helpful.",
                "Yes, I believe you learn a lot.",
                "Yes, but be prepared to work hard and have to go above and beyond to do well.",
                "Yes - it was definitely challenging and there were times that I was jealous of 161, but I did learn a lot before every midterm and feel as though my chemistry knowledge has greatly improved.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student that is looking to learn to love the field of chemistry and learn to think like a chemist. It was one of my hardest courses this semester, but there was absolutely no busy work. Professor Mayer's lectures are incredibly engaging, the TAs are willing to sit for hours and explain concepts to you, and the peer tutors are incredible. The class itself is a wonderful community and I have made so many friends among the students in the class. \r\n\r\nUnlike Chem 161, in 163 you truly get to time to question why things work. Our tests are essentially not timed, calculators are never used, and problem sets cite current chemical research applications. You learn how to reason through unfamiliar situations and extrapolate chemical concepts. This class made my semester. Enjoy!",
                "Yes, it is an overall challenging and interesting course.",
                "Yes, the course is intellectually challenging and a natural step from high school AP/honors chemistry. If you are up for the challenge, go for it!",
                "I would for someone looking for an intellectual challenge and someone who is very interested in chemistry. This is definitely not a course for someone looking for an easy class.",
                "I would. I think its very interesting to learn about the things we learned even though I might not use them. The concepts are very challenging and its just great to grow from being so confused to actually understanding and getting creative with you critical responses.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student that would like to challenge themselves and further their basic understanding of chemistry. It definitely has a greater workload than other classes, but you will leave this class with a greater appreciation of chemistry and a better overall understanding of the subject.",
                "definitely; it's very insightful without being tedious",
                "Yes because it is difficult but teaches you a lot.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. Because the instructor really puts focus on conceptual understanding rather than memorization, you will come out of this course with robust knowledge of the material. Although this course is definitely challenging and requires a high time commitment, you will be consistently supported.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in chemistry and not relying on learning gen chem in college, this course is wonderful.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. When I was first deciding between Chem 161 and 163, I was hesitant to take 163 due to COVID. However, there is so much support offered that my fear of being underprepared was something of the past. I truly think Chem 163 set me up well for future chemistry classes and intellectually challenged me in numerous ways.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who is already looking into taking a general chemistry course. It is harder than the regular chemistry but ever subject you touch on is fascinating and rewarding.",
                "if they were up for a huge time commitment and challenge yes!",
                "Yes, I would recommend it to other students with the caveat that a little background in chemistry is helpful. I took chemistry in tenth grade, so very basic chemistry principles were familiar to me but I had forgotten most details. I think this class is a good option for students with that amount of background or more, especially if you are interested in chemistry or at least want to learn it in a more interesting way than basic general chemistry.",
                "YES! if you like science/chemistry this is a very interesting and doable class where you are guaranteed to learn topics that you haven't learned before.",
                "YES! 100%",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it was vigorous and challenging. It teaches you aspects of chemistry that you have never thought about before and it prepares you for other chemistry-related classes that might be taken in the future.",
                "Yes, this is a great overview of general chemistry at a conceptual level, perfect for anyone who really enjoys chemistry and isnt just taking the course as a prerequisite or major requirement. If youre doing that just take 161.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it provides a great overview of chemistry while at the same time covering many detailed concepts. It is very engaging and provides some challenge, while also not being extremely difficult. This couse is great for any student who is interested in chemistry and wants to gain a deeper understanding of the subject.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who has a background in chemistry and loves science. It is intellectually challenging, but very rewarding.",
                "Yes, if you are sufficiently prepared and your schedule permits you to put in 10+ hours a week. I hadn't taken AP Chem before enrolling in this course, and I think having full AP Chem knowledge would have made the course a better experience. It does assume a decent amount of background. If you're not that interested in chemistry, this course won't be worth it to you. But if you're sufficiently prepared, want to learn a lot, and have time in your schedule, this course can be really cool (also make sure you can accept lower grades than you're used to). I liked being introduced to some advanced chemistry topics. Also, the TFs for the course are AMAZING. They are incredibly nice and so helpful.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is able to take on a higher workload and is genuinely interested in learning more about Chemistry.",
                "I would recommend this class to any student interested in learning about connections between topics in chemistry and anyone whos looking for an engaging challenge.",
                "I would recommend this course for students who want to learn the causes of observed trends in chemistry.",
                "Yes, absolutely. It's definitely difficult and pushes your boundaries of understanding chemistry, but the course definitely got me excited about studying chemistry in ways that other chem courses have not."
