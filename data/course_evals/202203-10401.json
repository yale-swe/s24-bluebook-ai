                "I learned a lot about modern and past China! And the reasons behind the countrys issues and successes today.",
                "Learned about a variety of current events in China and how they are influenced by Chinese history. I learned to think about the sources of information and to consider how they may be biased.",
                "I learned a lot about Chinese journalism",
                "I learned an overview of Chinese history.",

                "I learned about censorship in China and a basic overview of Chinese history. I learned how to examine sources critically and with an eye towards bias.",
                "Understanding of modern Chinese responses to the Covid epidemic and protests and territorial disputes of Xinjiang, Tibet, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, as well as general trends of the Qing and Song dynasties, the Cultural Revolution, and topical trends of family and gender across time. Learned how to evaluate a specific modern territorial dispute\/protest and take into account historical precedent and perspective. Learned how to evaluate historical documents of art and maps and make inferences and analyses on them.",
                "Chinese history, Covid in China, territorial disputes, Song and Qing Dynasties, etc.",
                "I learned a lot about Chinese history and events that happened in China that I didn't know because of censorship",
                "I really enjoyed this course's focus on the intersection of, and influence, of distant and modern Chinese history. I feel more equipped to critically discuss and understand the modern issues facing China today with the help of this class.",
                "I really enjoyed taking a deep dive into Chinese family life and territorial disputes throughout history. All the other Chinese history courses I have taken do not really address these issues in depth.",

                "I appreciated the weekly news articles and small section discussions. I also liked the class size, which was not too large. I found the instructions for the first assignment a bit confusing, and I think it would have been helpful to see example papers from previous years. At times I felt that more points were taken off of my assignments than was reasonable based on the mistakes I made.",
                "Strengths are great TFs who were from China and could speak very knowledgeably!",
                "Strengths: writing assignments are practical and interesting. The teaching team is always available for help or feedback. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times the course can feel a little disjointed. Present to past is a little misleading as we always moved around to different time periods. The reading assignments sometimes felt a little unrelated to the course material.",
                "Fantastic course, great prof. Put in the work and youll do well. She wants you to succeed.",
                "It is too rigid in its grading",
                "More organized lectures and more clarity in feedback for written papers and assessments.",
                "I would like to see more pre-industrial history thrown into the course.",
                "The course has a lot of interesting readings: I especially enjoyed the weekly news articles and the primary sources we read. I wish lectures had gone a bit more in depth, rather than providing textbook level overviews of events.",
                "Strengths: Clearly went through 3 units in depth, learning about different opinions, assignments were meaningful rather than just busy work. Readings were reasonable and interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: grading seemed arbitrary and not uniform across my classmates -- lost points on disagreements over word choice that felt like personal opinion rather than graded on actual content or amount of work that was put into the class. As a Chinese American, had some uncomfortable moments in class where it felt like the general opinion of the Chinese government and people were coming from a Western cultural point of view rather than an acceptance and understanding of the different values that the two nations have, making my own evaluation of the valid criticisms hard to accept.",
                "Strengths- The TA's and Professors are super helpful. I found the course material to be interesting. \r\nWeakness- The class become somewhat not engaging because the course is taught all from powerpoint slides",
                "It is a relatively chill WR and the topics are interesting & topical enough. Not sure how much improved my writing though. I like the extra credit writing assignments.",
                "Strengths - overall structure, great powerpoints (variety of sources), all the readings were interesting and relevant to the course content, sections were the best part of the course--great teaching fellows! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Some of the feedback on my writing was a little difficult to understand and the expectations were sometimes unclear. For both papers I went to TF office hours and the Porvu Writing Center, but could not seem to fit the expectations for a strong argument in this class no matter what I did. I think it would be helpful to have a couple more example papers for reference for those of us not accustomed to history writing. For class content itself, I would have liked to focus more on past dynasties than on COVID. Some of the things in Fang Fang's diary get very repetitive--I do not think it is necessary to read the whole thing.",
                "great lectures! I loved the Sterling visits that were very hands-on and engaging. i also really like how hansen is focused on real-life applications and wants us to walk away with something practical. however, the timed in-class paper was very hard... I am a bit annoyed that despite me sending my papers for feedback and fixing everything they tell me to fix, I still got points off seemingly arbitrarily or unfairly. it was also annoying that the slides were not posted for some lectures though."

                "Yes! Very informative and the small size makes the teaching team much more approachable.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, especially if writing is not your strong suit and you need an interesting WR credit. The first few essays are graded harshly, however you get clear feedback that you can use to improve your future assignments. The most challenging part of the course is the in class essay, but it is possible to prepare for using the class slides.",
                "If you arent lazy youll do well. Id recommend it. It is a solid writing credit and helps you be more concise.",
                "No",
                "No, the grading is oftentimes confusing and harsh and material was often boring.",
                "It depends on what the student is looking for. If the student wants a deep dive into Chinese history I would not recommend this course. If they want to understand China today and the historical roots\/context of modern events in China, I would recommend this course.",
                "As someone without much (or any) background on Chinese history, this was definitely beneficial as it acquainted me with relevant major historical events and people. If someone is looking for this level of engagement, I would recommend the class. It also has interesting and thought provoking readings and assignments.",
                "Yes! If you want a modern understanding of the CCP with real-time updates and relevant history to those modern topics, I think it's a great class to take. It's a bit heavy-handed on the censorship emphasis that paints China as a one-dimensional country and people group, but if you take a nuanced viewpoint and take the class for what it brings, I think it's really necessary and valuable for global context and understanding, if not personal interest.",
                "I took this as what I hoped would be an easy writing credit, but maybe this wasn't the right class to do that with. I still enjoyed the class!",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to other students if they have any bit of interest in learning about China. The course is not too hard and also gives you a great understanding of China's past events and the current events that are occurring in China. The course also helps paint a better picture of what China is like and teaches you to question the media and sources you read.",
                "Yes I would recommend. The teaching team is great and challenges you to think analytically (instead of feeding you with answers). Organization of the course could be more systematic however. It is very much organized based on topics (family, covid, territorial dispute) instead of chronology.",
                "I would recommend this course only if you are really really interested in the subject material. The class is very well organized, and the readings are actually interesting--they contain great variety instead of just textbook material. You get a lot of insight into things like Chinese family life and territorial disputes that most history classes do not address or just simply brush over. My one thing is that the professor is not very approachable, which makes it difficult to succeed in the class if you are not genuinely interested in the topic.",
                "No, the professor is very rude when asked questions and the tas were not helpful.",
                "yes!! it has a bad rep, but I think the professor is good-hearted and you really learn a lot, even if you are Chinese-American."
