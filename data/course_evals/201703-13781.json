   "comments": [
    "This course really helped me craft a strong foundation in global health science writing, and helped me think about the ethical challenges behind successful research and interventions.",
    "This course taught me how to develop a research proposal and think about limitations and ethics and how to address these.",
    "very skill-oriented class. loved it.",
    "I think the biggest thing I learned from this course was the value of and how to conduct qualitative studies. I had already known about quantitative studies from the HLTH 240 (Epi) class, but it was really eye opening for me to learn about the place qualitative studies had in health research. I also feel that I was prepared quite well to write a standard proposal for any health field in my future.",
    "It was a good introduction to research methods and ethics. Lots of great topics, examples, and speakers.",
    "We learned how to design a global health research study and create a proposal for such a study.",
    "The ability to write a complete research proposal. I developed a research question, background information, methodology and critical thinking skills regarding limitations etc.",
    "Research design and implementation, limitations to research. How to take an idea for a research question and make it into a tangible proposal.",
    "Learned a new style of research: qualitative.",
    "This course is kind of a workshop class in that we learned about research methods and then applied them to our own individual projects over the course of the semester. Therefore, I learned a lot by doing--my first literature review, contacting a research advisor and planning a study. This course gave me skills that I will need in my professional life and even set me up with a project for the summer!"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Amazing teaching staff, well structured course, great readings selected, clear flow, very organized\r\nWeaknessess: Large amounts of information learned through outside-of-class readings were not always discussed or followed up on",
    "The teaching staff is wonderful and the round table seminar style is great! I feel like I got a chance to learn from my peers which is unique to my Yale experience. Also the involvement of Prof. Curry and the TAs were amazing. I really appreciate their support throughout the course. The best part is that we come out with an exciting final product which impacts what we do with our summer!",
    "Not very structured, but interesting.",
    "I think since this course was trying to teach us how to write proposals, we should have read sample proposals each week instead of published papers. I understand that the purpose of reading the papers was to evaluate methods and introductions, etc. However, I think this could have been accomplished equally well and prepared us to write a proposal even better if we had been reading proposals all semester as well.\r\nWhen I was writing my Section II, even with the samples, I felt underprepared to write a \"standard\" proposal. I didn't know what I was missing in some parts, I wasn't sure how long sections should be on average. At the end of the course, there was some hesitancy to provide us sample proposals because of fears of copying. But I thought that if it hadn't been for the two samples provided, I would have been totally lost. So perhaps next year, it would be better if we could read a wide variety of proposals, so that way there is no fear of copying one or two samples, and so that there is also better guidance for students as they are writing their final paper.\r\n\r\nI thought the greatest strength of this course was the amount of feedback we got from the instructor and TAs. There were always so many comments and they were all really insightful and helpful! I certainly would've never thought of some of the issues that were pointed out on my own.\r\nI wish that we could have utilized this feedback system more. We wrote our Section I in early October, but our Section II wasn't due until the end of finals period in December. If Section II had been assigned for just before Thanksgiving break, or thereabouts, students could have utilized the feedback for section II to make the entire proposal stronger. In other words, there would have been more time for iterations, where the students could submit the work several times to continually improve it.",
    "I think the nitty gritty aspects of developing a research proposal could have been better covered as I know a number of people who hadn't had prior research experience felt unprepared come the initial stages of proposal writing; however, I really loved this course and enjoyed all the insight gleaned from writing my own proposal and speaking with the professor and peers.",
    "It was a good survey course, though a lot of time was spent workshopping instead of learning material.",
    "This course provides a good opportunity for becoming familiar with the various elements of a research project in the field of global health. The course is mainly an overview of the different components in such a study or, correspondingly, in a proposal written to conduct a global health research project. While the class may be a useful introduction or overview for someone entirely unfamiliar to research,  it was somewhat lacking in depth for students who may already have a background in research. The topics included in the class are important, but we often only received a relatively cursory review of each, or only delved into a small portion of what could be discussed. I and many of my classmates felt that while we had a general idea about many of the course topics, we were fuzzy on the particulars of how exactly to write an interview guide or develop a methods section, for example.\r\n\r\nAs the course is supposed to help students develop a project and proposal entirely on their own, the frequent lack of specific detail on how to do things, as opposed to what they are, is a major shortcoming. Having one in-depth textbook, as opposed to many discrete readings, would help provide this necessary depth and clarity.\r\n\r\nIn addition, because we are learning how to write a research proposal, it would have been great if the instructors provided us with examples of research proposals early on in the semester. While we read and critiqued many scientific papers, this was not particularly useful. Most of us were already familiar with reading journal articles, and reading these articles did not directly help us learn how to write a proposal. Most importantly, journal articles are often brief in the methods section, which was the most significant section for our purposes of designing a study. Reviewing exemplary proposals, on the other hand, would have better prepared us for producing the final product in the class.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the feedback we received in the course was great, both from the instructors and our peers. Having staggered deadlines for various components of the proposal helped the task become more manageable. The workload altogether was quite fair. I appreciated the frequent work-shopping as it allowed us to learn from one another.",
    "This course is everything I want to do - global health research - so I was very excited to take it. I liked the lectures, I thought they were informative, and I liked the guest speaker. The class could be made more accessible to people with backgrounds that aren't as set up to do global health research (i.e. they haven't traveled or they have had to work\/train over the summer). I think it would be really beneficial to have some faculty members committed to advising people in the global health scholars program before the semester starts, with several different topics (for example, look at the way Global Affairs runs their capstone project - the topics are already given). This would provide slightly less flexibility of topics for the students, however, it would give students who don't already have a connection to a country\/topic a higher probability of success for actually completing research, and for developing a better proposal. This wouldn't be mandatory, and students who do have a topic\/country in place can go ahead and work with a faculty member they find on their own. Additionally, I thought the readings were a bit long and the class could benefit from incentives like discussion questions. Also, I didn't like discussing the papers in pairs, I thought it would be better if they were incorporated into the lecture.",
    "Very well taught, I enjoyed the collaborative nature of the course. The professors and TAs are very helpful and actually care about each student's outcome. The feedback I received on every assignment was exceptionally thorough which helped me learn from my mistakes.  I also appreciated how the teaching staff treated all the students like adults! \r\n\r\nMaybe the course could give a little more attention to the ethics of research?",
    "Strength: practical application in practicing how to write a research proposal.\r\n\r\nWeakness: perhaps more preparation for writing each section with practice exercises on how to develop certain parts of proposal.",
    "Strengths: the team, Dr. Curry, getting to know the other global health scholars, the individual project aspect\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class felt too long at times, I don't know if we needed a full 2 hour block"

    "YES! TAKE IT! One of the best courses at Yale. Professor Curry is truly so helpful and inspiring, and her TAs are really wonderful. I couldn't recommend it more.",
    "if you are looking for an opportunity to carry out your independent project over the summer, this class lays out decent ground work to set you up for fellowship applications Prof. Curry is very well connected in terms of finding you a Yale faculty member to work with. On the other hand, if you are not a global health scholar and are not required to take the class, think again before you decide to take it. The class provides little instructions to someone who is not familiar with the field of global health and the readings do not seem to be very relevant.",
    "I would recommend to anyone hoping to write a global health research proposal!",
    "Yes, take it if you're a global health scholar (or aspiring). You will gain a very actionable skill set.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is trying to write a proposal that they would actually like to use to apply for funding or fellowships. I would suggest to all students who take this class to come in with a topic already in mind, and perhaps even a support system of a professor or other researchers behind you.",
    "Absolutely amazing class, would most definitely recommend to anyone who would like to learn more about global health research (or research in general).",
    "Yes, if you're a global health scholar, or if you're interested in carrying out a research project this summer!",

    "If you're in this class it's because you're a global health scholar. The class is challenging but informative, and it's cool to come away with a real-world proposal. One of the main attractions of the class it that you'll be with peers who share a passion for global health, and who are extremely interesting and cool and hold diverse areas of expertise.",
    "Great for any student interested in a future in research, global health or otherwise.",
    "Recommended! Great course with excellent teaching staff.",
    "This course is only helpful if you intend to conduct health research--but if so, it is extremely helpful. It's kind of a niche topic\/interest base but really tailored to professional development in the public health field."
