Importantly, I learned about key experimental techniques (fMRI, optogenetics, and so on) that are used to operationalize and study the hypotheses that were tested in the papers we read."

                "I think it would be great to include more juman subject studied",
                "Strengths: I liked the steady workload (no surprises and very manageable) and Dr. Chang is a great, easygoing professor who really helps with understanding the material, which is also interesting. this was a good class to be in a seminar format \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes that format of the class became repetitive (always spending it in discussion around 2 papers) so maybe it could have helped to occasionally change up how we discussed the papers",
                "Strengths: learn a lot about social neuroscience in a short period of time. Weakness: if you dont already have a basis in neuroscience and brain regions you will not get much out of the class.",
                "strengths: I've taken other psychology senior seminars, and one thing about this class was that it really forced you read the papers because the entire class discussion was on the papers. And through reading the assigned papers, I began to understand the experimental techniques employed \r\n\r\nweakness: I wish there was more time to talk as classmates during the discussion or some way to encourage it. I think the issue was in part was that the class was in early in the morning and so people didn't really want tot talk. I would also would have preferred the option to write a 10 page paper ver a 20 page paper if I wasn't planning on using this class t complete the senior class. I had taken a class where students could do 10 over 20 pages if it wasn't for the thesis."
