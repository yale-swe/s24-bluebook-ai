                "The class had high engagement, low stress, and was very educational. However, the class could focus a little more on learning \"how to write a paper\", starting with the first paper.",

There was nothing dislikeable about the course.\r\nMaybe the depth at which we cover course material could be improved in some aspects.",
                "The greatest strength of this course is definitely Larissa, she is an amazing professor that genuinely cares for her students, if you're taking ENGL 114 you have to take it with her. You also learn about complementary medicine in a more implicit way -- you don't realize how much you learn about it until it comes time to write an essay or you're talking about it with a friend, you learn without it feeling like a bother.",
                "We spent a lot of time discussing our readings\/videos, but it would have been more helpful if we spent a little more time on the writing process.",
                "I really appreciated the sense of unity I felt with my peers. I also appreciate how the professor was very understanding and accommodating to our needs. The only negative comment I have for the class is that I think some of the readings we did were redundant and unnecessary.",
                "I believe that this course had a very strong format in terms of discussing readings and having student led classes.",

                "Canvas organization system and module structure worked excellently for current learning environment. 2 minutes were given for free socialization before many Zoom seminars that boosted class cohesiveness and comfort in the Zoom classroom, fostering a healthy learning environment for all students. Name calling students to elicit responses without overlapping interruptions from other students also worked well in this course during discussion in the Zoom seminar.",
                "A lot of discussions even over zoom, but there probably could have been more varied and engaging ways of facilitating discussion in class such as utilizing presentations.",
                "At a certain point in the course, we were asked to present some of the readings in pairs. Each presentation included a recap of the information in the reading as well as some questions that students would have tailored in order to spur discussion. In general, this was an interesting way of engaging with the information and often started some great discussions on topics you would not think of on your own. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, Larissa also included a few minutes in the class just to facilitate the relationship between the members of the class. Granted that zoom always makes simple things a bit awkward, this strategy is a good one for building some comradery.",
                "The discussions we held virtually felt adequately interactive, but there could be more engagement.",
                "I believe that this course did a great job of offering strong methods of learning especially considering the times. I did not find it difficult to engage with any reading material or writing issues even with the virtual format.",
                "The virtual seminar format didn't allow for the same level of participation as in-person class discussion would, though some of the discussions were still quite engaging. I think implementing some class activities besides discussion could be a future area for improvement."

                "Yes. This course was very intersting! I learned a lot and I loved my classmates and teacher!",
                "Definitely would recommend this course to any student wishing to learn about writing for a college setting and who is interested in medicine or cultural anthropology. It provides an amazing outlet for expression of personal ideas as well as opinions and arguments over topics\/issues discussed in class.",
                "YES take this course -- Larissa is a great professor who genuinely cares for her students, the material is VERY interesting (you don't go into too much depth, you stay engaged in the material and readings), and the grading is light. However, I took this course because I was exceptionally insecure about my writing abilities. I do not regret taking this class, but if I were to choose another class for a WR credit I would choose ENG 120 -- but ENG 114 is more geared to academic writing which will be more useful for papers in the future.",
                "Definitely. Professor Tsukamoto does a great job of introducing each form of complementary and alternative medicine and because of that, I learned so much about each of these methods and at times I was challenged to rethink how I initially had viewed them. In addition, the course is a great way to improve writing and research skills. The personal and skill-based lessons I have learned from the course combined with the caring and insightful might of the professor made this class one of my favorite, despite my STEM focus.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in medicine (in any form) or simply want a great writing seminar, take this class; you will not regret it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was fascinating to learn about a unique perspective of medicine while improving my reading and writing skills.",
                "I strongly recommend this class for others, especially those interested in pre-med. It offers a new viewpoint of medicine that I believe is beneficial to those interested in entering the medical field.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I have found myself greatly improving in writing and I have learned to enjoy writing more. Considering I have ever considered English one of my favorite classes prior to taking this class, I feel that this class was completely transformative in how I perceive English as a class and has created a strong foundation for my writing skills.",
                "Yes! I think any student looking at the long list of ENG 115 seminars should strongly consider taking this class, even non pre-meds (which seems to be majority). The class does a good job of covering a diverse range of CAM, and it's not something I imagine I'll ever learn anywhere else. The professor is also really great at timely grading and giving feedback for improvement. She's truly there to HELP not HURT her students. I was really able to relax in this class, not in a sense of slacking, but because the professor did a great job at pacing workload and the class discussions really felt like intellectual conversations but with friends.",
                "I'd absolutely recommend this course for anyone with a hint of interest in the topic of complementary and alternative medicine, even if they have no prior experience with it. The manageable workload and interesting paper prompts make it an ideal freshman writing seminar."
