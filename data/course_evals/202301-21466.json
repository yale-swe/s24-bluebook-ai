                "During this class I was able to get a grasp on the development of a scientific experiment. I had performed science labs in high school but never really with the process in mind. I think I also was able to develop a basic understanding of all of the devices that we used, I wish we had spent more time understanding the oscilloscope a little more because I felt like that was the most complicated device that we used and it seemed very useful for a variety of applications. I think the Graduate student and Professor were both exceptional at guiding the lab but not giving away the answers as well.",
                "The course serves as a good basis to experimental physics. I would struggle to call it exciting, but Physics 205 Lab is a solid basis for lab work. I started working as a laboratory assistant this year, and I am already using some skills from this lab. \r\nMy main takeaways are error estimation and error propagation formulas, using Python and planning my own experiments. I appreciate that the course structure leads you up to these skills, as opposed to throwing you in at the deep end.",
                "I learned how to properly use basic laboratory equipment, such as the oscilloscope, torsional oscillator, DC power supply, etc. I learned how to construct and manipulate electrical circuits. I learned how to properly calculate and analyze uncertainties and errors.",

            "comments": [
                "The grading rubrics need to be revised.  I have lost a significant number of points for incredibly small errors, and in many cases, I've lost points for not mentioning things the questions didn't ask for.  The lack of grading transparency makes it very difficult to determine what will get full points (which, in most cases, is different than what the question asks for).",
                "I think the biggest strength of the class was the variety of labs that we performed and the different perspective that they gave me on topics that were covered in my physics lecture as well. Studying physics experimentally is very different from theory and I think this lab allowed me to get this new perspective. \r\n\r\nThe greatest weakness was that we kept using Jupyter notebook for data analysis, but I don't think I really learned any of the libraries or its functions. I wish this was implemented more into the course, especially since many labs that do research at Yale use this program or something similar.",
                "The strength of this course is in the structured approach to most tasks. There is a pre-lab reading with some questions to introduce the material and a step-by-step lab guide. All the coding necessary is done for you and given to you to use (although some minor tweaks to the python notebooks may be required).\r\nThe weakness of this course in my opinion is that the homework questions are not always clear on what they want as a response, but then you lose points for not answering the question the way it was intended. Often, if only I knew what the homework wanted me to talk about, I would have been able to, but some questions are so vague that it is almost impossible to answer them as intended.",
                "The strength of this course is definitely the workload. There are really only pre-labs, post-labs, and lab notebooks which do not take up much time at all but are very helpful to better understand and learn the material. I think a weakness was the grading of some of the pre-labs and post-labs. The instructions were not always super clear or detailed, and I would lose points because a question was not concise enough.",
                "Its okay. Pre labs are kinda bad and do not aid in teaching.",
                "I think the professors and TAs in the classroom at any time were incredibly helpful and able to answer any questions we had about experimental procedure and how to interpret results, which was essential for my first experience ever in a lab.",
                "This was a good course. It changed how I think about physics and the flexibility inherent to experimentation. The pre-lab assignments were interesting and useful.",
                "I thought that a few of the earlier prelabs did not present enough information for solving the problems they had (specifically the optics one). Otherwise, the course was very good.",
                "It could be improved by going faster through the tools learning in the first half and more focus on experimental design with more interesting and challenging experiments.",
                "This course was very good at communicating the concepts and helping students through each lab, as well explaining the physics behind each experiment.",
                "This course very deliberately and carefully covers fundamentals, but the torsional oscillator experiment can be a little boring to work with after the fourth lab with it.",
                "The class is strong in making you think through experiments to come up with solutions without making you feel frustrated and provides interesting labs to work through. I would like to see the course give stronger and more clear feedback for each lab and provide a more detailed explanation of statistical errors in experimentation and the calculation of them.",
                "Strengths - clear organization, clear feedback. It was overall a very well designed, well-guided course that let us truly immerse ourselves in the equipment that we were using. The workload was also quite manageable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - wish there was a greater emphasis on designing the experiments. The last two weeks of lab were fun, but I wish there was more of that experience. Also wish we had greater teaching in LaTeX, considering it's a requirement for 206L.",
                "This course is apparently newly revamped from the semesters before, and seems muchhh more manageable from the stories I had heard about 205 going into the semester. Workload is very manageable and labs are able to completed with ample amounts of time in class. Wouldn't change anything!"
