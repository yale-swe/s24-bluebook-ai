                "This course had a lot of organizational issues that I feel could be improved with a bit more thought and effort on the instructor's end. The majority of our time in class felt like it was not thought out and led to less than productive activities. Despite having such a small cohort of students, there was no effort to create a sense of community and collaboration. The only time we did peer-feedback was in class which led to a very short period of time to read and then discuss each other's drafts. If partners had been assigned in advance and we had been able to read the drafts before class, the class period would have been way more productive. The feedback we got was minimal and not very helpful. As it stands, the class just seems like a mandatory superficial check-in without any substantial feedback or improvement.",
