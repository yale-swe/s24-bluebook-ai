                "I had a great time in this course and learned about a range of topics at a relatively surface level, as expected in a survey lecture course. My overarching takeaway is a new appreciation for and interest in the urban built environment as a reflection of social priorities and planning decisions. When I walk around downtown New Haven or New York City, it feels like a whole new urban experience -- I'm thinking about the buildings around me, identifying how buildings are in conversation with each other, and wondering about the types of social relationships that these urban landscapes encode.",
                "I gained a broader understanding of architecture and its role in American history.",
                "I gained a good understand of architectural history, building design features and urban development in the US.",
                "I learned how to identify and analyze the different architectural and urban elements in a town, city, etc. I really learned to appreciate my surroundings more, as well as how it was possible to change the landscape over time.",
                "I think I learned more about how to look at historical buildings and maps, and identify themes. Introduced to some new ideas about urban planning and history.",

                "a very broad survey of american urbanism and some architecture styles",
                "I learned how to better read buildings, for example by considering a buildings massing or material, I could infer its program or time period.\r\nEssentially, I learnt how to make educated guesses about the built environment as well as about the forces that shape the built environment and the effects that our environment and these factors can have on our lives.",
                "Thorough understanding of the history of American built environments, in terms of both the architecture and the sociopolitical factors that have shaped them\/influenced racial\/class-based dynamics. Also a ton about New Haven which every Yalie should know imo",
                "I learned how buildings impact the environment and how any building can be read as a form of power.",
                "This course gave me a much better understanding of the timeline of American architecture. It also made me appreciate many buildings in New Haven that I see on a daily basis. I also learned many urbanism concepts that I had not yet encountered, having never taken an urban studies class. This course was a good way to dip into that discipline.",
                "Overview of American Architecture from colonial times to current. Learned how to read buildings and see into the histories of cityscapes. Absolutely phenomenal class and changed the way I interact with my urban surroundings.",

                "This class genuinely made me perceive the urban environment in a new way. Prof. Rubin will help you peel back the layers of the urban landscape and understand each one and how it relates to the others. I learned to think critically about buildings, neighborhoods, and cities, and really think about what might have happened to bring them to their apparent state.",
                "I definitely learned to be more observant of the built environment around me and to appreciate buildings for more than just aesthetics.",

                "A broad overview of architectural styles and urban trends throughout US history, from precolonial times to the present. This class made me pay more attention to the built environment and helped me analyze the buildings and cities I see on an everyday basis. Lots of discussion about how power (political, social, etc) shaped the urban grid, and how cities\/buildings can be interpreted not just based on their aesthetic features (which I learned a little, but not a ton, about) but also for how they reflect and reinforce\/challenge configurations of power and privilege.",
                "I learned interesting things about urban landscapes and architecture",
                "I gained a great appreciation for the history and trends affecting the build environment in American cities. It is fun to be able to walk around and see some of how these trends shaped the world around me. Deep dives into some topics, especially tenements and city beautiful, was also really fun. Finally, I feel like I am now better equipped to understand and discuss the buildings around me which is a very empowering feeling. Generally, just a fun introduction to the city around me, and especially gave me a deeper appreciation of New Haven.",
                "How to evaluate buildings and understand urban trends.",
                "I gained a basic understanding of American architecture and urbanism.",
                "As my first Architecture course, I learned so much about how to perceive history through buildings and the meaning imbedded unto each. I loved how the professor incorporated local examples and expanded on them to talk about more of the grander aspects of American architecture.",
                "I developed a more analytical view towards the built environment and was able to place my understanding of architecture and urbanism in a more informed context that included historical and social influences.",
                "literally nothing lol. i was SO excited to take this class but lectures were totally pointless. the prof is super passionate about his subject which is great, but imo hes the type of prof who knows a lot about their subject but doesnt rly know how to teach it?",
                "I learned how to think about the American city and urban landscape differently. This course taught me to question the (lack of) presence of buildings or other objects in the urban landscape, look at how different forces have shaped the urban environment, etc. I also learned how to critically think about and describe buildings, and over the course of the class, I picked up technical terms to do so.",
                "Not a lot",
                "Developed a general awareness of the trends of city making + urban development across American + pre-American history. Skills were less about specific architectural terms and trends, and more about the broader forces that shaped our urban landscape today. I gained a new perspective in looking at any buildings + neighborhoods - this class really changed the way I look at the world around me!",
                "I really learned about the trajectory of American architecture and how economics\/social attitudes\/etc affected architecture in each era. I also was able to focus my writing and final exam on the stuff that interested me the most which I really appreciated",
                "Ability to describe American architecture from different time periods; knowledge of specific buildings; attempts, successes, and failures of different phases in urban planning.",
                "I learned different types of architecture and the historical\/urban contexts they fit into, how architecture fits in and influences the built environment and the people who inhabit it, and a lot of architectural terminology that I wasn't familiar with beforehand. I learned about urban history since the founding of the US including trends of city growth\/decline, international influence on architecture, and public\/private funding\/partnerships in cities.",
                "Generally, I think that this class was great for helping me better understand the ways in which I interact with space.",
                "I learned American history through studying its architecture and urbanism over time. I learned a lot about architectural styles, urban movements, and influential people. I learned how to more deeply analyze urban planning and architecture.",
                "Knowledge that I picked up in the course was more on the architectural movements within the United States as well as its social and political effects. For instance, the bills and support that the Federal Government gave for urban renewal. A skill that I learned was how to better understand and study the urban landscape. Insights that it provided was why the world is shaped like it is. For instance, it gave me one reason why industrial cities are so disinvested and the complexities behind gentrification.",
                "I learned how to appreciate architecture and the history of cities.",
                "Learned about famous and living buildings around America throughout history and its architects. While learning about the different architectural styles of the buildings, we were also able to understand the narration surrounding the community and how it relates to urban studies.",
                "I now look further beyond the appearance of buildings and into the meaning and purpose of everyday buildings.",
                "In this course, I learned how to critically analyze built landscapes in American cities.  This course was a journey through United States history through the lens of the built environment.  I learned how to look at buildings more thoughtfully and understand where different buildings and architectural styles sit in the grand scheme of U.S. history.  The assignments in this course also provided an opportunity to do archival research in Yale libraries and the New Haven Museum which I really enjoyed.",
                "I learned that the so-called foremost scholars in the field of architectural history are consistently more concerned with reading comprehension, minute details, and stroking their own egos than they are with actually discussing any of the cultural or social implications of the buildings they study.",
                "Learning about the basic history of American architectural eras and urban planning. From colonial history\/city planning, to the impacts of industrialization and new forms of transportation. This course is not just limited to architecture itself, but focuses on urban impacts and social changes in the built environment.",
                "Learned a lot about the built environment around me and the historical background relating to it. Learned how to read into and analyze my surroundings. Learned about the significance of structures and how they affect everyday life and people.",
                "Learned a lot about the history of architecture and urbanism in the US, including different architectural styles and movements throughout history that have influenced the built environment. Could not recommend this course enough.",

                "Analyzing buildings",
                "I learned a lot about different architectural eras and styles. If you pay attention in the course, you can't help but see the material you learn in class out in the real world and that's pretty cool.",
                "Basic knowledge of American architectural and urbanism-related history.",
                "Foundation to the intersection of architecture and urbanism as they pertain to US history and contemporary structures.",
                "I learned a lot about the urban landscape and architectural styles throughout different time periods. In addition to learning about the styles of architecture themselves, I also learned how to interpret different architectural styles as economic\/cultural trends going on in the society to which they belong. Overall, this course goes beyond simply memorizing the architectural styles associated with different time periods in the United States. It teaches one how to analyze a building's features and derive a narrative for that building's importance within its respective urban fabric.",
                "I have gained a good basic understanding of American architectural and urban history. I really appreciate that Im more inclined to pay close attention to buildings in my daily life."

                "Strengths: lecture was always engaging and informative, readings were interesting as well and the amount of work assigned was very manageable but still promoted learning.\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures were sort of structured like podcasts on segments of architectural history, but this made it kind of difficult to know what to study for the final exam. I think a final essay\/project would be a much better final evaluation format.",
                "This class just seems like a lot of random material thrown together. The readings are extremely dense and section was pretty useless- out TA openly admitted to not doing the readings as well. There were some cool fun facts I learned but fundamentally I feel like I didn't actually learn a lot about building styles nor how certain buildings influenced their communities in depth.",
                "The lectures didn't tend to follow the outline set up on the syllabus or at the start of class. That said, the jumping around didn't bother me too much since Prof. Rubin's lectures are so engaging despite not following the set plan. I looked forward to lecture and think Prof. Rubin does a great job of condensing an immense amount of material into memorable, bite-sized pieces that I will remember long after this semester. The main weakness of the class in my mind was communication with my TF -- we would often receive prompts for a weekly reading response less than 48 hours before our section, and I'm still waiting to get back a paper submitted before Thanksgiving and have no sense of my grade in the course.",
                "Strengths of this course are that it is interesting and the instructor was very engaged in his teaching. Weaknesses of this course are that the recordings of the class were not readily made available. You had to ask for them and they were not always granted. I asked for recordings weeks ago and have followed up on them and still have gotten no response.",
                "Strength: low workload, assignments were interesting\r\nweaknesses: no organization in lecture, lecture made no sense",
                "The lecturer was fantastic, so engaging and witty. His lectures were entertaining, the highlight of my week. \r\n\r\nThe group discussions were a great feature and I learned a lot from my classmates.",
                "Strengths are the content of the course (if youre interested in looking at visual history, buildings). Elihu does a good job of just talking about these topics. Hes a funny, interesting lecturer. The two project and papers are really flexible and can be interesting, since you can pretty much follow your interests completely there. \r\n\r\nWeakness is the lectures, sections and readings together dont feel too cohesive. I didnt have a clear sense of what clear takeaways were from readings and how theyd apply to  lecture content",
                "The lectures didn't make sense how they were supposed to connect and felt very confused how material connected with each one",
                "The professor was not a great lecturer if I am being honest. He often went over time, and never seemed to really get through all of the material he planned to. I struggled to take specific things away from each lecture. I did like the lectures though.",
                "Lecture slides weren't shared which made studying difficult",
                "Maybe when reviewing for the exam, going over major themes even in discussion sections could be good to tie the periods together and have a formal place to start studying.",
                "Professor Rubin is a very passionate lecturer and loves to teach and his energy reflects his passion for his teaching every class. However, lecture slides are not posted and it's mostly taking notes on what he is saying which can be a little bit hard to follow.",
                "Great course",
                "Strengths: Really beginner friendly for anyone interested in architecture. Weaknesses: Final exam was a lot of memorization (50+ slides of memorization).",
                "The biggest strength of the course was the lectures themselves. Rubin is a very engaging lecturer and made each class very interesting. However, I did not like the layout of the course whatsoever- the readings, while interesting, felt entirely unrelated to our discussions and the assignments. The final also felt very useless as it involved the rote memorization of ~150 buildings + architects\/years, which has no real usefulness. I believe I would have benefitted far more from a final paper.",
                "I think the course does a brilliant job of giving a wide overview while also going into depth at points.\r\nNy only two suggestions would be to reconsider the amount of reading and the number of buildings eligible for the slide comparison on the final. The readings were mostly extremely interesting but sometimes the amount of weekly reading was unrealistic. Moreover, for the finals, we had to study over a hundred buildings but then only write on twelve and I think a narrower list would have allowed students to be less stressed and study for effectively and with more enjoyment.",
                "Strength: very engaging lectures, well-chosen readings\r\nWeakness: perhaps tried to cover too much at the expense of depth",
                "I enjoyed the wide breadth of knowledge we explored in this class, and as someone who came in knowing next to zero about architecture \/ urbanism, I feel I definitely expanded my knowledge. With that being said, I don't think the final exam should be worth 40% of our grade -- it seems unduly stressful and not reflective of the work we put into the class throughout the semester for so much to come down to rote memorization \/ photo IDs.",
                "strengths: intersting material\r\nweaknesses: lack of specific or technical instruction",
                "I wish that the course had more structure. Overall, during certain lectures I had no idea what the main takeaway was. I found it very hard to follow lecture and wish that the pictures had been posted online. I felt that the lack of structure hindered my learning.",
                "Professor Rubin is very passionate, and that comes through during his lectures. Assignment 1 was also a strength of the course, as this sort of research project was very valuable to me as a means of exploring architecture in New Haven. The discussion sections were also a very comfortable space where we were able to engage in fascinating conversations. In terms of weaknesses, Professor Rubin's passion did not always translate into well-organized lectures, and the content of the course did not come across in a very systematic way. He also always kept us over time by a few minutes, making the lecture feel rushed. I know the prompt for Assignment 2 was meant to be broad, I think it was too unclear, which made it hard to know how to complete the assignment in an effective way. The final exam was another weak spot of this course. For the slide comparison of the exam  which involved identifying the name, date, and architect of 12 total images  we were given more than 150 images from which the 10 slide comparisons would be selected. It felt really tedious and pointless to memorize that much information for only 12 identifications on the exam. I had to spend a lot of time memorizing this information, and it did not enhance my understanding of American architecture or urbanism.",
                "Strengths - lectures are incredible and highly entertaining, readings are great.\r\nWeaknesses - little feedback",
                "The lecture is very fun and engaging, like a Ted Talk. I gained a good overview of American Architecture and Urbanism, although sometimes I feel overwhelmed by the huge amount of information. Sometimes the structure of the lecture can get confusing as topic from one class overflow into the next class, but I do appreciate Professor Rubin constantly pointing out connects between different buildings across time and space. Things started to make more sense during final review. I especially enjoyed the two assignments, in which we got to look deeply into buildings\/topics we are most interested in. I loved some of the readings so much but find others occasionally dry and boring. I feel my learning experience would be more effective if less readings are assigned so that we have more time to digest the content.",
                "Strengths: this is a classic college course with winning elements  it's fun, it's about New Haven, it's somewhat interdisciplinary, and the professor is excellent. Like most large lecture courses, it will give you as much as you put into it. The assignments are genuinely fun, and will teach you something new about your college town. The professor is highly engaging, and I think anyone would find it relevant and compelling. \r\nWeaknesses: the reading list for this class contained some of the most insane literature I have ever read  either incessant nitpicking about intricacies of race in the built environment, or incoherent sociobabble designed to make the authors feel smart and the audience feel clueless. The textbooks, while less insane, were just not particularly interesting. For the final exam, we had to spend way too much time memorizing dates and architects, and it frankly felt like a middle-school exam. The lectures tried to follow a chronological order, but this was often difficult to follow and most of the 20th century ended up as a blob in my head. \r\nImprove: the reading list needs to be overhauled in a major way. I also wish there was more of a focus on contemporary issues towards the end of the course, and on distinguishing between different architectural styles.",
                "Lectures are just so boring and the reading load is a bit unrealistic. Sections were good, although having them geared more towards the trial of the exam would be nice.",
                "Strengths: The lectures are all incredibly interesting and the course is structured in a very reasonable way. The topics covered are all incredibly interesting and fostered very unique discussions during section. The professor is clearly passionate about what he is talking about and makes it stay interesting. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes, the lecture had very little to do with the readings, but it was made up for by the fact that the lectures were all incredibly interesting!  It is also difficult to tell what will be important later for the final exam, which was absolutely the most difficult part of the course. It involved a TON of memorization and looking back on what we've learned in the class. However, as the lectures were sometimes a bit disjointed and it was hard to know what we need to pay attention to and write notes on, referencing your notes while preparing for the final exam might be extremely useful for some topics and completely useless for others.",
                "Strengths: the content was really interesting and Elihu was an engaging lecturer. Section was also interesting and the readings were also fun. The structure of the course was also relatively low-stress\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the readings and lectures felt disconnected and it wasn't always super clear what we should be taking away from each. I think lectures probably could have been better organized and a little clearer. I also think it would make more sense for us to write a final paper rather than take a final exam just due to the nature of the class and the content.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Rubin is a very engaging lecturer, always a delight to listen to and very focused on deeper questions about power\/inequity. Assignments were fairly open-ended and interesting, encouraging students to do real archival research and explore topics that mattered to them. The class leaves you with a lot to think about\/discuss in your daily life; best discussion section I've ever had! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were very focused on themes (power, monumentality, etc) over concrete information, so I sometimes felt a little unclear on when things happened, what architectural features I should be paying attention to, etc -- they also got a tad repetitive at times. The second assignment was *so* open-ended that it could be a little intimidating.",
                "Topics are often interesting, but I also often found it hard to stay engaged with the course material. I think because of the great breadth that the course covers, it could benefit from some more organization by theme or time period. Also, the final was worth 40% of our grade which was kind of overwhelming considering that we were only given insights into what the exam exactly looked like at (what felt like) the last minute. I think it would have been more helpful and beneficial to our learning if we had exercised the skills we needed for the final earlier\/more throughout the semester in a way that was integrated into the curriculum. Not to focus on grades, but I also would have preferred to have another assignment\/midterm worth 20% of our grade instead of a final that was worth 40%, but that could just be me.",
                "Lectures are fantastic. Professor Rubin is more of a storyteller than anything else, and lectures felt like stories. They sometimes were a little disconnected, but overall you got the gist and they were wonderful to listen to. The two papers were really open ended and fun endeavors, and I enjoyed working on them. Readings were interesting. My two criticisms are that section frequently did not feel like a chance to dive into readings or topics from class, but instead just flirt around with different ideas. I would have appreacited if section was more tightly run and we did a deep dive into one pre-determind topic every week. Second, I think the final exam was much more difficult than necessary. The essays were good and open ended, which was nice, but I think a little bit more notice about their topics would be nice. Additionally, slide comparisons are a great exercise, but I felt the ID part was unfair and took away from reviewing the material. Everyone had to spend a lot of time memorizing date and architect for buildings that would have been better spent reviewing course material. Professor Rubin tried to remind us that slide comparisons were not a big part of our grade, but they were 15% of the grade on the final exam, making up 6 percent of your overall grade. This is not nothing, and felt like it was potentially penalizing people who paid attention in class but had busy finals periods or were not necessarily the best with memorization. I think just changing how IDs work, either reducing their significance, only requiring name, or reducing the number of things to ID, providing some slides with ID and some without may be a way to address this and allow us to focus more on the meat of the course.",
                "Some of the lectures cover really interesting material and Proffesor Rubin knows a huge amount about what hes teaching. If you do the reading and are interested in the lecture, its a very engaging class. Sometimes, however, the lectures can seem a bit repetitive and hard to focus on. Also the format of the final was frustrating. It involved memorizing about 150 buildings and writing two in-test essays and was a less-than-enjoyable experience which I think could be improved by setting expectations at the start of the semester.",
                "I found this class interesting in lecture and reading content. I thought the assignments were well integrated into the course and I was provided the right amount of time and support for each one. At times, the reading was really long, but if you were strategic about it, it was fine.",
                "The lectures were incredibly interesting, however it may have been helpful to have more slide comparisons or an overarching outline of themes. Additionally, not making lecture slides and course recordings widely available greatly diminished the accessibility of the course.",
                "strengths: relatively chill grading\r\nweaknesses: prof knows a lot about their subject but doesnt rly know how to teach it, lectures were pointless, had to memorise 160+ buildings for the final, wasnt made clear at the start of the term what exactly we were meant to be learning for the final (so it wasnt clear as to what we needed to take notes on during class)",
                "i loved the first two assignments but didnt really understand the format of the final. i felt like majority of my studying time needed to go toward short term memorization of details that feel somewhat trivial (dates within 5 years, architect names, etc).",
                "The reading load each week is a bit heavy, so it is more difficult to actively engage with it. However, the lectures touch on topics covered in the readings, and they are formatted in a more interesting and engaging manner. The discussion sections were meant to engage further in the readings, but discussion over these was only effective when other students in the room had the energy and capacity to offer their thoughts and insight. I'm not sure how the readings could become more engaging.",
                "Good discussion section teachers",
                "Strengths are Elihu and the amazing TFs. They're so willing to help you and meet with you and talk about anything architecture related. I think there could've been more work done at the beginning of the class to define the path the course would take -- I didn't really know anything about architecture going in so an outline would've been helpful!",
                "Strong lecturing and great TFs, material was clear and built on itself\r\nReadings too long to be motivated to do thoroughly but it was possible to succeed without doing all the readings",
                "I really enjoyed Elihu as a lecturer, but sometimes i felt disengaged and would doze off because the lecture wasn't a very active experience. There were also too many readings for section in my opinion, and they were very lengthy for a level 100 amst or level 200 arch class, without really drilling in any takeaways. during lecture i wouldn't always know what to write down as notes, and among some of my peers and i it would be hard to articulate what we were learning at different points. the first couple of weeks were pure vibes until we began to think about the exam. but i really admire Elihu as a professor and his passion for buildings. additionally, i do not think the final should be an exam. I think it should be something a bit more active or dynamic, a more involved project. the format of the test and the memorization it sort of demanded felt ineffective as a way to conclude such a great lecture.",
                "This course covered a lot of material which is one of its strengths as well as one of its weaknesses. Sometimes each lecture covered so much that it was difficult to glean major themes until the end of the course when studying everything all together for the final. There was a lot covered on a weekly basis that wasn't well consolidated at the end of each lecture so it kind of left a lot to the students to chunk for themselves.\r\nOne thing I think would be better is if there weren't presentations and if the sections were more of a brainstorming session, a run through of key topics and ideas from that week's lectures, and some main buildings\/slide comparisons that would be useful to know in relation to an architectural era\/movement\/urban concept. I think it would really ground the lecture material a little more having the concepts be distilled by the TF since there's such a discrepancy in how much of the readings everyone's doing that sections can feel really unproductive when people don't have much to talk about.",
                "Strengths: the topics covered were pretty interesting, my TF was easy to reach; Weaknesses: the class lacked some structure, oftentimes I felt like the lecture's material didn't line up with the readings, a large part of the final was fact recall which felt somewhat pointless, some lectures were boring.",
                "Access to recorded lectures and a different exam format.",
                "Strengths: Discussion section was great, Prof. Elihu is nice and speaks well\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture was not engaging, it seemed \"fluffy\" at times and not very substantive and hard to follow at times. There was a lack of structure at times as well. Also, posting lecture slides after would be helpful (or even recording). Additionally, the class seemed to emphasize the importance of contextualization, which I agree, but then the final included slide comparisons where we had to memorize a set of about 150 buildings (name, year, architect, purpose, etc) which I find a bit counterproductive to the point of the class. I wouldn't mind the slide comparison if it was just the comparison and contextualization.",
                "The strengths of the course was just the overall content. It was amazing learning more about how cities and architecture transformed over the years. Perhaps my only suggestion is providing more clear or at least accessible resources towards architectural movements\/design. For instance, giving a clear time line when Georgian (Colonial and Federal) style was, Arts and Craft, Streamline Modern, Art Deco, etc. Also, learning more about the intricacies like entablatures, cornices, etc. formally would be helpful too. The final suggestion is maybe having it more centered on New Haven and New Haven examples. An exciting idea, at least for me, would be for one of the classes to have a field trip to the Green and the different buildings and structures there.",
                "I loved the format of the course. No weaknesses.",
                "This class is a very good class on American urbanism, but I felt that it could be improved  by incorporating more rural concepts and settings into the course. The course seems intently focused on the city of New Haven, to the point that more class meetings than not are centered on the city for a good bit of class time, and I felt like the class should have been advertised\/labeled in a way that made it clear that New Haven is a focal point of the course. Also, I feel that the final exam was an unnecessary length and size. I feel that the image identification portion of the exam could have been the exam in its entirety and that two full essays on top of those image identifications were an overload of writing that wasn't necessary given that the image identifications asked for specific comparisons of images and architectural concepts.",
                "Slides or recordings aren't really posted when they definitely *should* be. The slides rarely had text and were purely images and considering we had to memorize these buildings, having slides or recordings to refer to after would have been such a help for note-taking as students would be able to annotate images. Section, which went into further detail, was ultimately the biggest strength of this course otherwise the lectures felt so big picture that I was unsure what to hone in on.",
                "Post lecture slides for better note taking and review - moved too fast in lecture to take notes without access to slides.",
                "Great class to take if it is your first time taking an urban studies, art history, and architecture class. Time commitment is low compared to most courses, but I was intrigued by the lectures every week. The course was inclusive and diverse in its buildings and people. I think more hands-on project can be implemented into this course.",
                "It has the typical strengths and weaknesses of a survey course: it covers the basics of a broad topic, which allows students an entry point to study more. By virtue of that fact, it does not go in depth into various areas, which can be boring for students more familiar with this subject area. I do wish that Professor Rubin had more clearly decided between chronological and thematic organization of the broader course, especially to make things easier when studying for the final exam, but that's more a personal preference than anything.",
                "I really enjoyed being able to talk about lectures in section with a knowledgable TF and my peers.",
                "Strengths: The readings were interesting, although a bit dense at times.  Prof. Rubin is an animated instructor and made lectures engaging.  The two assignments (a critical study of a New Haven building, and an essay on a topic of choice) were both fun to complete.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some lectures were a bit scattered and at times during the semester the course didn't seem to have much of a linear progression through history.  There was some jumping around which made understanding content a bit confusing.",
                "This course is interesting, but it can be a little bit intimidating for someone who has never been in an architecture course before. The slide comparisons were a little overwhelming at first, but the TFs and Elihu design the course well to improve our understanding of them before the final. I feel like I had a great survey of American architecture and urbanism from taking this course.",
                "No feedback. This course was a joy and the assignments were engaging.",
                "Focusing on more in depth case studies rather than covering such a broad array of buildings would have been more helpful and interesting. The slide comparisons on the final exam essentially involved rote memorization of names, dates, and architects.",
                "Elihu is a very passionate lecturer. I found that even though you would be confused on where he was going in a lecture, he was able to reveal a narrative that tied many things together. I found that the final lecture and reviewing for the final exam solidified the course's content.",
                "strengths are Elihu: amazing lecturer. If you find the topic interesting, i think you would find the overall course interesting as well. it's structured insanely well and is truly a comprehensive review of American architecture and urbanism. the essays are also very open-ended which is nice for diving deep into a cool topic.\r\n\r\nweakness: if you don't care about buildings, you might find it difficult to stay engaged with the lectures.",
                "Strengths- the TA team and Prof Rubin are all helpful and accommodating people, the course material itself was very interesting and applicable to the real world (did not feel too abstract of a course to take, I found myself walking around New Haven and being able to recognize building style!)\r\nWeaknesses: readings were a bit dense at times",
                "Strengths: the professor and TF's were amazing! Elihu's passion for the subject is one of the reasons I initially took the course, but until you take the class, you don't know how much of a difference it makes. The entire teaching staff loves what they do and are always available to help you with whatever you need.",
                "Strengths: interesting curriculum, 100% accurate syllabus, clear design and expectations. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: little variety in structure",
                "Strengths: preparation for final was thoroughly provided, classes were always engaging and interactive\r\nWeakness: syllabus and class guides were not always followed making organization difficult, large class size made professor difficult to connect with",
                "Strengths: The lectures are always interesting and the environment of the lecture hall is very fun and conducive to learning. Elihu always has an interesting way of introducing the course material for that particular day, and each lecture starts off with a song relating to the material that's going to be discussed. It's also a really big class, so taking it with friends is especially fun. Finally, section is absolutely so fun and was a highlight of my week. Zach is an amazing TF and I truly enjoyed his sections.",
                "I think the narrative style of lectures makes the course engaging as well as the TF participation."

I found the material fascinating, I enjoyed the readings (although I got the sense that very few students did them), and the workload was very manageable as an interesting 5th class.",
                "I would only recommend this course to students who are really looking to engage with a deeper meaning of architecture. If you are looking for just an overall history of architecture course, this is not the course for you.",

                "Yes, I think especially at Yale, there are so many buildings that you don't get to fully appreciate if you don't know the meaning behind them. I think this course offered me great knowledge that I will be able to apply by looking at any building.",

                "Yes, I'd definitely recommend this. It's a pretty chill gut. Lectures are interesting and you can get away with not taking any notes. The content is really interesting for anyone who doesn't have a ton of knowledge about architecture or American urbanism as it provides a very broad overview of most eras in American urbanism. Great class for STEM students who need a humanities credit!",
                "I definitely would! While the topic may seem niche, I think the skills learned are widely applicable. You learn so much in the ten weeks and I think also gain a much greater appreciation of the built environment. The workload really is manageable and professor Rubin and the TFs clearly have a lot of love for the subject!",
                "Absolutely! This is a must-take course for anyone who wants to be an informed citizen",
                "Maybe. I thought some lectures were great and others (particularly at the beginning) tended to be a little more scattered or confusing. I think I'd appreciate this class a lot more without the emphasis at the end on memorization for the final exam (worth 40% of your grade).",

                "I would recommend the course to a student looking for a broad survey course in American Architecture and Urbanism. However, given the nature of the course, you wont be able to dive deeply into any of them except for the few ones you researched on for your assignments. I do really appreciate how the course changed the way I see the built environment around me. It made me a lot more conscious about my surroundings and appreciative of New Havens history and heritage.",
                "If you're looking for a lecture class that isn't too much work, you should definitely take this class it probably has one of the highest learning-to-effort ratios in Yale College.

The lectures are interesting and the projects are very open-ended and FASCINATING.\r\n\r\nHowever, the work is not evenly spread out across the semester, so you have to be careful. There are two major projects\/essays, both of which involve a LOT of research and archive diving. However, the professor and teaching team provide a lot of resources to make this easier, so you don't have to go too far off the beaten path to find information. You do need to set aside A LOT of time for these projects, however. Don't rush them! The final exam is also BRUTAL and involves a LOT OF MEMORIZATION, much of which students (or at least I didn't) don't know they need to be memorizing until the end. Flashcards are your FRIEND and you should start at least a week or so before the exam, as this is a LOT OF MEMORIZATION. Be warned!\r\n\r\nDespite the uneven workload, this was a FASCINATING class and I would absolutely recommend it to other students. As long as you effectively budget your time, you will very much enjoy this class!",
                "Yes, I took this in my final semester at Yale. If you want a good survey course that isn't too strenuous, this is the course for you.",

                "Yes! The course is not super challenging and the lectures are interesting (although a little repetitive by the end). If you're at all interested in architectural history\/urban design, you'll enjoy -- although this is a very abstract, themes-based lecture and did not give me the crash course in architectural terminology that I was anticipating. The final is all about identifying\/analyzing specific buildings, so take notes on the buildings themselves and how they relate to key themes, not just the themes themselves.",

If you have a passing interest in architecture, history, urban studies, or cities at all this is a great lecture to add to your schedule. However, it is not really a gut. You need to go to lecture and do some of the readings, because missing them will bite you come finals. However, lecture is really worth it, Elihu is an amazing speaker, and he picks really excellent readings that read like stories.",

You get exposed to a wide range of case studies, including buildings, plans, and other renderings. You learn a LOT, and that's what I appreciate about this class.",
                "Yes! My perspective on buildings + cities is completely changed after taking this course. It's less about specific architectural terms, and rather more about the broader forces that shape and have shaped urban environments throughout American + pre-American history. Lecture is interesting and low-stakes: you can just sit and take in the information, but you'll be held accountable for them when the final comes around. The assignments give a lot of room to choose something that's interesting to you. Overall a very relaxed and fun course that has changed my perspective on the immediate world around me, perhaps more than any other Yale course I've taken!",
                "Yes! I had never taken an architecture class and thought it was really interesting and made me want to take more ARCH\/URBN classes in future semesters. It's a really manageable workload for how much I feel like I got out of the class! Lecture was also really interesting - don't lose your mind taking notes on every little thing but try to write down important buildings that Elihu mentions throughout the semester because it'll really help you when the final comes around. All in all, wish I could take it again!! Elihu is amazing and the TFs were wonderful across the board.",

You definitely gain a better overview of american urban history over the past several hundred years.",
                "Yes. The workload is very manageable and the lectures are, most of the time, decently insightful. This is a really good class if you have never considered your interactions with the spaces you inhabit or are unfamiliar with urban politics. A lot of the material is touched upon in rather broad strokes, but it's a decent survey class.",
                "Yes I would. The content was engaging",

                "I really would. It makes you see the world through a new lens. You start trying to distinguish the ages and years of different buildings, the styles, and why things are as they are in your neighborhood. For that, I would highly encourage it!",
                "I would recommend it because it was a new, refreshing take on niche concepts in architecture.",

                "Yes, if the student is looking for an interesting class with a low workload. It is also a unique course that not many other schools have. The student learns a wide variety of knowledge while learning how to utilize the yale library and archive.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this course because it broadens my knowledge, understanding, and impressions of buildings that I would not have if I didn't take this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in architecture and American history.  The course content was interesting, lectures were entertaining and engaging, and the workload was manageable.",
                "Absolutely not. Unless youre in interested in becoming a memory champion in a class that encourages zero connection to real-world issues or critical thought, this course is not for you.",
                "Yes. If you are at all interested in the built environment, this is a great course and a great humanity credit. Also, the assignments are pretty broad, so you can read\/write\/learn about the buildings and architectural features you are most interested in. My building study and paper were some of my favorite parts of the course.",
                "Yes - interesting survey course.",
                "Yes, it's a very good course to take if you're debating majoring in Urban Studies or Architecture. Through this course I found new passions and was able to test out different academic paths without being too worried of messing my courseload up.",
                "Yes, unequivocally.",
                "I really enjoyed Intro to Urban Studies, also taught by Elihu. This class was a lot less interesting to me, in both the discussions and the lectures. If you're interested in architectural styles and learning about different buildings, you'll like this class, but I found studying urban processes and policies more interesting than the buildings themselves.",
                "Yes",
                "If you took Introduction to Urbanism with Elihu, I would not recommend this class. It overlaps with a lot of ideas he talks about in that class. He talks about architecture and urbanism in a broad, social sense. It is oftentimes hard to understand how everything in a lecture, or a week of lectures, tie together. He doesn't present information in a conventional way, and for some people that is good. Instead of presenting one building\/place with a name, date, and other pertinent information, he uses photos with no text to contribute to a larger narrative he is crafting throughout a lecture. It makes you listen more to what he says in the moment, but it is a pain to learn all of the building IDs when it comes to the final exam, especially if you are not used to art history classes.",
                "Yes, but only if you are truly interested in buildings and architecture. This course can be easily boring if you aren't 100% fascinated by the content.",
                "Yes! I found the lectures refreshing, and we were always able to take assignments in a self-directed approach so, if there's a specific architect or architectural\/urban pattern you want to look into, this course will allow you to dive a little deeper into what interests you.",
                "YES. A lot of people made a big deal about the slide comparisons on the final--which might be hard if you never came to class--but a regular amount of finals studying makes it very manageable in the end. I never felt like the course was harder than a typical Yale class or graded overly harshly.",
                "Yes. The course provides knowledge important to ones full understanding of American history.",
                "Yes, provides a great introduction to urbanizing trends throughout the history of the US with clear explanations of implications on systematically minoritized communities.",
                "Absolutely. I am far from an architecture or urban studies major, and I am so grateful to have taken this course. The structure of the assignments allows you to focus on matters that specifically interest you. For example, assignment two is literally to write a five page paper on anything you want relating to architecture, and I decided to talk about how billionaire's row is impacting the purpose of architecture, rather than analyzing some historical style of architecture or specific building. Now, I can take what I learned with that assignment and apply it to my future ventures in real estate or politics or even journalism. There are a lot of avenues that this class will be applicable to, and that's the beauty of it. In addition, the class is just interesting and teaches you a lot about American history through the lens of housing and architecture. Regardless of your major, I think you should take this class. It's also not stressful and has a pretty laidback work to chill ratio.",
                "I would recommend this course especially if interested in any type of architecture or urbanism. This course is a great introduction and covers a wide scope."
