   "comments": [
    "I gained a much deeper grounding in climate science and its implications for modern-day climate change, a subject that will only continue to grow in importance as my life and career move forward.",
    "A better understanding of Earth's carbon cycle and the different effects that climate have on the development of Earth.",
    "Climate change at different time scales and their related causes\/effects, Earth's climate regulation mechanisms, and human impact.",
    "This course covered the basics of Earth's climate system and the mechanisms that cause it to change.",
    "I learned all about Earth's natural processes over different time scales. In addition, I learned a lot about climate proxies and how these are used to reconstruct past climates  so that we may better understand our present climate and possible future ones.",
    "Before taking this class, I did not understand the mechanisms of climate change. Now, I have a much better understanding of how our climate is changing and what the future may look like for our Earth.",
    "I learned a lot about climate. About the effects of climate change and how it's happening all that stuff. The material I found most interesting though was climate phenomena I don't even really think about before. For example, how monsoons or hurricanes or rain shadows work or how glaciers form and flow. Similarly, learning about Earth's climate history was really cool. How the most recent ice age was 20,000 years ago, and ice sheets covered all of Canada, or how there was no ice sheets on Earth 100 million years ago, and Canada felt like Florida. Also, how 10,000 years ago the Sahara was relatively fertile, and the poor ancient Egyptians wouldn't have understood that every year they were going to get less rain because of orbital cycles. Anyways, key learning is how weather and climate work today, how Earth's climate has changed over the last 100 million years, and how climate change might change the climate in the future. There was also discussion of how to stop climate change and what we can do in the last few weeks, but the class is not as focused on modern-day climate change as you might imagine, and looks to give students a broader view of climate.",
    "Climate cycles of various time scales, interactions between components of the climate system, climate forcing and response, and feedback such as the silicate weathering feedback cycle and albedo feedback. This course completely equips the amateur student with everything they need to understand the Earth's climate since the earliest of geologic times to the present and into the future, as well as a sense of the magnitude and mechanisms behind anthropogenic warming and the disruptions provided to the carbon cycle. The textbook by Ruddiman is illustrative and detailed. Professor Bolton is clear and concise with his lectures and his slides are a very helpful summary of the respective material in Ruddiman and Archer, refined with his own thoughts and extra information when relevant.",
    "I learned about how climate changed over the past millions of years, as well as the main factors that influenced climate changes. We learned about the ways that climate changes affect the planet, including how human activity has and will affect future climate.",
    "Learned how climate change works throughout Earth's history and of course the current climate change. Feel better equipped to read news stories and articles about climate change.",
    "I gained a solid understanding of the major processes active in modern and prehistoric climate.",
    "I learned about the science and politics behind climate change.",
    "I learned the basic mechanisms of climate regulations as well as the climate proxy records which are used to delineate climate history through the geologic timeline. I also learned the arguments which refute all climate-denying claims.",
    "I learned more about climate feedback systems",
    "I thought this course was a great overview of climate change science that was appropriate for any level of experience in science. I gained ways to  apply my preexisting biology, chemistry and geology knowledge to the science of climate and climate change, and felt like I was able to articulate the major factors that influence the climate. We discussed several types of climate feedbacks, and I felt like this enabled me to understand not only the aspects of climate changing but how these changes impact each other.",
    "I learned about the physical processes taking place on our Earth that have driven climate cycles in the past and that are currently driving climate change. I gained the knowledge and language necessary to better enter into conversations surrounding climate change and the impact of human-driven carbon emissions on our atmosphere."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths:  Discussion section with the TAs and the Ruddiman textbook.\r\nWeakness: the Archer textbook. \r\n\r\nI would have appreciated not reading the Archer textbook so more time could be devoted to the Ruddiman readings.",
    "Strengths: Interesting material, a good textbook\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Bolton, lack of organization",
    "The breadth of knowledge covered in the course was a big strength. I felt like we covered a lot of material, all of which were relevant to the theme of the course and the modern climate crisis. \r\nProf Bolton and the TAs were also extremely helpful and accommodating.",
    "The course was online, which made engagement very difficult. Technology issues severely hindered the flow of the class. However, the content was pretty interesting.",
    "The strengths of this class were that the TAs were very accessible. It was also nice going over the textbook readings in class as opposed to just moving on to new material. The weaknesses of this class were the discussion groups, which become very awkward when people do not want to talk. Also, though it is the nature of the beast, reading two full textbooks in five weeks and being expected to understand the material is a very heavy load. 40 pages of reading a night certainly took its toll and studying 28 chapters for the final can be overwhelming.",
    "This course was a great introduction to geosciences for anyone who is interested in the area. It is also a great class for those who are interested in climate change and want to better understand the science and history of it.",
    "Strengths: Ruddiman textbook is fantastic, like so so useful. Archer textbook is harder but also pretty good. The material is really interesting, both the modern-day stuff but really looking at Earth's history is really cool. Please keep this and don't make it more about global warming and stuff, I think the focus is good and gives students a better understanding of climate as a whole, which helps enormously in understanding the present. The P-Sets are also good, they force me to really understand topics, and go back and learn stuff I missed or zoned out during. I like that they're written. Also I love how the professor says \"I don't know this\" or \"science hasn't figured out this problem yet\". Makes the whole thing feel very human and like we're all in this together.\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture wasn't super strong. I found that lecture too often looked to discuss details of Delta O18 instead of the big picture. I had to read a lot of the textbook to do the P-Sets. As a student, the most frustrating thing can be that you never feel like you fully understand anything as the climate is just too complicated and there's always a level deeper. But, I don't think that this is anything wrong with the class, and just how climate science is.",
    "Strengths: The professor, the TAs were very helpful in answering questions during class as well as going beyond the bare minimum (e.g my TA, Jo, created mini lectures that supplemented class which were very insightful), the clear structure of matching the material with the textbooks.\r\nWeaknesses: None",
    "The class format was easy to follow and lectures were not too long.",
    "Strengths: Straightforward homework assignments and exams,  fair grading.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Could have done some minor things like provide an answer key to the homework assigments once completed.",
    "Professor Bolton's lectures felt a bit scattered, but the readings encompass the necessary material well.",
    "The course was generally well organized, however, the Archer reading was a bit confusing given that this was an introductory course. Assigning Ruddiman alone would have been enough.",
    "Good overall breadth of geologic sciences. Very fast paced and lots of reading. Lectures were not as beneficial because they simply seemed to repeat what had been said in the textbook without adding insight or further information or application.",
    "The class was interesting and the psets helped me learn more. The two hours during each lecture felt like a lot and I often zoned out. Although the breakout sessions were meant to keep us engaged and have discussions, I think it would have been helpful to have more discussions during the lecture.",
    "I felt like a strength of this course was the way information was presented for students with different levels of experience with the material, and that it offered opportunities for both broad strokes and in-depth analyses of the material.  I thought that a weakness of the course was that the Zoom breakout rooms didn't have super clear direction.",
    "too much material over a short period of time. was exhausting to keep up.",
    "This course is just hard to do over zoom. Wouldn't really recommend it.",
    "The course mainly consists of problem sets that require you to explain climate change concepts discussed in the textbook. The exams were similarly formatted. I personally found this to be a great way to learn the material and retain information for the future. I do think the lecture could stand to be more interactive."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only if you have a lot of time to complete the readings or a strong affinity for science.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course purely because of professor Bolton. If it was any other professor I would be quick to recommend this class.",
    "Absolutely. This course gave me a better understanding of Earth's deeply complex climate system that has kept the Earth in hospitable conditions for hundreds of millions of years, and how the climate now responds to human activities. The course has a focus on abstract understanding of the material and encourages students to engage with modern scientific literature, academic and otherwise.",
    "Not in its current form. Taking this class online is not a good experience. Much of the lecture content came straight out of the book because it is difficult to have engaging, wide reaching discussions over Zoom. So class essentially repeated the textbooks, which was not great.",
    "Yes. In terms of the distributional requirement, I think it is one of the more interesting courses that can fulfill a science requirement, provided they are at least somewhat interested in climate change. I also was appreciative of how honest the staff was, whether it was for grading assignments or telling us what material to not worry about. I think the workload certainly is a lot, but with the right mindset, some of it becomes more busywork that does not take a tremendous amount of effort to understand. The course truly does stick to the basics in a lot of complicated areas, which is nice especially in an environment with limited resources should a lesson become unclear.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students! Great science class and the professor and all TAs are very helpful.",
    "Yes. The material was super interesting and relevant to my life. It's also a science class with no math which is always appreciated. If you hate lecture, everything you need to know is in a fantastically written textbook. I enjoyed the class and am leaving feeling that I understand the world around me much better, and its future.",
    "Yes, because climate science has been and is increasingly important in our lives. The class not only provides the scientific foundation to justify the material presented but is also very helpful for understanding current climate policy.",
    "It would recommend this as science credit to non-STEM students (like me) who are interested in climate change but don't have much technical knowledge, and also to those who intend to delve deeper into the Earth Sciences. While I was able mostly follow most of the class, towards the end we were introduced to a new book by David Archer that was very hard to follow, even with lectures.",
    "Yes, if you want a a good science credit that will give you a solid foundation for discussing all things climate change. Workload wasn't anything to scoff of, but it wasn't very burdensome either compared to other courses.",
    "Maybe not -- I imagine there are more engaging courses on climate science.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in climate change and the science behind it, Id totally recommend this course.",
    "Yes, but during the regular term. The class is very beneficial in learning geologic mechanisms in climate control, but it is so information-dense that it would be much better taken during the regular, longer, term instead of the jam-packed summer session.",
    "It is an interesting class that helps you learn more about the climate",
    "I  would! I felt like it was a great science course for those of any major, so was definitely very helpful both for me and for my friends with different backgrounds. I also found it to be one of the only genuinely inclusive STEM courses I've heard of, especially about previous educational experiences in STEM.",
    "Not really, unless that student is a first-year looking to major in EVST or G&G and learn about the carbon cycle.",
    "Absolutely! I believe this course should be a requirement before you graduate, especially for both STEM and non-STEM majors who have a narrow understanding of the way climate change works. The issue is incredibly timely and anyone could benefit from learning about it.",
    "Yes"
