                "Very open discussions among students",
                "Strengths: \r\nspends enough time on each section of the book for meaningful differences to arise in interpretation, encourages student interpretation, synthesizes core themes and concepts into a digestible format and structure, engaging writing assignments that exercise different linguistic and philosophic skills with writing styles; clearest writing prompts I've ever encountered that made the purpose, limits, and freedoms of an assignment available to every student (I really appreciated this)\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nwould've liked more instruction and less discussion",
                "One of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Professor North facilitated discussions in a way that targeted students' interests but always had an overarching point.",

By reading the notoriously opaque Zarathustra, he showed us how to make dense texts clear and illuminating -- I dare say that I think differently now."

The text is engaging and the Professor North genuinely succeeds in preserving that engagement beyond the novelty of the first few seminars. A three-hour seminar is intimidating, but it frankly felt much shorter than even some of my 75 minute classes.",

Most of what you gain will probably be from reading the text and ruminating over it yourself.",

You engage with the text on a variety of levels, literarily and philosophically most often, and the insights gained through deep readings the text were astounding. The class also attracts some very intelligent students who can offer profound insights, and Professor North works to bring out the delicacies of Zarathustra's words. Took this as a philosophy major and I learned an incredible amount",
                "Yes; the thinking developed in this course is useful for any field",
                "Yes! This class will change the way you think about both philosophy and literature. Reading with Paul North is a paradigm shift. Reading Nietzsche is also a very exciting intellectual challenge - not easy to agree with, but disagreements always happen in interesting (and paper-inspiring) ways!"
