                "Strengths - good readings, great professor, interesting assignments, workshops. In the class, workshops were very important and everyone's shorter pieces (so, 2 creative works) were workshopped by the whole class. It wasn't scary at all, and Elise cultivated a respectful, supportive workshopping environment \r\nWeaknesses - Some of the readings weren't very well-received and I wish we read more from minority authors. I also wish we engaged with other media as well.",
                "Selection of reading material is a strength, but sometime the discussions feel too guided by Professor Broach. Mostly, she has something in mind and guides the class to it.",
                "This class NEEDS content warnings. I have been personally impacted by suicide--my grandfather died by suicide with a firearm in my sophomore year. One week, every reading mentioned suicide. One was an incredibly graphic description, and another included an ILLUSTRATION of a man's body in a morgue with a bag over his head. I have PTSD from this event and it sent me into a tailspin that impacted my other classes and my overall quality of life at Yale. I want to note that I still would have been able to engage with EVERY reading that week if I had been told what to expect. I also did not feel heard when I told the professor about this, and she continued to use language like \"committed suicide\" in class, which is upsetting when it is so easy to google how to carefully speak about suicide. She also said that \"a lot of us\" had dealt with suicide, which is true in a capacity, but it is not true that everyone developed PTSD after their grandfather's violent death by suicide. I still enjoyed this class, but this occurring early in the semester made it truly difficult for me to engage with the rest of the course.",
                "strengths: ability to try out and read different forms of creative writing\r\nweaknesses: workshops felt a bit robotic, but I'm not sure how that can be fixed. also, the second assignment was to turn our first personal essay into a fictional story, and even though we read fiction in class I didn't feel adequately prepared to do that. It's one thing to read something to take storytelling elements away from it, and it's another thing to read something with the intention of mirroring that craft. More of the latter would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: prof broach! She is so sweet and supportive \r\nWeaknesses: some readings",
                "I really loved the readings and the organization of this class. I think that we couldve done longer writing assignments during class time to practice skills seen in the readings each week.",
                "The strengths of this course were the quality of the assigned readings. The weaknesses were the quality and level of engagement of the discussions and also the quality of feedback on writing was at times poor.",
                "While the readings of this course were amazing, the class discussions were a little unfocused. Additionally, this feels like a literature seminar but the course is graded on your own creative writing, which felt strange because none of the classes were focused on teaching writing."

Discussions were interesting, and it was nice to ruminate about childhood turning points at this time in our lives, as we're on the precipice of adulthood. Reading my classmates' work was really inspiring, and I definitely feel like it pushed me to become a better writer.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in creative writing craft.",
                "Yes. Elise is an amazing teacher. It is rare to find someone who actually gives you constructive feedback on your essays and improves your writing. I certainly feel like Elise did. She was always available for extra help and advice. Great readings and class discussion.",
                "Yes, the readings were all great, and gave me an opportunity to incorporate more non-academic reading and writing into my semester.",
                "I would, because it's generally a lot of fun and you get to read and analyze a lot of great books that are often overlooked.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It was very engaging, the readings were interesting, and Prof. Elise was also very open to our thoughts on the readings; it seems like she's constantly working to develop this course. It was very helpful because we weren't just writing, workshopping, and reading fantastic authors, but there were also readings for craft/writing skills as well, that made you question certain things, like the importance of gestures for example. We would also go over other techniques in class. Definitely recommend.",
                "tentatively. another review from a different semester warns that if you don't want to spend a whole semester reading and writing about childhood, this might not be the best class for you. I made the mistake of ignoring that review and realized earlier in the semester but after shopping period that I didn't want to read anymore about childhood and coming of age. but if you're interested in that, then take it",
                "yes!! you will learn a lot about writing and yourself",
