I also enjoyed engaging with the texts in a detailed and critical way by dissecting imagery and figurative language, historical vocabulary, gender roles, and political allegories--Su Laoshi showed us how details as small as a character's name or an unusual contrast between two adjectives could reveal an entire thread of social critiques or the birth of a new avant-garde literary movement in China. The homework and essay assignments all helped improve my formal Chinese writing skills.",

                "My vocabulary improved immensely thanks to the listening/writing quizzes--it may seem tedious to write out characters in an age where you can just type in pinyin, but I found that Su Laoshi's classic pen-and-paper method is truly the most effective way to memorize new terms and grammar. The textbook format is very straightforward and easy to follow, and I appreciate that Su Laoshi is able to anticipate which terms are unfamiliar to L5 students and include them at the exact right places in the text--this layout not only helped me read the texts without having to flip back and forth in a dictionary, but it also helped me tie specific vocabulary terms to vibrant plots and imageries as mnemonic devices. The grammar and content homework in the textbook is quite time-consuming, but Su Laoshi is usually very lenient on deadlines, so they shouldn't pose a significant source of stress. Finally, Su Laoshi is highly specific and very clear in his feedback to the class on assignments, meaning you can never make the same mistake twice, and you'll always be improving as long as you take his advice."

                "Yes, absolutely. Even if you aren't necessarily interested in Chinese literature, just taking the class for the sake of learning from Su Laoshi's deep well of knowledge and life experience would be worth it. Even if you don't go into class already captivated by Chinese literature, you will definitely leave class wanting to read and learn more. Sometimes, the workload comes off as tough love, but it's balanced out by Su Laoshi's generosity with grading and deadlines.",
