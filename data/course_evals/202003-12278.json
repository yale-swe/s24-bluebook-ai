I questioned my own thoughts and experiences with how I perceived the universe, managing to compare and contrast them heavily with what science is leading us towards. I also learned many helpful tidbits about the scientific community, the methods used to do research, and how to write an effective scientific paper.",

                "Meg Urry is a wonderful teacher and she really helps you understand the complex ideas. The biggest weakness of the course is the 10 page single spaced final paper.",
                "I think the guest speakers provided extremely interesting information, and the assigned readings were also very informative.",
                "This course was strong beyond my expectations. I will get my one suggestion out of the way first, just so I can gush about everything else later. As a student who is admittedly not great in physics, I wish we had a bit more thorough of an explanation into some of the more confusing formulas and processes, but since the class was more about understanding, discussion, and inquiry than implementation, this wasn't a huge deal. Everything else about this class was fantastic. Professor Urry did an amazing job introducing and teaching topics that admittedly made my head spin but that grew on me over time. She always had excellent visual representations and analogies to help us understand, and these were greatly appreciated. This engaging style of teaching really helped the confusing subject matter of the class stick.",
                "Some strengths include the discussion-oriented nature of the class, the interesting assigned readings and papers, as well as the guest lectures. One way this course could be improved is by providing clearer feedback on weekly write-ups and midterm presentations.",
                "I think the structure of the course and the topics it covered were very effective for giving us background in many areas of astrophysics. It also prepared us well for becoming astrophysics researchers through the in-class presentations we did.",
                "Professor Urry is the biggest strength of this course. She is candid, engaging, and extremely knowledgeable. She is a world renowned astrophysicists and it shows! While most of the time was spent discussing the material, we also touched on topics beyond science -- like the involvement of women and voices of color in the community. Overall, I could not recommend this class and her more. Only weakness is that at times it can take her a while to grade material, which could leave you clueless as to how you are doing in the class.",
                "I think this class was good because I felt we as a class learned together, but my only difficulty was that with the challenging material I was unsure how much I should actually be expected to understand, and I had some trouble verbalizing the questions that I had."

Every lecture, discussion, and meeting felt like it was happening right in front of me. My only qualm was that we didn't get to do some admittedly exciting things, like the art gallery tour and discussions with professionals, in person, but for the circumstances, the way we did get to witness them were amazing.",

I like that we had partners for the projects because it allowed us to connect with others in the class in a way that is difficult in the virtual format.",
