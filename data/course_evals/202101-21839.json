                "I learned some plant economic skills such as interest, payback period, and different kinds of capital needed. In addition, I learned how to operate the Aspen HYSYS simulation and how to estimate and evaluate the production of a new plant.",
                "The course is more focused on real-world engineering topics, like economics, simulation software, and plant safety, which was a nice change from the rest of the ChemE curriculum.  The second half of the course was based on the capstone project, where the instructor guided us along to design a wind-powered ammonia plant.",
                "I developed the ability to seek a multitude of possible solutions to the same problem. Also learned how to use Aspen HYSYS to simulate chemical processes",
                "We learned how to build chemical plants taking into consideration both engineering and economics. We modeled processes in ASPEN HYSYS, did an extensive literature review, and generally got experience analogous to industry work.",
                "This is one of the first courses in the chemical engineering curriculum that goes into the real-world operations of a chemical facility. The first half of the class is devoted to lectures on plant economics, HYSYS simulations, and other useful topics in industry. The second half of the course is for the final project.",
                "I learned a lot about the economy of chemical engineering, like literally macroeconomics kind of stuff. Also, and this will change as the projects change every year, I learned a lot about ammonia production and renewable energy as that was what my project was related to"

                "Strengths: learn about aspects of industry engineering that aren't covered in other courses in the major. \r\nWeakness: all of the capstone groups in the class are assigned the exact same project, making the capstone project somewhat pointless since we are all reporting the same information in the end.",
                "The strengths of this course is that it allows for you to work in groups on a large long-term project. Also, I enjoyed the aspect of figuring the economic feasibility of our process. I think that weaknesses include that we started the project too late in the semester, and that the first half of the course did not feel like the most useful in the long-run. I think that the economics section of the course should be shortened in order to provide more time for the project. Finally, it seemed like many due dates were unclear, and would be thrown upon us. I think that using the canvas course assignments page would help this drastically.",
                "The strength of the course was the project, as it gave us more practical engineering experience.  The weakness was that, because there was no TA and thus no psets, the first half of the course was almost forgettable.",
                "Dr. Khalil is extremely patient and makes himself available for students as much as he can. Anytime students struggle with material, he offers his precious time and it is a very good opportunity for students to catch up. Weaknesses of this course include the lack of a TA, and the fact that Aspen HYSYS access was only remotely available.",
                "The professor is very good at providing all the resources you need and being helpful when you get stuck. Since we took this class during an online term, it was hard to get enough time to use the lab computers for our process modeling.",
                "The collaboration on the final project is great. I really enjoyed working with my team to make the best project we could. Also the textbook and lecture notes have vast amounts of real-world information on plant economics that are useful for thinking about any business, not just chemicals. Some suggestions for improvement for the course are: 1) longer time to work on the project: I think it would be cool to have more time to do more research on the real-world equipment costs, calling manufacturers etc. and overall improving the simulation as much as possible. In person, it might be worth doing a physical small-scale test/model depending on the type of project. 2) have some student input into the topic of the project. I really enjoyed my project but it  might be interesting to poll the class and see what interests there are, or give an option of topics that students would want to explore more.",
                "I wish there was more time to actually work on the project. So much time was spent on the economics of chemical engineering, and there definitely was enough time to do the project but it was not as satisfying as I feel it could be. It also became a rush at some point.\r\n\r\nAlthough, this class does have a lot of strengths like there is no stress about choosing your own project, I really liked that all the teams worked together on the same project with slight variations between them to compare."

I feel like canvas has many features implemented to make life easier for students and staff alike and not many features were utilized. The one that comes to mind immediately is the assignments tab, having to email things to your professor, while fine, can feel very wishywashy at times because assignments getting lost in an inbox is too real."
