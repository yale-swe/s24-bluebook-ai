   "comments": [
    "Listening exercises were boring and he overall could be tedious. Class was fun though, and it was extremely well organized",
    "strength: engages all students in the class even if they don't want to be engaged. \r\nweakness: don't have enough speaking evaluations with the teacher one on one for grade - that would be helpful",
    "I loves the many texts that were required for the course. I believe they really forced you to learn the French language. However, I believe the course packet recordings could be more efficient as they take a lot time off of my schedule.",
    "I found that my weakness in the class was the testing.. I felt that many points were lost on very minor mistakes making it difficult for the exam to be an actual demonstration of my knowledge",
    "I enjoyed the variety of books and movies that we watched and read.",
    "I think that it is generally a strong course with a high level of work and intensity.",
    "I think it was good that it is everyday and that there was a relationship with the Professor! I do think that material could be covered more in class, a lot had to be learned through homework."

    "It was more fun than I expected out of a language class",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, especially if professor Burton is teaching it! This class is a lot of work but it will really improve your french speaking and listening abilities.",
    "Yes. But not to solely to fulfill a language requirement; this class is rigorous and immerses you in French culture and language. Take it if you are interested in learning about French.",
    "Take the course if you want to improve your french and are willing to put a lot of work in it. The course is well organized, you get to read interesting books and watch cool movies. The unit quizzes are very tiresome and usually test irrelevant material or relevant material in an irrelevant way. Overall, not a bad L3.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. You learn a lot of French in a short period of time. It may be challenging at times, but it is worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course because It helped me greatly improve my French and I plan to continue studying French.",
    "I think it's a good course to take if you're committed to French",
    "I loved my teacher and I think French is a great language to learn here.",
    "Yes definitely! The course is very immersive and the professors are dedicated to improving your French skills."
