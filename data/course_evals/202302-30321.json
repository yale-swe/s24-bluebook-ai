The diverse book readings assigned were sufficient to provide different angles, teaching different new terms. The course also quite emphasize on writing, specifically book reviews and comparative book review. The guide included in the syllabus was effective in providing details about the kinds of argumentation and writing style expected in the course. \r\n\r\nNew Important Terms I can recall:\r\nDisease, Illness,  PTSD, Guanxi, Deep hanging out, Rapid ethnographic assessment, preparedness, and more.",

                "The skills I developed theough this course is critical thinking, public speaking, writing. I gained new abilities in writing academic book reviews and I recieved new knowledge about infectious diseases (how they spread through socioeconomic differences) and healthcare systems in different regions.",
                "As a public policy student, this course has enlightened me in terms of new knowledge and skills, particularly in the fields of public health and critical reading. This course taught me to read and re-construct a book properly in the form of book review. I have learnt that writing book reviews does not revolve solely on its strengths or weakness, but one must also include the methods as well as its key arguments. Additionally, this course has helped me to gain an insight on public health--how the public health institutions worked, how community responded to diseases, and how cultural as well as historical context also plays a role and constructing the society's mindset. The last skill that I gained in this course was how to conduct a discussion, because I never realized that it took a long time to construct a question set.",

                "Strengths: Interesting readings, very engaged professor/TA, strong participation from the students since its a summer class\r\nWeaknesses: The reading load is high enough that it's difficult to get the entire reading done well if you are balancing other obligations at the same time.",
                "The level of discussion engagement was the highlight of the course. The Professor and TF closely listen to the discussion and seem to understand the exact moment they should intervene. Most of the time, the discussion feels natural, and the discussion slowly builds itself.",
                "Strengths:\r\n1. Teaching method is very engaging and intimate.\r\n2. Professor and TAs are very helpful and provise much feedbacks on assignments to help students improve.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. Workload is toughhaving to read two whole ethnography books every week was challenging. I often struggled to finish some books. This can be improved by handing out the question sets earlier (1-2 days earlier) so students can estimate which parts of the books are most important to focus on.",
                "This course demands a great participation through its discussion, as it is mandatory for students to join the discussion; or else they would be assumed that they did not read the book. At some parts, it did enhance my confidence to discuss my ideas as well as rebutting others' opinion about a certain topic or question. It also increases my reading skills, because it demanded us to read one book every meeting, which is pretty tough as the lecturer said that this course has the workload of a graduate student. Moreover, it explores the world of public health and it was pretty understandable even for the kids who have not studied it yet. Though it increases my resiliency and knowledge, the biggest weakness that this course possess was the fact that it did not have its lecturer deliver the materials on this course. Marcia delivers her 'insights' after other students have spoken, but the knowledge she delivers was far than I expected. In my mind, I was expecting a whole introductory lecture about public health and anthropology or ethnography that was not in our reading materials, so that it could complement the knowledge that we read from the reading materials. I wished that she explored that part, or creates a variation in the courses; not only discussion but also a lecture. Other than that, maybe I wished that this course was a bit less tense in terms of workload.",
                "One of the main strengths of the course is that students could get clear and concise evaluation after every writing tasks. As undergraduate students, in my perspective, we exceedingly need detailed revisions in order to understand better our mistakes in writing.  I really liked cookies which brought by the professor for the entire class. Although such, for a summer session, I sometimes felt that the weakness is that students could not done one whole book only to be discussed during the class."

                "Yes. The course is recommended for anyone willing to spend time and effort to read and write, no matter what the prior background is. The importance of global health can and should be learned by more and more people. And the discipline of ethnography should be within everyone's toolbox. Using health as the main topic, which is basically a universal problem, we are pushed to learn about all the intricacies, both on macro and micro levels. I'd argue that the macro level of decision-making is more familiar to more people, the kind of personal, intimate, and deep look into people's live is necessary in daily life. To listen with empathy, to speak with care.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students especiallu those interested in diseases, health, and humanities because, although the tough workload, the teaching method of seminars is very engaging and insightful. Thus, the knowledged gained is memorable and useful for many future classes. The professor and TA are also extremely kind and helpful.",
                "For someone who intend to explore the fields of public health, conflict resolution, anthropology, and public policy, I really recommend this course. It was a tiring yet enjoyable course, but it did give me what I needed to understand. This course is very recommended to political science and public policy student, because this has allowed me to understand what usually goes wrong in the implementation phase of a policy cycle. Usually, the implementation phase was highlighted with the inability of policymakers to read the context of policy implementation. Sometimes they forgot the historical context and cultural context that might hinder or accelerate the policy implementation, and the common case is policymakers tend to be tone deaf--not understanding that in order to solve a problem, you need to understand the context and identify the root cause, which can be done by understanding the people.",

It helped to complicate my views of daily life, while still holding the drive to keep being ideal. \r\n\r\nThe course also pushed me to consider applying for anthropology masters, and do ethnographic research, especially in a topic related to what I major in: Media studies.",

Thus, it will be helpful during my next encounters with ethnography books or if I ever work on an ethnography myself.\r\n\r\n2. Many of the methods used in ethnographies are similar to those used in psychology research. Consequently, I can learn from these methods for my future research in psychology.\r\n\r\n3. The knowledge gained through this class about diseases, the healthcare system, and their correlation with socioeconomic setting is useful in understanding those aspects in my hometown of Indonesia.
