                "The course instructor was completely not engaging, unaware, and slow. He made no effort to engage the class and in many of the lectures, he arrived 5 minutes late. The material was poorly explained, the method of grading was convoluted, and the instructor struggled to explain material in class and in office hours, especially when questions rose up about the class structure. The instructor did not know why I received certain grades for assignments and struggled to explain my grades to me -- the course was led by a group, headed by a lead-instructor, whom my professor refused to advocate student concerns to.",
                "Strengths: well structured and comprehensive\r\nWeaknesses: A heavy load of practice problems and HAMs; however I enjoyed solving those.",
                "I feel like there was an extreme lack of feedback from the course, which made it impossible to improve your abilities on topics you may have performed poorly on. There was also no interaction between the students, which made the class seem disconnected. I also believe that the lectures we watched did not translate to the work that had to be done.",
                "Virtual office hours were available and very helpful. It was also helpful to have recorded lectures that were promptly posted on Canvas. The live virtual class sometimes lacked engagement with the students.",
                "Strengths: moderate workload and good pacing, pre-lecture videos were short and helped provide a topic introduction for the upcoming class\r\nWeakness: lecture was unengaging and didn't always prepare me for PSETS\r\nImprovements: part of lecture should be dedicated to problems and ideas related to the PSETs",
                "The class was nice because we went over a lot of cool topics, but the way the professor taught was very long and boring as we kind of did only practice problems the whole time. The way that class is graded is definitely a strength, as it was very low stress, which was so nice.",
                "The teaching itself was just not good. I basically had to teach myself everything. However the ability to take several quizzes was appropiate and effective especially since students had to learn all the content by themselves this term.",
                "The professor was very slow.",
                "Strengths: preclass assignments gave me a great idea about the information we were going to learn and made me pay attention with the quizzes. Another strength is that this course was based on mastery levels. I really enjoyed having multiple attempts. This mastery approach allowed me to see my mistakes and learn from them rather than a midterm or final and i just move on without correcting\r\n\r\nWeakness: The lectures from class and P-set and even some of the HAM and Quiz did not match up at all. In most cases, the pset did not corroclate at all with what we did in lecture. Or at least is was very difficult.",
                "This course had really low engagement. Everyday was packed with learning, and examples which is informative but a little bit dull",

                "Strengths: I really loved this mastery based grading system. It made the class low stress and manageable. \r\nWeaknesses: It would have been nice to have wider windows to take the quizzes."

                "There were virtually no practice problems or guided support to help students better learn the material. The lesson plans were very dense and extremely high level\/unclear especially for a Calculus 1 course. Students had to put in enormous effort outside of class to relearn or teach themselves the material that was overcomplicated or glazed over during class time. Additionally the in class actives were extremely difficult, made literally no sense, and did not contribute to a greater understanding of the material. For a student interested or intending to use mathematics in the future, this course was incredibly disappointing.",

Also office hours with the professor really aided in my success. \r\n\r\nOther than that, I feel like as long as you take advantage to ask your questions like i did in the office hours and schedule meetings with Professor, the class was a success.",
