   "comments": [
    "Lectures are all over the place - sometimes he's talking about stuff he just finds cool, whereas other times he's doing material you will actually be tested on. I found it pretty hard to learn. TAs and professor were hard to access. Professor honestly seemed unhappy to teach the class. Final project was dumb.",
    "- poor instructing, communication\r\n- low workload",
    "I actually think the course is very strong as is. I learned a lot and had a very low amount of stress for this class throughout the semester--something many Yale classes could aim for.",
    "The course is a great fifth or sixth course. It will teach you some basics about making and evaluating networks.",
    "I think the lectures included superfluous material that did not pertain to the homeworks. Also, we did not much guidance on the project (e.g. what was expected). I also think the final was a bit unnecessary as it was just a repeat of the midterm. That said, I did learn a lot of interesting material.",
    "Class cannot possibly be improved, it is so amazing.",
    "Good how it rewards the learning process. Lectures could be more engaging.",
    "Very easy class that was very low intensity.",
    "Lectures were irrelevant but homeworks were useful information",
    "The lectures do not align with the homework, but the midterm\/final was very straightforward, as were the expectations",
    "The perfect class",
    "The strengths of this course include the TA's exceptional willingness to help, but this of course is in the light of the course's greatest weakness: that the material taught in class rarely had anything to do with the demands of homework assignments. The most obvious improvement that could be made is to either make the lectures contain material that will be addressed on the homework, or alter the homework to match the lectures.",
    "Easy class, with very little material that felt relevant to networks.",
    "I think that a strength of the course was the way in which the grading was designed. You can submit the problem sets as many times as you would like until you get all of the questions correct and this is particularly helpful because often times the problem sets took an enormous amount of time. The information discussed in class was unrelated to the questions asked on the problem sets, so the students were often left having very little idea of how to do the questions on the problem sets. Stemming from this, I think that a big weakness of the course was the way in which the lectures were run. I wish that we had discussed problems and formulas to use that would could then reinforce and apply when we were doing our problem sets and homework. Instead, the information discussed in class was incredibly complex and almost entirely unrelated to the types of questions and problems asked on the problem sets and exams.",
    "The course had a very light workload but the lecture material was completely irrelevant to success in the class which made going to lecture tedious and painful.",
    "This course was very helpful in the sense that difficult mathematical concepts were broken down and explained in a way that was conducive to my learning. The one weakness might be no partial credit awarded on the midterm and final, but the positives of this course far outweigh the negatives.",
    "Better correlation with lecture and PSETs",
    "This class is terrible. The professor knows that no one cares about the course matter and does not make any effort to change things. He speaks so softly and in such a monotone way that it is impossible to stay focused on his lectures. The class itself is unorganized and I often had no idea what was going on.",
    "I appreciate that this class was geared towards students with little to no math experience. However, it was poorly taught and was more about memorization than learning. I never understood what was happening in the class or the nuts and bolts behind what we were learning. I memorized material and got through the course okay, but it wasn't geared toward my learning at all.",
    "Good feedback for such a large class! The workload is balanced and allows focus on final project.",
    "Make the assgnments count more. Small kistakes during the midterm are dispropotionately weighted.",
    "Strengths: It's a nice class to learn and apply data analysis techniques \r\nWeaknesses: The theoretical side of it is pretty hard to understand.",
    "Strengths: EASY, parts were kinda fun? \r\nWeaknesses: Not very interesting, disconnect between lecture and homework",
    "A weakness was the size of the class and lack of accountability for showing up to class. We occasionally had quizzes, but nobody was really making sure everyone was in class. Nick was an incredible TA, but he was also the only one, which was probably very difficult for a course of this size!",
    "This course is essentially just a gut. I learned very little, despite getting what I believe to be a 100% in the class.",
    "Manageable workload. Good pace. Midterms and finals are almost the same, which seems kind of pointless.",
    "Very interesting content with a good overview of data visualization.",
    "Fair workload but necessary further review in class and more obvious expectations",
    "No strengths. All weaknesses. You learn a bunch of crap in class and then it never shows up on the problem sets or exams. You might as well just self study the entire course, because that is essentially what you are forced to do.",
    "such an easy qr-- take it.",
    "It is the guttiest gut fathomable. That is both its strength and its weakness.",
    "Strengths- the psets tell you when your answers are right and wrong so it makes u go back and learn it to get it right \r\n\r\nWeakness- none at all",
    "This class does not try to be anything other than what it is.\r\nThat being said, it is possible to walk away having learned nothing.",
    "Strengths: The midterm and final was very fair - based purely on material covered in the problem sets.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the problems sets tested concepts that were not covered in lecture.",
    "The course is what you make of it.",
    "This is an intriguing course clearly geared towards introducing humanities students to general quantitative concepts. I enjoyed the first half of the semester; lectures were structured to facilitate student learning and weakly problem sets kept me on track to success. However, the second half of the semester, which focussed exclusively on student presentations, really sagged. I would have preferred a slightly more rigorous and structured second half of the semester that mirrored the organization of the first half of the semester. Also, concepts were sometimes unclear during lecture and I wasn't always sure which information was valuable to pay attention to and which information was extraneous.",
    "There were a lot of students that were overqualified for the class and it made things more confusing",
    "This course has many strengths and I cannot presently think of too many weaknesses.",
    "Nicholas was great and super helpful but the professor made very little sense ans the course was unorganized.",
    "Strength is the GPA booster, the Networks community, and Professor Coifman's sense of humor.",
    "Strengths- pretty easy and the TFs were helpful and I liked the format of the class and homeworks\r\nWeaknesses- sometimes got boring or repetitive",
    "The strengths was that it was understandable for people who did not understand math that well but the weakness is that the homework topics werent always discussed well during lecture.",
    "Course was disorganized in the beginning but got better as the course went on.",
    "It was not a terribly hard course which I thoroughly enjoyed.",
    "More interactive",
    "The lecture didn't seem to correlate much with the assignments we were completing and I don't think people taking the course learned a whole lot if i'm being frank. The tests were basically an exercise in creating a good study guide and making sure you didn't mess up during the exam -- I suppose you can either see this as a strength or a weakness. I don't feel like i'm walking away with a lot of new knowledge at all.",
    "The class was relatively relaxed and allowed for a lot of personal choices. It could have been better organized.",
    "Strengths - interesting final project, not too difficult\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - lectures were very confusing a lot of the time, which made it difficult to do homework sometimes",
    "BIGGEST GUT EVER. You need to take this class.",
    "The assignments and exams were extremely fair and structured in a way that maximizes learning of the materials. Professor Coifman also tries to make lecture material interesting by applying the math to real world examples. There's also a good number of TAs to help with clarification of problem sets during office hours.",
    "I really enjoyed this course.",
    "This course is very strong and worth all the time and effort. My only improvement would be a smaller class",
    "Well explained concepts. Willingness to help from professor and TFs",
    "strengths: excellent textbook, psets take a reasonable amount of time, excellent professor (Anibal Velozo), good preparation for exams by professor\r\nweaknesses: grade depends too much on final exam, different material covered by the end of the semester in each section (one section covered more material than the other and the final exams were different)",
    "The course could be improved by using case studies as the main focus of the class and using them to teach the basic principles.",
    "Strength is for workload, but weakness is that there is no partial credit for the tests",
    "Great course for QR credit."

    "super easy class, also pretty pointless unless you really engage with it, but I wouldn't know...",
    "The easiest class I have ever taken, high school included. If they keep the class organized how it is, you are an absolute idiot if you dont take it",
    "No, because the instructing towards the final project is poor and students have to rely on the TAs to fully understand contents and prepare for exams.",
    "Yes, very good 5th class or QR elective if you are not a math person",
    "This is an excellent course. The skills you learn are practical and useful for all sorts of work with data, networks, analytics or logic. The workload is very manageable and grading is no problem since you have direct feedback and multiple attempts at most problem sets.",
    "Yes.  Professor Guinnane is a great and smart teacher",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to students who want an easy course.",
    "Yes. So so much fun, loved the professor's irony.",
    "Yeah. Solid QR.",
    "For someone looking for an easy QR, this was a helpful class.",
    "It honestly depends. If you're already comfortable doing math (i.e., you've taken either CPSC202 or a MATH higher than 200) and you need a good fifth class, this is a good choice. If you already know some graph theory and game theory, the class is a good choice for a fifth credit. If you don't know either, but you're good at math, the new stuff is very easy to learn. The problem sets are pretty straightforward. \r\n\r\nThat said, I wouldn't have had as nice a time in this class if I didn't already know much of the material beforehand. The lectures weren't really useful for learning new material - they were more useful as reviews of some basic material you would cover in, say, a linear algebra course.  \r\n\r\nEven if you don't have a math background, the class is very doable.",
    "Yes. It is a good intro",
    "Yes if you are looking for a QR and an interesting topic",
    "While I can say this course was easy speaking from a humanities major in terms of workload demands, it is equally frustrating. Frustrating in the sense that since the lecture materials don't match the demands of homework, it can leave students in the spot of learning more from a Google search than sitting in class for an hour and twenty minutes. That being said, your greatest resource is the amazing TA's, so if you take this course, GO TO OFFICE HOURS. They're  just as confused as you are, albeit they have the knowledge to solve the hardest problems.",
    "It's a gutty QR. Take it if you want.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. I think that the information learned in this course is not all that particularly important and I think that at a place like Yale, there are plenty of other and better opportunities to take a course that is interesting and useful.",
    "Yes, if you are looking for a free credit, this is a great class to take.",
    "I would recommend his course if you are willing to set aside a little time each week to seriously learn some of the material. Do not take the course if you plan on slacking off, because even though the instructor is able to explain complex mathematics at an introductory level, if you do not at least review the material you may not do well.",
    "This was the easiest class I have taken since 7th grade. He gives you UNLIMITED tries on PSETs. Both exams are the EXACT same questions as the PSETs but different numbers. The PSETs are normally 3 hard questions given he doesnt really teach in class but go to office hours and the TA will explain how to do them in 15 minutes tops. The TA also goes over all the questions before the exam and the exact method to use to get the correct answer every time. Since the exams are open book you can basically just write down the methods for every problem and change the numbers. This was the EASIEST A I have ever gotten.",
    "I took this class because I wanted an easy QR. Even though it was easy, I feel that it was a waste of my time at Yale. I regret taking the class.",
    "If you want another credit and don't want to do too much work, and are at least somewhat interested in statistics, yes!",
    "Yes, but you can probably learn most of it by yourself.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend. I also recommend taking Linear Models before with Dr. Brinda. This is a more applied version of that class and it helped me understand statistical concepts a lot more when applying them to a real data set.",
    "For sure! While lectures were boring and not entirely useful, I actually had some fun doing the final project. But really, take this class because it is so easy! The hardest parts of the entire class are the weekly homework (which weren't bad if you went to office hours) and the final project. Midterm that is just like homework, final is just like the midterm and homework. You will learn how to solve matrices like the back of your hand! Take it and save your GPA and yourself. It may be frustrating at times, but take it and hang in there! Perfect 5th or 6th class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend only if you go to class. I found the material very interesting but I don't really support people taking a class to not show up.",
    "This is just a gut; take it if you must. In an ideal world, Yale wouldn't offer courses like these, and would instead allow students to use the credit\/d\/fail option for distributional requirements, so that they can pursue interesting and challenging new subjects.",
    "Yep, what everyone else said.",
    "If you want to take a fun Applied Math class, this is for you! It is a good review of math concepts and data visualization.",
    "Yes",
    "No. It was an absolute disaster. In the end, the class is an easy A, but it will give you many headaches along the way.",
    "Hahaha",
    "yes!!! especially if you are bad at math.",
    "Take it if you need a QR credit. The lectures are a bore, but the term project is quite enjoyable and the workload isn't significant.",
    "If you're looking for a gut, this is it assuming they let it run again. The psets took, on average, 10 minutes, and we only had two after spring break. They could be resubmitted over and over up until the deadline, and you could check whether you'd gotten the right answer. Both the midterm and the final were just the questions from the midterm with different numbers, and they were open book\/notes\/internet. Truly a joke. The only thing you could maybe consider work for the course was the group presentation, which was the normal amount of work for a group presentation. If you take this class with a half-competent group of friends, you're guaranteed an easy A.",
    "You're stupid if you don't take this amazing course.  Easy a while learning math. And prof coifman is so funny and cute. TAs are helpful too. The finals are online.",
    "If you want the gutiest gut, yeah take this class. But honestly don't waste your time or money.",
    "No - only if u need a QR credit and\/or a relatively easy A (not completely a gut though; you definitely have to put in some work, and make sure you are prepared for the midterm and final, both of which are open note).",
    "Yes, everyone who can should take this course.",
    "Yes",
    "I might recommend this course to another students. It's an accessible and straightforward QR. However, I think there are probably courses with a similar workload but with an opportunity to learn more.",
    "Yes definitely- if they are seriously interested in the course and are not taking it for a Qr",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a great QR and the professor is very nice and understanding as well as the TAs.",
    "If you need a qr and you hate math, you NEED to take this course.",
    "Yeah. If it's offered by The CoifMan again, how could you not? Brilliant class, you'll get everything out of it that you need for minimal workload.",
    "Yes, definingood for non math people looking for a QR credit!",
    "Yes if they need a math course that will be more legible than others.",
    "Yes. Take it absolutely. Great class.",
    "Yes, if you're not good at QR courses, you should take this course.",
    "I would.  This class was a good class which was actually interesting.  It wasnt too challenging but it made you learn a lot about stats and networks.",
    "Yes for beginners",
    "I probably wouldn't for many of the reasons I gave above. I feel like it became a burden for me to complete p sets and do the final project and it was a burden that wasn't worth it because I genuinely don't feel like I learned anything. I would tell my friend to take a different QR if that is the type of credit they're searching for.",
    "Take it if you want a little broad overview of math and to do the project. It's more work than some of the reviews say so be warned that you will have to put in a little effort.",
    "Yes, I think it was an interesting class and a good way to get a QR credit. Lectures could be kind of confusing at times, but if you go to office hours the parts are pretty easy.",
    "Yes. THE BIGGEST GUT AT YALE. You absolutely NEED to take this class, it's not even a question. You will do 0 work and are basically guaranteed an A.",
    "Absolutely, a great class for anyone. Very interesting.",
    "Yes, take it! You actually learn really useful math in this class AND you get a QR credit. It wasn't as easy as I expected, but that's because Prof Coifman actually wants you to learn the materials. With that being said, if you do the p-sets and understand them (which take less than 2 hours a week), this class is 100% doable.",
    "If you truly struggle with math, this is the class for you!",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone with an interest in pattern and probability. It is elegantly taught by Prof Coifman, he makes complex topics very interesting and easy to grasp",
    "Interesting perspective on statistics.",
    "Only if they need to take it for their major and enjoy mathematics",
