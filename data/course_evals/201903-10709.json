   "comments": [
    "Learned how to better zoom in on a very small area of text and come up with an argument from there, instead of first formulating the argument and finding the evidence after.",
    "Improved my writing and analysis substantially, particularly in the vein of close reading.",
    "Besides reading a semester worth of great DS books, I definitely became a better communicator and critical thinker by participating in seminars, and practiced close reading while writing papers.",
    "This course really values close-reading and Prof. Roffman really shows you how to do it well throughout the semester and in-class. You also get to understand texts as a whole by comparing different translations of the same texts and discussing these differences.",
    "I developed my close reading and analytical essay writing skills in this course. I learned that one should develop a personal structure fo writing that best communicates their thoughts.",
    "To deeply analyze writing and gain a greater understanding of classical poetry.",
    "I learned a lot about close reading a text, changing the tone of my writing, and finding multiple interpretations of one text.",
    "Its a great survey course for Ancient literature, basically studying all the cornerstones of western literature except Gilgamesh except for the bible",
    "I learned how to close read without making generalizations or sweeping arguments before approaching a text. I also learned how to appreciate the intricacies of short ten-line passages through literary analysis.",
    "I learnt how to close read, appreciate various interpretations of one text, observe what the text is doing and not just what the text ostensibly seems to be saying, and resolve confusing parts about the text by relating them to larger significances and themes (about mortality, death, justice, nature etc.)"

   "comments": [
    "Wish that there were more female voices on the syllabus!!",
    "Great discussions, primarily because of great facilitation by Prof. Roffman.",
    "I really enjoyed Prof. Roffman's teaching style and the way she led seminar. This is just a thought, but perhaps we could have general guiding questions in advance; sometimes it felt really difficult to begin talking about a lengthy section of text.",
    "The strengths of this course are definitely the discussion that we have about each text; you really do most of the learning by participating and discussion and making note of the really interesting things others students have to say. Prof. Roffman really cares about our different opinions and encourages our discussions. The lectures focus on very different and often very specific parts of the texts but can be really helpful in understanding context. The biggest challenge is definitely the volume of the literature we are expected to cover over the semester.",
    "I wish we had more time to work with some of the texts.",
    "I liked how this course was set up, and this class interacted well with the other two directed studies courses. I thought it may have been interesting to read Augustine Confessions in this course to complement the Augustine we read in the other two classes, but this class was great and I loved my professor.",
    "I think the amount we read was a little stress-inducing, but all the books were very interesting, so maybe find a balance?",
    "Get rid of final exams, we should write a thematic essay",
    "I really enjoyed DS Lit this fall semester and I do not have any recommendations for improvement.",
    "Prof Roffman is really great at teaching and bringing out the best in you and your ideas"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, as long as they have adequate time to complete the readings and write the essays.",
    "Yes - learn a ton about ancient literature and improve writing\/analysis",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students (provided, of course, they're on board with the rigorous reading load of DS.) I personally felt like literature readings were definitely more enjoyable than H&P\/Philosophy readings, and equally rewarding.",
    "Yes! While the amount of material covered can feel overwhelming at times, making connections between different texts and understanding the progression of such important thoughts over time is incredibly rewarding. Also, most professors are willing to meet with you and go over the readings\/your thoughts on the texts or papers, which can be very helpful. Make sure to reach out to them!",
    "This is a really great cursory course for anyone interested in improving their writing. Professor Roffman is really talented and showed me how to develop really unique yet substantiated insights from the texts.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Directed Studies to others, however I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. It is a very work intensive course and if one isn't interested in the material it probably isn't worth it. Even so, I enjoy it and if someone else thinks that they will benefit from the course it is definitely worth it.",
    "Yes, I think Directed Studies is a challenging but very worthwhile set of courses.",
    "Do it if you want to get an education or if you just want to get a survey course on literature in general.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student because apart from the amazing texts you read, you also learn how to write effectively.",
    "YES. Close reading is something that is so valuable and this course teaches it really well."
