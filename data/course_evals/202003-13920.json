                "There is a huge amount of variation between the quality of the different instructors of the course. Some are wonderful teachers, and others aren't as much. It would be great if there was a higher standard of teaching skills across all sections of the course. The instructors weren't great about adding grades to Canvas, so I was never totally sure of where I stood in the class They didn't upload exam grades to Canvas, didn't tell us our new percentage grades when a midterm was curved, and stopped uploading pset grades to canvas about halfway through the course. Additionally, the grading for tests and psets was wildly inconsistent. I was given half credit on one problem, and after consulting with my instructor, they said they would have given me full credit for it. Incidents like these gave the impression that the class wasn't about gaining any genuine understanding of calculus, and was more about writing things out and hoping the instructors would be in a good mood when they graded it.",
                "The virtual aspect of the course adds to the difficulty of fully engaging with and learning new math; however, it was nice having so many virtual study sessions that were recorded for reference.",
                "I think the strength of this course was that it was clear and provides good and in-depth foundation for higher level mathematics courses. However, I think that this course may be significantly more engaging in person as one can collaborate with other students in person and work on problems together; this is difficult to emulate in a course like this over zoom.",
                "This course was well-structured and I felt like I had the tools to prepare for each exam. I wish study sessions before exams were in smaller groups so they could be more interactive.",
                "The course was good in making sure to cover the material necessary to complete math 115, but we could have spent more time on the material we needed to get through and less time on questions.",
