                "At first, giving a presentation every other week sounded like a lot but it got easier with practice and I honestly think it is one of the most useful practical skills that we could have, especially if we intend to continue in academia or in a lab where presentations are routine. The small setting enabled all of us to present very often so if the course is offered again (I hope it is, at least as a senior seminar option). Discussions became easier throughout the course and I think we all got a lot of practice paper reading (4 papers per week) which will also be extremely useful in the future for many of us. I did like the variety of papers that we read, but I think the major should develop more of these senior seminars, perhaps with more specialization like MCDB has with for example MCDB 387, MCDB 415, MCDB 450 - all of which get great reviews from students. The greatest weakness was probably the ambiguity in the feedback\/grading because everyone did a lot of presentations and we weren't really advised on how we could improve after each one. On occasion if you were assigned to present on the first Monday of the next unit, the papers weren't assigned until like Saturday night which made it difficult to really digest\/understand the material you would be presenting before the presentation. Finally, I think I would have appreciated a little more guidance on the final proposal guidelines because the sections were different in the syllabus and in the assignment on Canvas and having never written a proposal before I ended up just Googling some common outlines. Some examples from past years (or even from real grants) would have gone a long way."

                "Yes, this was a great course for learning practical skills in a less intense environment and for getting to actually engage with the DUS'es on a routine basis to learn about the state of research from experts in the field. It was a great way to introduce students to what they would likely be encountering if they continued in the field so I definitely recommend taking it if it is ever offered again."
