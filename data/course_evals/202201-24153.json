Understanding of the Cradle Paradox (professor's working theory) as a way of analyzing Africa as a continent and Africans as a diverse group. Developed critical reading skills through in-depth study of complicated research papers. Enhanced group work and presentation skills.",

I learned about the cradle paradox and how a lot of western relies on the assumption of Africa as the cradle of humanity and that assumption is ingrained in our culture for example in the way museums are set up. I learned a lot about how locals react to scientists at their excavation sites.",

                "Strengths: Professor checked in frequently with students regarding workload and status of understanding, many topics covered but with a cohesive theme and course thesis, only one traditional exam\r\nWeakness: Not much feedback given on written assignments",
                "This course was very interesting and covered a variety of topics. However, it seemed a little thrown together as we went, with readings and assignments changing from the syllabus. With readings assigned only a couple of days before class, it was hard to get ahead or feel prepared without being rushed. She also told us of our assignments, including the midterm and papers, about a week in advance, so I never felt like I knew what was going on in the course.",
                "Course was fantastic in its design; Enjoy not only the topic and the work but the instruction ; The only improvement would be location of class; with the topics we are discussing, the class would fare better with better natural lighting",
                "It was very eye opening and thorough. There was clearly a common theme of the cradle paradox and the Professor really drove that idea home.",
                "The course covers a lot of topics, and as someone who had very little knowledge about these subjects ahead of time, it was nice to get a broader understanding rather than going into the weeds on very few topics. However, I think it could have been a bit better organized so that I could more easily make the connections across the different topics we covered.",
                "Could be more clear about the goal of the course",
                "Strengths: The readings were very interesting, the flexibility in essays and presentations allowed students to explore whatever they desired, this class also attracted a very diverse set of students, breaks\r\nWeaknesses: The discussions were hard to initiate with certain topics",
                "a little disorganized",
                "Sometimes switching from lecture into group dicussions made it difficult to generate dicussion since we were focused on notes and listening rather than conversation among students. We did start to switch this order later in the semester which helpled. Also taking into account class seating would help with discussion since often times distance made it dicussion more impersonal. Due to the size of the class smaller discussions may have helped. Besides that I loved the material and the openess offered to us during class. Especially how Prof. Waweru would weave our own considerations and opinions into class regularly.",
                "The topics are unique and things I have never had the ability to study academically before. All the topics are connected under the classes name.",
                "This course was excellent for studying social phenomena in Africa- from skin bleaching to Afro-futurism. Helps contextualize how some of these practices emerge."
