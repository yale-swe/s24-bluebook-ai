                "Strengths: Rigorous course with assignments that help you stay on track (mostly because there are so many that its hard to not learn the language if you're doing them). With Professor Ao, the conversation style of the class was a highlight and made daily class (which has felt monotonous in the past) entertaining. She is really the strength of the course, and I think everyone should try to take her section. She is always on her email for questions and will meet with students whenever. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The assignments. Most are just busywork and graded automatically by canvas.  I would appreciate more written assignments like the unit essays and less daily listening\/reading quizzes that come from the textbook.",
                "I think the way the course is setup is really nice with the 4-1 approach that way you dont feel like youre doing it every single day of the week, you get a breather in essence. But on top of that it is very very organized and well put together where on the first day I could tell you what my homework assignments are for the last week of class. The one issue I had was that I found my Chinese level was slightly superior to that of my classmates and because of that I feel like I might not have gotten as much out of everything, but Professor Ao helped with that!",
                "Strengths: the professor and her unyielding enthusiasm, the organization of the course (daily schedule for the whole semester, PowerPoints, and test format), and the focus of speaking and listening\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none that I could find",
                "This class was excellent. Ao laoshi really does a good job at keeping you engaged in class and does well at accessing the energy of the class and making sure students are comfortable."

                "Yes! I think it is a great course for anybody in the Chinese sequence to take! Itll help you better understand life scenarios through the perspectives of our textbook making the class very applicable.",
                "100%! If you care about learning Chinese and Chinese culture, there is no better course.",
                "Yes! I feel like I have learned so much and this class makes you feel proud of how much you have gained."
