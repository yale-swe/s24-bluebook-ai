   "comments": [
    "I learned about various important intellectual circles throughout time, from antiquity to the founding and development of the United States to those behind modern Europe and beyond. Exploring the history, interactions, and ideas behind these circles, the insights provided by the course are also readily applicable to the present day.",
    "I feel like I developed a greater sense of the world and how it came to be through this course. I thought it incorporated both breadth and depth; the readings gave a really great overview of the circle of the day, and Professor Hill supplemented the readings with more historical background on how the circle came to be, etc.",
    "This course offered insights into various intellectual and powerful circles throughout history. The content of the course, brought to life by Professor Hill, has changed my understanding of history in general and intellectual history in particular. I learned that many of the most impactful decisions and meaningful conversations take place in small settings among those in the circle, from Plato's Symposium to the Georgetown Set. The readings from the course offer additional insight into the dynamics behind these circles.",
    "This course was a very intellectually stimulating one. I developed a broad understanding of how the world is organized and how it functions. Reading books on a variety of topics introduced me to new concepts. This was a very culturing experience. Additionally, discussing these works in class with my classmates and Professor Hill, improved everyone's understanding of the books and the concepts we were covering.",
    "This course allowed me to understand the origins and works of the modern world order through the study of intellectual history.",
    "I learned to look at events and issues in a historical lense. All the issues of today can be traced back to a lineage of intellectual ideas discussed throughout the ages.",
    "I learned about the relationships between various eras of intellectual discourse and about the broader evolution of thought over time. It was very interesting to see how Professor Hill designed the syllabus to lead from one period of thought \/ area of society to another, and how he bridged the different eras of seemingly irreconcilable theories. It definitely taught me how to synthesize material more and how to evaluate societal actions and decisions on a more philosophical level.",
    "The biggest insight that I developed my taking this course is the factalthough it sounds obviousthat different intellectual circles have met, and influenced our perception of the world we live in today. This course showed me that not only have there been so many different intellectual circles overtime, but that some of these circles share similarities with one another, while others are completely different in nature.",
    "Because the course goes over intellectual circles in a chronological timeline, I felt it was a really cool way to better understand the world's history as a whole, and more specifically the timelines of philosophy and governance. I really enjoyed most of the readings and have become a better reader and analyzer over the course of the semester. Getting to see how parts of history were affected by interpersonal relationships (beyond the facts and events we are taught in high school) was so interesting, and makes this class incredibly unique. I'm very thankful to the class and Professor Hill for giving me a new way to think about history and the way our governments operate.",
    "Critical and lateral thinking, clear and concise writing",
    "I read a lot of really interesting books and thought about things in new ways.",
    "I learned a lot about crucial texts and ideas. I gained the ability to link seemingly disparate ideas and theories. And my ability to analyze and think outside the box grew enormously.",
    "Intellectual Circles covered a broad range of historical, philosophical, and political topics from a variety of time periods. Besides creating a strong foundation of knowledge in these areas, the course focused on being able to identify the structure of relationships between a number on individuals and their collective impact on history or thought. Most critically, we learned to track these narratives to issues in the present.",
    "Insight into the humanities and social sciences, how we can analyze individuals of the past and their motives",
    "Insight into Intellectual Circles  how intellectual history, and history as a whole, is formed by interest groups. Insight into the content, structure, and power dynamics of influential circles. Skills developed: critical reading, writing, and reflection."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the professor gives great lectures. Very insightful and thought-provoking.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: most of the readings are irrelevant to the lectures and are not too thought-provoking. Some of them focus more on the personal relationships between intellectuals and people around them instead of their intellectual legacy. I personally wouldve enjoyed reading more works of the intellectuals themselves or readings related to their intellectual legacy.",
    "The strengths of the course are in the class discussions with Professor Hill. After letting the students run the discussion about a particular session, Professor Hill would share his own thoughts which were always incredibly insightful. The circles selected and their accompanying readings were generally quite interesting. One weakness of the course could be that if you go in expecting the class to focus on the tangible products and outcomes of the intellectual circles you will be disappointed. Instead, the course centers around the individuals and interactions underlying the circles, as well as the ideas that they gave rise too. I think the course could be improved by exploring more non-western circles in addition to the others examined.",
    "I thought that Professor Hill's knowledge was the main strength of the course. I feel as though this course cannot be taught by someone else; it was as great as it was because of his extensive work and interest in this field of thought. I cannot think of any weaknessesthis really was my favorite course this semester.",
    "The strengths of the course include, but are not limited to, the course syllabus, the course readings, the professor, and his passion for these topics. The syllabus is well structured and flows logically. The readings move the class along and provide students with a never-ending source of learning. Professor Hill is a masterful teacher and is able to convey, through his evident passion for these topics, historical insights, anecdotes, and analyses with seemingly no preparation. Although the professor is very considerate and encourages students to drive the discussion, I think the course could be improved if the professor himself initiated discussion as I imagine the discussions would be more thought-provoking and efficient.",
    "Having starters every class and first discussing the book among ourselves were helpful. Everyone was able to share their take on the book and what everyone one understood or did not understand from the book.  Then Professor Hill would clarify the points and give an in-depth analysis of the book. This made this class much more interactive and engaging. Assigned readings were sometimes difficult to get through in a week.",
    "The fact that there were no open office hours for the course made the writing assignments more difficult than they should've been. At times, I found that I had no idea of where the class was headed or what I was doing. However, surviving the course is an extremely gratifying experience because the scope of intellectual ideas that the class covers is extremely diverse.",
    "Strengths: Increased student interaction and control of discussion. The professor is more of a moderator allowing ideas to flow freely and only interjecting in the end.\r\nWeaknesses: Fast pace, often lots of texts to read throughout a semester.",
    "The course required a bit too much reading on a weekly basis, such that I found myself skimming or skipping sections of the assigned material. Mandating 700 pages on Stalin in one week seems a bit much, although it was assigned in advance with plenty of time to prepare. Additionally, the course could be improved by outlining more of the grading structure on the syllabus, as well as the exam structure. It was very free flowing, in the sense that the midterm assignment was assigned two days before it was due, and we still don't know the weight of the various assignments in our overall grade.",
    "Strengths -- The readings are very engaging and also important to history. I also really liked the idea of discussion leaders and having the ability to speak to students around the table. I also really liked that Professor Hill was always available to meet with his students, did they have questions. \r\n\r\nImprovement -- I would just suggest spending more time in discussion with students around the table.",
    "Strengths: Professor Hill adds a lot to discussion and has so much experience that it is incredibly valuable to be able to hear his point of view in class. Many of the readings were also very interesting, and the workload was not too difficult besides the hefty weekly readings. Discussing the circles with your classmates is also very exciting and helped me understand a lot more about the readings and the circles we were analyzing. Many of the readings were phenomenal, especially the ones from the end of the semester and I loved the flexibility the final paper gave us.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel the course could benefit from a bit more structure in terms of what the professor wants us to discuss, because it would help us avoid repetition. Professor Hill also interrupts discussion after half an hour, going into a 45 minute monologue that can sometimes be redundant or unrelated to what we had been talking about. I'd suggest that Professor Hill interrupt discussion to add his two cents and then allow it to resume, maybe only going into his \"monologue\" later on in the class, because he sometimes cut short debate that had been fruitful and interesting. I would also recommend changing some of the historical readings from the middle of the semester, as they, to me, were fairly dry and not conducive to discussion in class. The class seemed to thrive when we were discussing more abstract philosophies and forms of governance than the intricacies of certain historical moments, and maybe the course would benefit from focusing more consistently on those sorts of circles. I think the course would also have benefited from more papers over the semester so we could get more individual feedback on our writing.",
    "Very strong and interesting selection of works to read, some were too long to be able to read all of. Discussions were interesting and Professor Hill was able to greatly increase our knowledge and thinking ability",
    "Perhaps to have questions to think about before we read the books.",
    "I think that the bones of this course are very good. The books are excellent and the ideas covered very important. I think discussion could potentially play a larger role in the class structure.",
    "I loved that each class began with a student presentation and discussion. It kept students engaged in the class, and encouraged everyone to come to their own conclusions about the readings.",
    "The professor did not really push the students to be more analytical in our discussions, and the latter half of the class was mainly dedicated to just him talking, which I personally liked since I would rather listen to the professor give his insight than having a discussion with other students",
    "The strength of this course was in the specificity and breadth of the content (studying many cultures within a rather narrow lens), the quality of Professor Hills lectures, and the other students. While I loved this course, readings could be overwhelming. Also, the class heavily relied on the engagement of my peers, which could be problematic with a different set of students."

   "comments": [
    "No, this class was a good time, however, it felt rather lackluster in development and it was not very engaging.",
    "If you are interested in the personal relationships of the most important intellectuals in the past, then take this course. This course is more about circles than intellectual.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Intellectual Circles was a great introduction to the humanities at Yale and Professor Hill's insights, professional and personal, were always worth writing down. As a small seminar, it functioned almost like a book circle of peers; it was a class that I always looked forward to starting my day with. The reading load could certainly be heavy at times, but most classwork was what we contributed in class discussions. The ideas and individuals we examined were ones that I'm confident will appear again and again at Yale and beyond. Intellectual Circles is another class where one gets out what they put into it. Provided that you have the time to fully engage with it, Intellectual Circles is a great example of Yale's strength in the humanities.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think everyone who is interested in history and\/or humanities should take this course, as it discusses the origins of specific strains of thinking. Professor Hill also selected a handful of great books as our course material, which is another reason why other students should take this class.",
    "Absolutely! Regardless of intended major, this course is accessible and can be engaging for all. The structure of the class is consistent and the content is easy to follow. Whether the student enjoys the course is largely dependent on their personal engagement with the material, not their natural ability to perform in the class. For this reason, I encourage everyone with an appreciation of history and a curiosity for the workings of circles who have changed the course of the human journey to apply for this seminar.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to another student only if they are willing to take on this workload. At the end, it will be worth it if the student puts in the work for it. Reading books on these important historical figures and historical events was really culturally and intellectually stimulating. I would recommend this course to someone who is hungry for new knowledge.",
    "This course was a completely new experience for me, but I would definitely recommend it to students looking for a high level of intellectual challenge. Prof. Hill described the class as a \"mini Directed Studies,\" and I can vouch by his description.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student interested in broadening his \/ her understanding of intellectual development and of societal perceptions of the world. It encapsulated political, philosophical, and intellectual theories and histories, which greatly improved my knowledge of the world and my worldview. Additionally, Professor Hill's knowledge about every topic discussed was definitely invigorating.",
    "Yes, I 100% would. The reason I would recommend this course to other Yale students is because you learn about a lot of individuals throughout history who have shaped our own outlook on our world today. I think it is important, and exciting to know how leaders\/circles of our past inform our judgements about our society and global community today.",
    "I would totally recommend this course, and although it wasn't exactly what I expected, I grew to really treasure my time with the material and in class. If you are considering taking this class because you want to do literary analysis, don't. It was much more of a history class centered on people and relationships, and even though I enjoyed the course, it was disappointing at first to see that we weren't supposed to engage with the texts as much as we were expected to engage with the ideas and events of the (historical, factual) novels. \r\n\r\nIf the above seems even a little interesting, absolutely try to take this class. Definitely a highlight of my first semester and I am certain to take what I learned in the course with me through the rest of my time at Yale and beyond.",
    "Yes. Great first year seminar that will introduce students to certain knowledge that I would consider to be critical for all students to be familiar with",
    "Yes, it was a great seminar.",
    "I would! It is a fascinating course and the readings are very useful long term. It is different than I expected, but certainly pushed me to improve.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student hoping to gain a good foundation in the humanities. The course encourages critical thinking and careful argument structurethe readings are often quite long, but are very interesting and do a lot to further the inclass discussion. Professor Hill is delightful and fills in all the contextual gaps of the reading so that the picture is always complete by the end of class.",
    "Yes, you may not know what you will get out of it but it really got me interested in the humanities. You have to make the course meaningful to you",
    "Yes, if the student can handle reading 100-700 pages of reading per week (we read a book per week). However, the assignments were not strenuous, class was full of interesting discussions, and Professor Hill captivates."
