I thought that the second midterm was substantially harder than the first midterm and the final, so perhaps this could be evened out.",
                "This course was pretty interesting for a pset-focused/ purely problem-solving based class. Dr. Prabhakar was super engaging and made the content fun to learn. The psets were nicely spaced out, as were the exams, making the pace of the course very manageable. The 24 hour extensions and points back for test corrections also made it much easier to properly learn the content, as you didn't have to worry as much about cramming/rushing assignments, and also made me really go back and learn topics I had missed on exams."

Dynamics was a great class to expand upon previous concepts learned in Statics and Physics and helped me understand how to analyze moving systems a bit better. You learn a lot about particle/rigid body kinematics and kinetics, although the learning in 3D is a bit limited. Exams and psets are very reasonable.",
                "Yes! Especially with Prabhakar. The content you learn is actually very interesting and applicable in the real world.",
