The focus was primarily on the math behind these structural systems, and how the forces within these systems can be calculated. Although interesting in theory, it moved unfortunately fast, and relied heavily on outside study to fully understand the concepts. There were several interesting lab assignments, including a pasta bridge and column building, but expectations were never clear nor was warning of what was coming next. Overall, this class was overwhelming, unpredictable, and unnecessarily stressful. There was a distinct lack of support from the professor, and almost everything I learned came from the incredible TAs. I regret taking this course.",
                "By taking this course I learned some of the math/theory behind how elements of everyday structures work, including parts such as beams, columns, frames, and arches. Also, I got some experience building models of such structures such as a pasta bridge and wooden column."

            "comments": [
                "The course material clearly covers the fundamentals of structures. The professor is outstanding in her field. But the exams are poorly proctored and review sessions quite haphazard and long. The absence policy is also quite tough.",
                "This course offers important content that is helpful for anyone who wants to get a small taste of structural engineering. The course felt a bit disorganized in terms of content covered (seemed to jump around from 1 topic to the next without much reason). I wish the course also focused more on the importance of units and their meaning in the real world - it felt too theoretical.",
                "Strengths: interesting subject material, variety of math, variety of projects (labs were great), variety of lectures (guest speakers, important side topics like sustainability), Weaknesses: in the beginning, the course was extremely fast paced. I would normally ask many questions during that style of class but such fast pace made it difficult to even know what to ask about, especially at the start of the course. Maybe the lack of questions made it seem like we knew the material, but it really came from confusion. As the class progressed, I became more familiar with the material and could keep up in class more easily, but that in large part is due to the weekly review sessions. I found that I needed to go to almost all of them because I did not always understand the material from lecture or the textbook. I needed the extra space to try problems, ask questions, and talk through the material to more fully understand it. The concepts were not challenging to grasp, they just took being taught them more patiently and thoroughly for me to get.",
                "It's disorganized at times and the beginning of the course is much more difficult than the end. If the course material at the beginning were stretched out longer, the course would be more effective.",
                "This course is very poorly organized. Often the lectures pertain to abstract concepts which are not a part of the assessed material. The mathematical concepts taught in this class are very complex for non-stem majors and they are not well taught in lecture. I wasn't expecting to spend so much time reading out of a math textbook.",
                "Strengths: The TAs in this course were amazing. They always held study sessions and PSET review sessions which truly saved me in this course. Moreover due to the difficulty of this course and the relatively small class size, you end up getting very close to your peers as you will spend hours together each week trying to figure out PSETs. \r\nWeaknesses: The content of this course was quite difficult in the beginning for someone without any physics background and weaker math skills. The PSETs really don't reflect the content taught in class and overall you will spend a lot of time watching videos and learning how to solve problems through the TAs.",
                "I think the topics themselves are organized well within themselves, but the class as a whole felt somewhat disorganized. I think most of the problem was the math; the math wasn't hard, but many people seem to have taken this class thinking it was a gut science credit when it isn't, and many people struggled with what I thought, as a senior economics major who does a lot of math, were pretty basic calculations. It also didn't help that the professor herself sometimes seemed to get confused, and neither her nor the TA's seemed to be able to explain it in a way that answered people's questions. All in all, I think the class should have been a lot less stressful than it turned out to be. The lectures also didn't cover everything that we were tested on. I get that this is supposed to be incentive to actually read the textbook, but anyone who actually expects it to work, especially when weren't warned about it, is being naive.",
                "There was very little preparation for what we would be tested on. Lectures moved incredibly fast, and often spent the majority of the time on example buildings or loosely explained theoretical concepts that were never revisited. When Prof. Hatfield did address the mathematical calculations at the end of class, she did so only through example problems, and never explained the steps or reasoning behind her work. She often would realize she had made a mistake in her calculations just as class was ending, leading to a very disoriented understanding of the concepts. Because the quizzes and exams almost entirely consisted of mathematical questions, this was a deeply frustrating teaching model. The midterm in particular consisted of \"gotcha\" questions that took what we had learned but warped it in ways we had never seen before. This might have worked if the class conveyed a more solid understanding of the basic concepts, but felt miserably overwhelming here. The median for the first quiz was somewhere around 4/10, which shows that the disoriented feeling was one shared by many members of the class. I do not think the concepts in this class are as hard as this disorganized style of teaching made them out to be.",
                "The TAs were a large strength of the course. They offered review sessions before every quiz and were always available to help however they could. One weakness was how the psets, quizzes, and the midterm did sometimes include problems that we didn't go over concretely in class which did make them more difficult than they could have been. The TA review sessions did help with this though and this did generally get better in the second half of the course."

                "Not especially, unless you have a strong background in physics. The course claims no previous knowledge of physics is necessary, but physics concepts were used immediately without too much explanation. Most of the time, I would need to wait to go to office hour with the TFs to even start the PSet since the material was not really discussed in class.",
                "I would recommend the course to students planning to major in architecture who need a science or qr. The class was interesting to me and I found it quite useful for informing how I think about the built environment. It just requires many more hours than I expected of outside class work--mainly going to weekly review sessions for psets, special review sessions for quizzes and tests--in order to fully grasp the many steps to the material. Half the class went to the weekly review sessions, if that says anything about what is required.",
                "Absolutely not. This course is poorly designed and the lectures do not help you learn the material. If not for the TA help sessions, there is no way someone without a physics/math background could do well in this course. In this course you learn from the textbook more than the instructor.",
                "Only if you have strong physics/math background. It is still doable if you don't (like in my case) but be prepared to spend A LOT of time outside of class learning content either at review sessions or on your own. Also I think the alternative is actual physics for Architecture majors who intend to apply to Architecture school, so I would take this as an alternative/if you need the distributional requirement.",
                "Yes and no. Its a fascinating class and I loved learning the material but it was a huge workload.",
                "If you want to take this class, don't expect a gut. If you have a basic knowledge of algebra and are willing to commit the effort required for the class, you will breeze by just fine. You have to buy into it to enjoy it.",
                "NEVER!!! Please do not take this course. It's overwhelming, miserably time consuming, and a greater drain on your energy than any student deserves. I spent countless hours a week on this class just to feel like I was scraping by. Prof. Hatfield shows very little empathy towards the confusion and distress of her students.",
                "I would recommend this course. Overall you do learn interesting content, the workload isn't that bad, and the TAs and instructor really do their best to help you throughout the class."
