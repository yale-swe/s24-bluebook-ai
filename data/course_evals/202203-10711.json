Prof Jones would give us guides and sometimes summaries in order to double-check that we knew what was going on. I also learned more about how different themes (gender, sex, sexuality, femininity, toxic masculinity, etc) play a role in all the literature. that we read.",
                "I have learned how to properly read Spanish literature and this course has helped me to improve my reading and writing skills.",

                "I learned to read and understand classic Spanish Literature works. Learned to better appreciate Medieval Spain and the historical nuances that occurred during that period.",
                "I learned about Spanish literature and Spain's rich history, developed advanced writing skills, and discussed key takeaways from high-level readings. I would consider the insights I gained to be profound and I certainly enjoyed the enriching experience of contributing and listening to stimulating conversations about Spain, literature, and life."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Prof Jones is extremely understanding and flexible as a professor. He was always available to meet for office hours, would understand if we weren't able to complete an assignment and needed an extension, and is always super engaged with his students. The themes we explored were also one of my highlights because they were always interesting and relevant to today. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes there were a lot of readings to do (every week doesn't have the same workload with readings), but it was still manageable to complete weakly reading responses. I also wished we had more slides during his different lectures because we would only write notes on what he would say out loud.",
                "Overall, this was my favorite class of the semester. I believe the literature was very interesting and engaging. I think that the manner that we submitted reading responses could be changed.",
                "Im not quite sure if it had any major weaknesses. I times I did feel that we could have gone more into detail on the core texts themselves instead of relying on surface level information.",
                "The course covered interesting material and allowed for a lot of thought about each piece. However, the texts often required specific vocabulary that a non-native speaker wouldn't know, and translations were not always available. In addition, more internal discussion between students would have been nice.",
                "This class is a very interesting and enjoyable credit for students looking for an L5 Spanish credit. Professor Jones is very chill and cares about his students. In general, the readings were very well chosen and gave a pretty interesting look at early modern Spanish literature. I will say that the readings can be dense since the language can be rather archaic, even if you have an extensive background in Spanish, so definitely don't go into this course thinking it is totally easy. However, Professor Jones guides the class really well through his lectures (only thing I would change is have more structured lectures maybe with PowerPoints) and definitely encourages students to try to speak. The class balances speaking, reading, and writing well, so definitely go for it as the advanced readings will help your Spanish substantially. The final project of being able to view a film\/show in Spanish and review its themes is also a super cool touch.",
                "I enjoyed delving into readings I had never before encountered in Spanish, though perhaps it would be equally helpful to split the text up into digestible chunks more either as a class or for homework and discuss what the text is saying as well as what themes it involves. We did some of this already throughout the semester and I found it helpful for clarification on the texts!",
                "Everyone participated so much in class and we loved the multimedia presentations from our professor.",
                "Strengths - Course really fosters participation and thinking critically when analyzing the texts. \r\nWeaknesses - Texts are very old, meaning they sometimes are hard to understand.",
                "The course requires biweekly reading responses which can be time-consuming but seem to add little to our class discussions, which render them largely unhelpful overall. Either ridding the course of this component or linking the discussions to the responses are two excellent ways to combat this challenge.\r\n\r\nI found the difficulty of the readings to be a strength because the professor provides extremely useful resources to aid in our understanding and the readings can either be skimmed or read in depth depending on the level of comprehension you feel is necessary before entering class."

                "Yes! Professor Jones is kind and flexible and knowledgeable- the reading responses can pile up if you dont stay on top of them but beyond that its a super manageable and interesting class",
                "I would recommend that they were able to manage their time well. They need to allocate time every week to read and write reading responses, but they didn't take up too much of my time and sometimes the readings were in English so they went by quicker.",
                "It is a very interesting class and the professor is extremely engaging. I would highly recommend this class.",

                "Yes; this course is a a great way to step out of your comfort zone in terms of conversational Spanish and learn about engaging themes that characterize the complex literary world of medieval and Andalusian Spain. It helped me expand both my Spanish skills at the conversational and writing levels!",
                "Yes!! Professor Jones is the best!! You learn a lot about critical works of literature.",
                "Definitely! It has a lower required workload than most Yale courses but has plenty of opportunities to explore the material more fully for those super interested in Spanish literature. The professor is outstanding, very accessible, and helpful in providing feedback and facilitating my growth as a Spanish speaker."
