                "Strengths: the seminar format was genuinely really good (its easier to focus and stay involved), Professor Reiche is engaging and encourages collaboration, exams are also easier and allow cheat sheets (so grateful). Weaknesses (more like observations that stressed me out): the curve is brutal, and its the first class I took that felt notably competitive, so people are distant. Final 50% and Midterm 30% is a nerve-wracking percent distribution. Homework grading had no feedback included, so we had to deduce which parts were considered incorrect.",
                "This course was very strong since it was a small section rather than a big lecture. There were many office hours and the professor always stopped to ask if there were any questions. The class also fostered good discussions. One way I believe the course could be improved is increasing the collaboration between classmates. I didn't really get to know my classmates this semester, as in class, I never got the opportunity to talk with them. This could be improved by having problems in class that you work on with a partner.",
                "The material was pretty interesting and well taught. Problem sets covered the same material and were generally very manageable while being good practice for what we learned in class. The tests werent bad since questions were very similar to what we worked on in class and problem sets, and we could bring a page of notes, although the final being worth 50% was stressful.",
                "The prof could teach at a slower pace. She rushed through lectures and then asked questions that no one could answer. Office hours were helpful, though, but not at convenient times for people involved in music or sports."

                "I ended up Credit\/D\/Failing this class due to the weight distribution, unpleasant rivalry, and the curve. I was pretty relaxed, and if you dont think about your grade too much, this class is really insightful. Professor Reiche is understanding and a joy to learn from. Im glad I took it.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student since it truly teaching you economics well and efficiently. Because of the small class size I was incentivized to attend all the classes, pay attention, and raise my hand.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn microeconomics, I think the seminar format is well taught by Prof. Reiche and much more engaging than a large lecture.",
                "I would recommend you take the lecture Econ 115 instead of this course, unless you have some background knowledge in microeconomics already.",
                "I would probably recommend the lecture, not because of the professor, but the other students. The majority of students in the course had taken economics before so it made it seem like the class was ready to move on from a lot of topics at a faster rate and of course, messes up the grading curve. I think that Professor Reiche did a great job of trying to engage us in the lectures and was great at explaining concepts though."
