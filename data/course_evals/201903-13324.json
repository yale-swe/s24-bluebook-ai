    "I gained the ability to focus on detail and develop as an academic. A lot of time in courses, you arent penalized for broad strokes assignments or for writing buck shot. In this course, there was a lot of emphasis placed on making sure all claims were backed up and all arguments were properly supported. That is very helpful in developing me as a writer",
    "I greatly improved my ability to evaluate sources, both primary and secondary. I also developed the ability to write a research proposal.",
    "Learned a lot about Central Asian culture, religious traditions and political nuances throughout last several centuries. Learning about its history helped me understand the role of Central Asia on the global scale and would like to learn even more to understand the function of it in times when few media outlets discuss about Central Asian countries.",
    "Extremely comprehensive overview of the history of central asia, from the Russian empire to today. More broadly, a great introduction to the process of historical research.",
    "This was a great, well-organized survey course. I learned a lot about Central Asian history\/culture without feeling like the Professor was trying to teach too much in too little time. Learned a ton and every class was a different topic\/time period. The readings were interesting and well-chosen."

   "comments": [
    "I personally felt that the final and final paper was too much. I think there was reason to give a third paper, but it should have been due earlier and not during finals if a final paper was to be given. I also think more general background was needed before going into specific topics. \r\n\r\nSome strengths included Professor Roosiens strong knowledge of the topic and her ability to answer almost every question we had on the subject. She is an excellent professor!",
    "Strengths: Professor Roosien is very knowledgeable, class discussions are lively, and readings are diverse and interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It can be difficult to keep up with the readings since the class meets twice a week and there is a high page count. Especially those unfamiliar with Central Asia, it may be necessary for you to look up a lot of outside knowledge.",
    "There were more readings than expected, but they were necessary to understand the content of the class. It was very difficult to cover the whole Central Asian area in the period of one semester, but Professor Roosien have done a great job in fulfilling this uneasy task.",
    "Incredible course that was well structured for student learning. Very few, if any, weaknesses come to mind."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would because there are few opportunities at Yale to learn about this subject area. Moreover, Professor Roosien is a practitioner with ample knowledge of the area. Its very cool to hear from her about what Uzbekistan is like and ask her questions about what its like to live in the region. However, the class is certainly graded harder than others at Yale, which isnt an issue as one can certainly earn an A, but if youre expected to be lauded and not critiqued, this isnt the class for you. \r\n\r\nDid I mention that a Professor Roosien is fantastic? I cannot state this enough. Take her classes!! Hire her!!",
    "Yes! I both learned a lot and greatly enjoyed this class. However, I would not recommend this to someone as a first exposure to Central Asia or as an elective outside of their major due to the higher workload and substantial amount of information covered.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to other students because it will help not only understand non-linear history, but also gain some analytical skills to analyze resources critically when various narratives are provided.",
    "Yes, absolutely. It was a really interesting overview of a region that is often fairly unknown to people, but is also very important in understanding modern geopolitics.",
    "Absolutely. Prof. Roosien organized the course really well and its a great intro to the region even for people with no prior knowledge."
