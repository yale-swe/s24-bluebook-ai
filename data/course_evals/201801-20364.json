    "Because of the teaching staff, I feel better equipped to go through various stages of design and understand what goes into each of them.\r\nthe course helped me think of program and form in ways I haven't before.\r\n\r\nI also learned how to render, but that was just self-motivated desire to make an experiential depiction. The course will help you learn the skills you want if you can justify their importance and usefulness. \r\n\r\nThank you for a happy final studio!!!",
    "This class is the capstone of our design education in the major, with a focus on self-motivation \/ self-organization to complete all of our design problems and to keep exploring how to represent our ideas visually. Wonderful end to the major.",
    "Learned how to think on my feet and consider real-world situations in a more abstract context."

    "Holy smokes.\r\nWhere to begin...\r\nThere were a million little assignments and minor projects.\r\nI agree that without them, perhaps the final project design would be less creatively done. maybe.\r\nBut we ran out of time! The site was only given after spring break and the final project had to be completed a month since then (schematic design, program, plans, models, drawings, sections, renderings, you name it!)\r\nThe assignments were fun. I enjoyed them a lot and often wished I had more time to flesh them out. It's SO FRUSTRATING to go to employers and show them a portfolio of little \"would-be\" concept projects like stand-alone masses with no clear connection to inhabitation and use for the average occupant.\r\n\r\nI'll rate this course as excellent just because I'm so happy with how my final project turned out and because I actually had fun.\r\nThe teaching staff all gave wonderful and helpful feedback.",
    "strengths -  the teaching staff was very flexible and understanding in letting projects develop unevenly and at one's own pace. They also went above and beyond to help us with professional development. Furthermore, the structure of the design studio as a series of exercises was really enjoyable and kept things fresh. It was great to interact with another school's design culture (Stanford).\r\n\r\nweaknesses - there seemed to be a lull in design rigor after spring break in translating the vampire house and five obstructions into a commons. perhaps that could be reworked.",
    "I think that setting context aside in the first two exercises was interesting and valuable, but suggesting that we synthesize it in the final exercise seemed to go against the point a bit. Of course, though, it felt nicely open-ended regardless.",
    "strengths -- interesting design prompts, not too intensive and definitely manageable for senior spring\r\ncons -- a bit disorganized, could have had better communication between teaching time, definitely would benefit from less pin-ups and more individual desk crits",
    "The instructions were oftentimes unclear, and there was a general lack of communication throughout the semester. Feedback was oftentimes conflicting and inconsistent. Still, the teaching team was wonderful and I really enjoyed the projects."
