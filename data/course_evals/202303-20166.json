            "comments": [
                "There were many strengths to this course, the first and foremost of which was, in my opinion, its structure and the syllabus. The breadth of this course was very wide, and as a result, it felt like a very thorough introduction to most of the important aspects of contemporary French life. It gave me such a great understanding of this contemporary reality that it changed my perception of life in France, which is saying something because I have even lived  in the country myself (albeit only for a few months)! As a result, one could argue that a weakness of the course is that it sacrifices depth for breadth, but I'd say that this course circumvents that issue through its assignments (particularly the presentations and expos), which allow students to delve more deeply into subjects that are of interest to them. In general, I found the assignments to be another strength of the course. There's a lot of them, to be sure, but there are a variety of types that support a variety of preferred learning styles and which push the students to practice using French in a variety of waysthrough reading and writing, and speaking and listening. I also found the daily readings to be consistently interesting and informative not too lengthy. Lastly, the class meetings were structured very well, I found, and I enjoyed the insightful comments from my classmates, which made the conversations really interesting and made the class meetings fly by.\r\nThe one weakness of the class that I can think of was also a strength, in some ways: the workload is actually quite high for what one might expect from a twice-weekly seminar (not in terms of reading but in terms of the constant flow of assignments throughout the semester, with tests and presentations piled on top of weekly readings). In some weeks, it felt as if this workload was actually slightly unreasonable, so much so that it actually distracted from learning that week's content. That said, the strength of this approach was that it felt like no one assignment would determine the whole of your grade, which reduces the pressure of each assignment, particularly when it comes to the end of the semester and finals period.",
                "Honestly, this is a great course that teaches you a lot about modern France, as well as relevant cultural figures\/movements to contextualize the French language. The readings were a bit overwhelming some weeks though, as there is definitely a LOT of homework. They were substantive though, but I also did find some films a bit redundant\/repetitive.",
                "The readings are engaging and manageable, the professor is welcoming and encourages conversation, and the discussions are insightful.",
                "Perhaps it's simply because I'm a graduate student with many other priorities and a very different course of study, but this course had far too much homework for my capacity. Papers, readings, films, and more every week adding up to more than 10 hours of outside of classroom study. I had the time for about 3 hours of that per week. I was not expecting a \"conversation\" based course to include so much reading and writing, and wish there had been a bit more emphasis on deciphering and understanding the nuances of fast spoken Metropolitan French, including more slang and other practical and topical vocab. And the textbooks were so so much reading and very expensive, but didn't feel entirely necessary. But again, these criticisms may all be a result of my unique place taking taking the course as an older graduate student, and the workload may be far more appropriate for undergrads, who don't have their own houses to take care of, meals to cook, and part time jobs to attend to.\r\n\r\nMy one main criticism applicable to all students would be that the weekly programs were released at inconsistent times every week and often required significant amounts of work to be completed before Monday, while only being released on Thursday or Friday. If I was traveling for the weekend, there was almost never the time to plan ahead and complete all the necessary work for Monday, let alone all the assigned work. It was also often hard to find instructions for papers and links to films on the Canvas site since things were very haphazardly organized. I think setting a much more structured agenda with timelines for expected assignments, particularly the longer ones like written papers and exams, at the beginning of the semester would have reduced my stress about this course greatly (and resulted in a higher rate of completion of assignments on time).\r\n\r\nFinally, I'd hope that in the future the course take more non-Metropolitan perspectives and units, which the prof acknowledged would be great as well. For example, a unit looking at Senegalese or Algerian colonial and decolonial history, writers, and films. Or a dive into Quebecois, the differences in accent, vocabulary, music, cultural identity and a film or two. Or even a deeper dive during the Francophonie unit on Abidjan's unique French-as-first-language multiethnic communities and their new cultural power on the greater Francophone world (The New York Times wrote a great article about this published just after the end of the course: https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/12\/12\/world\/africa\/africa-french-language.html).",
                "Strengths: TalkAbroad was fun and helpful, good way to get out of comfort zone and have real conversations with people experiencing the things we discuss in class, discussions were high level enough to get us to question our core values and how our culture raised us. Good balance of speaking\/writing assignments. \r\nWeaknesses: not many, sometimes we had a lot of reading that we couldn't really get through discussing in class.",
                "The smaller class size allows for great conversations with peers and with the teacher. Sometimes the workload can get overwhelming considering the time it takes to do readings\/watch films."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, whether they really be interested in contemporary Francophone society or not. Contemporary French society isn't a particular interest of mineI took the course mostly to have a chance to engage with French and speak and hear it at least twice a week and to keep me from getting rusty (and it certainly succeeded in that regard)but I was consistently engaged by the course content and I learned a lot (more than I even expected, actually). It's a very different style of learning from the L1-L5 French courses, but one that I generally found to be more enjoyable and which really encouraged our personal stakes and interests in the French language and the French-speaking world. My one warning to prospective students is that this class demands a fair bit of work, but if you put effort into completing that work, you will get a lot out of it.",
                "Yes! I learned so much about France, and had lots of opportunities in-class to improve my spoken French.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in contemporary France and want to practice speaking French.",
                "For grad students not studying humanities, literature, or language - it's a great opportunity to beef up your French skills and engage in deeper understanding of the language and ability to discuss some fun cultural topics, granted with undergrads who may have significantly less life experience than you do. But it's a lot of work, and more than you might think for a language you already know reasonably well, so be prepared to not be able to do all of it and not get the highest grade if you want to manage all of your other responsibilities.",
                "Yes, this is a great class! Some of the topics are very reminiscent of AP French or other high school French classes, but it really is different in the seminar and college setting, especially if you are lucky enough to have a super diverse group of students. You will watch some interesting films and have discussions that really make you think. Professor Pinzka is very caring and an excellent professor.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about France and to anyone wanting to improve their conversational French."
