                "How to analyze music more deeply and consider changes over time. Analyze the systems in our world and how they influence art / creation.",
                "I gained close listening skills for songs spanning a wide variety of time periods and genres, and how to identify musical trends in terms of lyrics, cultural context, and music theory applications.",

                "Learned how to really listen to music!!!",
                "I learned how to analyze music from both a historical and a musical perspective. The projects, especially the Hip Hop project and the final, taught me about presenting my opinions/material I was interested in and teaching others about it. I have a much wider range of music history knowledge now, as well as a framework for analyzing songs I hear on a day-to-day basis.",
                "Some basic knowledge about song elements and music theory. Don't have to read music to be able to take this class. Biggest thing I learned was that medieval music and ancient music was not pure/innocent at all! Really engaging fun class.",
                "I learned the history of love songs in music and how deeply entrenched it is in the history of music in general. We covered Italy, France, Germany, and the United States. You will travel from the music of medieval times all the way to current pop. I especially enjoyed listening to the operas! Don Giovanni is SUCH a banger. This course taught me so so much! It was part poetry, part history, and part music analysis (which is a really interesting topic! You will learn how to pick apart different musical aspects of songs and evaluate how they tie into the story that is being told!)",

                "At first, the weekly quizzes were difficult in their specificity (and you can't make them up if you miss class) but definitely got easier over time. The lectures were so interesting and kept me engaged throughout.",
                "This class's lectures were very well formatted, especially for people who have no experience with analyzing music. I think this course could be improved by publishing lecture notes that would be available for studying for the weekly tests. I often found myself nervous for the weekly tests because I was unsure of what exactly I needed to know for the tests. However, I did appreciate having the weekly tests as opposed to a midterm and a final. There was a lot of material every week that I feel would have been overwhelming in a midterm and a final.",
                "Strengths  nice title of the course & very interesting to go back in time. Enjoyed thinking of creative processes.\r\nWeaknesses  one hour and fifteen minutes without a break felt pretty difficult to stay focused. Even a little mini break in the middle would be really nice!",
                "The course did a good job of including a large variety of musical genres and cultural perspectives, it was also very inclusive and engaging/fun to learn about. At times, it was difficult to know what kind of material would be on the weekly quizzes, and the optional review sessions took place during another class I had, so I was never able to attend which was inconvenient.",
                "The lectures are very engaging and informative, Prof Z is amazing at what they do and you can tell they took their time on each and every slide. The beginning of the class was a bit rocky in terms of being able to understand what was going on, but as time went on the class made more and more sense.",
                "Very engaging lecturer! Did not expect the course to focus so much on Western musical tradition, and they managed to make that material interesting to me!!!",
                "The lectures were really well organized, and I liked how the assessments were split up into manageable portions. I think the difficulty level of the course varied a lot throughout the semester, and it might be good to communicate that to students who are thinking of taking it. I had to adjust how much time I set aside for studying for listening quizzes and doing the readings from week to week, whereas my other classes were pretty consistent in their time commitments.",
                "Strengths: great professor, really interesting topics, interesting readings, songs are all great\r\nWeaknesses: quizzes were a lot harder than I was expecting, readings were long, songs were sometimes long",
                "This course is just strength after strength. Prof Z is absolutely amazing! A true gem at Yale University. The class is incredibly enjoyable and I actually LOVE the way it is taught right now. I heard it used to be a seminar but the lecture format allows you to learn so so much more from Prof Z. Moreover, it is super interactive and never feels like you are passively learning. Students participate in every lecture and even lead one of them. I personally really adore this \"leminar\" format. Also, this course is incredibly interesting (I don't remember a single boring lecture!) The quizzes are not that bad and I like using the time preparing for them to reflect on the week.\r\nThe only weaknesses- some readings were very loosely tied to the lecture (but good thing none of them were too long!!) and also I wish assignment prompts were assigned at least a week in advance (I know they are short assignments, but it would be nice to get them at least one week out!)\r\nOther than that this course is GOLDEN! LOVE it.",

                "I would highly recommend this course. I gained a greater understanding of many different genres of music that I had never learned about. The class was very engaging and interesting. It was very accessible for people who did not have an in depth background in music theory or history.",
                "I would recommend this course but you do listen to some really old music. Of course this makes sense from the title but hearing a lot of really old music wasn't really always feeling engaging. But if you really like super old music for part of the semester you'll get through it. Time progresses. Lectures continue. We move and grow. It's cool to see the progression through time. Enjoyed talking about creativity and certain things in music. There's a quiz every Wednesdayit's pretty fine though. Would recommend honestly. You engage in various types of thoughts.",
                "I would recommend this course because it was a great way to expand my learning that was engaging and valuable without being overly difficult.",
                "Yes, it is a fun, chill humanities course that is perfect if you like music at any level.",
                "Yes! You learn how to listen to music, what makes songs so good. As a non-musican, I learned so much",
                "I have already recommended it to a few people! I think it's a very engaging and enjoyable class, and it's accessible for non-music majors.",
                "If you're interested in the topic you definitely should. I'll warn you that it's not really a gut as the quizzes can get very specific and you do have to do a fair amount of preparation for them if you want to get an A. I think it's a great class to Cr/D/F and just enjoy without having to worry about your grade though. Really interesting topics and you get to listen to songs as homework.",
                "YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!\r\nJust take it. You will NOT regret it. So well taught, so interesting, and accessible to anybody no matter what your musical background is. If you care about music at all and love love, just take it!\r\nWho knew there was a course where you can discuss romance, love, sex, pleasure, feminist/BIPOC/Queer culture, AND listen to music?\r\nYes, you might be turned off by the first half of the course which does not deal with current music. But trust me you will learn to LOVE it! Also, the professor (and Allison) are both GEMS! \r\nI have nothing bad to say. I promise you will love this course. I looked forward to attending it every week. If you have room in your schedule and this course is available your semester JUST REGISTER AND SHOW UP ON THE FIRST DAY AND YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE (I promise!)\r\n\r\nIf you don't like it you're heartless:) just kidding! You'll love it guaranteed so no worries there.",
                "Absolutely",
