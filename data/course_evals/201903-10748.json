    "Whereas most Chinese classes focus on day-to-day conversation, I now feel comfortable expressing an opinion in more intellectual matters, such as politics, education, as well as gender and income inequality. Incredibly satisfying to start finding my own voice within the language, as opposed to simply learning grammar.",
    "Lots of new, more formal vocabulary and grammar structures.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of Chinese culture and gained the vocabulary to discuss higher-level topics in Chinese. I also greatly improved my Chinese speaking, reading, and writing skills!",
    "Chinese vocabulary and grammar, debating skills in Chinese, and knowledge of Chinese culture",
    "My Chinese speaking, vocab, reading, all improved.  This is a difficult class, but is worth it if your goal is to improve Chinese quickly.",
    "My memorization skills improved immensely. I learned the importance of asking for help, and this course sparked a greater interest in chinese culture more broadly.",
    "I learned a lot of new vocabulary and grammar patterns, aswell as some traditional characters.",
    "Deeper understanding of Chinese history and modern culture,  a greater ability to express complex opinions and ideas in Chinese."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: quality of topics, scope of vocabulary, debate structures that force you to engage with perspective dissimilar to your own\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: listening. I feel my reading, writing and speaking have all improved while my listening comprehension abilities have remained the same.",
    "I found the strengths of the course to be the instructor (she was very understanding of different levels of Chinese entering the class) and the course content. I really feel like I improved my Chinese skills. I found that there was not as much of an atmosphere of class participation and interaction in Chinese as I would've liked, and I also felt like my Chinese skills improved on the formal language front, but potentially got worse on the daily conversation front.",
    "I didnt feel very well prepared for the midterm, so I wish there had been more preparation for that. The course was very effective in that the workload was predictable, so I learned to manage my time around the clear schedule.",
    "More films would be nice instead of reading and analyzing text all the time. Listening and speaking chinese is what people value, not so much reading it."

    "As much as I love the Chinese teachers at Yale, I have a hard time recommending this course (although you don't really have any other options if you want continue studying Chinese). I think that the pace of the course was just too fast, too much vocabulary and grammar are crammed into each lesson, and I rarely felt like I was comfortable enough with the material to actually be able to use it while speaking. Studying the material itself also just gets tiring after a while - it's still that same cycle of grinding away at vocab and grammar (as necessary as that might be). As a result, the work that I put in over the semester felt somewhat unsatisfying because I'd just totally forget material within a few weeks or so. However, I appreciate the weekly tutorial sessions, and the textbook readings cover some pretty interesting topics on Chinese politics\/culture that result in halfhearted (but highly entertaining) class discussions.\r\n\r\nThe class is a lot of work and not always the most fun, but the teachers are lovely and you'll definitely pick up some useful material along the way.",
    "Yes, I found the topics we discussed very very interesting. The class definitely improves your overall Chinese exponentially; you also get to learn how to discuss higher-level topics that you wouldn't normally get the chance to learn in any other Chinese class.",
    "Yes, if your goal is to improve your Chinese, even if it is a bit of work, then this is a great class.  I knew it would be challenging going in, but it really has paid dividends.",
    "If the student is prepared to work really hard and has a reason to obtain fluency in Chinese, yes.",
    "Yes. Li laoshi is the best. The course might focus a little too much on traditional stuff, but you will definietly take a lot out of it. Your chinese will improve for sure.",
    "Yes, I feel like this course really increased my ability to discuss complex topics as opposed to just talking about myself"
