In addition, in class, Professor Tipton would often talk about modern physics and research being done in the world today, and learning about that really helped boost my understanding of physics as a whole.",
                "Physics 200 built on my existing understanding of mechanical physics and introduced topics like relativity, waves, and thermodynamics. Throughout my previous physics classes, I did a lot of formula memorization to get by, but this course dove deeper into why those formulas exist and helped cultivate my ability to understanding the logic behind the math.",

                "PHYS 200 was a nice addition to AP physics c, which I took in high school. It covers many similar topics to the mechanics semester, but with more detail overall. There are also sections about special relativity, thermodynamics, and fluid dynamics. It was a great way to start physics at Yale.",
                "Mechanics but harder than needed to be",
                "I learned how to think carefully about the fundamental principles of mechanics, special relativity, fluids, and thermodynamics. While many students will have had exposure to the mechanics portion of the course (although at a lower level), this comprises only about half of the material, and the rest of the semester was filled with exciting and interesting branches of physics which are not traditionally covered in high school.",

                "Obviously, we all learned the curriculum of freshman mechanics, but we also gained important skills in problem solving, collaboration, and perseverance. After this class, Ive started to see the physics involved in everything around me, from the forces applied to me when I drive around a curve to the resonant frequencies of elevators.",
                "1) I learned introductory material on topics including mechanics, statics, special relativity, 4-momentum, thermodynamics, oscillations, and waves.\r\n2) I learned about applying strategies in calculus to solve physics problems",

I learned about projectile motion, rotational motion, waves and oscillators, special relativity, hydrostatics and fluid dynamics, and energy and momentum conservation, among other things. \r\nI gained an ability to approach physics problems that described often complicated physical systems.",
                "Definitely helped me learn the fundamentals of physics much better than high school AP Physics. Forces you to really think through a problem. I would say this class, and physics in general, really makes you a hard thinker about not just physics, but other aspects of the world.",

            "comments": [
                "This course covers the material really well in-depth, and the problem sets are very comprehensive of the material learned in class. The lectures are also very engaging with many in-class problems to try. One thing that could be improved is the pace of the class. At some points throughout the semester, there felt to be too much material to be covered in the given class time and the learning felt a little rushed.",
                "All in all, I thought the class was very good. Definitely the best of the semester. Professor Tipton was a very capable and engaging teacher, and the TAs (particularly John Garmon) covered class material and built on it during office hours to compound the ideas from lecture and improve understanding of the material. The method definitely worked and focused on the idea of practice, where answering problems would teach the material. The problem set questions for the year were very good questions, and I felt I learned quite a lot from them. I'm always a fan of learn through problem solving. \r\n\r\nHowever, I do feel Physics 200 also has some room for improvement too. My greatest gripe with the class came from the lecture slides. I learned most from Professor Tipton's lectures when he used props, answered questions, and deviated from the slides. The reason being that he tended to explain why something occurred and how it did so in much greater detail than the slides or when he was reading off them. I found that the slides generally covered what was happening in a concept but not why, which I found tough to follow. Also, very often they were a mix of formulas and bulky paragraphs that were tough to read while following the lecture. It felt like the idea behind a concept should be intuited from the formulas, which I found very challenging to understand at times. To use an example, slides 11 to 13 of lecture 22 introduce the 1st law of thermodynamics. Heat is introduced, a formula derived from previously seen principles is shown, and paragraphs bookend it with things to note about the formula and things of note about heat. Now, this is a good introduction to the material (remember I think the class is quite good), however it was much better explained by John Garmon during an office hour session as Heat being the sum of the change in internal energy of the system and work done on or by the gas (where the sign of the work changes depending on what is doing the work). He took the time to explain what heat is in a system, how it is transferred and related to internal energy, and why work would subtract or add to it. The inclusion of \"why\" and \"how\" into the equation as opposed to \"what\" made a world of difference in understanding it and more of that in the slides would very useful. That's not to say there was never a \"why\" in class, only that more time spent on it makes understanding the rest of the material much easier. I apologize for the essay. \r\n\r\nTo summarize, there were a lot of formulas that detailed what was happening in a concept. Deviating from that, with an explanation of \"what\" happens because \"why\" and \"how\" that occurs would help. Despite being one of the toughest concepts in the class, I feel Professor Tipton taught relativity very very well, because every other sentence was about \"why\" something happened, rather than just what. I didn't always understand it, relativity is tough, but the actual teaching part was great.",
                "The lectures need to incorporate and adjust how much students are understanding the material. The best part was probably TAs that helped cover the gaps of lectures. Professors at Yale have to understand if you are lecturing just to fit all the material in the allotted time you are educating no one.",
                "Overall I really enjoyed the course, but the lectures could get very convoluted to the point where it was hard to tell what was important or not. A lot of lecture was spent on derivations, but sometimes it was unclear what was tangential derivation and what were relevant formulas to remember.",
                "Strengths: the practice problems interspersed throughout lecture really helped with engaging us with the material and testing how well we truly understood the content. The practice problems also allowed us to see where our understanding of the concepts may be lacking, thus allowing us to know which chapters to study for exams. I also found the announcements and review of last lesson's material at the beginning of each lecture to be really helpful. There is also a LOT of office hours and study sessions every week (often 2 per day!), so you can get lots of help if you ever have a question about the material or about a specific problem (which you inevitably will). The course itself was difficult in the sense that you had to combine concepts from two different units together to solve problems sometimes on the PSETs and exams, which means you have to know when to apply certain equations and when not to, as well as what each variable in the equation really represents. However, this pushed me to understand physics at a more fundamental level, so I feel more confident in my problem-solving abilities when I see a new physics problem.\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures were taught at too fast a pace, so it was often difficult to keep up with the professor unless you read over all the slides for the lesson the day before.",
                "Lectures heavily focus on derivations of physical laws which we are already expected to have a physical intuitive understanding of> We are also expected to have past experience with fundamental mechanics, rotational motion, and some thermodynamics. A conceptual understanding of special relativity helps as well. I think I would have benefited from more hands-on demonstrations of the concepts we learned about and more time spent teaching us how to problem solve rather than simply focusing on the derivations of the formulas we were taught. The peer tutors and TFs were INCREDIBLE though, I can't recommend office hours enough!!",
                "Strengths: PHYS 200 is a very good next step if you took AP physics c\r\nWeaknesses: If your high school physics experience doesn't map on very closely to AP physics c, there may be chunks of material you aren't familiar with that you're assumed to already know.",
                "Well organized for office hours sometimes I felt that the course was more difficult than necessary",
                "Professor Tipton's lectures were sometimes hard to follow, but he posted the lecture notes so we could review later. There are also lectures from a previous year on youtube. The psets were good, but it was necessary to do a lot more practice problems to prepare for the tests, for me at least. There was a lot of resources like problems from the books and practice tests to help with that.",
                "Honestly this was a very well-run course. The teaching team was extremely helpful in giving guidance on problem sets without simply handing out solutions, and Professor Tipton was an excellent lecturer. I do wish that some of the principles we covered could have been proven a bit more rigorously-- while I understand the time constraints of the lecture schedule, I would have enjoyed if derivations were posted online for those who were interested.",
                "The course covered a lot of interesting topics in physics and also developed the critical thinking abilities and math skills needed for success in science. However, it was quite fast-paced, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but perhaps can be better organized.",
                "Prof. Tipton is a very fun and knowledgeable instructor. He makes learning physics great! This course had no weaknesses!",
                "This class teaches a lot of valuable information and skills in physics. While most of the content is taught in a clear and concise manner, it felt like the last few units of the course were rushed and that the content itself was unclear.",
                "Strengths: Professor Tipton is a phenomenal lecturer. He's engaging, funny, clearly passionate about the subject material, and provides tons of resources to help you succeed. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some portions of the course, particularly thermodynamics, had to be covered over a very short timespan. This means glossing over some demonstrations and proofs.",
                "The course gets through a lot of content, and the plentiful office hours really help to learn the content through PSETs. There were periods of the year when the content moved too fast in lecture to keep up with, and it would have been easier to follow it we did less derivations of concepts, as these didnt really come up again in the course, whereas learning how to solve types of problems would have been more helpful.",
                "There is very little margin for error on examinations, increasing stress level of the course. Problem sets are very innovative and office hours are very helpful",
                "This course had really strong lecture notes and slides, and psets mostly stayed true to them. However, several psets required insights and information that could really only be found by asking the TAs and TFs in office hours. Some lectures also went into very specific details which werent actually used or tested on, i.e. damped and forced oscillators.",
                "Could be less reliant on an assumption that youve taken Physics C as in that particular course as opposed to others of the same level",
                "Very nice lecture notes and office hours which was helpful",
                "The lectures are very engaging and the lecture content, problem sets, and exams align well. The course is a solid introduction to a broad range of physics concepts, which is both good and bad. Good for the scope and breath, but bad in that we only get a cursory look at each of the respective topics. In particular, thermodynamics, engines, and hydrostatics/-dynamics felt very brief.",
                "A strength of this course is the amount of TFs designated to helping the students understand and apply the material as there was always someone available to help if you were confused about a certain concept or question. The course could be improved by providing more class time to learn material, as the professor often resorted to pre-lecture videos to distribute the content more evenly but still always had to rush through the lecture in class, leaving little room for questions or problem-solving practice in class to fully grasp the new concepts.",
                "I really appreciate the amount of material we covered, but I dont entirely understand the order we covered it in. I dont get why we moved from classical mechanics to relativity and then to oscillators. I also enjoyed the courses emphasis on developing intuition and the practice problems we did in class.",
                "This course was well-paced and well-taught. I liked that we derived a lot of the equations (or derived in some cases if the actual derivation was beyond the math scope of the class), because I felt like I understood what things meant more. Sometimes I felt the hand-wavy explanations were actually more confusing than if they had been more exact.  The psets were a good level of difficulty in relation to the content, and the tests were a good level of difficulty in relation to the psets.",
                "The office hours are incredibly well run and an invaluable part of the course, especially since so many students go to them. There's definitely an effort to have as many office hours as possible, so you can go no matter what your schedule looks like, and the peer tutors are all super kind and helpful! The only weakness I think this course has is that exams were sometimes unpredictable, but they were never impossible.",
                "Strengths included very helpful office hours and well-organized curriculum and assignments. One weakness was that I often felt we were rushing through material in lecture, which made it hard to get a deeper, intuitive grasp of the concepts. However, I think that was somewhat inevitable given how much the course aims to cover. Also, since almost all students had seen much of the content previously, it was ok to move quickly through some topics.",
                "Strengths - great professor, good curriculum/timeline, teaches physics well while not being a crazy workload\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - many of the TA's were not very helpful, though a few were. I think some of the in-class explanations were rushed, and there were a few covered topics that I'm not sure we needed to cover (like forced damped oscillators, since we don't know differential equations yet).",
                "This course offers a clear introduction to mechanics. The content is laid out in a logical progression flowing easily from one topic to the next. In particular, I appreciated the reviews that Professor Tipton held at the beginning of each class, which allowed us all to tie new concepts to old ones and ensured that everyone started new concepts on the same page.",
                "Strength: This course had very interesting content for me.  I believe it's a very engaging syllabus for all students who are interested in physics or some form of engineering.\r\nStrength: Professor Tipton was an awesome professor.  He was easy going, funny, and appeared to love phyiscs and teaching physics.  The energy he brought to class helped engage us with him and his clear passion for physics made me want to pursue physics more.  He was awesome.  \r\nWeakness: The pacing of the course sometime through me off.  In retrospect, I can understand why we did not spend as much time on certain subjects, but in the moment I struggled to understand damped oscillators and force damped oscillators in the two classes we spent on them.  I thought other topics like static water pressure could have been condensed.  This may be because I have taken Physics 2 in high school and seen those topics before, however.",
                "Some of the concepts of the course towards the end of the semester were covered very quickly and it took a while to understand them whereas other concepts throughout the semester were explained in depth very well.",
                "The course material was interesting but I found that the p-sets and exam review materials frequently werent indicative of the difficulty of the exams. Additionally, I think that more time shouldve been spent on some of the more difficult topics, and possibly less on some of the less difficult topics.",
                "A strength of this course was the rigor of the problem sets, combined with extensive support from teaching fellows and peer tutors. The problem sets were often difficult, but there were ample opportunities to work through any difficulties that I was having with tutors. Additionally, these problem sets were good preparation for the test. \r\n\r\nWhile the lectures were interesting, they were often quite rushed. On many instances, I did not understand the lecture material until after I revisited the lecture slides after class, and worked through them myself. As a result, my ability to participate in class (i.e., to engage with the practice problems Professor Tipton posed to the class) was diminished. \r\n\r\nI also would have appreciated more demonstrations, particularly for rotational motion and forced-decamped oscillators. I felt like I had trouble picturing these concepts for myself.",
                "Teaching got a little stale when the teacher would just be reading PowerPoints. Also due to how much content there is we would have to move fast at times and sometimes not understand a subject completely when we were presented with it, but the show must go on and the teacher would have to move on and I would have to either go to office hours or watch a video.",
                "Professor Tipton was very good at keeping the class engaged and at introducing difficult physics concepts by building off of previously covered content, which helped me become better acclimated to the material.",
                "Great slides and course organization. It was always presented clearly what we needed to know. Although I appreciated the pacing for material that was assumed to be familiar, the course didnt really slow down for some of the new topics and it was pretty hard to keep upI often felt that I had to study the course slides relatively thoroughly before all the lectures. Lectures were often somewhat unclear, though the slides made up for any flaws.",
                "Please, please, please more review on AP concepts for those who may have had different curriculums. The ultimate weakness of this course is that too much prior knowledge is assumed that is not referred to in the course description. This course is described incorrectly. Tutors are great though.",
                "The course should either be made either exclusively for potential physics majors or advanced physics topics like special relativity should be shortened in scope. TAs were also hit or miss with grad students using linear algebra and harder/unreasonable problems unnecessarily while others, especially the undergraduate TAs were very helpful and more understanding."

            "comments": [
                "Yes I would. This course is a great intermediate introduction to physics, and even if a student has taken physics in high school, this course teaches the material much more in-depth and challenges the student to apply the material in out-of-the-box ways. In addition, the wide range of topics covered gives a good insight into what physics can be about.",
                "Yes I would. The teacher were good, the ULAs and TFs were brilliant, there were plenty of office hours and help resources, and the material is engaging. Definitely one of the better classes I've had. The material is challenging, and it was hard to absorb the material at the end as it was covered very quickly, but as far as classes go it was well executed.",
                "Not unless you took AP 1-9 or whatever in high school. I didn't have any AP in highschool and all the other kids did so I got sauced by the curve on exams.",
                "Definitely would recommend! Not sure why you would be taking this course in particular unless it's a major requirement or else you really like physics (in which case major it in), but I would definitely recommend this course over PHYS 180 or 260 if you want to really learn the content and be reasonably challenged.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are planning to pursue a physics or astrophysics major, because it will challenge your understanding of physics, but ultimately allow you to develop a stronger problem-solving ability in physics because of that. I also highly recommend going to office hours or the study sessions or even asking a friend if you ever are stuck on a problem, and I also recommend reading the lecture notes the night before each lesson (otherwise you will be lost during lecture). However, if you are only taking physics because of the requirement or you don't want to take a difficult course this semester, I would recommend Physics 180 instead.",
                "The course is very much designed as a follow-up course to AP Physics C and assumes that every student has a very good understanding of the content covered in that class. If you got a 5 in AP Physics C, I highly recommend this course. However, if you did not take AP Physics C (even if you took a comparable-level course such as IB Physics, French Bac Physics, or another international program), it is very difficult to adjust to this course. In that case, I would recommend starting with PHYS 180/181 instead of 200/201.",
                "I would definitely recommend PHYS 200 if you took AP physics c in high school. The course very much uses material covered in the mechanics part as a jumping-off point. If you haven't taken AP physics c, but some other high-level physics class, I would recommend emailing the professor to see whether you covered similar enough material.",
                "Yea its not an insane amount of work.",
                "Yes, it's difficult but it's interesting and you'll learn a lot.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course! I am an MB&B major, so I could have taken 180 instead, but I am incredibly glad I decided to take 200. It is both more interesting and less work than 180, because from what I have heard 180 involves quite a bit of busy work on problem sets. This was absolutely not the case in 200- problem sets were interesting and a reasonable length, and the content (especially the modern physics) is so much more engaging! If you have any interest in physics beyond the bare minimum, I highly recommend this course.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course if you've taken AP Physics or feel you have a strong understanding of physical science. Very useful for physics majors (obviously), but also all other sciences.",
                "Absolutely! This course is very interesting and exposes students to a lot of important concepts at a fundamental level, but it is sufficiently basic so that it is accessible to every student.",
                "Yes. You'll be actually learning how to apply physics and solve interesting problems during lecture, rather than flailing about with the disorganization of 260 or the arbitrary problems of 180.",
                "Yes, if you need to take an intro physics course. I really enjoyed this course, but wouldnt have chosen it as an elective. This is a great course for students with a background in high school physics (Physics C equivalent) who would be bored in 180 but dont need to take 260, which is a lot more rigorous.",
                "I would recommend it to students who are passionate about the physics field, but not those who shy away from theoretical physics.",
                "Yes, as an intro physics course this one was very good and hit a good balance between depth of work and workload. Its even better if you can find a good study group.",
                "Yeah if you want to do physics/a related subject for a major. If youre just looking for a science requirement do something more specialised and interesting. If you can though take 260 - even if its a lot of work and youre on the cusp give it a go",
                "Yes because I learned a lot about the fundamentals of physics and I got a better understanding of the world",
                "I would certainly. I took it because I enjoyed physics and high school and wanted to extend that knowledgewhich it did very well. I also wanted to explore the physics major; PHYS 200, as best as I am able to judge, is an effective window into that (and a required pre-requisite, so you don't have much a choice).",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as it is the first step in the fundamentals of physics course program and is sufficient in covering all the necessary information for potential stem majors while also allowing for deep thought in terms of introducing special and general relativity. The course work is also not too great with a very traditional weekly pset format of work.",
                "To be honest, Id probably recommend PHYS 180, at least for somebody who had my level of experience/interest in physics. The pacing of the course was not overwhelming or anything, but I think a more thorough approach to classical mechanics better suits my interests and those of most students taking introductory physics.",
                "Anyone who wants to learn physics, this is a good class! The way Professor Tipton taught it, you needed very little of multivariable calculus to be able to follow, so I think this class is pretty accessible. I had a pretty scattered and inconsistent physics background from high school but I still could follow the material.",
                "I would definitely, definitely recommend this course to a student who has a background in physics but thinks 260 might be too challenging. The workload isn't too heavy, and the problem sets and peer tutors are all really instructive.",
                "Absolutely, especially for students with some high school physics background. There is new material that you really have to apply yourself to understanding, but the review-side of the curriculum isnt boring at all.",
                "I would recommend taking this intro sequence if you have a strong background in physics but don't necessarily want to take on the challenge of 260/261. I felt that the class improved my understanding of topics I'd seen in AP Physics C while also giving me a foundation in some new material, especially relativity.",
                "Yes, I would and have! I think it really encouraged me to be on top of my game and learn a lot of physics. I liked how it was really challenging while still being possible.",
                "Absolutely! This course offers a comprehensive review of freshman mechanics with a manageable workload that efficiently ensures mastery of the broad range of concepts inherent in this curriculum. Professor Tipton is clear, kind, entertaining, and inspiring.",
                "I would, especially to a student interested in physics or engineering.  I loved this class because the teacher was energetic, fun, and very knowledgeable about what he was teaching.  He was also always willing to answer questions and talk about topics in physics not covered by the course.  The workload was totally manageable and the content was taught well.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who already has somewhat of a physics background. I feel like if I did not have a physics background coming into this course, it would have been a lot more difficult.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who is in a STEM major and needs a physics credit. This course was rigorous and engaging, and some attention is paid to more contemporary areas of research in physics (such as the implications of the special and general theories of relativity). \r\nHowever, I would likely not recommend the class to a student who doesn't need to take a science course and doesn't have a prior interest in physics, as this course is quite rigorous.",
                "If you are interested in physics, then it will be a great course and good introduction. Barely any multivariable calculus so don't let that be a deterrent.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It has a considerable workload, but you learn so much about the essentials of physics and physical problem solving that will definitely be helpful in future physics classes.",
                "Yes! Great for anyone who is interested in deepening their understanding and command for physics. If you just want to get through the requirement, take 180 instead.",
                "Only if you have done really well in AP physics."
