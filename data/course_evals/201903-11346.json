   "comments": [
    "Both professors were better than most science professors I've had at Yale. Their slides and the course were both very well organized to facilitate student learning. I appreciated that the quizzes were every other week, since this is often enough to ensure that I kept up with the work, but not so frequent that the class took time away from being able to keep up with my other classes.",
    "Strengths: the biweekly quiz schedule was really nice, because I would study a lot for every quiz but be able to take a week off in between. The professors are pretty engaging in class and were really approachable to ask questions or set up office hours.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the slides had a lot going on that weren't fully explained in class, so it would be difficult to piece the information together when I was studying for quizzes. I also think that some of Prof. Dellaporta's quizzes were really tricky in terms of wording, even if I studied really hard and knew all the material. Also you never get the quizzes back, so you have to set up office hours with your TA to see them if you care.",
    "Quizzes are too complicated and the lecture material is somewhat hard to follow unless you have previous knowledge about the topic.",
    "The class material is organized well and the quizzes help you keep up with material. However, the quizzes are really hard\/tricky and I don't think they are fair sometimes.",
    "Strengths: biweekly quizzes are much preferred over longer exams. Concepts covered during lectures were very interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: quiz questions were unnecessarily tricky.",
    "This course did not require a lot of outside work. Quizzes every other Tuesday were multiple choice and facilitated understanding, without having formal exams throughout the semester. This was a strength of the course, creating minimal stress but holding students accountable for the material.",
    "Lectures were good. TA sections varied GREATLY - some were much more strict than others. Please standardize...",
    "Some of the lectures by Dellaporta were pretty disorganized. But the content was very interesting. I like the structure of the quizzes and special Tuesdays.",
    "The class is easy and you'll learn a lot. With that being said, some of the quiz questions are just so dumb. On one quiz there was a question with 2 right answers and a question with 0 right answers. There's only 11 questions on each quiz; it's almost impressive to mess up 2 questions on the same quiz. On another quiz, the answer that Professor Dellaporta says is correct directly conflicts with how he taught the material and the answer the textbook says is correct. Despite these annoyances, you drop your lowest quiz and he makes 11 question quizzes out of 10 points, so it's possible to get an 11\/10 on every one. The workload is a joke and there's no midterm, which is nice. Take the class because you'll learn a lot and it's so easy to get an A, but you're going to have to deal with the slight nuisance of some horribly-written quizzes.",
    "Dellaportas lectures are rather disorganized at times. I would find myself taking notes and just getting completely lost in what the main topic even was. It seems at times like the topic of the next slide that pops up is random. I ended up reading the textbook instead of going to class most of the time. Clear outlines and emphasizing important points could make these lectures much better. For an example, see Gendrons lectures. \r\nDellaportas quizzes are also a little silly. He doesnt let TAs see them and provide feedback before sending them out, so sometimes they contain weird stuff.",
    "Strengths are the materials chosen to be presented in the lectures and the special Tuesdays. Having a section after each three classes is great. Because you take the quiz and the rest of the time you learn how to discuss a scientific paper, which gives students enough variation to stay involved in the class.",
    "The first half of this course is extremely disorienting. It feels like lectures were put together without any planning, since there is almost no effort to present concepts in an order that makes logical sense. Additionally, this class offers almost no opportunity for student improvement since we do not get our quizzes back, and the final suddenly switches to short answer type problems. In class lectures do not emphasize problem solving, yet you are expected to self-teach problem solving for various unseen problems in preparation for the final, which seems to test your understanding of genetics, but not the genetics curriculum taught in this class. I also wish there was a greater emphasis on molecular biology, as the Mendelian genetics that took up a majority of the semester felt unnecessarily long and not insightful or informative.",
    "I liked the quiz system and the Special Tuesdays, but I have no idea how we're supposed to learn from our mistakes if we don't get the quiz answer keys. I understand that people tend to argue, which I'm sure is really frustrating, but it's hard to understand what we did wrong if we don't ever get the correct answers or explanations behind them.\r\n\r\n I thought that the course could've been a little more organized\/with more communication. For example, the syllabus gave the chapters we were covering that week, but we would often only cover part of the chapter, so it was unclear what reading we would have to do ahead of time. Also, the review sessions were legitimately terrible except for the very first one because none of the TAs seemed to actually know what we had covered or how to explain it.",
    "The quizzes every two weeks really helped consolidate material while not being as stressful as compared to weekly assessments. The use of recent, real-life examples to illustrate concepts helped place these in context.",
    "Professors Dellaporta and Gendron are both good professors. The set up of the class felt effective because it was easier to categorize knowledge based on the two week modules, and the papers were a good way to study the concepts from class in historical and contemporary examples. I think genetics is an inherently interesting subject, so it wasn't hard to engage with the material. My biggest criticism of the class is what felt like a lack of transparency in how it was ran. Studying for the biweekly quizzes was good practice in comprehending the material, but they also felt like a guessing game of what super specific question would be asked. There was also very little indication of what kind of questions to prepare for on the final. Overall it was a reasonable final exam, but quizzes put us in a mindset of looking for minute details rather than thinking about broader concepts, which the final tested. I don't think this is a huge issue with the class and could be easily solved by more communication and maybe more resources on the part of the professors.",
    "Strengths include organized lectures and discussion sections. Weaknesses include tricky biweekly quizzes.",
    "This class was just fun and engaging overall. I wish that the experimental methods for 1st through 3rd generation sequencing were explained more in depth.",
    "This course was so frustrating. I tried so hard to learn and understand genetics, but the method of biweekly quizzes with NO feedback was absolutely not conducive to learning.",
    "Strengths: very relevant topic, fairly application (opposed to memorization) based, \r\n\r\nwekanesses: disorganized for some of the course",
    "Strengths: Both lecturers, Stephen Dellaporta and Gendron were really engaging and the final was fair as long as you studied what the professors want. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Dellaporta's lecture was a little bit unorganized, while Gendron's was more organized in terms of how well it followed the structure of the textbook. The quizzes were not at all a representation of how well you know the material, but of how well you interpret the question. The quizzes were all 11 multiple choice questions and some of them were worded so weirdly and it felt like I was playing a guessing game half of the time. The worst is that none of the TAs seem to know\/understand the quizzes as well. I think when the professor chooses to hire people to be TAs for this class, they should have a basic knowledge of genetics. There was this one time I got points off for this pedigree problem. It was hard for me, but I assume my TA would understand, but he ended up referring me to this other TA that never got or replied my email. I understand that each TA was assign to grade a specific quiz, but I assume that my TA should have basic knowledge on a Punnett square. Also, when it comes to review sessions, none of the TAs were prepared and they were just reading answers from the textbook. We also get a copy of the solutions on canvas, and we go in hoping that they would be able to address questions outside of what already explained, but none of them were able to. So in conclusion, I don't mind the quizzes being hard, I just hope there to be better TAs and more office hours to help us through the process.",
    "The strength in the course is how the course is structured. The quizzes and the biweekly special Tuesdays. I really liked how the quizzes were not too difficult but made you keep up with the material, which made studying for the final much easier. One way this course could be improved is to provide answers to the quizzes online. It was difficult to find time to arrange and meet with the TAs to look over the quizzes.",
    "The strengths would be the professors, they are both excellent lecturers and very engaging. There aren't many opportunities to get feedback on your learning to help prepare for the final, because the multiple choice quizzes have answers that are all very similar, but because it's an all-or-nothing multiple choice question, then you don't get a great measure on how well you're learning the material and on what areas you should focus on improving.",
    "The course has so much material packed into such a small amount of time that its hard to grasp every concept. Each concept also isnt explained as much as it should be.",
    "I think that this is a well-organized course and that the lectures were presented very well. \r\nI think an improvement can be on the official reviews for quizzes and other assignments besides quizzes and a final that go towards a final grade. I found that I was going to lecture and taking notes, going to review sessions, rewriting notes, reviewing these notes, reading the textbook, and watching videos or finding other sources for difficult concepts, but I still wouldn't be able to do well on quizzes.",
    "More practice questions, final was completely different so hard to know what to expect",
    "Strengths were the Special Tuesday format of the class and lack of homeworks. Having optional homework is great because the problems are there if you want the practice, but not required if you feel confident on the section. I think the grade breakdown was very fair with many opportunities to improve your grade.",
    "This course is awful. 50% of grade is intentionally tricky multiple choice questions. And each question wrong ends up deducting about 1% of final grade. Other 25% of grade is very biased discussion section participation grade, and if you are in the back of the classroom and the TF goes from front to back, you may not even have the chance to participate and automatically get a zero for the day. You do not get your quizzes back to study for the final. There is no study guide for the final. The class has two professors, and they are both very disorganized and bad at explaining the material. I had better luck reading the textbook, which unfortunately swallowed all of my time outside of class due to how poorly these professors teach the class.",
    "strengths: both professors care about the students and the students' learning. lectures are engaging\r\nweaknesses: we never get our quizzes back and we never talk about them in class or see what we got wrong, which i think prevented us from improving and correcting misinformation that we had.",
    "The strengths of the course is that the material is very interesting and relevant to all fields of biology. The weakness of the course is definitely the structure and the first half of the course. Dellporta's lectures, particularly of the first three modules, are really bad, and this makes it really hard to enjoy the class. The class got better in the second half, but it is too late at that point. The quizzes in the first half were also very poorly written (not hard, poorly written). The class just felt sort of silly because of that because it didn't really matter if you went to class and studied, as that wasn't going to help much at all. This class could be greatly improved by a professor change in Dellaporta by maybe letting Gendron run the whole class or someone else. Dellaporta is very nice, but his part of the course was clearly the part students felt less comfortable with.",
    "One strength is that lectures were engaging and clear.",
    "Lectures near the end of the first half were a bit unorganized and confusing. Still, the format of the class was very refreshing and the content was very interesting.",
    "The main problem is the way that the class is structured. For the vast majority of the semester  up until the final exam  we are forced to think in terms of the quizzes. This means no calculations, no statistical tests, no linkage mapping, none of the most important techniques of genetics, which are tested on the final exam but not any of the quizzes. I cannot understand why this is. It makes no sense. If we are learning about recombination mapping and linkage, obviously we should learn about how to do it! In other words, the current structure of the class helps no one. By testing us using multiple choice questions for the vast majority of the semester, we do not learn about the most fundamental, the most essential parts of genetics until the very end. Instead, the quizzes should have 5-6 multiple choice and one short answer question. \r\nThere's also the lectures, which are presented in convoluted and obscure ways. Many of them (especially Professor Dellaporta) have too many slides which convey too little (Professor Gendron is not immune to this either  some of his lectures have 90 slides, many of which just repeat the same thing over and over). This is such an easy fix it astonishes me it hasn't been done already. The lectures must be shaved, the slides tweaked, if we are to really learn and internalize the information. Unfortunately, until that happens, many students will resort to the textbook, unsatisfied with what has been taught in class, hoping that some pirated copy of the textbook will be able to teach them more than two world-class professors.",
    "Strengths: overall, a good course. Professors were engaging and supportive of students' questions and concerns. The quizzes definitely made it easier to study for the final, and the course provided students with a fairly solid foundational understanding of genetics without overwhelming students. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Really wished we could have seen the quiz answers after the grades were in---would have been helpful to study for the final. Also would have appreciated a practice final to prepare.",
    "A weakness would be the wording of the quizzes in the class. At times, I didn't know what the question was asking.",
    "Strengths: Appreciate the 3 class\/1 quiz modules format. The quizzes were okay if you studied sufficiently for them, and section is as engaging as you make it out to be (and as engaging as your TA is). \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the TAs did not seem to have a very strong biology background.",
    "Strengths: it was organized very well because it was taught in modules so you could focus on a specific concept for about three lectures then take a quiz on that concept and then move onto something new.\r\nWeaknesses: very few, maybe that some of the lecture slides are unclear (not common however) and that the papers were sometimes too confusing than their worth",
    "One strength of the course is the variety of scientific articles that students read every other week. One weakness of the course is the review session before every quiz - the quality of these sessions depends on the TA that week (as well as the random times Professor Dellaporta decides to give last year's quiz questions to the TA). Another weakness of the course is the tricky and deliberately difficult questions for each quiz. This could be improved by normalizing what is provided\/taught at each review session as well as making the quiz questions more clear for students to answer them.",
    "The course has an interesting organizational structure with the special Tuesdays. I liked the inclusion of a journal club with the special Tuesdays. The quizzes that make up the majority of the grade in the class were all multiple choice, and I found it frustrating as I didn't feel as though they were really testing everything we had learned in class in an applicable way.",
    "I think this is a very well structured class. Specifically, I like having section every two weeks during a class period.",
    "A strength of this course are the biweekly quizzes. It encourages students to learn throughout the semester instead of cramming everything before the final.",
    "Quizzes were not fun, didn't feel like they were an accurate reflection of material learning. Lectures weren't super helpful for doing well in the class and it was hard to figure out how to \"do well\" until later on in the course.",
    "The strength of this course is the fact that the professors are actually approachable and openly advertise office hours to offer help to students, which I find kind of rare for professors of large lectures. Prof Dellaporta's final study guide was helpful, actually. The weakness of this course is the teaching quality and the organization. The slides from the first half need revamping. The words on the slides are fragmented and their connection to the figures is often unclear. Explanations need major overhaul. Maybe type up an outline or a script before class. The textbook explains much better than the profs and the slides combined. The second half felt like I was in middle school again. While I applaud Prof Gendron for being unique and TRYING to make the content enjoyable, I personally despised this because it was accompanied by oversimplifications and lack of explanations for new concepts. Prof Gendron tends to spend 60% of the lecture time explaining simple things that we already learned in the BIOL sequence and in high school and spends 40% of the lecture explaining the new concepts that we actually haven't learned yet. I'm sorry but I don't need you to spend 50 minutes of the lecture explaining what base pairing is, what HDACs or methyltransferases do. These can be explained quickly\/easily without 30 lecture slides. We have already been presented with this information several times before in BIOL 101-104 and in high school biology. What I do need is more explanation on imprinting, and explaining the more complex details of epigenetics, calculating disease risk, inbreeding pedigrees, chi square tests. From what I recall, we had a whole question on imprinting on the final, and we spent little time on that compared to other topics in the epigenetics lecture. The quizzes aren't for everybody and emphasize memorization rather than problem solving. They create quiz questions that are so tricky that they end up compromising the integrity of the entire question. I don't think this class tests what you have learned, more about how you can adjust to this kind of assessment style. Participation evaluation is subjective. There were no guidelines presented to me at the beginning of the course, and I don't even know how I got the participation grade I did despite my showing up in EVERY section and speaking up, raising my hand actively, in EVERY section. There is no transparency here. Also, we aren't allowed to see our quizzes. If they really want us to learn genetics would it not be beneficial for us to view the quiz to learn from our mistakes? Is it the students' fault that they are limited by creativity in designing quiz questions? It's almost as if they don't want to learn from our own mistakes. We are here to learn genetics, not how to take quizzes. There must be a better way to structure this course. I guess the only good thing about the quizzes is that they keep you on top of the material as the semester progresses. Also the final was very horribly designed. I was not surprised by the short answer format because I expected it beforehand and had practiced for it, but the wording of the questions on the final was absolutely horrendous. Just look at how many people were getting up to ask questions. They need to learn from the other MCDB cores how to design a fair exam. One of the questions needed you to make an assumption about what it was asking rather than having this being explicitly stated in the text. In addition, the point values of the questions need to be increased. There was no room for partial credit given the way they assigned point values. They want to take our performance on the final as a reflection of their teaching? Well, a 76% mean on the final doesn't look so good does it? I cannot believe that this course has been taught for SO long, and yet there is still so much room for improvement in terms of teaching quality, organization, and providing proper feedback for student learning. This course can be so much better.",
    "Strengths: the format (biweekly quizzes, participation, final) is really manageable. For the most part lectures were well taught and engaging. It seems like your experience in section\/'Special Tuesday' really varies by TA but I really enjoyed section after the quizzes. \r\nWeaknesses: some of Prof. Dellaporta's lectures got confusing (especially mapping).",
    "The strengths of this course are that there are biweekly quizzes that help you further understand the information and practice throughout the semester. Another strength is that the professors are very interesting and make the class very interactive and engaging. The weaknesses of this course are that the quizzes are 50% of the grade. This is a large portion of the final grade to base on 11 multiple choice question quizzes. Also, it way that participation was graded was a little unfair. It was very difficult to get full participation points if you were shy and nervous about discussing scientific papers. Another weakness is that the final has a completely different format than the quizzes.",
    "Strengths: Engaging lecturers! Best MCDB professors I've had (Prof. Gendron especially). This class was my favorite STEM class at Yale so far. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Yes, the quizzes were difficult, especially the first quiz of each respective professor that you'll take, but you can definitely pass them. A lot of it, like most classes, is ensuring you know details because sometimes subtle details will pop up on the quizzes. Another thing is that I have absolutely no clue how this class is curved. Like at all. Apparently they depend on the class average, which is difficult to gauge since on Canvas only your section averages appear for quizzes so you have no clue how well (or poorly) you are doing.",
    "I liked how Special Tuesdays helped us keep up with the material, but I think it's detrimental to make the quizzes tricky on purpose.",
    "The Special Tuesday sections were amazing at improving information retention and making sure that students remembered how to read and analyze scientific papers. The quizzes were pretty well matched to the actual course content. The final was more advanced than the quizzes, so we had to suddenly prepare for a very different style of exam. This could be addressed by using more problem-solving questions on the quizzes or during the lecture throughout the semester to get students used to the final exam's problems. However, the professors had been assigning those kinds of problems as optional homework throughout the semester, so it wasn't too much of an issue. The lectures were fun and information was gone over enough that it made sense. The peer tutor was fantastic. Overall a wonderfully informative and enjoyable class!",
    "The Special Tuesdays group sessions were very helpful, and the class structure as a whole was extremely efficient for learning.",
    "Strengths: subject material, professors, grading style (50% weekly quizzes, 25% final, 25% section participation and attendance), low workload, modular format (every other Tuesday is a section instead of a lecture, professors passion for material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some lectures (especially before section Tuesdays) were rushed \/ included too much material, format of the final was short answer while all quizzes were multiple choice, recommended problem sets should be awarded for completion given they did not take very long, required scientific paper readings were not very helpful to understanding the lecture material",
    "The course was taught really well with the slides being very useful in helping reinforcing the information. The quizzes every two weeks also helped keep me on top of studying the material or otherwise I would not have until the final. Have better feedback on the quizzes would have been nice as the quizzes were never given back.",
    "The strengths were the special Tuesdays quizzes. I know that a lot of people dreaded it but I really looked forward to them as they kept me on my toes in terms of studying and honestly were kind of fun to fill out. Never before have I spent so much attention to wording. I wish we got the quizzes back though, or went over answers after the quiz.",
    "This course was structured very well to facilitate student engagement and learning. Having no-weekly quizzes was a good way to encourage keeping up with the material, and papers from discussion sections reinforced topics discussed in lecture. The lectures were also very engaging and well-organized. That said, I wish we received more feedback on the quizzes and went over them in a more structured way.",
    "We weren't allowed to view our ridiculously difficult weekly quizzes after taking them, so we never knew what we got wrong and what we needed to study.",
    "A strength of this course is that I feel like I am coming away from it having a much better understanding of an important topic. The theory did not feel too abstracted from what could be useful to me as someone studying public health and ecology. Also, there were lots of opportunities to appreciate just how friggin' awesome genetics is. I loved the videos Professor Gendron included of things like non-homologous double strand repair. It's crazy that these complex and elegant processes are happening all the time! I also liked the way things were formatted with the quizzes, as this provided a strong motivation to stay on top of the material. \r\nA weakness of this course is, as I think is inherent in all lectures, it was difficult to focus for an hour and fifteen minutes. Perhaps the integration of something like PollEverywhere to break things up would be helpful?\r\nAlso, I felt like discussion sections often had an unnecessarily stressful and competitive vibe. I did not feel comfortable asking questions regarding things on which I was unclear (unless it was impressive that I had realized something was unclear), and I felt like I needed to structure my participation in a way that made me look as knowledgable as possible.",

    "I would highly recommend this course. It wasn't overly time consuming like some STEM courses, yet at the same time I felt like I learned a lot and that I will still remember what I've learned a year from now (which isn't the case with most STEM courses).",
    "Yes, I think that in general this was a good introduction to the field of genetics and I think that I learned a lot by the end of the semester. You have to keep up with the material for the biweekly quizzes and make sure you participate in discussion section because that is also a large part of your grade.",
    "The class was not as enriching of an experienced as I had hoped. I did not receive feedback on my work unless I went out of my way to find it, and studying for the bi-weekly quizzes was difficult in that the lectures are long and not very explicit, and the questions themselves are difficult to understand at times.",
    "Yeah if you are interested in it or if it is required. The second half of the course is a lot more fun than the first half.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if it fulfills a requirement for their major, and\/or if they are interested in learning about genetics.",
    "Yes, any premed students should take this class. Even if it is not regarded as 'easy' as reproductive bio or another class that fulfills premed requirements, the topic is fundamental.",
    "Took it for fun. Take it if you are interested about genetics but not worried about grades.",
    "Yes! I thought this was a pretty good class. Both professors were very passionate about the material.",
    "Yes, it's an easy A and you'll learn a lot. Tough it out through Professor Dellaporta's quizzes, take the A, and move on with your life.",
    "Its a good class. The challenge for me was that I didnt find the content that advanced. It seemed to focus more on a really solid understanding of some simple principles than interesting new stuff. I can list the types of dna repair for you, but I dont know what modern genetic researchers really do.",
    "Yes! You learn a lot about basic genetic concepts on an intermediate level.",
    "Yes! Both Dellaporta and Gendron are lovely professors who are clearly think that genetics is the coolest thing ever. Quizzes were tricky at times but I still thought they were fair. Pretty low stress, manageable workload, well taught. Take it!",
    "Youre obviously in the MCDB major if youre taking this class. Its interesting at times, but you really dont learn that much. The class is not well organized to facilitate student learning, but that is offset by the fact that the concepts are simple enough that this is usually not a huge problem.",
    "Not really",
    "Yes! Professors are great and are available to answer questions. A very helpful introduction to molecular genetics.",
    "Yes, I think this is an interesting elective and well taught.",
    "Yes, the course material was very interesting and the professors were engaging.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to anyone of any major who is interested in life or science.",
    "Maybe. If self-motivated and willing to deal with frustration",
    "Yes, this is a good course to take for anyone hoping to gain a better understanding of genetics for a future career, or as an MCDB core course. Overall, I feel that I learned a lot and the course was enjoyable. The material can be a bit dry but is quite relevant given the importance of genetics in any sub-field of biology. The first half with Prof. Dellaporta is pretty poorly organized and can be quite confusing at times, however. The second half with Prof. Gendron is very clear and well organized, and professor Gendron is a fantastic teacher. He totally goes out of his way to keep the class fun and to help students, which is awesome. \r\n\r\nThe course is graded as 50% quizzes (every other week, pretty memorization heavy), 25% during-class section participation, and 25% the final. The sections are every other Tuessay during class and are just the quiz and a paper discussion. The quizzes are tricky but always have an extra credit point. The final is totally calculation and application based, which was different than most work during the semester (so make sure to get extra help or do practice problems) but was really great in that it was NOT memorization heavy, unlike many biology tests. \r\n\r\nThe workload is quite light: studying for a quiz and reading a paper every other week, and studying for the final is all you have to do. Overall a good course with important concepts and a very manageable workload.",
    "The material is very interesting, so I would recommend, but be ready for A LOT of independent learning and studying.",
    "Yes, it's a pretty great and not too demanding course! The professors are really nice and engaging during lectures. Sometimes the material is a bit dry, but the professors really try and make the material engaging and the course accessible to everyone.",
    "I would just because the material was really interesting, but from a this course was well organized and I learned a lot fully, like fully understanding concepts, I dont know if Id recommend it.",
    "Yes, this was a solid MCDB core class and honestly an essential one for anyone wishing to further pursue medicine. No homework is great, biweekly quizzes are also nice. I did not learn a ton outside of population genetics, but that's mostly a feature with overlap with other classes.",
    "NO. This course is awful. 50% of grade is intentionally tricky multiple choice questions. And each question wrong ends up deducting about 1% of final grade. Other 25% of grade is very biased discussion section participation grade, and if you are in the back of the classroom and the TF goes from front to back, you may not even have the chance to participate and automatically get a zero for the day. You do not get your quizzes back to study for the final. There is no study guide for the final. The class has two professors, and they are both very disorganized and bad at explaining the material. I had better luck reading the textbook, which unfortunately swallowed all of my time outside of class due to how poorly these professors teach the class. Additionally, he refuses to give you back your grade for quizzes and discussion participation until AFTER the final exam, meaning you will not know whether it is in your best interest to drop the class or not.",
    "Yes I would say take this class, its not too hard. the quizzes can be annoying but its a good class with interesting material and good professors.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to anyone unless it is required for them to graduate. The class is very poorly taught in the first half, which makes it really hard to learn the basics and stay interested in the material. If Dellaporta is not teaching, maybe take this course, otherwise I would avoid it. The class is on a curve and many cutthroat junior and senior pre-meds take this course, making the environment bad. The quizzes are very poorly written and don't really reflect what you know or learned. I would say that the material isn't impossibly hard, but it's annoying in this context because, if the class was taught better, then the material would be much more interesting and students would know it better. I ended up not performing that poorly in the course because the second half with Gendron is more organized, but, since the first part was bad, I Credit\/D-ed the class and didn't really care much after that. However, the whole class felt like a waste of a credit overall, and I wish I wouldn't have taken it. In context of the other MCDB cores, it's probably not the worst of them, but that's not saying much.",
    "Yes, the course gives a great introduction to an important field in biology. It also helps develop critical thinking strategies to approach these issues more effectively.",
    "No, don't take this class.",
    "Yes---probably one of the better core MCDB courses, given what I've taken so far and from what I've heard from other people. The professors are really flexible in terms of asking questions and scheduling office hours, so I never felt as though I didn't have an outlet for any concerns I had about the material. There are definitely some really interesting and thoughtful concepts taught in the course, but I wouldn't say that every lecture was a winner (though that probably applies to every class in college).",
    "Yes, this was a fun course and I learned so much. The instructors are also very friendly!",
    "If you're going for a core MCDB course, this isn't a bad choice. Might be one of your best choices out of the 5, actually.",
    "I would totally recommend this course to another student. Its my favorite biology class Ive taken at Yale so far. I really appreciated having both Dellaporta and Gendron as professors. They provide different perspectives on genetics. The biweekly quizzes keep you on top of the material - theyre pretty detailed and to do well you really need to know what youre learning. While at times this could be frustrating, I do really think it made me actually learn the material. The final was very fair and, when taking it, I felt confident that I had learned a lot. In summary, if you are looking for an MCDB core, take this one!",
    "Yes, this has been my favorite science course I have taken so far (5 semesters in and pre-med). Both professors are great and they made learning about genetics pretty fun. Quizzes do require a good chunk of time the weekend beforehand to study and they aren't easy. It's really great that rather than having a separate section, they replace the Tuesday lecture every other week with section.",
    "As a student majoring in MCDB, I would recommend this course to another student. I feel like this is one of the easier MCDB core courses in terms of memorization. The course material is pretty similar to BIO103 (especially the developmental genetics part), but goes more into depth with mechanisms, specifics, and calculations. The teaching styles of Dellaporta and Gendron are completely opposite: Dellaport is more straightforward with his slides, and he really isn't engaging while Gendron thrives off of participation and throwing goodies into the classroom. The multiple-choice quizzes are difficult by choice (and also the wording), and the free-response final is pretty straightforward (except for a couple fo Gendron's questions).",
    "It is a good MCDB core course to take, but I would not recommend it to a student outside the major.",
    "Yes!",
    "Genetics was a wonderful course and you learn a lot throughout the semester.  Although the quizzes were challenging, I would recommend the course to another student as it was worth it. If you study hard then the quizzes are easy.",
    "I think this core needs a lot of improvement. It's another one of those classes where you just have to learn how things work and work with the system. It's not really about understanding. Rather, it's about whether you can decipher the quizzes and the final. Despite the horrors of this course, I think it is one of the better MCDB cores out there. I mean, you already know how MCDB classes are, and I think this is one of the less painful ones. The workload is pretty low, you just need to learn how to ace the quizzes and memorize every word on every page of the slides. The textbook explains the content much better than the professors. I recommend going to class, making note of what is covered in lecture, then go home and refer to the textbook for better understanding. You will be bound to get confused in lecture, especially in the first half because explanations and slides are SO bad. Make sure to participate in every way you can during section and volunteer yourself to present the introduction because the participation grading is not transparent at all even if you do meet the requirements for 100% participation. You already know what to expect for MCDB courses. Good luck...",
    "Take this if you're at all interested in genetics; it's generally a well-taught course and very manageable. Instead of section, every other Tuesday you have a 'Special Tuesday' where instead of lecture you basically have section\/the quiz, and it was so nice not having section outside of regular class time. FYI though, the quizzes are sometimes harder than you'd think.",
    "I would recommend this course because the professors are great! They made sure to make each class interesting and engaging. It didn't seem like they were out to get you or treating this class like a weed-out course. If you had any questions, the professors were more than happy to help you and they genuinely wanted you to succeed!",
    "Yes! I absolutely recommend it. Best MCDB (and STEM) course that I've taken so far at Yale.",
    "Yes! If you're interested in genetics it's obviously a must, but I think any MCDB students would like this as an elective. The professors really care about you.",
    "Yes, this course was a fantastic core biology course comprised of both fascinating material and great teaching.",
    "Yes, genetics is a very necessary subject in all biological (even social) disciplines. Even if you aren't pre-vet\/MCDB and it's a pre-req, genetics is a well structured class that teaches you a lot without being overwhelming. Just beware of some lectures that are rushed and material piling up for the short-answer final",
    "I would recommend this class because genetics is a useful way to understand how life on earth exists and continues to exist. That being said, being interested in the material does help as a lot of the course is memorization.",
    "Yes, this is a great intermediate biology course. Dellaporta and Gendron are awesome and you really learn a lot, but you're not inundated with information. Very manageable workload.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It was well organized, well taught, and the material was really interesting. Very engaging MCDB core course!",
    "This was probably one of the better MCDB core courses I've taken. If you can get through Dellaporta, Gendron is worth it.",
    "Yes! I greatly enjoyed it and I feel like genetics is going to shape the future, so we should all learn about it.",
    "Good",
    "I would recommend this course, but maybe not as highly as people recommended it to me--the class overall is strong and the topics are interesting, but I did not have a particularly strong interest in genetics and so getting interested during Dellaporta's lectures was difficult for me. Dellaporta also has a teaching style that I did not click with--his slides don't have much information and he assumes a lot of knowledge when he should not. He also does not teach ways to apply information, and he is not clear about what you need to know (so when you get to his quizzes sometimes it's overwhelming). I enjoyed Gendron much more, partially because of his teaching style (which in my opinion was more thorough and clear) and partially because the topics he taught were way more interesting to me (developmental genetics stuff). His quizzes were way more straightforward and I think that was clear in the quiz average increase when we got to Gendron's lectures.\r\n\r\nOverall, the course is strong and it won't be a train wreck (all in all most people do pretty well on things), but I think that some people recommend it so highly and are so confused when you want to take something else. I would beware of taking this class just because everyone takes it--make sure you at least already like genetics or are willing to develop a real interest in genetics otherwise you might find yourself dragging your feet. \r\n\r\nA PS is that taking genetics with lab (or having a friend who is doing so) gives you such a leg up that I wish they would say that before you commit to the class. I say this because a lot of the pen-and-paper techniques that the class mentions are things that the genetics lab actually practices and uses to get data, and when you have to do those things on the exam it pays to have experience outside of class because neither the textbook nor the lectures cover it well (eg. log of odds, chi squared tests, recombination tests, etc.)"
