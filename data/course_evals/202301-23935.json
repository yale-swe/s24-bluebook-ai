                "A great overview of fantastic directors, developing an amazing toolkit for use in my own directing projects!",
                "I learned specific techniques that important directors in film history employed to attain certain cinematic effects. These included techniques employed in editing, on set, and in pre-production with actors, as well as certain life philosophies that bled into artistic pursuits.",
                "I improved my filming and editing skills, learned how to assess the techniques of different directors and how they impacted their films",

                "A lot of knowledge about how various director's do their craft, which is exactly what I wanted going into this course.",
                "I really got a sense of the method of how to direct, getting insights on different ways famous directors approach filmmaking and getting hands on experience in writing, directing, editing, and shooting my films."

                "Strengths very hands on. You really get better by making a film every other week. Also learning the different styles   help develop your toolkit.",
                "It was epic. My favorite course at Yale so far. Cant think of a disadvantage apart from the workload. Yet, readings and assignments are utterly fascinating if you are into filmmaking.",
                "Prof Carey is an incredible support, and is very knowledgeable in her field. The discussions in class are really interesting, especially if you do the reading. However, you can totally get by only doing the reading every few weeks or so it's not a massive courseload as long as you're comfortable cracking out a short video project every two weeks. The grading is also very kind!",
                "Strengths: The structure of the class was super effective. I really appreciated taking a week to focus on each director, and I thought the readings/interviews were highly engaging, informative, and inspiring. I appreciated the class discussions, and felt like I learned a lot from both the professor and my classmates. Time passed quickly despite the class being an hour and 50 minutes.\r\nCan't think of any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths interesting and well-chosen reading, engaging classes (a combination of discussion, screening excerpts from films and student exercises). I felt like I had a good foundation in understanding the different methods directors used a vocabulary or frame in which to think and talk about film directing. I feel like I acquired a valuable and consolidated set of skills (even if I might not use them often in the future) by the end of this course, which is not always something I can say about other course experiences.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses not many at all. None that I can coherently articulate.",
                "The strengths are the short exercises and the readings; weaknesses -- I see none!",
                "I really enjoy the format of making a film every two weeks and reading about filmmakers; every reading was super interesting and I felt like the course had good pacing.  Likewise, the discussions were always fun and informative.  I do sometimes wish we got more time to discuss each filmmaker in each section; often, we talked about them for half an hour or so and then proceeded to watch clips of them, which sometimes felt like we did not get to discuss their approach as in depth as maybe we could have.  But that's really only a nitpick; overall, the class is very strong."

                "I would recommend this class to first-year film students. As a senior, there was very little new information for me, besides learning about director's styles. However, the younger students in the class seemed to enjoy it thoroughly.",
                "Yes if you want to make some films and gain a better understanding if directing.",
                "Yes! It was a great opportunity to learn about the technical rather than aesthetic side of directing",
                "Yes! If you are passionate about filmmaking, youll definitely enjoy this class! Yet you really have to love it because it is a lot of work.",
                "Absolutely! This course is an amazing one to take if you're interested in filmmaking, and would be super fun even if you're not!",
                "I definitely would recommend this course to students who are eager to \"do the thing\". A lot of arts classes focused mainly on analysis and history of the art, can make one anxious to get outside of all the intellectualizing of the subject, and actually experience it for themselves. This class does exactly that!",
                "Yes! The class itself was very interesting and Prof. Carey is a great person to learn from. Even though class was on Wednesday nights, it was always one of the highlights of my week",
                "Most certainly, provided you have an interest in film. The things you learn here are not very exportable to other disciplines, but they're tremendously interesting and valuable if you're considering working in film.",
                "Yes, absolutely. This is one of my favorite courses that I've taken at Yale for film -- I think it really helped me hone my own directorial/artistic style.",
                "Yes, absolutely!  If you are interested in making film or want to take a creative filmmaking class, as long as you are aware it is a good amount of work, this is absolutely worth taking."
