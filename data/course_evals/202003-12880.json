                "This class is fantastic at introducing students to L-3 Spanish. The use of Supersite, the textbook, speaking in class, and documents was amazing and engaging. I would most certainly recommend this class.",
                "Strengths: Reymundi was awesome, definitely explained some tough concepts pretty well. Conversations with peers was definitely one of the higher points of the course, allowing to practice speaking but also getting to know classmates. Homeworks and quizzes weren't terrible, and the exams and writing assignments weren't too bad either. If you set aside a decent amount of time after class to dedicate to improving Spanish with what was learned in class, this class definitely helped with that. Weaknesses: Felt like there was an over reliance on the site used for some practice problems. The book assigned for the class was also sped through very quickly without a lot of time to really enjoy it. Something that could be improved is more oral activities as well as more practice problems specifically geared to the concepts taught in the class itself.",
                "I think it might be helpful to focus on speaking more often. I felt a bit underprepared for my oral exam.",
                "I appreciated the daily tasks, which helped me practice this language even on days without class. A weakness, though, was that some tasks just seemed like busywork that didnt really help me understand the language better.",
                "Strength: Professor Reymundi herself makes the course 1000 times better. She is so understanding, kind, and patient with her students. Weakness: I think the online platform is the weakness in the fact that I love speaking and getting to know all my classmates individually but it was hard to do so given that the class times were so short. But Professor Reymundi did try to facilitate that by putting us into breakout rooms.",
                "This class was very well-structured, giving much opportunity for daily Spanish practice and improvement. After the first wave of quizzes\/exams, students know what to expect for the rest of the semester; there aren't many surprises which makes the workload more manageable."

                "Having students engage in the online platform was a success, since we were often put into breakout rooms to discuss and speak in Spanish together. One thing that could be improved, however, was a clarity on what assignments were due and what we had to prepare for the next class. I was often confused if assignments were in my canvas section or on the umbrella section.",
                "Adapting the previous daily classes to the three synchronous and two asynchronous classes per week was very helpful in managing the workload associated with this course. Additionally, retaining small class sizes was integral to comfortable language learning. There are no practices that were particularly unsuccessful in this course."
