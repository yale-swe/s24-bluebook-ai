The final (group) project was a good opportunity to explore a more recent immunoengineering application by presenting a paper (journal club style)."

                "strengths: engaging content, passionate and very helpful professor\r\nweaknesses: a more structured syllabus + lectures would have made it easier to keep track of everything",
                "Strengths is the flexibility of Professor Fahmy. Homework assignments were few and the final project was not a huge time commitment. Additionally, the exams were take home exams which alleviated stress associated with them. However, I thought the course was kind of unorganized in that each lesson was something new and didn't really tie up ends from the previous class. I think we could've learned more about each topic but I left confused some classes and my notes were not very organized since the lecture slides were posted very late and didn't always make much sense. I think this course would benefit from greater organization.",
                "Strengths: Having the web open as a resource during homework or take home exams is a great idea, I learned a lot while doing them. Weaknesses: Slides were unreliable posted, specifically towards the end of the semester. That wouldve been nice to",
                "I loved that the course was based on learning material, rather than regurgitating memorized facts on psets or exams. This was one of the classes I learned the most in this semester, as we were encouraged to think critically about material presented to solve problems.",
                "The portion of the class which covers an overview of the immune system felt a bit belabored, and didn't really go into as much detail as one would expect for the amount of time that was allocated, with the same information often being repeated many times. I think the portion of the class that covered applications was stronger and felt more interesting, but not as much time was spent on it.",

                "Yes, only if required though. I think it is an interesting course but a better professor would help you to learn more if you are genuinely just interested in learning about Immunoengineering.",
                "If youre interested in the human body, yeah. The detail of the immune system is crazy.",
                "Yes. Professor is clearly passionate ab what he teaches and is readily available to aid students. Very interesting content.",
                "Yes, I will. For students who seek knowledge in immunology, this is a nice introductory course.",
                "Yes, it was very interesting and I learned a ton about the inner workings of the immune system. There were many novel ideas presented in lecture as well that are current areas of study, which were fascinating to learn about.",
                "yes, it was incredibly interesting and challenging",
                "I would recommend this course to students looking for a low workload biomedical engineering electives or students who have prior knowledge with immunoengineering. I would not reccomend this course to anyone outside of the major, or anyone looking to gain a comprehensive background in immunoengineering."
