                "Unfortunately, this is a large lecture class, so it is tough to stay engaged with the course and the material.",
                "Strength: very detailed and helpful course. Professor and Tas are kind and nice.",
                "I think that we could have had more examples in class and have Professor Wu go over the things that seemed \"intuitive\" to him. The only benefit was that one of the TA's Jacques Morris was particularly helpful with Psets and helping me understand concepts during his office hours. Without his help, I don't know if I could have completed this class.",
                "It would be better if we have more practice problems.",
                "I barely went to lectures. If possible the lecture should be held at some point after 10pm, at least, for such a large class. Also I think there could be better class notes available. I also think that it would be a lot easier to cope with the class if extensions were allowed, maybe with a rule of having to request it at least 24 hours before the deadline. It can be tough to have no flexibility with pset deadlines and get an immediate zero for a missing assignment. Another way to make it more manageable is to allow late submissions with a penalty. I think this is important for people to stay in the class and not feel overwhelmed with it alongside other classes, especially since its a major requirement for so many people. I also think these rules are more important than having the option to drop a pset over the semester.",
                "strengths: This course successfully incorporated statistics knowledge with real-life examples, which is pretty impressive. Every lecture is well organized.\r\nweaknesses: none.",
                "Although the material on the surface sounds interesting, it was oftentimes difficult to take in information during lecture (due to the combination of 9am and boring slides). The second half of the course is also covered at a breakneck speed, be prepared for work to ramp us as the semester goes on",
                "This is a really tough class, TAs were often unhelpful, and problem sets are far more difficult than they should/need to be. A professor who moves through the content more slowly and more deliberately would be great. It often felt like Yihong was way too smart to teach this class and had no idea why students couldn't quickly grasp topics that seemed intuitive to him. Students with backgrounds in competition math have a big leg up here.\r\n\r\nAlso, brush up on your calculus for the second half of the course.",
                "The lectures are recorded and there are a lot of office hours which is nice. Sometimes it felt like it took a long time for us to get grades/feedback on homework which was unfortunate since that was really our only source of feedback during the semester.",
                "this course is great, but final exam is too hard",
                "There were many learning resources available and a lot of office hour to help us understanding the course materials better. The HW were very challenging and inspiring. But the HW solutions were often too short to understand. Many of the questions are super tricky so I would hope that more well explained hw solutions could be provided in future. That would be super helpful! Math is fun but I gotta say that the exams were not that fun and brutal. :(",

                "The ULAs were incredibly helpful for the psets. The lectures were clear, but not particularly engaging. A lot of time in lecture was spent deriving formulas and proving propositions, and not enough time was spent applying these concepts to the type of problems we saw on our problem sets.",
                "Strengths: very interesting and challenging material. Lecture notes are very well-written and organized\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Could provide additional practice problems, which would help with exams",
                "Strengths: psets are very structured and lecture notes are very specific. The exam material is based on the two and is extremely fair. I also love Yihong's lecture style, and he's very nice in person. Weaknesses: can't think of any!",
                "It is very good at helping students learn through psets, but the lectures could be more engaging.",
                "I think some mathematical proofs have gone through a bit fast.",
                "Strengths: interesting material, good book, decent problem sets, Jacques Morris was a great/extremely helpful ULA; Weaknesses: not taught in the most engaging way, results in class seem unmotivated",
                "Strengths: The course was organized very well, with the problem sets graded promptly. We covered a lot of material, proved every result, and had good practice with the problem sets. Weaknesses: The grading for this class often felt arbitrary and overly-harsh, unforgiving of any typo or abbreviation of computational work. Also, I did not feel as though the final exam was a representative sample of what we learned in the course.",
                "Well taught, but fast-paced at times. The textbook is really really good and helpful in bolstering the course material.",

                "The ULAs were definitely a strength - they greatly helped with psets and with understanding the material. Professor Wu tends to go fast during the lectures (glancing at calculations and saying that certain concepts are obvious/trivial) so if he could talk through examples and concepts a bit more then that would be very helpful. The graders for this class, like with other classes, were unable to grade psets on a decent timeline so when we were doing pset 9, we didn't have feedback for any psets after pset 6.",
                "The lectures were well organized. I hope the homework and exam questions could be more related to the way concepts were introduced in the lectures. It seems to hard for me to relate those problems to concepts we learned in class.",
                "could use blackboard",
                "This course is challenging, and it would be better if we will have more practice problems.",
                "Strengths: This class was very well organized and clearly explained. The slides were beautifully done. Weaknesses: The slides were so beautifully done when compared to the lecturing that ~80% of students did not bother showing up to class! Professor Wu, while a technically satisfactory explainer, is one of the least inspiring professors that I have had at Yale. This might not be a fair comparison because almost all of the math professors that I have had here have been out of this world, but any non-calc intro sequence in the math department will be taught with more spirit than will this class. The course was also an odd mix of high school level concepts and proof based grading. This resulted in extremely easy questions on which I would miss points because of arithmetic steps that I would skip (literally I would subtract fractions from each other between lines and be docked points for not doing this more explicitly).",
                "The professor explained all conceptions clearly and briefly. However, several topics at the end of term is a little bit hard for me to master.",
                "I think that the problem sets were great. They were doable after going to lecture, but they stretch your understanding and are a learning experience. I think that in general the lectures were helpful. A bit dry, but often the examples were incredibly engaging.",
                "Examples are easy to understand",
                "I thought the course was well organized and well taught. I wish there were discussion sections",
                "I enjoyed that the lecture was recorded. I thought this was especially helpful because sometimes I wanted to review the lecture material on my own time. I thought the TA's were amazing. There were plentiful hours and they were always so helpful. The lecture slides are really amazing. I think the 9 AM time slot is always tough, especially towards the end of the semester.",

                "Id say that the material could be much more interesting than it is as presented.",
                "Strengths: awesome textbook, lectures were pretty good\r\nWeaknesses: final was very hard relative to psets - psets should be more representative, material in last 2 weeks was very important and should have been covered in a longer time",
                "Went by fast at some points",
                "The slides were an incredible resource and Wu was an excellent lecturer.",
                "Yihong is a pretty good lecturer and the material was presented pretty clearly. That said, it was basically just a standard lecture with weekly psets so it wasn't all that engaging.",
                "The class is taught highly systematically, such that it's very easy to follow the logical flow from concept to concept--great for grounding the theory of probability.",
                "Although the lecture slides are very informative and helpful for studying, the actual lectures were quite dry.",
                "Pretty good course all around, accomplishes what it sets out to do.",
                "Pretty solid course! Strengths: very clear lecture notes, recordings posted after lectures, clear textbook, plentiful office hours \r\nWould've liked faster grading/posting of answers after pset deadlines so we could see how to improve as the course progressed",

                "Lectures were often very difficult to follow along, and required re watches. Professor Wu has a tendency to dive into proofs and derivations for equations, which although interesting sometimes are often not useful or necessary for PSETs and exams. Would be helpful if he could make a distinction between subject areas that are important in application and those that are just optional theory.",

                "The psets, lecture slides and exam problems are completely different entities - always leaving the student with a dilemma on which resource to use for practice; lectures are unhelpful and the grading criteria are not mentioned well either on the course website.",
                "S  Abundance of office hours available, highly structured, grades came back at a reliable pace, manageable workload with some challenging problems, fantastic course to explore stats from a math major's perspective. The availability of past exams to take for practice was great. The classes being live and also recorded was a huge plus\r\n\r\nW  Not a weakness per se, but watch out for a couple problems per exam that require mathematical creativity to solve.",
                "The strength of this course is the content. The material covered is immense, and we engage with it at a nice level of depth for an introductory probability theory course. The weakness is the professor. Yihong is a horrible teacher, his slides are full of arcane derivations which make you confused even if you do understand the concept, he is condescending and impatient in his office hours, and a very unclear lecturer. It is stressful to listen to him explain any difficult concept, because for him it is \"clear\" and \"obvious\". He seems to dislike teaching. Luckily his class adheres almost exactly to the textbook so I stopped going to lectures and spent all my time with the book. When I stopped going to his office hours and went to the ULAs instead, my grades improved.",
                "I thought the course was exactly what it needed to be. Lectures were very clear and taught you everything you needed. There were some surprises on the psets, which I think were meant to introduce a concept not in the lectures, but they ended up feeling more like tricky problems than anything else.",

                "The weekly psets were well designed to test understanding of concepts gone over through lectures without taking too much time which was a strength. However, this class is still primarily an introduction and may be a bit slow paced (mostly in the first semester) for people with experience in doing probability problems in the past.",

So, obviously, I have a different perspective on the class than many others.\r\nI think Prof. Wu's lectures were excellent (clear, and well-structured).\r\n\r\nThe main problem with the class, in my opinion, is that a) it steeply ramps up in difficulty after the first midterm, and b) it doesn't facilitate (from the administrative side) student collaboration to help students handle this increase in difficulty. \r\n\r\nAs someone who hasn't taken many other math classes, I felt like I lacked a student support structure that many others in the class possessed. Moreover, for a while, office hours were only in-person (which, when they are 20 minutes away, strongly dissuades attendance).\r\n\r\nBecause of a long delay in receiving graded PSETs, I didn't realize just how wrong I was on certain concepts pertaining to midterm 1 until after midterm 1.",

                "Yes of course! This class greatly improved my understanding of statistics! Even if you're not a S&DS major or a stem major, it's a very good class to take to understand better how the world works.",
                "Possibly. The course content is definitely interesting and useful at times, but I'm not sure if this class would be the best class for someone looking to gain exposure of S&DS-related areas.",
                "Yes. Very useful course and professor gave us very interesting and organized knowledge structure.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
                "Yes I would - I think the class is important to learn. But the workload is tough and the psets are challenging. It feels hard to get a good grade",
                "Yes. It's a great intro course to stat. And it's also interesting.",
                "If you have a strong math background, go for it. Other 238/240 might be a better option; not much application taught in 241, but this the class for you if you love theory I suppose",
                "If you have to take it. If you're looking for a gentle introduction or to do the SDS certificate, take 240. You'll make your entire semester much more pleasant. If you do take this class, do yourself a favor and take it with smart friends so that you're not struggling alone to complete the way-too-difficult psets.",
                "If you are an SDS or math major (or seriously interested in one of those), sure. It's a good class. However I am not sure I would take it just for the fun of it",
                "yes, this course can give people basic knowledge about statistics",
                "If he's a fan of math, yes. But if not, I probably wouldn't. Math is fun, but this course is very challenging.",
                "I wouldn't recommend it unless they had to take it or already had a great background in probability.",
                "yes, only if you need it for your major. otherwise. NO",
                "If you're interested in an introduction to the basics of probability, the 100-level statistics courses are very useful. Otherwise, if you need this course for a requirement, be sure to make ample use of office hours.",
                "Yes,  it is a great introduction to probability theory, and it strikes a balance between being manageable yet challenging.",
                "Yes. This course is useful for students who are new to statistics.",
                "It's worth looking into 238, but I'd say I enjoyed the challenging semester",
                "Yes, if they are interested in probability.",
                "Personally, this class was difficult for me, especially whilst balancing other classes and understanding the concepts. Get help when you need it, ask for help when you need it, go to office hours, get your questions answered. The workload is super manageable, though, one pset a week, not super much in the beginning, but progressively gets harder.",
                "The course need more time to explore and practice, but definitely it helps to build a steady foundation in the probability theory.",
                "Only if major requirement, e.g. s&ds major, math major, or applied math major",
                "Yes. For anyone who wants to learn the theory behind statistics, this class is a very thorough introduction.",
                "This is a great course that has a lot of applications to many topics in economics, statistics, and math. Be prepared for a fairly rigorous course if with Professor Yihong Wu.",
                "Yes! I think especially if you're a student who's had some background in mathematical proofs, it is a really good class for understanding statistics. I personally never really liked statistics that much because when I took it at high school we were often just given equations we were told were true, and various tables of numbers, and told to work the problems using these things. This course is really interesting and valuable because it goes over why you calculate statistics the way you do.",
                "If you are a math/stats major student, you have to take it, but otherwise, you are torturing yourself.",
                "Yes. Though may have some challenge, one can learn enough statistics knowledge from this course.",
                "I would not. If they want to learn statistics or if they are planning to be a S&DS major, then I would recommend S&DS 238.",
                "YES. It's easy to follow the professor.",
                "Maybe. Depends on how good the math level of the student has.",
                "Yes. The intro to prob theory and applications are thorough.",
                "Yes, is is hard but really important for students who are interested in learning stats.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who is required to take it, someone who has never seen *any* concepts of statistics in his/her life (if you have done any error propagation in any science course ever than this does not apply to you), or a math major with an intense courseload looking for an applied math without the expectation of learning anything interesting or exciting. If you fall into the first category, than my advice is irrelevant, if in the second you are the only type of person who will benefit from this course and you should definitely take it, and if in the third rest assured that this will be a (painfully) easy class that you could take on top of any schedule that you would otherwise survive.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I would! From the perspective of someone who mostly takes CS and Math QRs, for me, it was on the guttier side. The course material is interesting and quite intuitive to understand. Probability theory underlies a lot of STEM fields and has many applications so this will be a useful class to have under your belt. The topics we covered in class. The first half of the semester dealt with discrete probability: introduction to conditional probability, distributions (Binomial, Poisson), PMF, expected value. Next we explored continuous probability: density functions, more distributions, transformations, estimation, covariance, and the Central Limit Theorem. The first half is reminiscent of material from MATH 244 so if you took that, this will make the class easier. This class gets a little calculus heavy towards the end so make sure your derivatives and integrals game is strong there! The PSETs are 5 problems or less each week so they are not too bad. There are 2 midterms: the midterm was on the easier side and then the final was much more challenging but in a fun and doable way. The slides are very thorough and posted so that makes it easy to review and look back at material when you get lost. Moreover, people like to hate on Yihong but he is a great professor! No nonsense kind of guy but very concise and thorough explainer. You might think he is a little fast though if the material does not come intuitively to you.",
                "Yes. Although the course required more in intellectual level, it concluded the important and fundamental part in statistics.",
                "I think that this is a great course. Even if you have done competition math before there is still some formality that is great to learn. The amount of work is fair, and it helps you understand the content better.",
                "Yes. It is fundamental",
                "Yes",
                "If you're an SDS major, you probably will have to/should take this course. But if you're not, I wouldn't recommend because it's not that fun. It's a lot more math than anything else.",
                "Exams are kinda brutal, which is a bit surprising as this class is required for the S&DS major.",
                "Yeah, pretty good introduction to statistics, good foundation!",
                "Yes, take this course if you want an introduction to probability! It was pretty good and not too difficult!",
                "Yes, it sets a good foundation for future classes, and I think it helps develop mathematical intuition. Its a challenge, but worth it if you want to major in S&DS or Applied Math or grad school in an empirical field.",
                "Maybe. If you have to take it for major definitely do it. If you are looking for an interesting math class maybe look elsewhere or at least come in knowing you may get bored.",
                "Yes if they want to learn probability theory.",
                "Yes, it is a challenging class but makes you think in unique ways",
                "Yes, Professor Wu teaches the course exceedingly well.  Lectures are structured very well and can be followed easily--to the point where they can serve as good class notes. Not only does he explain the concept properly, but also motivates them with examples so it feels like you're learning with a purpose.",
                "If you're a s&ds major or something related you have to take it. For someone interested in learning probability tangentially I would recommend other intro courses that have more of a computing aspect, such as s&ds 238 or 230",
                "Yep! Walked away with a pretty good base understanding of probability theory. That being said, it's very possible to get through the class (and do pretty well) without going to lectures",
                "Probability theory is a fundamental that every STEM major should learn about. It is also a prerequisite for many S&DS department courses.",
                "I would. It's a good intro to the field. Useful for life and for future classes.",
                "If you are a S&DS major, then this course is required. If you are not a S&DS major but still want to get a hang of probability, take it.",
                "If they need it for their major yes. But it is still pretty interesting seeing the math behind simple chance and events",
                "Only if you would like a math-based probability course or need it as a major requirement. If not, consider 240 (which is easier but only fulfills for concentration) or 238 (which is not necesssarily easier, but covers a broader range of topics and includes some statistics).",
                "yes, if they are interested in probability",
                "I would recommend this course, as it was a good experience and allowed me to gain a significant amount of knowledge.",
                "Yes. It is a foundation of advanced courses.",
                "I switched my major because of this course",
                "I wouldnt necessarily recommend it unless necessary for a major requirement. Most of the time it didnt feel like the math we were doing had any real world use, which I think takes away from its appeal for most students.",
                "No; you might think of taking this course as a natural prerequisite for 242, but 238 works for that just as well. This course aims to develop practical skills and a good understanding of probability but the abstract, disconnected nature of the problems and the absence of helpful resources to practice them make this course one I wouldnt recommend to anyone.",
                "This course is fantastic if you take it at the right time. I took it my sophomore fall after struggling through math/physics my first year; 241 was a great balance of being easier work than I was used to but also novel and challenging enough to be interesting. If I had taken this course immediately at Yale I could see myself having been overwhelmed, and if I had taken it later on, say just to fulfill a credit for the math major or stats certificate, I might not have found it very stimulating. I would not recommend this course as an exploration of the possibility of majoring in S&DS, it probably won't draw you in like the intro courses in other subjects. However, if you've had time to develop a little mathematical maturity (either at or before Yale) I think this is an awesome course on probability once you get going.",
                "The professor is one of the worst at Yale, but the course content is incredible and well-thought out. The homeworks are good and challenging, and the exams are also well-made. If you survive this course you would have gained an important and very solid foundation in probability theory to build your further statistics expertise on.",
                "I think its a must take for anyone whos even a little interested in probability.",
                "Sure. This is the fundamentals of Statistics and is an important course.",
                "Maybe? The course is hard and challenging.",
                "No don't take this class (unless your major requires it), I struggled so much. Then again, I naturally suck at probability.",
                "Sadly, I think the material is fascinating, but if you did not have probability in your high school classes, you are not given the tools to be successful.",
                "Yes. This is good",
                "yes, good intro course for probability",
                "If you need this class take it. If you don't need this class, take another.",
                "yes",
                "Don't take this class unless you have to. If you have to, then think again.",
                "yes",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. While how much they get out of it is largely dependent on their probability background going in, a lot of material (especially in the second half) is new and interesting for people with a wide range of background without being overhwhelming for people more new to the subject.",
                "definitely. it is the fundamental of statistics and the professor is great.",
                "great, because it covers many basic knowledge",
                "Yes. Because this course can help us to build a solid foundation of probability theory.",
                "Yes. Very useful for students who studying statistics",
                "This course is required for S&DS students like myself, however, I would not have taken it if it were not a major requirement.",
