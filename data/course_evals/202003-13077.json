                "The strengths of this course include the overall high level of engagement and organization by Dr.K, who has experience prior to this semester with teaching ASL online! From day 1, the canvas page for ASL is super clear with the assignments, deadlines, and expectations for every week. I have never seen such high levels of organization from a professor  and it made the world of difference when it came to my personal learning experience. By encouraging a \"flipped-model\" of learning, Dr. K was able to retain a high level of engagement in the course. Every week's learning outside of the classroom was reasonable, and Dr.K was always very helpful with questions. While there were many assignments, they were split up into small assignments spread out over the course of the week, allowing students multiple opportunities to practice all we had learned.",
                "A strength in this course was the fact that there were about 12 people in the class, and so our professor was easily able to communicate with each of us individually, and we were able to watch our classmates grow in their skills and communicate with them easily without being confused. A weakness of this class was that it was conducted virtually, and so there were some skills (like eye-contact), that we could not really work on because the class was virtual. Of course though, I understand that with the world's current situation, there was no other option.",
                "Dr. Guynes was very understanding and accomodating to her students, which made the class fun and not stressful. We did many activities, such as bingo or virtual games, that made learning ASL very fun and interactive!  The assignments were also well organized and helpful for learning vocabulary and grammar. She gave lots of helpful feedback on our assignments. One minor weakness is that there was not a lot of time to practice conversations with the class, but I understand that there were limitations due to the virtual format.",
                "Dr. K is amazing! She really cares about student understanding and appeals to many different learning styles.",
                "The course work is very engaging and interactive, even while done online. This was my only class that I felt I paid full attention to during meeting times. I can't think of any weaknesses of the class.",
                "Strengths: Dr.K's materials are easy to engage with, she is always open to questions and makes herself very available to students, the course is broken down into helpful units that are organized by theme, just really fun learning environment with games and conversations. Weaknesses: honestly none, Dr. K is a gem and this class is awesome",
                "strengths: the professor! one of my favorite professors I've had at Yale, the class is very structured so you always know what to expect on a given day\r\nweaknesses: none",
                "This class was very well organized, and you are always given clear feedback. Overall, it was an excellent class.",
                "This was far and away my strongest class since the beginning of the pandemic. I loved Dr. K's teaching style  I think she was incredibly skilled at managing the Zoom discussions, and I really appreciated her embrace of tools uniquely available to a virtual classroom, e.g. breakout rooms, google docs, shared google projects, her interactive use of powerpoint, etc. I took another Yale language course in person a few years ago and remember that professor also having success with fun lessons, but I never would've expected Dr. K to succeed in this way online; she blew my expectations out of the water. It's the only class I've had consistent fun in since we moved online, although I've enjoyed others. Can't say enough good things about Dr. K."

                "Every two weeks, we created a video log of sentences using the new vocabulary signs we learned that week. I found this to be extremely helpful, especially in a group with other students. It allowed me to meet new people, practice my sign production, and receive feedback from Dr. K that would further strengthen my learning. Additionally, the flipped-model of learning was very helpful to maximize the amount of class-time that was spent doing other fun things (such as playing bingo and other games with new vocab) and practicing!",
                "Definitely the fact that you could mute yourself on zoom was beneficial to this class -- it really helped with the full immersion aspect of this class, and personally I believe it helped me. Other than this, looking at my professor from just the one angle sometimes made it difficult to learn the sign she was producing, and there were several times when I didn't quite understand the word she was producing.",
                "Dr. Guynes had lots of virtual games that we played as a class, which made learning very engaging. The assignments and projects were well designed to be completed virtually. She also would give us 5-minute breaks in the middle of class, which was very helpful for preventing Zoom fatigue. It did require having a stable Internet source and decent camera quality to fully participate in the class, which was difficult sometimes since my Internet would not be great or other students' video was laggy, which would make it hard to see other people signing.",
