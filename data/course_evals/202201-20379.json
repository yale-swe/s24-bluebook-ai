I also learned more about historiography  how history papers themselves work and how to analyze them; this was something I had never officially learned before. I thought this class was wonderful in showing the different perspectives form which the same past can be approached.",

                "I learned a ton about 20th century Japan, as well as the historical study of War Memory, Historical Revisionism, and Social History. A valuable class for not just understanding Japanese history but broader socio-historical approaches in general.",

                "I learned a whole lot about Japanese history, but also the relevant skills to analyze history. We had practice analyzing both primary and secondary sources, and how to read through and understand the author's argument.",

                "The course was brilliantly organized and well-taught by Prof. Shepherd. I only wish there could have been more of an emphasis upon Japanese cultural history, but I understand in such a broad survey course there is only so much you can fit in. Readings were strong. My main suggestion regards the assignment structure. I think timed exams are just never the best way to measure student engagement in a history class, and I recommend that future versions of this course replace the two short papers and two exams with two longer papers that allow us to more creatively engage with the material and pursue our own interests.",
                "In general  a wonderful course. I do think that discussion sessions could be useful if we were given questions to read for at the beginning of the week.",
                "Strengths: great breadth of coverage of the topic of 20th c. Japan  military, social, intellectual, political histories were all incorporated. Prof. Shepherd did a great job of weaving these narratives together, giving us a clear picture of both the history AND historiography of modern Japan.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not many  sometimes I wished the readings were a bit more tied to lecture for the week, but Kelvin (our TA) did a great job of bringing them into the right context. Also, I will say, the focus on historiography in tests and assignments was a little tough as I and many others have had no exposure to Japanese historiography other than this class  so asking us to compare readings with a broader historiography is a bit rough.",
                "The professor and the TF care about the students a lot.",
                "I thought the amount of readings was a tad overwhelming. There was a lot to cover so the pace was a little fast.",
                "Loved the course, learned a lot, Prof. shepherd is great",
                "Strengths: the lectures were well paced and very educational\r\nWeaknesses: not many"

                "Yes. Professor Shepherd teaches a subject of history that doesn't get much attention from the Department of History at Yale, and she does so with great skill.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in 20th century Japanese history, especially if you have no background in Japan. Prof. Shepherd offers a rich, thorough, and extremely well-organized survey, and I'm sure the course will only improve as she further refines the syllabus.",
                "Absolutely! Its very accessible and very interesting  I think it invites a more complicated way of looking at history.",
                "I would warmly recommend this course! Professor Shepherd is a generous, kind person and a top-notch lecturer. I was impressed by how much we covered in each class. The reading list is also cleverly constructed: primary sources provide insight into contemporary thoughts and debates, while secondary sources often commented on these primary documents, leading to fruitful discussions in section. The workload is very manageable, comprising of two brief writing assignments, a midterm, and a final.",
                "If you are interested in East Asia at all, or Military/Political history, this class is a great introduction to the region or the area of study. It is neither too demanding nor that challenging, and while it may not change how you view the world like some seminars might, its well worth your time as an interesting diversion and a good way into the field.",
