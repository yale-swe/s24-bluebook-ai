The Professor and TF are both very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.\r\n\r\nWeakness: might not be friendly to beginners. Although the course was designed to be at beginners level, its hard to feel like you really got a grasp of things in the course. Its kinda hard to feel like youve met the professors expectations, if that makes sense"

                "Helpful practices: Having a regular Friday midnight deadline on canvas made coursework predictable and established a sense of routine; the midnight deadlines also allowed for students in different time zones to adapt more easily than a random arbitrary time deadline. Lecture handouts were also good at writing out what was covered in class and allowed us to catch up if we missed anything.\r\n\r\nNot-so-helpful practices: Homework released later in the week and skills needed for homework being taught the day before the homework was due in section meant that Thursdays and Fridays had to be reserved exclusively for completing homework for this class (which is incredibly stressful at times, considering that for remote students, we can't guarantee that wifi and home-life will be stable those days). Wish there was a more explicit policy for getting extensions (rather than it being implied that you could ask for one via personal email and it may\/may not get granted) and wish there were much more advance notices of extended deadlines (especially during weeks with break days). \r\n\r\nAdherence to the break-day policies were there **technically** but did not really adhere to the spirit of what the break days were supposed to be about. Since homework and quizzes were due Friday, the break days for Monday and Wednesday only affected us not having class, not the level of work we still had to do for the class during those weeks."
