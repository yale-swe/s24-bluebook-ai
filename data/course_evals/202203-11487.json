                "Some interesting conversations and I received very detailed feedback on my essay however I thought the course focused a little too much on the historical development rather than the future. I also think sometimes discussion felt a little circular.\r\nI think the thirty page paper is excessive and I think it should be on a different topic; I did not find these to be extremely rewarding. I would have liked to also look more at communication technologies, driverless cars etc.",
                "readings were not always engaging. sometimes felt like we were saying the same thing over and over. perhaps cut down the number of readings and have more exercises to increase engagement with them",
                "Strengths: Jonny and Nate put a lot of work into this course. They adapt it each year in response to student reactions. Their banter is very entertaining. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this course requires a 30 page paper. If you are willing to write this, then definitely take the course.",
                "The seminar format was very engaging. Both professors did a good job at carrying the discussion forward, and kept a fun and humorous environment in which we also learned a lot and got a lot done. Readings were interesting as well. No weaknesses",
                "Given that the opportunity to take a college seminar is limited and the class is named Technological Innovation and the Future of the American City, I was excited to learn about futuristic technologies and their impact on cities and societies; however, as we dove into the readings, the takeaway wasn't too clear, and I struggled to stay engaged with the material that was focused on really old things like trolleys and railroads -- things that don't convey the same vibe that the class title does. It seemed that the recurring theme that we needed to stay cautious in modern times when people talk about creating \"the next big thing.\" I wish there was more writing support. I enjoyed the opportunity to engage with the other students who really wanted to learn about inventions and with Nate and Jonny. The instructors were really nice. I hope in the future, the class can be renamed to avoid this kind of misunderstanding or the focus of the class can shift to more modern topics. With the instructors' experience in the real world, it would be interesting if they related class topics to what they have seen on a day to day basis. Some of the discussions I found most interesting was when Nate or Jonny talked about relating these forms of transportations or inventions to their jobs. Also, I sincerely appreciated all the feedback they gave on the essays and presentation. I really enjoyed the thought experiments posed to us during the last class period. Overall, I liked this class alot!",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The profs\r\n- Readings - some were dull and\/or not very informative, but they were generally high quality and not overly long (around 150-200 pages\/wk)\r\n- Pretty much everything\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n - I didn't enjoy the quizzes, although they were scrapped after the first one. I just don't see the point of them. I would encourage the profs to adopt reading responses, however - they're a sure way of making sure people are engaging with the readings without adopting juvenile quizzes. \r\n- I think the course dwells too much on the history rather than future\/current applications. It definitely is true that a strong understanding of the former is necessary for the latter, but condensing the history by a week and adding a week of more application-heavy discussion would be a good idea imo.\r\n- Organisation was generally strong, but reading questions and the actual readings themselves should have been posted far more in advance. Very often they were posted after the weekend, leaving 3 days to do the readings whilst classes were going on."

                "Yes, Nate and Jonny are really cool and the seminar was formatted well.",
                "Fantastic course! Highly recommend. You learn a lot about the history of why cities\/transportation\/infrastructure look the way they do now. The course was allowed for a lot of open discussion and exploring ideas about the philosophy behind why things are they way they are in the United States. The course instructors are very knowledgeable about the course material but also facilitate meaningful discussions without just lecturing the whole time about the material. Super great course!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class! This is the second time the class has been taught, and it is clear the professors took into account the feedback received. I learnt a huge amount, both relating to the actual course itself (i.e. urban development, transportation, technologies etc.), but also about my own writing. Simply put, you *will* receive the most comprehensive writing feedback at Yale in this class."
