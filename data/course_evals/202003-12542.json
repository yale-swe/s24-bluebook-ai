Specifically, I got an excellent introductory understanding of the p-value and its problems, in addition to hypothesis formulation and experimental validity. We also did good work on causality.",

                "There weren't any strengths. Weaknesses were that we started with a very scientific, statistics based concept that was very difficult to understand. The readings complemented this by being very scientific and long. It was a freshman seminar and he threw us into the deep end on the first week. Most readings were unnecessarily long. There was almost no clarity on ways to improve. He would unfairly grade assignments and would just tell you to do better.  Assignment deadlines were never clear. The final assignment was also not very clear. The prompt was never explicitly written which was frustrating.",
                "Strengths: In-person which all of my other classes were not, I like having several readings throughout the week which we later discuss in class (this helps with understanding material due to different perspectives), each week's material built on the next. Professor Fernandez-Duque was also a great teacher who cracked jokes, made sure everyone was comfortable and happy, etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I was a little surprised to see that the two midterms were each worth 25% of the grade, whereas the final was only 20% of the grade. Maybe the final should be weighted more heavily because it exhibits an accumulation of knowledge throughout the whole semester?",
                "The course has some really great content that I had not been introduced to. It teaches a topic that is only just beginning to flourish, allowing us students to carry on and spread this knowledge. It aids in future research and scientific and statistical analysis. Some of the weaknesses was the required background knowledge that I wasn't aware of and wasn't exactly taught thoroughly during the course. For example, there are a lot of statistic terms and concepts\r\nthat one must know, such as the definition\/concept of the p-value and statistical significance.",
                "There should have been more structure regarding the discussions and a more in-depth review of the articles. The content of the course was pretty difficult, but there wasn't really a lot of explaining going on. I also wish the professor was more clear about what he wanted from us students -- for example, our final was a significant part of our final grade, and yet I was not even given examples of the scientific review that we were assigned. I had never written one before, and I was left guessing what he was looking for.",
                "I enjoyed the discussion format combined with assigned readings for homework, which I think is very effective. I think the discussion section went well, as we were generally able to cover the most important themes across the readings. At times, I felt a bit lost in terms of organization and the structure of the course, and I definitely felt like I learned more during some weeks compared to others (such as the week devoted to final project preparation).",
                "The content covered is an excellent introductory overview of statistical analysis and scientific reasoning. The units were broken up well, and for the most part, the readings were well-chosen. Sometimes I felt that the in-class discussion was a little stagnant and did not probe the insight we brought from readings. I liked the level of freedom we had with the final. The midterms were well-written and fairly scored.",

As an in-person participant, everything went very smoothly, and I felt like I was able to contribute and learn from the class. However, I'm sure the remote students had different experiences.",
                "This course's response to COVID left much to be desired. I was one of two students not on-campus. At the beginning of the year, before even starting the course, I asked the professor if it was going to be a problem and was told no, the whole thing would be remote. Then, I'm told in the second or third week that they will be moving in person because the professor \"can't stand\" online teaching. When I ask how I will be able to attend class, the prof emails me \"we will figure it out.\" Two weeks later, I can still barely hear what's going on, can't jump into discussion because no one can hear me, prof leaves mic off because of feedback loops, I can't see what's written on the board, the amazing long-suffering TA has to private chat everything that's written on the board to me and the other student. (Eventually we did figure out the audio, more or less). But even though I had struggles as a remote student, I was so thankful I wasn't in-person because the prof was NOT consistent about wearing his mask\/having it over his nose and he would routinely stand well within 6 feet of students. Oh, and then we find out that the whole time, he has been requiring our TA to be in person against regulations, given that she was a sophomore and shouldn't have been on campus. Then during the outbreak of cases in Davenport and Hopper, a student from Davenport called in remote to class due to residential college lockdown; some other students didn't feel comfortable coming to class in person and the prof had a huge problem with it. There was some drama about not letting the Davenport student take their midterm remote even though the other remote student and I had been doing it since the beginning because the prof was really worried about cheating, even though the protocols for remote midterms were well established and went off without a scratch in my other classes. In any case, I don't want to be too hard on this professor because I know he was trying his best, but in terms of formulating a coordinated protocol for courses during COVID going forward, I hope some of this might be good information.",
                "This course showed impressive adaptability to conditions of remote learning. Even when the class switched to in-person meetings, those students who were abroad were included by presenting them on the projection. This course was accessible to everyone despite their location."

But if you aren't really familiar with the scientific jargon, and aren't really down with learning topics on your own, I'd go for a different course.",

But the content of the course was excellent, and answering this question outside the context of COVID, I would definitely recommend it to STEM and non-STEM majors (prospective majors) alike, as it provides a baseline for experimental design, statistical analysis, and just reading the news with an informed disposition.",

It will help the first to familiarize themselves with the proper scientific paradigm of thinking. The second group, on the other hand, will explore the malpractices of the modern way of conducting research, which will give them crucial insights into what should be avoided."
