                "basic solid state physics, the way to understand 2nd order perturbation theory is quite intuitive and helpful",
                "I learned to understand phonons and electronic band theory in crystals. We learned the fundamentals of a few experimental techniques (x-ray diffraction) and specifically how lattices affect material properties.",
                "I learnt basic solid state physics and many other concepts relevant to understanding solids. Some concepts are also extendable to other fields of physics.",
                "I learned the basic concept and method in solid state physics, such as the lattice and its relation with X-ray diffraction pattern, the analysis about heat capacitance and the theory of phonon. I also get a sense of the logic thread in thinking about related problems.",

                "I really enjoyed how the course was a good balance of theory and experiment.  I think contextualizing a lot of the quantities we were talking about was critical to what I ended up getting out of the course and for building intuition.",
                "Strength: Friendly and engaging classroom atmosphere. Lively class.\r\nWeakness: Handouts should be more organized and clearly show key points",
                "very intuitive. It would be better if instructor can provide more supplementary reading materials",
                "This course had so many strengths: comprehensive notes with writing\/background\/diagrams in addition to math. The lectures were clear, well-paced, and built upon each other like a story. No weaknesses to report.",
                "Overall this is a great course. The material is laid out in a logical manner and builds on itself. Using the textbooks to augment lectures was easy as the correspondence between them was clear. Homework also reinforced and explored class content well and was helpful for developing a strong understanding. Frequent references to real devices, materials, and everyday phenomena are great for connecting and contextualizing insights from class.",
                "The course was really well constructed and the instructor was very enthusiastic about teaching the course. The level of the assignments was perfect; they weren't too hard or too easy. The teaching fellow was also very helpful. The instructor took regular feedback about the course and made sure students were satisfied. The lectures were delivered enthusiastically, and were really clear and enjoyable. I don't have too many suggestions about improving this course.",
                "Strengths: the teacher is well prepared for the fundamental theory and very skillful in answering related questions.\r\nWeakness: the slides sometimes involves too much words, it could be improved by highlight some key words or give some summary slides."

The insights gained in this course are a great complement to studies in electrical engineering, applied physics, and materials science, as they form a great foundation for understanding solid-state phenomena.",
