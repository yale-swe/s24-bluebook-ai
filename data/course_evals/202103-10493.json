                "Learned a lot about the history and philosophy of education (especially in the United States) and how systems of inequality and inequity still persist today. Especially fascinating as a student who went through the K-12 education system and now attends a prestigious institution. Highly recommend this class!",

Dr. Debs encouraged us to master the fine art of skimming in order to engage with our readings for every class and develop our research skills to analyze various texts through discussions in class and sections as well as in our essays. Additionally, the process of proposing, drafting, and revising our essays to result in the final product helped me learn to be a better writer (especially as a first-year who had never written such a long literature review).  I learned so much about how education works (mainly in the United States) from various perspectives including theory, policy, school types, and the actual practice of what makes effective (and ineffective) teaching.",

                "This class really prompted me to think about my education and, more broadly, the entire US educations system. It is really a survey course, so it sparked a lot of conversations and questions without going into all of the depth these issues require to really address. It was really powerful to hear from other students, even if the pool is slightly self selecting, and reflect on how we all ended up at Yale and how we were helped and harmed by US education. There were some interesting writing assignments that pushed me in my revision skills but aren't all necessarily papers typical to other Yale courses.",

                "The biggest takeaway for me was how big of a power education really is and the various forms of a childs education shapes their entire life and their values. Schools are the biggest cultural machines, and this course helped me learn how to look at my education critically.",
                "I learned about the history of education in the U.S., systems of education in other countries, accountability measures and No Child Left Behind (and the impact these had), rural and urban education, and community through education, pathways into teaching, and educational policy.",
                "This course provided a broad introduction to the variety of topics and fields within the broader area of education studies. I learned valuable insights about my classmates' own educational experiences, and I appreciated how Professor Debs and the TFs worked to connect individual student experiences to the material covered in class. The syllabus covers a broad range of topics from alternative and culturally sustaining pedagogies to the history of exclusion in higher education.",
                "- deep appreciation for the research that contributes to the advancement of educational equity\r\n- steps of the research process and real-time exposure to how to go about those steps\r\n- a fantastic introduction to the education studies (scholars) program!",

                "Overview of history of US education, different pedagogies, US Ed policy",

                "A ton of information about the construction of education, which pretty much sums the course. The courses I was taking this semester all examined a construction of a concept; thus, this class dove into the construction of education as we know it. Through the foundations, I was able to see how much work still needs to be done while understanding what possible pathways are available to enact those changes.",

                "The course is divided into four sections: the purpose of education, the history behind education in the United States, educational policy, and communities and spaces within the education systems. The student is pushed to engage with different theories of how education should be structured and ponder on how each theory affects different types of communities. The literature review paper challenges students to think about a particular question in education and synthesize overall trends of what researchers have found so far.",

                "Strengths: a broad array of topics so a lot to learn and a lot to ponder. Prof Debs often created a welcoming environment that caused significant reflection and learning\r\nWeaknesses: This isn't professor deb's fault, but sometimes the classes turned into series of complaints about yale and attacks on yale's policies (specifically in regard to legacy admissions). While some of these grievances are appropriate to share in class, these complaints took over entire sections/classes and some students made others not feel comfortable sharing their opinion if it differed from the general view. I know education policy is inherently political, but I do have to admit I was a little disappointed in how one-sided the class seemed to be during discussions or sections.",
                "strengths\r\n- lectures super interesting\r\n- huge breadth of conversation\r\n- amazing group of students because of the content\r\n- extremely insightful TAs\r\n- very fun assignments\r\n- sometimes podcast options for readings and youtube videos\r\n\r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n- lectures are rarely finished so maybe leave some of the lecture engagement for section to ensure we hear as much of hte interesting conversation as possible\r\n- reading amount is too much and not attainable (so interesting but must be skimmed.. also there is not much accountability for doing readings so maybe lessening the load but increasing the accountability would be good)",
                "strengths: Dr. Debs is so caring and makes lectures engaging/is responsive to student feedback, variety of readings/videos/podcasts, community; weaknesses: wish we could've gone more in depth with some topics as is typical in a survey class",
                "Strengths; good readings, interesting papers, not-stressful final assignment. Weaknesses; Professor Debs is very accomplished and fantastic and approachable but sometimes she said problematic things that made some people uncomfortable (unintentional of course!! She is lovely).",
                "Dr.Debs was a very responsive professor, and her response to feedback made the course very strong. The reading load was manageable and always relevant, I really enjoyed our time spent in discussion sections, and her flexibility on assignments was also very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeakness - perhaps since we had so much material to cover, we did not have time to go in-depth on topics that I found particularly interesting or important.",
                "Strengths: interesting readings, wide variety of topics covered, understanding with deadlines, shorter class time\r\nWeaknesses: heavy workload (mostly reading), requires Dean's excuse for an extension longer than two days",
                "Strength: the students in the class are there because they are interested in education, and will be willing to talk about any problem and come together to find a solution. Really cool people with really cool ideas, sections were enjoyable and really nice spaces!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course content. I personally felt excluded in most if not all of the topics we covered in class, and I found plenty of other students who found the same problem and dropped the class or certificate because of this reason. They were not relevant to me, as I am interested in going into education outside the US. The course and the assignments are not designed for students who are not interested/will be a part of the US educational system, yet it is a requirement for the certificate or the program (there is an assumption that all students in the program will stay in the US). I find it ironic that in this class we learn about how education can be filtering out certain students from certain opportunities, and that that is exactly what this class is doing with students with an international perspective/interest, and that we were learning how to be inclusive in the classrooms but I was myself feeling excluded from this community. Facts speak for themselves: there is only 1 international student in the EDST program. I wanted to give it a chance, especially since Dr. Debs seemed really receptive to feedback. However, when I brought this up, the response I got is that these have been comments that theyve heard in the past (yet there is no change) and that theres no solution (while there is, clearly ). I felt and still feel really frustrated/sad/mad about this.",
                "Strengths: so much information in a light, digestible way\r\nWeakness: wish we could have more formally engaged with the texts!",
                "The strengths is the student engagement in this course, the discussions both in section and in class, the reflective component in the class, and the insightful content, curriculum, and essays assigned! This was such a great class, I have no weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: Professor Debs and the teaching team!  I always looked forward to going to lectures and sections. The lectures and course content were fascinating and engaging. The assignments were graded fairly and not overly stressful - they were a good chance to engage critically with course content and felt meaningful. The only weakness is that the readings were also fascinating, but it was unlikely that I could ever complete them all.",
                "I really enjoyed how accessible lectures and the readings/podcasts were. It was very easy to keep up with the material in the class. The only thing I didn't like was that we often spent a lot of time answering questions during class and ended up running out of time. This meant that anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 of the presentation was rushed through at the end without much insight.",
                "Lectures are recorded which is really nice. The syllabus was well structured and there was good communication throughout the course. Be aware that this is a survey course-- you cover a lot of topics with less depth, which I thought was a strength but might not be for everyone. The main weakness I can think of is that the lectures were very participation-based, but it is not easy or accessible for everyone to verbally participate in such a large lecture. Would appreciate more non-verbal opportunities to participate",
                "The strength of this class is definitely the discussion sections. I love being able to talk to others about the readings, which were always great. Another strength was the variety of assignments: we had a personal essay, class observation essay, literature review and final project. The weakness is that the class is an overview, so you don't spend much time on any topic. Also, the lecture time sometimes feels pointless to go to since it is so short and most of the time it is just quickly summarizing the readings for all 50 minutes.",
                "Strengths of the course are the range of topics covered within the class and the establishment of an open, discussion-based environment in the lecture hall. Some weaknesses are the lack of depth the class surfaces in each topic and occasional long readings assigned.",
                "Strengths: You learn about current and historical issues of the US Education System\r\nWeakness: Too many topics to cover in such a short semester",
                "Strengths: The class was a good introduction to education studies, and I really enjoyed the readings. My teaching fellow was also phenomenal, and really added to my experience in the course.\r\nWeaknesses: I think having longer lectures (two 75-minute classes, maybe) would help the class cover more content, because it often felt like we were unable to go really in-depth into topics. Some of that feeling, though, may just be a result of how much material a survey class like this has to cover.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Debs was pretty accommodating and the lectures were as interactive as they could be for its size. I enjoyed the assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course was VERY U.S.-centric. I've talked to international students who have been discouraged by other international students from taking this class. I feel like if we're trying to reimagine U.S. education, we should be learning about other systems besides the U.S. to a greater extent in this class.",
                "One strength of this course is that it was so broad and we were truly able to touch upon so many areas of education (which is something that many students simultaneously view as a weakness). I think one weakness was that the readings were often very long and included anecdotes that were very personal to the author, while the lectures went by very quickly and we were always running out of time. Honestly, I think adding at least 20 minutes to the lecture time would allow for Professor Debs to effectively teach the lesson and also allow for more student interaction/participation during the lecture. I also think that some topics were approached without enough nuance and that multiple perspectives should have been provided aside from just oversimplifying a topic to say that one thing caused another or that one thing was good or bad when these topics (especially about educational inequality) are much more complex and deserve to be treated as such.",
                "Loved that discussion sections made content taught in lecture digestible",
                "strengths: engaging readings, helpful professor and tfs, ample time to reflect on your work and its effects, good introduction to course material at breadth\r\n\r\nweaknesses; a little disorganized, readings were thoroughly integrated but felt as if they could have been used more pointedly, set-up of lecture was a little awkward as it was sometimes split between discussion and lecturing which sometimes left lecture material uncovered",
                "Strengths: there's something powerful/special about learning about education in an inherently educational space as both the teacher and students are critical about the ways we're engaging in learning, Professor Debs' generosity with students and their learning styles/needs, the interesting topics covered, the division of graded assessments (not placing a significant weight on one final exam, for example); Weaknesses: lecturing pedagogy throughout the whole semester, wish Professor Debs' teaching had more of a critical theory-oriented and anticolonial lens, wish Professor Debs acknowledged and addressed her own positionality in the beginning of the class (how does her own identity impact how she teaches these topics?), a lot of readings",
                "though i somewhat wish it had been a seminar instead of a lecture, it was one of the most engaging lectures i've had! really interesting material and engaging lecture format. assignments were pretty straight forward and interesting to complete.",
                "It is a broad overview, so you learn about a lot that you can potentially explore in your papers, in future courses, or on your own. The timing of some of the assignments made the course feel very work-intensive at awkward points of the semester, like right before Thanksgiving break.",
                "Lectures and sections were the biggest strengths; they were very engaging and section was always enjoyable. I liked how we received feedback on our literature reviews and had the opportunity to turn our lit reviews into projects. My only criticism is how close the deadlines for all the assignments are to each other.",
                "I think the class did a good job highlighting many of the major issues and topics of modern education and incorporated some of the important historical context as well. I thought section was really cool because we got to focus on what issues interested us and discuss our specific and personal experiences in various types of education. It prompted many conversations with my friends in and out of the class. \r\n\r\nI think it would have been helpful if the readings were a little more directed. For instance, maybe there could be something highlighting the important points. Or maybe students could split the readings amongst a group? Sometimes it felt like the lectures were covering the exact same content as the lecture which made it feel redundant and hard to justify spending time on both.",
                "Mira Debs is an excellent professor.",
                "Strengths -- prof and TFs\r\nWeaknesses -- too much reading",
                "Strength: Dr. Debs was a very good professor, very responsive to students, and very knowledgeable. She promoted in-lecture discussions and questions, which were very insightful and engaging. Section discussions were also very productive. Weakness: the reading load was very heavy. We were encouraged to skim the readings, but it may have been more productive to have shorter readings that present main ideas, rather than long chapters; shorter, to-the-point selections were beneficial for my engagement in other lecture courses, and it may help this one as well. Additionally, being a survey course, it had the benefit of covering many interesting topics, but never in too much depth, which was somewhat unfortunate.",
                "It is obviously an intro class, so you can only talk about certain issues so much, but I really liked how much space we had to bring out personal experience into discussion and learn from our peers. There was a LOT of reading for an intro class but the assignments are pretty straight forward.",
                "Strengths: manageable readings that were well-selected and definitely added to my understanding in the course, interesting material, recorded lectures, engaging polls/discussions in lecture. Weaknesses: I might have liked to see a more diverse array of arguments and opinions regarding education, even just for the sake of seeing the opposing view to see how well-formed it is and how to refute it.",
                "Good mix of assignments, accessible readings, engaging TF. Often times Dr. Debs wouldn't make it through all of the lecture material which sometimes was frustrating.",
                "A strength of the course was not having exams and no late penalties. I really took pride in my work without fear and it made me enjoy the class more.",
                "Strengths: the pacing never felt too fast, the readings are all very engaging and varied (especially the podcasts and the final readings of the semester), many topics covered, lecture participation encouraged and welcome, clear communication, rubrics, and expectations alongside many chances to share personal educational experiences and work.\r\nWeaknesses: a common one is that the pacing is too fast for certain areas, but I understand that this is a survey course which is designed to provide large breadth of knowledge on contemporary educational issues, debates, and history. The one weakness I can think of is that the course felt a bit start and stop when discussing higher education, it felt as if we had a lecture on higher ed then a different topic, then the talk with Dean Quinlan, then community in education.",
                "The syllabus is one of the strongest parts of the course. I felt like Dr. Debs provided a broad, yet thorough set of readings that proved interesting and valuable in my understanding of the overall course material. However, I felt like the lecture was somewhat superfluous. I could have skipped every lecture without impacting my experience in the course. I think this class depends on how much you commit to engaging with the texts on the syllabus. If you do the readings as assigned, you will find you learn a lot about the history and structure of the education system. However, if you skip most of the readings, your experience in the class will suffer as the lecture won't catch you up.",
                "i really liked the compassion with which Dr. Debs and the TFs/Psalm went about grading/assignments/adjustments/accomodations. Student feedback was a critical component to shaping the classroom experience every step of the way, which I also really valued. balancing lecture with discussion, in class and in section, also was really well executed!",
                "Course was very organized!!",
                "I loved the TAs and Professor Debs! The teachers were definitely a plus and I really appreciated how flexible they all were.",
                "A good range of topics but unfortunately very broad and not in depth. I liked the diversity of topics tho. The class could be longer. I would have liked more guidance with my writing I was often very confused. At first I was angry at how Dr. Debs didnt include everyone in lecture but I thought she got a lot better with it throughout the semester. It was also really nice that she learned everyones name.",
                "The syllabus is really carefully curated and really supports the expansiveness of topics covered in the course. The readings vary greatly in terms of perspective and the audience that they are written for (some things werent even readings as we had an array of podcasts and videos in the syllabus too). This syllabus really aided in the purpose of exposing us to many different topics and perspectives in education.",
                "Strengths: really strong survey course from a lot of different perpectives\r\nWeaknesses: can feel like US Ed is hopeless sometimes (perhaps realistic but maybe course could include a bit more discussion of the way forward rather than totally focused on problems). Small note: it would be helpful to have an intro to the landscape of the US Ed system earlier so were all on the same page about vocabulary. For example, we talked about charter schools for a while before defining them, and a lot of students from suburban or rural backgrounds had no idea how those worked.",
                "Strengths: Reading material. Professor accommodation and understanding.\r\nWeakness: Lectures didnt add much to the readings",
                "The big strength is Dr. Debs. She made an effort to engage with students and their thoughts, even though it was a lecture-sized class. Dr. Debs was also willing to amend or update her statements if new information ever came to light.",
                "Loved everything about this course. No weaknesses I can point out. I think a particular strength of this course is the flexibility. The additional two days you can request on assignments was super helpful to me. They allowed me to submit my best work.",
                "The content of the course moves quickly, which I was glad about (as it meant covering more information), but also at times a bit sad about (because I wished we could have gone deeper into different topics, with more time for discussion). Getting to discuss and reflect more in section every week was wonderful. I loved the major assignments of the class -- I was really happy that there were a mix of creative/personal projects and research projects.",
                "The class was very vibrant amd engaging community and the communication would have been a way better experience if the class could be split into seminars. \r\nThe course structure was also very flexible, with flexible deadlines and recorded lectures. However, this meant it was easy to become disengaged from the class, if one was not comfortable in speaking in a large room and could not keep up with the heaps of readings.",
                "I LOVED this course!!! It was definitely my favorite course Ive taken at yale.",
                "Strengths: DR DEBS! Also, this was by far one the most wholesome course Ive taken at Yale. Because youre surrounded by many, many potential teachers, even the discussion sections are enjoyable\r\n\r\nWeakness: we had a lot of readings. The readings were super interesting but quite lengthy",
                "A weakness is that we go over so much material that we are unable to focus on certain topics like ELL education for example, which we only spent half a lecture exploring. A strength is the constant checking in with students as it made us feel heard within the classroom.",
                "Strengths: Many topics give a good overview of some parts of education\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some topics deserve more attention but I know this is difficult with the little time and number of topics we go through",
                "I am absolutely grateful for the extension/late policy deadline + discussion section. These were huge strengths that allowed me to enjoy the course without worrying about grades. I think the weakness really relied on 1.) course content breadth and 2.) student options to explore learning. While the content was informational, the amount of content deterred from truly diving into topics and resonating with the content. I, also, think more assignments like the personal essay and the creative dissemination should be added to the course.",
                "please more support on lit review!!! it was a very hard paper to write for an intro class because it's not the average english or history paper we are used to writing in high school",
                "The professor was very accomodating with deadlines considering the pandemic. The professor reassured students that they could approach the teaching fellows and the professor for any matter related to the course or the education studies program. I think the course would benefit from a discussion post section where all students from the class could engage with outside of class. Though I think sections provide more intimate opportunities to discuss the readings and lectures, giving space for a class-wide forum will allow students to interact with one another across sections (this also would complement the learning circles that sometimes we did in class).",
                "Strengths: well-organized, very interesting material, engaging\r\nWeakness: scope of course focused mainly on American education and less on international",
                "I think a big strength of this course is the number of topics that we were able to touch and discuss in only a semester. I was definitely too naive before taking this class. I also think the discussion sections were the highlights of this class. I really appreciated the recordings as there were some days that going to class (none specific) felt really impossible. Very adaptable and always looking for feedback from the students. It would have felt nice to have more conversations where my peers spoke about their experiences and their knowledge. I felt that was sometimes more valuable than just reading research about it.",
                "The class needs to allot more time for discussion in lectures and sections."

                "Yes! If you don't know much about the education system, or you do and would like to reflect on your own, this is a great course. The lectures are interesting and Professor Debs is an inspiring teacher with creative assignments that do not feel overwhelming. Having the major paper done before thanksgiving break (while it feels like a push before break) makes finals and December so much nicer.",
                "absolutely. every student should have to take it - regardless of their major or career path. It is crucial, especially if you plan to have kids in America.",
                "Yes!!! I think this class should be required for everyone, even if you're not an ed studies scholar",
                "yes! only if they are interested in education. you really dive deep",
                "Yes, anyone who thinks they might be interested in Education Studies at all, definitely take this course to get a nice overview of all the different ways to be involved in the field.",
                "Yes. There is a lot of reading assigned, but it's okay to skip out on a few since the information is covered during class. However, the readings are interesting. Lectures are short but informative and section facilitates engaging discussion",
                "I would definitely not recommend this class to another student interested in international education, and would also not recommend it to students interested in the US educational system. I feel like the fact that they are aware of an issue and they are not willing to change it or comfort students would personally drive me away from any class, especially one about education. The worst is not the fact that other problems in education outside the US are overlooked or not even acknowledged, the worst is that they are aware of the scope of the class and how it is filtering out a lot of students, yet there has been no change. It could be removed as a requirement, or its syllabus could be changed, or there could be a list of requirements from where to choose from. But no, its easier to just leave it like this and pretend there is not a problem with it!",
                "Yes! Whether youre interested in the education studies program or not, this is a class everyone should take.",
                "I would 100% recommend this class to any student in any major. You do not have to be interested in the education certificate to enjoy this class. It is so insightful to learn and criticize the current academia, the past of your education, and how we can improve it in the future. It was ludicrous how our educational past was actually destructive, but we were so used to it that it felt normal. It would be amazing if everyone could tap into their education and be critical of it.",
                "Maybe. I took it because it's a pre-req for the ed studies program and certificate, and had it not been required I would have preferred to take a different ed studies course. If you're interested in education but not the program/certificate, I would probably recommend a different course that doesn't cover so much content, because we had to go over a lot without much depth. That said, Dr. Debs is a good lecturer and a really nice and understanding professor, the topics and readings are really interesting, and the workload is totally reasonable.",
                "YES YES take this class! For a very low workload, you will come away having learned a TON about a fascinating topic that we all engage with on a regular basis - education! You will find yourself thinking critically about education in ways that you never thought about before and will get the chance to reflect on your own educational experiences, both before, during, and after Yale.",
                "If you're interested in educational studies or just finding an interesting yet relatively easy class, this is definitely a good class to take. Focused much more on presenting material to students rather than testing them on it and the grading isn't harsh. Prof. Debs is focused on the well-being of students and knows that pressure from grades can definitely detract from wellness.",
                "100%. great course to take if you have any interest in education-- whether that is actually going into the education field or just better understanding your own educational experiences. I think everyone should take this class if they can",
                "Yes. Especially if they want to learn more about education. However, I think I would recommend most of the EDST seminar classes over this one since they can go into more depth on unique topics",
                "Yes, especially if you are even the slightest bit interested in learning about education.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in our education system and/or plan to be an educator.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! Even if one is not considering the ed studies certificate/scholars program, I think learning about education and reflecting on one's personal connection to it is really important. As a first-year, I found it a great start to my time at Yale, and a really helpful tool in determining what I want from my next seven semesters.",
                "Yes, if you want a broad overview of education studies and are interested in the Ed Studies program. Otherwise, I feel like you might be more intellectually stimulated by the upper-level courses in Ed Studies.",
                "yes, I would, if you have any interest in education and/or social issues/inequality!",
                "If they want a broad understanding of concepts within education studies",
                "yes, it is a good general introductory course and fits all types of students since everyone can relate to any aspect of education.",
                "Yes. This is a good introductory course to introduce you to topics of education that will push you to think and reflect critically about where and why you are on your current educational journey in the greater context of history and systems of power.",
                "yes! really good broad overview of education topics, interesting but not stressful",
                "Yes, if you would like an introduction to education studies. I stopped attending lecture in person because recordings were captioned and that was more accessible for me.",
                "I would highly recommend this course, especially if you have any interest in ed studies.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! It was really well organized to not be overwhelming, the work was super manageable, and the professor and TFs were super flexible. They wanted everyone to be successful, so anything that would help you learn, they were happy to adjust and/or accomodate. While it is a survey course, it does raise a lot of interesting questions and you can focus your assignments on the specific issues that are important or relevant to you.",
                "The course is very informative, and the professor is incredibly supportive.",
                "Absolutely. Great professor and TFs. This was the first lecture with section in 4 years I actually looked forward to each week. Prof Debs's lectures were great. My peers also seemed to care about the class, which I think is unique for intro-level lectures.",
                "If you're even mildly interested in education - this course covers many different aspects of education, and is a good entryway into education studies. It's also a very friendly and chill course to take if you're just interested in a social science credit.",
                "Yes, I do think it's a good class, and the amount of effort you put in impacts what you get out of it.",
                "Yes! These are issues that we need to know about as voters and future parents (and some of us, future educators). The class is manageable and well organized.",
                "If you're curious about foundational education pedagogies, or education really at large, I recommend this course. The assignments are flexible enough that you can really investigate whatever it is you're interested in.",
                "YES! Even for those not interested in the education studies program, this course is great for just thinking about education as we are all still students.",
                "Yes! Even if you are not planning to pursue EDST at Yale or after Yale, EDST 110 is an open and welcome space to learn about history through education and better understand current events in education. The workload is manageable and the community of students, TAs, and Dr. Debs is supportive. The emphasis on sharing personal experiences in a lecture class is also quite unique and special.",
                "I'd definitely recommend the course. Dr. Debs is super knowledgeable and friendly. Although the breadth of topics might be a negative for some, I found it to be liberating as I could choose which readings/topics I wanted to dive into further. I'm more of a STEM person, so I appreciated the readings that took a more quantitative approach. I guarantee there is something on the syllabus that will interest you and may draw you to a specific EDST elective later on. In its current state, the syllabus has a lot of reading for each class, but the graded assignments aren't very long or difficult. I think most students earned at least an A- if the TFs could see that you invested at least some time and effort. Definitely a low stress environment. Would recommend!",
                "Absolutely! for anyone who wants a more comprehensive understanding of education, it's historical underpinnings, and how to approach its reform through deep and critical research.",
                "Yes!!!",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in education, or just learning more about the history of education in the US!",
                "I would for everyone even if youre not interested in education. It breaks down a lot of the stigmas surrounding education in an engaging way.",
                "I definitely would recommend this course, both to students interested in continuing to study education and also students who may even be just slightly interested in learning more about education. The range of topics is so vast, and several of the topics intersect with other fields and social issues that I truly believe that there is something interesting for anyone.",
                "Yes, even if youve never thought about going into education this is a good opportunity to think about your own education and the role of education in society & inequality. Prof Debs is fantastic and really understanding. First time in college Ive actually wanted to do all the readings.",
                "Yes, if youre interested in understanding education and education inequality. I wish there was a little more focus on pedagogy and learning, and that there was more depth overall, but I think this is a great intro survey course.",
                "If you're thinking about the Ed Studies Program or Certificate, definitely take this course!",
                "Yes. If youre interested in education at all, take this class.",
                "Yes, for those who are interested in pursuing more education studies classes or if you are looking to explore ed studies for the first time, this course will give you a solid foundation of knowledge as well as allow you to focus on an area you are interested to look at more in-depth through the main project assignment.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course! This was the first education course I've taken, and I'm now excited about an education studies track. The readings are fascinating, lectures engaging, and I really enjoyed the assignments.",
                "Yes if you are interested about US education and are fairly good in skimming through large readings. Otherwise, you will fly through the course and feel like you have not learned anything new.",
                "YES!",
                "Absolutely. I think its important to see how education can shape individuals lives and mold society, and I think this survey course does a great job at highlighting how some are unfairly disadvantaged or advantages in the process",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone regardless of whether or not they want to pursue the education certificate.",
                "Absolutely! I think it is very important to understand education and be able to see it from a number of perspectives.",
                "Yes, but take it with a grain of salt. I don't think this is the best introduction to the education studies program, but it allows students to think about what they can and do within the education studies program + things they could change about the program.",
                "yes. an excellent class that helps you understand the education you are pursuing as yale even if you don't want to go into a career for education. as a lecture this class was still tailored to individual learning and emphasized collaboration. great class!",
                "Yes, this course effectively serves as an introductory course to Education Studies. It really sparked my interest in the subject, and I hope to take more Ed Studies courses moving forward.",
                "Absolutely! The content presented in this class is super engaging and raises questions that will leave you pondering all day. The community you create with your peers is unlike any other and all the instructors are incredibly understanding. As a first-semester freshman this class really helped me build the confidence needed to study at a place like Yale.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to others. The workload is fair. You get out what you put in for the class."
