                "A survey over human rights and humanitarian crises in the 20th century. Learned how to more critically analyze source documents.",
                "I learned about the history of human rights in the 20th century (including conflicts I knew very little or nothing about, the rise of the NGO's, and the presidency of Carter). I also became more supportive of American intervention to stop human rights abuses or to promote equal treatment of all citizens.",
                "The historical foundations of humanitarian interventions. Reading for important information.",
                "I learned about the development of human rights, what humanitarian interventions are, and the reasons for and against humanitarian interventions. Out of necessity, I have improved a little at skimming. Although this course was cross-listed as PLSC and GLBL, it very much was a HIST course. Thus I honed my primary source reading skills, as well as my discussion-leading skills. A lot of the knowledge I gleaned was on the history of how states have approached the issue of human rights/humanitarian interventions.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of human rights and international law. I improved at writing history papers",
                "Gained a deeper understanding of human rights and humanitarian catastrophes in the 20th century. Big focus on the United Nations.",
                "I learned a little more about humanitarianism and its traditions/histories. I learned about specific cases and situations in the past and how to contextualize them. I also gained a better understanding of the difference between human rights and humanitarianism, and where politics come into play both domestically and transnationally.",
                "More historical skills - how to approach these questions from a historical point of view instead of a political science one",

                "I learned a lot about the development and theory behind human rights in the 20th century. I also learned about humanitarianism and the development of humanitarian and human rights in the 20th century through case studies. More broadly, I honed my historical analysis skills.",
                "Overview of various humanitarian crises and interventions throughout the 20th century.",

I learned about the essential philosophers that influenced our modern understandings of rights.

            "comments": [
                "Charlotte is incredibly knowledgable and designs class activities to have us engage more deeply with historian processes. At times there was too much reading to spend enough time deeply analyzing each piece. Discussion sections were very engaging (Lauren was a great TF).",
                "I thought the reading amounts were rather high which in turn probably led to a lesser understanding of the material. With that being said, the readings were usually pretty interesting (especially the primary sources).",
                "A huge strength of this course was how interesting and engaging each class meeting was. Although it was 3 hours long, it didn't feel like it because I always was doing something or had something to think about. The meetings were very organized. I really liked our discussion section because we always talked about thought-provoking things. The readings were interesting as well. \r\nA weakness of this course was the workload. Although getting the work done was not hard, it was a little too much reading, more so than most college classes I'd ever taken. A way to improve this course would be to remove some of the longer readings.",
                "Strengths: The content is really interesting. The readings are usually interesting, and the discussions were always super productive and insightful. Final paper was cool and I felt prepared to write it, which I can't always say is true. The in-class activity was always really fun and useful for kind of consolidating the premise of the lecture. Case studies were interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: High demand, maybe even for a summer class. The short papers were actually kind of useful but felt like a lot of extra work I didn't have time for. Lectures felt a bit awkward at times, even though the information was really interesting. Having to lead a discussion also felt weird, I wasn't sure what to talk about when the conversation stopped or where my TF wanted us to go. Lots of reading.",
                "Strengths: the teaching staff tried to make this course more accommodating and flexible. After the midterm feedback survey, the professor adjusted the syllabus in accordance with student feedback. Recording the lectures and releasing lecture slides after the class was helpful for reviewing. I liked how we had to post discussion questions before each class, since that provided a nice basis for discussion sections.\r\nWeaknesses: the reading load for the first four weeks of the course was extremely heavy. There was a point where I was skimming all the readings and still struggling to finish them in time. Having similar reading loads for both the Monday and Wednesday sections wasn't ideal because we had fewer days in between classes (Monday to Wednesday) than Wednesday to Monday, so I would've preferred a Monday-heavy reading load. Professor Kiechel was obviously very knowledgable about the topics she lectured on, but at times it felt like she was reading from a script. I would have preferred for her to lecture a little slower and add more pauses to prompt reflection. I wonder if it'd be possible to lecture about the readings due for the next class, particularly because the context provided in lecture would have been incredibly helpful to have before diving into primary sources. Also, while there were merits to the same TF grading all your short essays and final paper, I anecdotally found that certain TFs were much more relaxed with their grading than others. I'm not sure how this would get evened out in the grading distribution. If there was a mechanism to ensure that grading across TFs was the same, I would've felt a lot more sure in the fairness of my grade in this class.",
                "I think the course had too many assignments, leading students to not always complete their best work",
                "The knowledge and history I learned from this course was absolutely amazing. However the course load for this class was extremely tough. I will commend the professor for taking account of this and making the course load lighter during the last week of class was helpful.",
                "Strengths: specific case studies, key words, and relatively well managed pacing \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: too many assignments - not sure if conducive to learning? could've also been more thoughtful about race",
                "Not being online, but the best was made of a bad scenario. \r\nA strength would be the lectures - thoroughly enjoyed that",
                "I thoroughly enjoyed this course. The instructors were all engaging, kind, excited, and knowledgeable. The work was challenging but manageable. \r\n\r\nI struggled to write effectively because this was my first Yale course--I would have liked to see some more examples of writing, but I understand that a certain level of proficiency is expected.",
                "strengths: content (the specific HR crisis), helpfulness of TA's, professor was kind, organization was VERY good (lecture, class activity, discussion section)\r\n\r\nweaknesses: way too much reading, professor seemed to be reading off a script for every presentation, professor used way too technical language that was very hard to follow along, not enough time on the midterm, should have focused on more HR crisis (like Rwanda, Biafra, Bangladesh) instead of political/HR theory",
                "Strengths: The lectures were very informative, the readings were very interesting and put together very well. The class was also structured in a great way; I liked the section and lecture parts. Weaknesses: The professor changed several of the readings last minute (including adding more reading), and the workload was high",
                "Strengths: very friendly and enthusiastic professor and teaching fellows, interesting course material. \r\nWeaknesses: lecture felt monotone and too scripted at times. Workload was far too high at times.",
                "Strengths: engaging section leader \r\nWeakness: zoom",
                "I learned a lot in this course, and the knowledge gained and the readings we read will stay with me for a long time and certainly come in handy with my other classes. I loved our case studies, especially Biafra and Rwanda. I enjoyed the lectures and I learned something from every reading.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course were in the group activities. While the activities themselves were somewhat useful, I would have preferred to do them with my discussion group. Doing activities with a large Zoom room of strangers did not lend itself to a sense of community; it could be quite awkward and low in participation energy. However, doing these activities with a group I already knew could have been fruitful and enjoyable. \r\n\r\nEven though the readings were all great, the workload was really quite intense. This was one of the most reading heavy courses I've taken in my college experience."

                "Yes! If anyone is interested in human rights, regardless of how they feel about it/the UN/American intervention, then they should take this class.",
                "I didn't love the course at times, and was often frustrated with the workload, but it has a lot of good content that other Yale classes haven't offered (as I've seen). The readings were usually interesting (though very long), and the lectures complemented them well. If you're looking for a more political science-oriented course, this isn't really for you. It's good grounding for the historical trace of these concepts, which might be useful, but at times I wish there was more discussion of the political activity in the events we talked about. Of course, neither political nor historical language alone will ever get a comprehensive picture. The instructor focuses a lot around the UN, which makes sense at times, while also recognizing that the UN is flawed in many ways.",
                "Not in its current state. Online lectures feel much longer and more painful than in-person ones. I felt that the course was poorly organized, partially because this was the first time it'd ever been taught. While I learned a lot of historical context on human rights and humanitarian interventions, I distinctly remember studying for the midterm and feeling like there was no obvious thread or takeaway that I'd learned. It felt like an amalgamation of information that wasn't particularly well tied together. Perhaps it is simply more difficult to teach/take a summer course than a semester one, but this one was significantly more exhausting, time-consuming, and confusing than I had anticipated. If you can handle a heavy reading load, long lectures, and an inundation of assignments (this last one is by no fault of the teaching staff, there are only five weeks and a necessity of having things to grade), then I would suggest you try this course out.",

                "Yes, I would recommend it. I learned a lot about human rights and humanitarianism, and this class was well-structured and the readings were super interesting. The workload is high, but I would still recommend it.",
                "Unless they are exceptionally interested in human rights I would be hesitant to recommend this course in its current form. The material was interesting but there was simply too much reading and writing to fully engage with and enjoy the course material.",
