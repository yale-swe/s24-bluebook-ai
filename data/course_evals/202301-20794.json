                "I enjoyed reading 10 biographies that were entirely new to me, and diving back into an 11th. I learned more about how to conduct archival research and write a lengthy research paper.",
                "A great series of biographies. Lots to read, but very rewarding.",
                "An understanding of the various forms of Biography, and an idea of what it takes to be of consequence.",
                "I learned what makes a biography good and what makes one great. This class was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I'll never forget it!! I of course loved writing the biography (it's actually fun!!), but I really loved writing my short autobiography (and reading my classmates'). Take it if you can!! Just remember to start your biography (and go to the archives) earlyit's a lot and will for sure sneak up on you!",
                "I learned a lot about the different forms that biography can take, as well as how to discuss a biography what are the important things that go into understanding a historical figure. For me, the most interesting thing I learned was definitely how to write history in a creative and almost literary way.",
                "This class was an attempt to answer the question: what is a biography? We dove into different forms of biographies, analyzing common themes",
                "Knowledge of 12 different people's lives, i.e. their biography (about a book a week for the semester). An appreciation of of different examples of effective biography writing, different styles and approaches to writing biography. The course made me consider who gets biographies written about them, what qualities about a life lend them towards being biography-able. Also had me thinking about what makes a life worth examining."

            "comments": [
                "I thought the caliber of the biographies we read was actually a bit low. Eleanor, Calhoun, Holmes, and God all left something to be desired. But I understand that Professor Gaddis changes up the syllabus every year (or at least from time to time), so that is good, and I appreciate him trying new things.",
                "Strengths: Many of the books on the syllabus (LBJ, Steve Jobs, Augustus, Orlando, Lincoln in the Bardo) are incredible and reading a book a week is a wonderful habit to get into. I found myself won over on more than one occasion by a biography I thought I wouldn't enjoy. Gaddis is entertaining and really values good writing. The final project was so much fun. If you'd like writing a biographyresearch, drafts, fun new anglesyou're up for the challenge. I loved how we addressed fiction and looked at authors and authorial strategies.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Many of the books on the syllabus. Oliver Wendell Holmes was particularly weak, but it's baffling that there are only two books about women, two books by women, one book on a non-white person, and zero books written by non-white people. This was also reflective of the demographic of student that typically takes this course, so our discussions were a little section-assholey. I understand that the aim of the course is different than, say, Karin Roffman's biography class, but her syllabus actually belongs to this century. It seems more like a place for Gaddis to talk about a cool person once a week than to discuss the ethics of how to get into the head of another person, but I'm an English major and not a History major so maybe other people enjoyed that.",
                "Love the format.",
                "The strength of this course is Professor Gaddis. He is, I'd imagine, the most qualified person in the world to teach a class on biographies. I was always amazed by his insights and commentarywill miss this class a lot!",
                "Nothing to change.",
                "I loved all of the assignments for this course I thought that they were really interesting, and I really appreciated the flexibility that Professor Gaddis allows, as well as the high expectations that he holds. I felt really motivated to rise to a certain level of quality, and I think that's a good thing. For me, the main weakness was probably the nature of the discussions/some of the readings. I think that I might have preferred in some cases less discussion about the figures in the biographies themselves and more discussion about exactly what a biography does and what the limits of biography can be. I think we approached some of that but did not necessarily dive in as deeply as we could. With that in mind, I really enjoyed Professors Gaddis' more experimental choices like Lincoln in Bardo, Orlando, or Augustus, and I wonder if we could have read more books where the approach to biography is more obviously original and unorthodox.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gaddis is fantastic, the syllabus is great and the class is one of the most enjoyable Ive ever taken at Yale \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: If the class didnt read the book, discussion can be bad",
                "Wide selection of texts. Moves at a very brisk pace which allows a lot of material to be covered, but can be hard to keep up. It's clear what the assignments are I, and what's wanted for them. Very interesting questions that discussions which arise in class prompt, however sometimes feel like some of the main 'themes' or questions which we come back to throughout the semester could be more explicitly laid out. No framework is presented to think about recurring concerns - I suspect this is by design, I wonder about the usefulness and value of one. Knowing about the internal units within the texts assigned earlier might've been interesting? Perhaps also letting us know the big picture, publishing a here are the things I want to talk about today in class could be useful in getting a sense of what to pick up from texts? Though I suppose that runs the risk of pigeonholing the conversation into those preset topics and doesn't allow for more spontaneous discussions about aspects which might otherwise be overlooked."

                "Definitely! Professor Gaddis is a gem and the books are pretty good. There is a decent structure to the semester, which makes the paper manageable.",
                "Yes.  Without a doubt, one of the best courses I've taken at this school.  Even the final a brutal slog of a paper  was one of the most stimulating intellectual activities I've ever engaged in.",
                "Yes",
                "As mentioned above, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was really cool to write a biography using primary source material about a person that few know about, but the best part was being encouraged by Gaddis to write the biography non-traditionally. If you can believe it, I ended up writing a quasi-fictional story, which never would've flown in another history course. If you want to have the space to explore a new type of writing, take this course!",
                "Yes. It is an excellent course. I would argue it is one of the core take courses.",
                "I would if they are interested in reading/writing biography. I think that the amount of \"expertise\" that I developed in the class felt like less than in other, more focused courses, but in general, I enjoyed the class and I still think that I learned a great deal.",
                "Yes, 100% its one of the best classes Ive taken at Yale",
                "This is a very intense course with a high work load. The questions that it ends up asking you about what kind of live is worth reading and writing about, what comparisons can you make between different the people who have been biographed and read in class is immensely interesting. You have to put in a lot of work, but I think you can get a lot of it. Because you don't write on any of the books, you could plausibly coast along without doing much of the work but then I think you'd be wasting everyone's time by doing that. Gaddis is great and has lots of great things to say, gems to listen to. It's well worth doing, just be prepared to put a lot of work in"
