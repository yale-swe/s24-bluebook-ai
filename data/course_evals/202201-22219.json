                "Strengths: Interesting discussion of the basic models mentioned in principal-agent literature. Detailed notes were provided to help us better understand rather difficult topics. Four Problem Sets, Take-Home Midterm, Take-Home Final\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of in-person office hours, Problem Sets were all assigned in the last few weeks of class",
                "Interesting and relevant topic.",
                "Legal material was very interesting and definitely unique to this class. Economic material was not particularly new or advanced. I sometimes felt that the legal and economic content were a bit too separated at times-- spending more time working on the integration of the two would have been interesting. Overall, Professor Brooks was very knowledgeable and engaging. \r\nOrganization was a weak point of the course. Designated readings were not super clear, and problem sets were all assigned at the back end of the semester-- it would have been better to have had a more even distribution across the semester.",
                "Strengths are that the content of the course is fascinating and a really great selection of papers are assigned as reading. Organization of the syllabus could be improved and more straightforward guidance about expectations for assignments would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: one-of-a-kind course, really interesting topics, especially if you're thinking about going into law.\r\nWeaknesses: course felt kinda disorganized at times.  Unclear deadlines and grading policies.",
                "Strengths: I was excited to attend class every session!",
                "Strengths: Interesting course material, very unique to talk about law and economics. Nice professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class very disorganized",

                "Any student interested in law and economics broadly would definitely benefit from taking the course-- there is a lot of material to be had here. Hopefully, the course will be better organized in future iterations-- assignments were not spaced out well and mostly all given at the end of the semester.",
                "I would recommend this course! Especially if you are an Econ major considering law school. I think its a great introduction to the ways that the logic and methods of Economics\/Game Theory can help us to better understand fundamental questions about the law.",

                "Yes, I would reccomend it to any economics student.",
                "Probably not. While the course material itself is interesting and worthwhile pursuing, the class itself is too disorganized to make an enjoyable or rewarding learning experience. We did not have a single grade in the class going into the final, and additionally it was unclear what topics we would cover each weak and the readings we needed to do since we stopped following the syllabus around week 2 or 3. The class is rather laid back and the professor is very nice, but I don't think this compensates for the disorganization.",
                "Yes, I thought it was an interesting course and I dont think there are many that explore the intersection between economics and law specifically."
