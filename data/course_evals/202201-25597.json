However the professors and TAs always tried to check in with us students and offered help/support whenever needed. Slack was a great way of communication too ;). \r\n\r\nWeakness - by the limits of a lab course, we werent able to fully make research/scientific advances each week. Due to limits of time, we often had to discard bad results and adopt results from previous semesters... which was our best choice in our interest of time, but unfortunate."
