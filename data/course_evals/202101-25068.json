Out of my entire semester, this course was definitely the one in which I learned the most concrete knowledge. I feel infinitely more confident in my ability to read the news, or any other complex constitutional issue and be equipped with the tools to properly interpret it. Professor Amar and Ben were amazing in teaching a course that incorporated history, political science and the law in a way that felt coherent and robust.",

                "I wish the class either followed the text more closely, was more of an open conversation format, or was a pure lecture given by Professor Amar. I also enjoyed the first half of the class which featured lecture videos to accompany the text. I wish those were available for the final book (or spread out for the duration of the class).",

                "This course was amazing in that it gave us the opportunity to discuss anything we wanted from the readings or from our own curiosity into class through the reading responses. I also loved Professor Amar's books and lectures, and studying them closely provided me with so much information and nuanced argument that I never would have known otherwise. In terms of improvements, I think it would be helpful if we maybe spent one session a week specifically focused on an aspect from the reading so I could feel more prepared for discussions, and perhaps another session every week on reading responses/personal interest questions. That would be useful just so students with less background knowledge could prepare from the readings to contribute too.",
                "This course is not super structured, which is both a strength and a weakness. It is a strength because it means the students often drive the class in terms of what we are discussing, but a weakness in that it is difficult to be completely engaged and well-versed in every discussion topic (especially if it is getting into niche legal issues). Overall, it's a good course, and Prof Amar and the TFs are so knowledgeable about the field, so that is a major plus.",
                "The books are well written and are good and important reads. The class discussion often gets bogged down in minutiae or obscure constitutional hypotheticals."

As a seminar, the class is pretty unstructured and led by student discussions, which ultimately end up being rants by the professor.  Akhil Amar definitely knows what he is talking about, but his comments oftentimes leave little open for discussion for the students, and he is occasionally quite dismissive of student contributions along with being one of the most egotistical professors I've had.  Nonetheless, the class is pretty enjoyable but simply not the best way of learning the basics of constitutional law in my opinion.  Also, for any prospective students, please note that professor Amar goes over time nearly every class.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in American history, law, and even social issues more generally. Professor Amar is a passionate and incredibly knowledgeable professor who cares deeply about the intellectual progress of his students. The arguments he presented and the way he focused on both subject matter as well as methods of constitutional interpretation is something I will never forget, and hope to carry on throughout my life to matters both legal and beyond.",
                "I mean, it's really difficult to pass up an opportunity to take a class with Amar. He knows the field so well, so it was great to her his insight (and often strong opinion) about different constitutional issues that are extremely prevalent today. Especially for political science or other adjacent majors, I would recommend this course.",
                "I would not prioritize this course if someone is choosing between this and another class. I took it as a second semester senior and it was interesting, but it was far from the most engaging or riveting course I've taken."
