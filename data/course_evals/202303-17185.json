                "I learned the fundamental tenets of Roman law involving persons and property. I learned how to apply these laws through case studies. I also learned about the historical context of Roman law in areas such as womens' rights, slavery, and international law.",

                "I wished Professor Lenski had held office hours. It would be awesome to be able to come talk to him.",
                "Strengths: great overview of everything in the textbook. Fun use of primary sources and archaeological evidence (codices, coins, papyri). Great application of the law in case studies in section.\r\nWeaknesses: It was difficult to integrate lecture materials (especially the History lectures) with the long conceptual big-picture questions. More essay-writing and writing assignments would have helped, but a lot of the assignments were simply case studies/application. The write your own case study assignment was especially unhelpful (we did not even need to provide the solution to the case study.)",
                "Strengths: Professor Lenski was a great lecturer with great slides, the slides were a great supplement / reinforcement of the reading,  I had a great TA (Rafail Zoulis), case studies were engaging and made us apply the principles we learned in the reading\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I felt that some of the readings we had that were not in the Borkowski textbook were kind of unnecessary, some of the problem sets could have been shorter",
                "Good course assignments, lectures and weekly work. Can encourage more student engagement in sections.",
                "Strengths - Professor Lenski is a great lecturer and is very engaging. I found the case studies to be an interesting way to apply what we learned each week in class instead of just discussing the readings. Weaknesses - Midterm/Exam was difficult to prepare for given that so much content was covered, although they were not unreasonably difficult. Readings were also a reasonable length but could be dense and sort of boring as they were largely sourced from a single textbook.",
                "Overall, the course was excellent! It has been one of my favorite courses at Yale, and I definitely learned a lot. I loved the course design, and thought it struck a great balance between theory and history. Given my own interest in the law, I personally enjoyed the topics discussed and the class structure. Prof. Lenski is also an amazing instructor. During the class, he was clearly both very passionate and knowledgeable about the Roman law subjects discussed. \r\n\r\nThe class definitely involves a lot of work, and you'll have to be very organized to do well in it. Perhaps the only weakness of this course was the grading, which was a little too harsh at times and not made very clear. For example, the standards of the midterm exam weren't clearly-outlined and it caused lots of confusion, as well as large point deductions. In the ID section, for instance, even if you identified and wrote the correct answers, you would still get points deducted for not explaining them as detailedly as expected by Prof. Lenski's grading rubric  even though the section was just an 'identification section.' This was a little frustrating, though Prof. Lenski fortunately did clarify his standards after the midterm in anticipation for the final, which was helpful. For future iterations, it might be beneficial to make these grading explanations before the midterm.",
                "Strengths: engaging, challenging, applications to modern law\r\nWeaknesses: n/a",
                "Lectures dont always line up with case studies. Readings are dense for the amount of important information actually being conveyed, best split among several students in a study group."

                "YES. I really loved this course. Such a fun way to engage my mind in a way that is different from a lot of other classes. When I had the time, I loved to really take my time with the case studies and work my way through them-- it was like a fun puzzle. I appreciate Professor Lenski's sense of humor. Professor Lenski and  Rafail Zoulis were both really amazing.",
                "Yes, a good course to learn about the workings of a law school course.",
                "Only if they were interested in the subject and okay with having to memorize a lot of information. It's definitely not an unmanageable workload, but the class requires effort that is above-average for a typical history course. This is because it is structured differently from a typical history course; the assignments for section as well as the midterm/final are very law/application focused, rather than so much on history.",
                "Yes, great class were you will learn a lot of interesting things without drowning in work.",
