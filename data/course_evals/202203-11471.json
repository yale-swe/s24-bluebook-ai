                "Strength: Small class sizes, excellent instructor, rigorous coursework. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Class assignments were occasionally too cumbersome to be completed thoroughly. For instance, on the last week of classes, we had an 8 minute skit and and a test covering five units of material on back-to-back days. It is difficult to give other classes the attention they deserve when we face a back-breaking schedule such as this. Another weakness is that the materials, particularly the course workbook, are not available online. This is the only class at Yale I've taken that requires lots of paperwork, which made things difficult to keep track of because my system for organization is entirely online.",
                "The videos seemed to be a bit outdated. The learning model was also entirely conducted in French. Because of this, at times I found it hard to grasp complex grammar rules or vocabulary that we've never learned before.",
                "I thought this course was very engaging from the start. Class is conducted entirely in French from the first class, which is really helpful in learning the language.",
                "Lowering the amount of homework assigned.",
                "The strengths of the course were Professor Kosman's teaching and the amount of exercises/worksheets/opportunities she gave us to learn. I always felt supported through whatever questions or difficulties I had through her language exercises and office hours. The weakness of the course was that I sometimes felt like the French department didn't make it very clear what we would be tested on each week. For instance, we rarely received a vocabulary list for each unit. While this hands-off approach encouraged me to take greater initiative in my learning, I think, it did led to some confusion for our class throughout the semester."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! I loved beginning French through this class, and I feel like I learned so much about the language and French culture over the course of the semester. Moreover, Professor Kosman is a fantastic instructor!"
