                "I gained a basic knowledge of some of the most famous political thinkers from Machiavelli up through Arendt. Every thinker we read has unique ideas that are truly thought-provoking and have had a massive impact on societies all over the world. Being able to know first hand what Machiavellian means or how the idea of a social contract took shape is really cool.",
                "Learned how to engage with difficult texts and discuss in a high level classroom discussion setting.",
                "I learned about how early modern to 20th century history shaped political thought and its development during this time",
                "I gained familiarity with key texts in historical and political thought. I developed critical reasoning and essay writing skills.",
                "I gained a lot of the political context Id been missing from the past 5 centuries and learned to discuss it using accurate language",
                "I learned to read more effectively by looking for common ideas across different works. For example, systems of government have been a continuous theme over this semester, and we really dug into a diverse set of perspectives on this issue.",
                "I became a much more thorough reader of text in this class. A lot of the authors this semester are making relatively complex arguments that needed to be tracked through the readings and are not always in the clearest language. I think I got better at unpacking those arguments over the course of the semester, and could follow Arendt better than Hobbes because of it.",
                "I gained a wide-ranging exposure to an evolution of ideas in historical theory and politics. This course provided skills for quickly and effectively analyzing dense text and drawing intertextual connections.",
                "By taking this course, I gained a solid introduction to the range of historians and thinkers explored by Directed Studies' Historical and Political Thought spring term course. I also learned how to write a better argumentative essay."

            "comments": [
                "This course has a fantastic reading list. Every thinker makes major contributions to political theory and leaves you thinking about their ideas. It was especially rewarding to engage with thinkers whose views we might consider untraditional or even radical today and try to parse out why they thought the way they did. The papers also provide a great opportunity to engage with one or two ideas on a much deeper levelI found H&P papers to be the most rewarding DS papers to write. This helped counteract the one weakness I see in this course which is the unmanageable amount of reading. But you just kind of accept that some of it will need to be skimmed and that readings are for breadth while seminars and papers offer more depth.",
                "Strengths: So many! One of the only classes in DS that comprehensively covered most of the reading. Historical context given to ground the texts. Engaging class and discussions.\r\n\r\nWeakness: None",
                "this course was excellent in all ways",
                "Strengths: good teaching, interesting and important texts, helpful lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "It could be improved by replacing Hegel with another author, since I felt that we read too little of Hegel to really get a sense of his positions, and the material ended up being confusing. The strengths are the links between our authors and modern historical events. The material felt closely connected to events I've learned about elsewhere.",
                "This course's strength lay in its breadth. I really enjoyed the intellectual journey from Machiavelli to Du Bois. Further, the design of the course by Professor Semmel allowed our attention to be quickly directed to compelling excerpts from the course's dense texts. \r\n\r\nI believe this course could be improved through the introduction of more radical theory and the introduction of more shared vocabulary for discussing politics and government.",
                "I enjoyed this course a lot. Although we couldn't spend much time on any one thinker, it was gratifying at the end of the semester to look back on all the different themes and see how the different thinkers connected to one another."

                "yes i would--it is an incredible way to engage with some of the most important political ideas of all time",
                "Yes this course was interesting and as comprehensive as it could have been, given the number of texts to be read in a single semester. The professor was great and I felt that my writing improved substantially during this course.",
                "Yes!!! I loved this semester of HP; I found it engaging and relevant. Its a must for any politically minded humanities student",
                "I would recommend it to anyone interested in political science. Coming in, I thought I knew quite a bit about the theories behind modern political systems; I was wrong. This course has taught me a great many foundational ideas, but I now know there's still so much more to learn. It's definitely worth your time.",
                "Yes. The texts this course presents are critical texts for understanding the modern political state of affairs. I do sometimes wish the relevance had been made more explicit in classroom discussion, and that comparisons in writers' approaches had been more clear.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Semmel is a great professor and the texts we read are interesting. Professor Semmel incorporated our contributions and one-liners into class discussions while still steering the discussion to cover key points. He was very conscious of balancing the discussion and making sure everyone had a chance to talk. He also offered an abundance of office hours and gave very helpful and thorough essay feedback."
