    "Undergrad: The basics of genetic analysis! It was fun, the problem sets weren't too bad. The professors in general tried to keep things interesting, and the TAs were understanding. Take it because it will help you with research down the road.",
    "I learned about many fields of genetics including epigenetics, conducting large genetic screens etc.",
    "I learned a great deal about experimentation in the field of genetics and recent trends in the field.",
    "I learned how more about the current state of genetics as a discipline of study by reading scientific articles."

   "comments": [
    "Strength: It was great to learn from so many leaders in the field. Also, Jun is just amazing\r\n\r\nWeakness: Reading the primarily literature was really difficult at times. Sometimes the mathematics went right over everyone's heads.",
    "One strength of the course is that you get very familiar with primary literature in the area of genetics as you have to read papers for section (and this is one of those sections where you have to read the paper beforehand or it will be very obvious). One weakness is that the lectures often felt disconnected due to the switching of instructors between lectures. Also, the course did not really have any overall structure, but was split into essentially small modules of two or three classes per topic. An overarching structure would've been helpful in keeping the contents of the course in order (especially since there is no final).",
    "One strength is that the course does a good job of making clear the differences regarding how experimental methodologies used to be, and how they are today. One weakness is that the question-answering format of section, in which students were expected to answer questions in turn. I think it would have been more useful for students to contribute to questions \/ discussion areas that they felt they could add something interesting to, rather than the randomized system.",
    "Strengths: No midterms or final exam. Only take home quizzes (that can be quite challenging at times). TAs were nice and helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Professor quality varied significantly, and each week's reading assignment was consequently easier or more difficult because of that. In section there was an emphasis on understanding only the figures, which placed the overall themes in the course out of focus."

   "comments": [
    "Yep! great elective! or just take as a grad course, that's also good!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other MB&B majors looking for a senior requirement. As MB&B majors, we learn all of the mechanisms behind genetics, but rarely learn about genetics itself. This class is a pretty good survey of different topics in modern and traditional genetics, and it also focuses on analyzing primary literature, which is a good skill to have in science. Moreover, the class is not that much work and there are no exams or a final, only take home questions.",
    "I would recommend this course. Compared to the undergrad genetics class, this class is much more focused on giving a broad overview of the field of genetics as it is today rather than on rote memorization of facts (as is exemplified by the lack of any midterms or final exams). The problem sets for the most part involve analyzing primary literature and coming up with experimental designs, which I think is much more instructive than problem sets in the undergraduate course would be. Overall, would definitely take this course again, especially over the undergraduate genetics course.",
    "Yes, the course provides a good background to important and growing areas of genetics research.",
    "I would recommend the course if you want something rather \"chill\". But do not underestimate this course. If you take it, work with others to brainstorm responses to the take home quizzes."
