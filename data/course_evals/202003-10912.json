                "This course is very thorough and definitely provides you with a good understanding of German language and grammar. I definitely feel like I understand the grammatical concepts we learned, as opposed to just memorizing them for the exams. I also feel like this course allowed us to practice reading, writing, speaking, and understanding German--it was very well rounded. Sometimes the course felt like it was moving very quickly. I wish we had a bit more time to review material that we learned independently in the homework or asynchronous classwork.",
                "The MAJOR strength of this course is the section lecturers. Liese Sippel and Ido Ben Harush are incredibly patient and considerate towards the students, which makes for incredibly entertaining live virtual sessions (notice that I am saying having just A1 fluency in German). The grading is adequate for an introductory language class, where it is expected that students will make occasional mistakes. Indeed, this encourages students to go beyond the Wortschatz (vocabulary in the textbook) and try new structures and vocabulary without being penalized for doing so wrongly. \r\n\r\nFeedback was always very clear, and the instructors are willing to stay some minutes after class to answer some questions.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness that I would note is the uneven workload across the semester in terms of activities on asynchronous days. Some days it would take 20 minutes to finish, but others it could take up to 2-3 hours.",
                "The workload assigned on asynchronous days far exceeded the number of hours of work on a synchronous day and throughout the semester it seemed like that amount of work only increased."

                "Overall, I thought the course ran very smoothly in the online format. I thought the use of breakout rooms worked very well and allowed us to practice our German in smaller groups. Although we could not practice speaking German in person, there were a lot of opportunities to practice our spoken German using online recordings. One aspect of the course that could be improved is the asynchronous work; it was sometimes confusing and a bit overwhelming.",
                "The Zoom live sessions were definitely the highlight of the semester. I would suggest that the German Department replace the asynchronous component of the class with a synchronous component, so that workload can be more predictable. As an alternative to keep the asynchronous component, I would highly recommend revising the length of those assignments to make them more even."

                "I would definitely recommend it! *Especially* if it's being taught by Liese Sippel and Ido Ben Harush. You will learn a lot of German in just one semester in a relatively low-pressure environment, where the focus is on learning a language as opposed to mastering a vocabulary sheet."
