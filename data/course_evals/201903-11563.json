   "comments": [
    "I learned what I expected to learn coming in: between 440 and 441 a good theoretical basis of quantum mechanics.",
    "I developed very strong background of quantum mechanics, which will be valuable throughout my life as a researcher.",
    "This covers the second half of quantum mechanics, and roughly the second half of Shankar's textbook, so angular momentum, Hydrogen atom, spins, perturbation theory, scattering, etc.",
    "Linear algebra, fundamentals of quantum mechanics",
    "I gained a lot more understanding of quantum theory, and got a better idea of how modern physics works at the basic level. I also learned a lot about problem-solving and physical intuition.",
    "Spin, Adding angular momentum, Variational and WKB Methods, Time-Independent Perturbation Theory, Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory, Scattering Theory, The Dirac Equation (CH 14-20 of Shankar)",
    "An understanding of angular momentum and spin, perturbation theory, and applications to scattering problems.",
    "We learned about symmetries (e.g., translational, rotational, parity) and how we can use them to glean physical insights. We spent a good amount of time on the hydrogen atom, followed by perturbation theory and a nice finale: the DIrac equation. Compared to QM 1, there was a lot more approximation, so you'll get good at simplifying problems and knowing when you can neglect certain things. There was a pretty theoretical introduction to spin as well.",
    "General overview of quantum mechanics. Also reviews linear algebra. Some connections to thermodynamics and classical mechanics.",
    "Angular momentum, spin, perturbation theory, scattering, the Good Gospel of the One Electron",
    "I now have a reasonable grasp on spin, addition of angular momenta, perturbation theory, and other approximation methods used in quantum mechanics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Maybe the last lecture on scattering could be given in a clearer way.",
    "The class is smaller than 440 (less than half as many people took it) so it was easier to slow Shankar down and ask questions. Like first semester quantum, I feel like the homework was too focused on complicated linear algebra proofs rather than conceptual understanding of quantum.",
    "I think the midterm grading was a little rough in terms of partial credit, and I probably could have benefitted from increased time spent in class introducing the subjects before we dove into them because I felt a little unmoored in the subject material often. Following up in office hours helps quite a bit",
    "The lectures and assigned problem sets were very useful. The review sessions before each exam with the professor were helpful, but those held by the TA were not very helpful, due to a lack of focus and planning.",
    "Shankar is a brilliant instructor who really cares about teaching and he literally wrote the course book.",
    "Strengths: the material is interesting, and Prof Shankar was very receptive about answering questions during class\r\nWeaknesses: the tests were formatted such that they often emphasized speed and memorizing equations, rather than problem solving and deep understandings of the material. Even being able to bring a formula sheet in would have been useful. Would have been interesting to see the material applied to relevant experiments (perhaps via reading topical papers, etc.)",
    "The textbook is pretty frustrating and not very easy to understand, and lectures are often incomplete, requiring knowledge from the textbook to fully understand them. I think using a different textbook would be helpful, and if the professor brought notes so that the lectures were better organized that would be good.",
    "Lectures move quickly and not enough summarizing\/reinforcing previous material. Very receptive to feedback and to questions.",
    "There is some misunderstanding between the professor and the students in the class about expected workload. But the professor was very willing to hear students' feedback and made lots of changes to make the course more accessible.",
    "The strengths of this course are that it follows the textbook closely, Prof. Shankar does a good job of conveying the central idea of each concept in lectures, and the topics and problem sets are well-organized. The weaknesses of this course are that the problem sets do not prepare you for the midterm and final. While problem sets are enlightening about derivations and interrelated concepts, we did not get enough repeated practice with problems to really hit the calculations home. Meanwhile, the exams were not derivation-focused but more like practice problems. Personally, while these kinds of problems don't seem \"enlightening\" I need that kind of repeated practice to understand and get a hang of topics. I can't just read about the derivation and the overarching concepts\/strategies then execute them on an exam. \r\n\r\nRelated to this, it was extremely frustrating that we did not receive solutions to problem sets week by week (and for the second half of the course's Psets... ever). So for the few problems we did have to work with, I did not have a guideline to go off of for problems I did wrong.\r\n\r\nAll of this is to say that the problems\/processes that were treated as trivial to the professor and TA are actually of utmost importance to a student learning quantum mechanics for the first time."

   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn quantum, there really is no alternative to this course. At times it can be tedious and confusing, but you will come out the other side with a good grasp of quantum physics.",
    "Of course, I will! It is the best course on QM which I have ever heard of. QM is very hard to learn, bus Prof. Shankar made it very friendly to students. His lectures is even better than his book.",
    "Yes, it's better than 440 was more interesting, easier to interact with the professor, etc. It's not the kind of class you should casually take if you're not a physics major.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to another student.",
    "The difficulty of the material covered in the latter half of this 440-441 combo is a steep departure from the former. This being said, it is all really interesting stuff, I just wish it were explained more clearly. I think what would really help this course is another textbook, bc frankly I don't think Shankar's is really that great at explaining things to those of us who will not end up being physics professors.",
    "Yes, especially if Shankar is teaching it again!!",
    "Overall, required if you're on the intensive track -- material wise, QM has lots of interesting tidbits though sometimes Prof Shankar's textbook moves quickly between steps, making it a bit hard to follow. The TA (Ridge) was wonderfully helpful.",
    "No. This course was incredibly frustrating and I don't feel like I really learned a lot of the material. Obviously it is required for the intensive physics major so many people will continue to take it, and it's not so awful that you shouldn't be a physics major. But if you're only kinda considering the major I definitely wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Yes, but only if they have taken other challenging physics classes, because it is hard to catch up unless you are always on top of your game.",
    "Only if you need it for the physics major"
