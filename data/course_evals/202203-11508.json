There are multiple paths within the concept of colonialism which I had not previously been aware of that now I feel capable of exploring further. I have developed new skills for consuming literature as well. We discussed \"lens essays\" and methods for comparing contrasting forms of literature which revealed a new depth to our readings. I was able to apply these skills to my other reading based classes as I learned them, and plan to use the skills in the future.",
                "Writing an academic paper, analyzing papers, introductory concepts in postcolonial studies.",
                "I learned how to write academic essays, which include close reading, lens essays, and a research paper. The course also provided an introduction to colonialism, especially in the African context, introducing Fanon. The most important part was learning how to write a clear, strong thesis.",
                "I have developed a holistic comprehension of the decolonization movement in general and the psychological, cultural, and political factors at work in decolonization in particular. I have also developed more advanced writing skills as well as a conception of how to evaluate whether one work is good or not.",
                "I developed critical analysis, concision, and close reading skills.",

                "I felt that Professor Danny truly helped me analyze the texts we read to a deeper level and helped make me a more efficient writer. I learned about how impactful post-colonialism is and how it influenced our society today as well through many films and scholarly essays.",
                "I've gained a broader perspective on the relevance of colonization in post-colonial cultures. From language to film, the impact of colonial power on former colonies seems to continue through the years. I found that really interesting."

                "This course is strongest in its development of the skills necessary for creating an argumentative essay. The postcolonial subject matter was extremely thought provoking and I enjoyed our readings immensely, but as an English 114 class there was not enough time or space to fully engage with the subject. At it's heart, this is a wonderful writing course that made me feel more confident in my understanding of what college-level writing demands.",
                "The strength was the professor, who provided a lot of input on each essay assignment and was always eager to help with an assignment available. The essay inputs were clear and the feedback was very clear. He was very accommodating in terms of assignments and was always encouraging.\r\n\r\nWeakness: We did not dive too deep into colonialism but more of an introduction to colonialism's effects because of the complexity of the consequences. Students in the class did not have much experience in colonialism-related literature, and since this class is not a lecture class but rather a discussions focused class, you do not necessarily learn as much about colonialism as compared to a lecture class.",
                "maybe the number of students can be cut down by 4, and the overall time for each section would be more suitable.",
                "A strength of this class that it attains a great amount of depth in regard to the breadth of colonial practices while still emphasizing key writing skills. The course could be improved by incorporating more modern and less dense texts.",
                "Strengths - doable amount of reading, interesting discussions, good classroom dynamic, fair grading, and responsiveness/investment from the teacher - he really cared about every student!",
                "Strengths: The professor's feedback was this course's biggest strength. Professor Daniel, gave thorough advice on writing assignments to ensure you can understand what areas of your writing needed improvement. Further, every assignment could be resubmitted which allowed for students to actually learn from mistakes and write better. The caliber of assigned readings was this seminar's next great strength. We managed to always have compelling and interesting texts which made homework rather enjoyable and the seminar discussions fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "1 on 1 attention\r\nProfessor Danny really cared about the students and helped all of us become better students and writers\r\nReally emphasized finding deeper meaning\r\nEncouraged collaboration between students through peer-editing\r\nHelped facilitate discussions very well\r\nI enjoyed every part of the course."

                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course! It was my favorite class this semester. Professor Danny quickly created a welcoming environment which made everyone comfortable sharing their thoughts in a seminar style discussion. Our reading material was consistently interesting and unfolded the subject of colonialism at an appropriate speed for what is fundamentally a writing class. In addition to providing debate sparking ideas to our class discussions, Professor Danny offers great advice and inspiring comments on assignments. He was extremely responsive to what my classmates and I needed to develop in our writing and what we needed in terms of reading and time to complete those writing goals.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course as it provides an introduction to colonialism for anyone that is interested. I would also take this course just because of the professor and how encouraging he is during essay assignments and discussions in general.",
                "Yes, for they would learn quite a lot, and the instructor is also a very nice person whose patience and kindness can make sure students get more than what is intended in the curriculum.",

                "I'd recommend it!",
                "I would highly recommend this course. The readings highlight perspectives colonialism that are invaluable to understanding of post-colonialism. Additionally, the professor's insight allows for growth as a writer and his guidance during seminars ensures that you fully understand what the authors are conveying.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because I feel that this course helped improve my writing in so many ways and made me a more confident speaker. Furthermore, this course never overwhelmed me as it progressively increased the workload to help us eventually write our very own research paper. I am so glad I took this course.",
