                "The repertoire of speakers that were invited to speak to the students was of the very highest of standards and allowed students to gain deep insights into key issues and challenges faced by global leaders.",
                "Strenghts: interesting lectures and readings, light work load\r\nWeaknesses: Some topics gone through on a surface level as with one lecture can not get into depth.",
                "GLBL 101 benefits from featuring World Fellows as guest lecturers. Consequently, the range of material that we cover is broader and more comprehensively, with concrete, real-world examples used to contextualize the topics covered in class.",
                "The guest lecturers are both the strength and weakness of this course. While they are all quite accomplished and have very interesting backgrounds in the context of IR, some are more able to give engaging hour-long lectures than others. I also learned a lot about many global affairs topics I didn't know too much, if anything, about. At the same time, given the nature of the intro course, it was a bit unfortunate to not discuss them in any depth.",
                "nice",
                "The course does a great job of having students gain a diverse understanding of the global affairs topic by focusing on historic and current events from around the world.",
                "I appreciated hearing from guest speakers, as it made the class engaging and relevant. I have no suggestions for improvement of this course.",
                "some weeks lectures were very interesting however other weeks could be very boring",
                "Strengths: Sky's lectures, the readings, and section were all very interesting\r\nWeaknesses: Many of the Yale World Fellows lectures were disorganized and hard to follow, overall class engagement was low",
                "The strengths of this course are that it allows for students to sample different topics. This comes with a downside, there are some lectures that I was not at all engaged with and lacked the motivation to attend.",
                "This class has tons of critical information that needs to be addressed to all students throughout Yale. It was very interesting throughout the whole semester learning about the past and present affairs that go on throughout the world.\r\n\r\nNot many weaknesses for this course, although if you have no background on any of this information you will need to do a lot of reading and research to truly understand the topics that are talked about and addressed in this course throughout the semester.",
                "I think this was an amazing course and I have no recommendations to improve it.",
                "great lectures but be tu broad topics for the final papers",
                "The strength of this course was the level of expertise of the guest lecturers. A weakness, however, was that the class had a US centric nature which became quite repetitive and annoying.",
                "I enjoyed this course since a variety of topics and world problems were addressed and as such, I briefly learned about a wide range of topics, which allowed me to develop an interest in new areas. \r\n\r\nHowever, I believe that a weakness in this course was the disparity in terms of quality between the different lectures. While some lectures were very interesting and well planned, others were unorganized and monotonous. Thus, the class really depended on the lecturer and their commitment to a good, interactive presentation.",
                "Engagement within discussion was a strength; guest speakers were great.",
                "The course was very surface-level at times, but it gave a nice overview of some of the key global affairs issues of our time.",
                "Very insightful and interesting class. Real world problems that kept the class interested",
                "I think the course should do a better job of going into more detail about each topic, or perhaps even focusing on fewer so that certain ones can be further explored. \r\nI enjoyed how the course had many expert speakers on the topics come and teach classes.",
                "The best thing about the course was the great number of skillful and engaging guest lecturers. The course could be improved by adding a bit more theory on international relations, as well as encouraging more fruitful debates on modern-day issues in class or section.",
                "The strengths are certainly the lecturers as they are very interesting and come from a breadth of topics. The weaknesses were that some of the lectures seemed to end before the full time of the class and then seemed to just fill time until the end of class.",
                "The strength of this course is its diversity in topics and speakers. It was a unique experience to have a different speaker each lecture to give a unique perspective on global events. I think the course could be improved by posting the speakers presentations on canvas after their lecture to make it easier to use their information for the midterm\/final papers.",
                "Strengths - The lecturers were on some occasions amazing! A former Governor, a current Ambassador, a human rights lawyer, etc. There were brilliant insights during each lecture. The professor is also very knowledgeable and a valuable asset, which is why it was sad to see such little involvement with the course towards the middle\/end. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - By far, the disorganization of the course hurt it the most. It was frustrating to be given an assignment with little to no guidance on what the professor\/TA was looking for, and I think the course suffered from a lack of engagement because of this. Second, the lectures and readings were, by and large, optionalvery little of the information presented in either of these were necessary to complete the assignments and because of that, the class felt like an option to attend. Regardless of how interesting the material is, if its not immediately pertinent to the required assignments, its hard to justify attendance. Toward the end of the course, when workload from other courses started adding up, I started attending lectures and doing readings less and less, unless I knew the speaker was notable or the material was necessary for research we had to conduct.",
                "The second half of this course was a waste of time. The lectures were hard to follow and did not come together to show any sort of trend or overall big picture of the current state of the world. The first lectures were fascinating, but the second half of the semester did not make the course worthwhile.",
                "Strengths: some of the guest lecturers are fantastic and present interesting content from around the world, my teaching fellow was very knowledgeable and always willing to talk about his experience, we covered a few topics in depth like great power competition. Weaknesses: the class seemed a bit disorganized and sometimes the lectures did not quite line up with the syllabus, by the second half of the semester much less than half the class showed up to lecture and engagement was low. I wish we would have covered in section how to write a policy memo before being asked to write one for the midterm.",
                "It was interesting to have a bunch of different speakers however i think the lectures could be a bit long sometimes.",
                "The class should be more engaging and focus less on western perspectives.",
                "More organized with office hours.",
                "Strengths - Provides an overview of a good multitude of topics. Sections moderated by insightful TFs provide a great venue for fruitful discussion.\r\nWeaknesses - Felt that a lot of those topics were approached from a very US-centric perspective - not enough emphasis, I don't think, on the perspectives of other agents, such as multilaterals.",
                "This course was amazing, as it engaged students via the caliber of lecturers and its topics. This was an introductory global affairs course, and it accomplished its goal of getting students excited to take on the world in their studies in the future.",
                "A fine survey course for dipping your toes in the water of Global Affairs. If you are knowledgeable generally about current events across the globe you won't gain too much insight. Solid course if you aren't.",
                "I really liked how the course had a different speaker every lecture, I thought that was a very interesting system. I do think however, that we could have had more engagement with professor Sky herself. Also, I don't know if this is simply because I enjoyed them, but the sections seemed to go by really quickly.",
                "The strengths of this course include sections being ran incredibly well. Also, section leaders were always extremely helpful with any questions about the course. One weakness I found was with so few assignments, it is hard to show gradual improvement in the course.",
                "Strengths: excellent guest speakers, flexible assignments that allow students to explore areas they are interested in, class organization, \r\nWeaknesses: Because every lecture focuses on a new topic, students do not learn about any one topic in-depth.",
                "Strengths - Interesting and relevant information, lecture style by multiple speakers, powerful discussions in section\r\nWeakness - Possibly individual speakers with topics that do not fit greater theme of the class. Required readings missing the idea of lecture"

Much of the stuff we learned was extremely surface level, which made lectures quite tedious. Guest lecturers started out very strong early in the year but gradually got very hit or miss later on in the semester. There was really no reason to go to lecture at all because you didn't need the information presented in the lecture to do well on the midterm and final assignments. This class is the definition of a gut, but left me very disinterested as a poly sci major.",
