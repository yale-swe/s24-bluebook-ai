    "I learned the basics of German!",

    "I gained insight into a culture different from my own. I gained proper pronunciations and words in German.",
    "Began learning  German",
    "I learned the basics of German, and I discovered I really liked German language and culture. I also made really great connections with the German department, both in and outside of the classroom. I loved this class and cannot wait until L2!",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Fun, simple, efficient. This course teaches you the basics so you can start speaking German even if you've never had any experience with it before. It doesn't over-complicate things and is very well structured.",
    "A great strength of the course is that I have a lot of opportunities to speak in class. Just being able to practice speaking so often with the guidance of a native speaker was the most helpful part of the class. The homework assignments were a great complement to the class because it allowed me to develop vocabulary and practice reading comprehension. However, the class could be improved by including more reading comprehension in class.",
    "This course is very engaging with a variety of projects and outside events to make learning German more inviting.",
    "The course focused entirely on getting engaged in the material and really loving German culture.",
    "Meeting 5 Times a day quickly becomes a drag, and makes the class much less interesting and engaging",
    "I think the course was nearly perfect. I loved the immersion from day one, and I loved the small setting and intimate class. It was really a great place to get to know each other and learn together--it felt like a miniature community of beginning German learners, and it felt we could count on each other (there was a noted lack of competitiveness\/judgement which was very nice!) The only think I think could be improved is the Kontakte program. Oftentimes, I'd face technical difficulties with it, and this was just frustrating, as it made me sort-of annoyed with German.",
    "This class is very well organized. It is a bit fast-paced but overall it is a great class.",
    "This course was very helpful and worked well."

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended for anyone who has not taken German before!",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It was the best language instruction I have received thus far. I can already have complete conversations in German. The instruction in the class taught me how to grasp overall meaning without knowing specific vocabulary and use the vocabulary I already have to communicate effectively.",
    "Yes, I thought that the curriculum was interesting, the workload was easy to manage, and the variety of optional outside-of-class activities which were held to stimulate learning were helpful for learning language skills that are harder to teach in a classroom and grow more through continuous conversation.",
    "This course was wonderful!",
    "Yes! I absolutely LOVED this course. It was my favorite course. Every morning (German was my first class of the day), I would be excited to go to German class, and I, honestly, feel it was the most learning I've ever experienced from a course. The German department is fantastic and there to help you and talk to you if you need anything--whether relevant to class or not. The events I attended (primarily German lunch) was a great way to get to know other German speakers and get to connect with them. It was always so fun, and I always looked forward to the events. Overall, I cannot emphasize how great my experience was this semester, and I would recommend it to anyone!",
    "This is a great class for anyone who is interested in learning German. I had no background in this language, but this class definitely starts from the bottom up."
