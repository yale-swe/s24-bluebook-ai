                "By analyzing academic texts written by scholars with differing perspectives in the field of international relations, I learned how to develop my own opinion about the interactions between actors, institutions, and organizations at the global level. The arguments proposed by these texts exposed me to game theory, the application of economics to political thought, and even psychological approaches, which enriched my study of the three main paradigms of international relations. In addition to grappling with various theoretical schools of thought, I learned how to apply these abstract theories to concrete historical examples in order to offer a coherent argument in the final essay.",

                "The strengths of the course undoubtedly lie in the way that the course is structured and taught. The two discussion-based weekly class meetings, which enabled us to hear the voices of our peers, combined with the video lectures and long readings made for a satisfying experience. I was able to independently draw my own conclusions from the text before listening to the videos and observing whether my peers thought the same way. Both in the video lectures and Zoom classes, the professor used dynamic, humorous, simple examples to illustrate broader concepts in IR that enabled me to remember the grasp the topics with more clarity.\r\nThe class could be improved with one more written assignment, perhaps about one of the readings in particular. The research paper was a valuable part of the class, but it also made it so that our only opportunity to write about the readings was during the final. One more assignment would have been welcomed, though not necessary.",
                "As a summer online course, all of the lectures were asynchronous and live sessions were discussion sections. I felt disconnected from the actual lectures, though the discussions were interesting.",
                "More classes throughout the week",
                "Everything was very clear and although at times some topics got harder to understand and because of the time we didnt have enough time to get through them in more depth our professor and TA always made sure we were on track and answered any doubts we had",
                "This course followed a very logical sequence of topics that were each very informative and useful. I only wish that we would have had more time to apply concepts to historical examples.",
                "Strengths were the live sessions discussing the readings, lecture concepts, and beyond to supplement learning and helped me better understand the concepts beyond the materials provided pre-class.",
                "I think this course is a great introduction to this discipline. If I were to improve it I would maybe add some variety, so instead of individually answering questions about the readings, some days we could have a debate or deliver group presentations about a particular topic.",
                "The courses progression of material learned was very logical and made sense as we got through the course, and classes reinforced what we learned on readings. One bug weakness of the course is that a lot of the material in the online lectures that we had to watch were not really covered or important to the rest of the course.",
                "I think that the online format does have a few setbacks, but overall, I think that the strengths are clear. The lectures are easy to refer to and pay attention to, the professor and TF were both available, and it was an engaging course. I think one of the primary weaknesses of the course was the amount of lectures and reading assigned, as it could sometimes lead to confusion and/or small periods of burnout. However, it's a summer class and that's expected.",
                "I really like the discussions of the class because it made the content more understandable and engaging. But, it is sometimes hard to get through the lectures because they are long (but it also the nature of summer classes since time is limited).",
                "I liked how it was discussion-based, it made class interesting. I thought that the reading was interesting but sometimes unnecessarily long/some parts unnecessarily complicated, as in we would read it but never talk about it or think about it again."

                "While I have not taken any other course at Yale (hence my inability to respond to 7/8 above), I would absolutely recommend it to another student seeking to delve into the field of IR. The course covers a plethora of topics, significant developments in the field, noteworthy authors, contemporary connections, and even other subjects (like sociology, psychology, game theory, etc). The concepts were broken down meticulously, and despite the challenge that the readings sometimes offered, they were rewarding since they built on one another.",
