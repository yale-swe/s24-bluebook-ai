                "I learned so much about politics! This is my favorite class at Yale",
                "This class taught me about the foundations of journalism, how reporters approach politics and political campaigns, how candidates shape their own campaigns based on their relationship with the media, and a whole host of other topics relevant to the politics of today, like the nature of fake news, the partisan news, polling mistakes, groundbreaking candidates like Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama and why they come under increased scrutiny, what \"electability\" means, political scandals, and more. In short: this class teaches you a ton. I really learned how to critique both the media and candidates/political campaigns themselves, and how to look at the intersection of the two. I learned so much about politics over the last 50 years because of Professor Shapiro, who has so many great anecdotes and insights to share."

                "This course was amazing. Professor Shapiro assigned readings from books that he personally enjoyed and thought highly of and I think that enthusiasm translated to the students. I genuinely loved doing the readings for this class and I felt like I was reading for fun not for work. The guest speakers included political consultants and acclaimed journalists who were so insightful and willing to share about their fields. These speakers all clearly thought very highly of Professor Shapiro too which also just reflects what a great person he is to learn from. I liked doing the work for this class and the papers were manageable. Honestly, there weren't really any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Shapiro is light hearted, kind, and very knowledgeable about the last 50 years of American politics. The guest speakers were also a highlight.",
                "Strengths: Walter! Professor Shapiro is an absolute gem. This class would not work without him. He brings an insane knowledge and experience in presidential campaigns. Hes also just a funny and kind man. He brought in lovely guest speakers and he speaks with such knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Its hard to think of any. Readings were heavy! I just couldnt do them all which I hate. I would have preferred fewer readings so we could all focus on the same content.",
                "I dont think there were any weaknesses. The class was always fun, engaging, and thoughtful. I learned a lot about the recent history of politics and how it has changed today. I also learned a lot about the media and how they are such an integral piece of American politics"

                "Yes, great professor who really knows what hes talking about and has a lot of experience. Interesting content",
                "YES! I think students will get out of this class what they put in, but it is honestly so worth it. By doing the readings, engaging in discussions, and going to office hours, even if it's just to casually chat with Prof Shapiro, you can really get a lot out of this class. This course sheds a lot of light on the reality of politics that I find some more theory-based poli sci classes lack.",
                "If youre interested in politics I would say this is the media class to take.",
                "Certainly. Prof Shapiro says it is not a history course, and it isnt. But with his wealth of knowledge about elections stretching back nearly a century, Prof Shapiro paints a fascinating historical election tale.",
                "Yes! It was amazing",
                "Yes, absolutely. I loved this class so much. The conversations are so interesting, and Professor Shapiro is truly a gem. He is super interesting to talk to and has such a long history in journalism that it definitely makes the class feel like it's being led by an expert; also, he invites guest speakers on who are also great to talk to. The readings are great-- the page numbers might seem a bit daunting, but they're all part of books that are meant to be fast-paced and engaging, so the reading ends up being easy to breeze through and really enjoyable. If you have any interest at all in politics or journalism, this class will have something for you. I think particularly in the wake of the polling misses and failures by journalists in the 2016 campaign, it's even more relevant and interesting to take this course."
