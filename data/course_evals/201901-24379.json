    "This course is designed extremely well. The texts and films are very well-chosen and richly interconnected, and we were lucky enough to receive a visit from one of the authors we read, which was truly amazing. I also appreciated how open-ended the prompts for the writing assignments were.",
    "This course is the best course I have taken at Yale. I cried when it ended!",
    "The authors of color we read were excellent. The white authors tended to be very similar (grew up poor, usually in the north of France, and became professors). I would prefer more of the former and fewer of the latter."

    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in exploring issues of (im)migration, social class, race, sexuality, and the relationship between them. If you want to get some solid French literature under your belt that isn't another Balzac\/Zola novel, this is a great option!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who's interested in learning more about social mobility and migration in modern French literature. Madame Cadieu is an excellent professor and really aims to foster an inclusive discussion in the classroom.",
    "If you speak French, you would be doing yourself a great disservice if you did not take this class before leaving Yale.",
    "An excellent French seminar-- probably the best literature course I've taken at Yale and the best French seminar in the department. Madame Cadieu is truly an exceptional instructor!"
