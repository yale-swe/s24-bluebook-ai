Depending on one's background and interest in these topics, the material on how the methods work, some math derivations, and so on may be too detailed. But these are still good to know (although their application could be further emphasized at times, maybe if that is the intention of the course?) and the instructor still tries to emphasize the reasons why the underlying math is important to understand. The biggest strength of the course in my opinion is the broader understanding of the planning and optimization fields that students can take away, and the notes are a great resource to look at when working with these methods in the future too.",
                "Professor Rakita is a good lecturer, and he is a very nice person, but the class is not very well organized. We had two assignments before spring break, and got around 6 assignments and the final projects in the last two weeks of classes.",
                "One of the main strengths of the course is the quality of the materials - the class notes are well-structured for review. I found many of the interactive visualizations to be particularly helpful in building intuition around the iterative optimization methods discussed in the final units of the course. The lectures were also engaging and touched on \r\nThere weren't any glaring weaknesses, though I think that more \"real-world\" and \"research-type\" examples could be introduced in the lectures around (for example) regularization or trust-region methods.",

The instructor presents enough detail for those who wish to dive deep into the topics, but the course also covers broad breadth of topics for students interested in the general methods, when they can be applied and what their strengths/weaknesses are. Overall, I highly recommend this course!",

I found the optimization half of the course to be more challenging, but also more rewarding. If you are interested in either area, this course gives a strong theoretical grounding, but also the opportunity for hands-on application of the concepts discussed in lecture in the problem sets and programming assignments.",
