Primarily, I benefitted from Hylomorphism by gaining a working familiarity with (a) the problems, decision points, and desiderata hylomorphists (especially neo-Aristotelians) seek to address in their substance ontology and (b) the key players in contemporary hylomorphic theory and where they stand on key ontological doctrines.",

I also thought that the system of having people present on a paper was good, as well as the system of having people send in questions before class. It made me actually think about what I read. Also, Prof. Charles' comments on papers when he returned them were fantastic. My only complaint is that the seminar discussions sometimes went down a specialized rabbit hole."

Every class I've taken with David has been phenomenal, and his influence was the reason for choosing philosophy as my major. \r\nGiven that it's a higher level philosophy course, I'd recommend taking the course only if students have engaged Aristotle deeply and in a philosophical context.
