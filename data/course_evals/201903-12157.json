   "comments": [
    "The greatest strength of this course was the fact that there were a limited number of students in each section. This allowed for a lot of conversation between students, which was very helpful in practicing speaking in the language. Personally, I did not feel that this course had a lot of weaknesses, however one thing I would have liked to focus more on during class is listening comprehension. I think this is a very important skill and I found it very hard to practice this outside of the classroom."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think it is a very interesting language and is very fun to learn. Also, the addition of discussions of Germany culture and history in class made it very engaging on a different level.",
    "Yes! German 110 is fun and positive, although a lot of work, but it is easy to succeed if you devote yourself in the least. There are only six tests, which are weighted at 5% each; the rest of the total grade is a final short film project (not as much work as it sounds!) and homework. Be prepared to be thrown into the deep end, though, the first week of class--I might do some advance preparation with Duolingo! You'll come out with a working knowledge of elementary German and a vocabulary of about 2000 words.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to a  friend seeking to learn German"
