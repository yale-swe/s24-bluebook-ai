I appreciated the independence and flexibility of the coursework, which focused on projects and essays that were largely determined by student interest. The assignments helped me build practical skills for research and understanding the energy system.",

Gives the student a strong foundation for understanding energy innovations and what is happening in the modern world, as well as how to understand policy that will affect the future. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was more moment for discussion or otherwise interaction with classmates, I think many of us are interested in the content but don't get to explore it with each other as much",

                "Strengths: Professor Oristaglio is wonderful and committed to student success. You will develop a thorough understanding of how the energy economy and the energy system functions, and develop skills for understanding the complicated aspects of the industry. \r\nWeaknesses: I think this course is best enjoyed by people who are truly interested in and dedicated to learning about energy, and for people who already have a pretty extensive background in it.",
                "Strengths: Very cool and real-world assignments and great professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "Strengths: best. gut. ever. Weaknesses: redundant for students of energy studies (e.g., same slides as in EPS 275); sort of a pointless class with extremely simplistic assignments, little-to-no expectations, and zero rigor.",

                "Yes! Even if not for the energy studies requirement or credit, I think it provides a strong foundation for current news and understanding of the energy sector, professor Oristaglio is also pleasant to learn from. Only thing is the time, Friday mornings are sometimes tough.",
                "Good fifth class or energy studies credit! It's not a super robust learning experience though.",
                "Yes, for the Energy Studies certificate. It is a relatively low-workload course but is engaging and very educational if you are prepared to invest the time.",
                "Yes! It was a stress free environment in which we learned a lot about energy topics! Even with little to no background, this course was super engaging and it always made me excited to talk about whatever we were in class that day!",
                "Only take this course if you are an energy studies major.",
                "Yes! Professor Oristaglio is amazing and the assignments are really interesting and directly applicable to the real world (for example, calculating if a country is on track to meet their NDC)",
                "If you need it for Energy Studies, yes. Otherwise, there are better ways to spend 1 of 36 credits at Yale. This felt like an early morning opportunity for the professor to talk about things (1) he was knowledgeable in and (2) most energy studies students were already familiar with; not much more.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student, regardless of major. For a student with no knowledge of the energy industry, this course would serve as an excellent introduction."
