I learned how to find patterns and trends throughout history and how specific events and issues have evolved over time. We read books by leading scholars and learned about notable female activists such as Angela Davis and Ella Baker. We learned about the pioneers of various Black social movements throughout history and how these movements were formed. I was able to learn about important issues such as Black uprisings, policing, mass incarceration, the AIDS epidemics disproportionate impact on the Black community, Black feminism, and disenfranchisement in the US.",

                "Very strong discussions and great text selection.",
                "Really great texts, Professor is really good at leading conversations and providing context",
                "One strength of this course is the weekly readings. Each book we read was engaging, insightful, and thought-provoking. I thoroughly enjoyed the material we read about and discussed in class, and I genuinely looked forward to doing the reading each week. I like that this class is in a seminar format, as our weekly discussions helped me to understand the content better and look at the material from various angles. All of the assignments in this class were straightforward and reasonable to complete as well.",
                "-really interesting readings\r\n-I really liked the note card questions we did at the beginning of class, it was a good way to stimulate ideas and spark a conversation whilst still giving students space to explore and take the conversation in whatever direction they choose \r\n-I liked the short responses, and they did help me think about my research paper \r\n\r\n-Sometimes I wish that once a conversation began to dwindle/ideas were reiterated, a slightly more direct prompt was given to give the conversation a little more oomph",
                "strength: the books were phenomenal! And the material discussed is unique as I have not seen any other course like it. The information taught in this course is what every single Yale student should be familiar with. \r\nweakness: the speed at which we had to read the books made it so that we rushed through material or that I couldn't finish the books at times even though I really enjoyed the material. The speed combined with having the course once a week made it so that we barely got through the surface level in the conversations\r\nImproved: more broken up reading assignments and more varied activities during class to mix up the predictable routine of notecard-surface level discussion-end of class (for example, the activity where we split up into groups and looked at Angela Davis' wanted poster was a good way to mix up the routine and keep us engaged); also, I think the Boundaries of Blackness book in particular should be given a lot more time given its more theoretical and academic language that was confusing to some"

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students. This is one of my favorites classes I have taken at Yale so far, and I really feel that I gained a lot from this class. Professor Lafargue did an excellent job with choosing the materials for the class and conducting each class to allow us to have thoughtful discussions about the readings and issues discussed within the books.",
                "Yes, I LOVED the readings we did, but it is a lot of reading!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course because the information you learn is unmatched! Learning new ways to analyze historical trends and apply them to our present day BLM movement help us to be engaged global citizens in our everyday lives. It's not too often that we can explore these sort of conversations in an academic setting.",
                "I would recommend this course to most students. If you're already very familiar with the content the course covers, don't expect groundbreaking new information, but Prof. Lafargue does a good job of framing the class through compelling paradigms and chooses some interesting, non-obvious readings.",
