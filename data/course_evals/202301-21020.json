The guest lectures and student presentations can be interesting, but require you to be there\/pay attention to actually learn anything. I'm not really sure how you could improve the class without losing the research part of it though.",
                "Very disorganized. You hardly learn anything from student presentations. But for a course that is so disorganized it is also unreasonably strict on grading and late day policies. The teaching staff is unresponsive and makes unreasonable requirements.",
                "very interesting guest speakers",
                "Very un-engaging, boring, and most of the class was student presentations which seemed like a waste of a class.",
                "It's very easy to skate through this course without learning anything - if a student is interested, however, there is a great deal to learn from! The guest lecturers were all great, and most of the student presentations were super informative as well.",
                "strengths - allows you to learn a little bit of everything in ML, hear interesting research topics through student presentations and project\r\nweakness - the expectations and grading rubric on assignments were vague and the TFs were very harsh when grading and would take away points from every minor error, the professor makes it seem like it is a chill class but towards the end of the semester, they post your grades that are very harsh",
                "Guest lectures are very insightful and can be better organized.",
                "The guest lectures were really cool and provided valuable exposure to what people are working on in ML, both on the academia and industry sides. Half of the class comprised of student presentations, which is very chill and you are exposed to a lot of different papers.",
                "Strengths: gut, easy to add on as a 5th class. The week to week workload is extremely low. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not much instruction is given on the term assignments. its hard to stay engaged in the class, because all of classtime is spent listening to other students' presentations.",
                "I would like the professor to teach more materials and less time for student presentation. And I don't like that we are forced to ask questions for participation grade. To encourage participation, we should have more options like asking and answering in ED discussion, summarizing what we learned, etc. And I would prefer the final project to be group project.",
                "Cool subjects, and guest lectures were great \r\nShould probably tone down the number of student presentations and somehow incorporate more teaching",
                "The power to control how much you learn is a strength. The lack of group projects was excellent. Excluding graduate students from paper presentations would be ideal to save time on presentations,."

If you study a different area, I don't think this course works well as a first exposure to ML; a good bit of preliminary knowledge is needed to get much out of even the student presentations.",

However my engagement with this class was really low. The class format wasn't conducive to learning but I was able to research more on ML topics that I was personally interested in.",

                "I would recommend this to another student if they were truly interested in making a contribution to the ML field while still being a class."
