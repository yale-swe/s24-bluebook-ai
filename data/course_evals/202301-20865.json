It was a bit outside of my wheelhouse, so I also learned how to analyze scripture and think through the lens of the Bible, which was a lot of fun!",

It challenged a number of my preconceived notions about \"the Bible\" with a breadth of historical context that makes us question the specific ways it can be applicable to modern audiences."

The readings were curated very thoughtfully (and kindly, such that they were reasonably doable in their entirety) and I felt like I got something out of everything I read. It is such a gift to see Professor Nasrallah explain passages of Greek. I have a much stronger understanding of every verse she analyzed; every week was a new light bulb moment! My only suggestion would be to differentiate the topics of the three papers a bit more; otherwise, I thought this class was fantastic!",

I became friends with all of my classmates, and I think that's a testament (see what I did there?) to how much we all bought into this course. It opened both eyes and doors for me. I would particularly recommend this course to any student interested in the Christian antiquities, but looking for a grounded window into its implications for modern life."
