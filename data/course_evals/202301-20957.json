                "Use of resources (peer tutors, TA office hours, review sessions)",

                "I gained a lot of in-depth knowledge about chemistry, and I really appreciated the thermodynamics perspective.",

It was very easy to understand how what we had done in previous lectures related to the current lecture, and I found the \"lecture recaps\" at the beginning of each lecture to be extremely helpful. Probably the biggest weakness of this course for me was that there was maybe one in-lecture chemistry demonstration the entire semester - as someone who enjoys seeing theory applied in practice, this was a bit disappointing.",
                "Course is organized pretty well, teaching fellows offer a lot of help, and peer tutors are extremely useful. The material is challenging but the course is formatted really well to aid learning. While there are four midterms (one is dropped), I feel that they are actually beneficial to learning and retaining the information learned in the course. No real complaints with the course.",
                "The beginning of this course was overwhelming lecture material does not correlate well to homework. However, as I got more into the class and into material I had a better background in, I loved it.",
                "I found the unique curriculum developed by Dr. Johnson to be the major strength of this course. The organization and scope of content covered were another major strength. Lastly, homework graded upon completion was a major strength that allowed for low-stress practice of the material. I found the 4 exam (and an additional final) structure to be a weakness. There was little time between exams to process course content, and this pacing seemed stressful.",
                "Strengths: The lectures are well-paced and Prof Johnson starts each lecture with a recap of the last, which is very helpful for refreshing the contents. The TFs and peer tutors are very kind and helpful, especially when it comes to exam reviews. \r\nWeaknesses: The class is quite challenging for someone who is no longer very familiar with topics in physics and sometimes its easy to feel lost in the class.",
                "The problem sets and exams were well thought out and related to the course. I felt like there was always help for me from Professor Johnson, the TFs, and the peer tutors. The lectures were always interesting and I felt like I could see the myriad of applications of the lectures to concepts outside of the course. I cannot think of any weaknesses!",
                "I think a strength of this course is how the exams for the most part are based on the problem sets and things we do in class and one weakness is that sometimes it is hard to know whether information in class is important to know or just extra information",
                "The strengths were the community and the peer tutors. The weaknesses were the teaching style and low access to office hours.",
                "The lectures were sometimes too derivation-heavy.",
                "Strengths: Problem sets are very straightforward and manageable, units are clearly defined and relate to one another, exams are generally fair/clear, material is typical for an introductory chemistry course, due dates are very manageable and often adjusted to ensure that students are well-informed to complete them\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures move very quickly, but TFs do a good job at recapping tougher topics in discussion sections. Example problems/in-lecture activities to engage students in the material could make the course even better.",
                "Great class, extra work for the same credit",
                "I really liked having practice tests available and the review sessions, that put together with the peer tutor's cumulative review was really helpful for exams.",
                "I really enjoyed Professor Johnson's qualitative approach to explaining complex topics. I would improve this course by offering more specific information about what will appear on exams."

                "Yes. Some lectures may be difficult, but MJ does a great job answering questions in class and emails to address any confusion. Ultimately its the pace that drives the difficulty because its a lot of information at once but reading Oxtoby prior to or following the lectures is great.",
                "Yes. I would take this course taught by Dr. Johnson over the regular general chemistry 2 course. This course seemed to have a more interesting curriculum. The smaller size of the course allows for a closer relationship between students and both the professor and TFs.",

                "Yes. It is a great course.",
                "Yes! From what I've heard about 165, I honestly think this course is easier (this was a very pleasant surprise after finishing 163!). The workload is very manageable, exams are fair, grading policy is very generous (don't have to finish entire exam, one is dropped, PSets graded for completion). If you took AP chemistry, you're very well-prepared.",
                "Yes but be prepared to do more work than is needed to get the chemistry credit",
                "Yes, because I think that it helped build a good foundation of chemistry that even if not applicable to other fields, at least made sense and was cool to understand.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to other students. It was very beneficial to me in developing my understanding of chemistry and reshaping how I think about science in general."
