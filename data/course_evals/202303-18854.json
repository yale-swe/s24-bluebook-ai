                "This course was helpful in getting exposure to a large number of viewpoints regarding the various fields of cognitive science. I left this course with a very broad interpretation of the fields of cognitive science that, as a cognitive science major, are helpful in deciding which combination of fields might be best to concentrate in. I think I gained a general insight to cognitive science that is analogous to a very brief introduction to linguistics, neuroscience, and perhaps psychology. I think this course is best for cognitive science majors but for non-majors I think it is very helpful course for someone that wants to learn more about fields like linguistics, large language models, and somewhat logic in a rather broad sense.",

                "Many, many knowledges about Cognitive Science. From what is Cognitive Science to how our brain work, to how we as human acquire language capability. Also, I learned how fMRI is used in the context of criminal law, as well as higher level cognition such as causation and decision making.",

It was a great intro to a wide variety of different subjects, but Prof. Kinney did a great job of teaching us about the higher level implications of research into the topics we learned about. I enjoyed this course a lot and feel like I come away with a great base level understanding of a lot of areas.",
                "I learned a lot in cognitive science: material-wise and skills-wise. Skills-wise, I learned the importance of being thorough. The first exam I had felt like went well but then I saw my grade and was shocked and confused. I met with my professor and he told me that next time I ought to ensure that I leave no doubt in the readers mind that I know what I'm talking about. So next exam I did just that and I feel like I performed much better.",

                "I learned a lot in this course, so first I just wanted to thank Dr. Kinney and my TF Aurelien Fermo for making this class so enjoyable. I loved thinking on a deeper philosophical level of how our brain functions and possible theories to explain different areas of our cognitive capability. From language acquisition to computability of the mind, there was never a dull moment in the class and I found that the information I gained in this class was the information that I most commonly recited back in conversations with my peers late at night outside of class. I think I was challenged to think about my psyche in ways that I haven't before, and being able to dictate my thoughts clearly was a skill that I gained through the tests and essay.",

                "I learned how to analyze the brain through lectures in a very interdisciplinary curriculum. We looked at the science of the brain through neuroscience and computers / information processors as well as the biological and evolutionary standpoint. We discussed how humans acquire and perceive language. We considered the human mind in economics, moral judgment and emotions, implicit and explicit biases, and brain damage and mental illness.",

                "I loved everything about this course- the setup, how assignments were spaced out, the professor, even the topics (which I wasn't expecting to find interesting whatsoever).",
                "Strengths Kinney really pays attention to student feedback and does his best to accommodate us. He explains information really well. Has live polls to make it interactive\r\nDrawbacks- study guides basically say you have to learn all the material, which is hundreds of slides (with lots of paragraphs on each slide). So the con is its a larger workload for studying for tests. Other than that, its fine.",
                "It would be nice if there were a lot more answers to some of the cognition questions posed in the class. The paper, especially for the grad students, seems superfluous and didn't add a lot of value to the course.",
                "The course was very structured which I liked, so I could anticipate what would happen. However some of the information doesn't feel super relevant to cognitive science, there was too much mention of AI.",
                "Strengths: Interesting lectures and interdisciplinary content \r\nWeakness: Material covers a broad range of topics and does not go into depth",
                "Strength: a great survey of cog sci topics. Enough details to understand its significance but not too much that a particular topic was overbearing. The course was also incredibly organized and the teaching team did a wonderful job to make it a pleasure for students to take this course\r\nWeakness: The reading assignments were very repetitive and the material from this course seems like it could benefit from multimodal \"reading\" assignments like Youtube videos or activities instead of upwards of 3 different research papers or articles a week to read and discuss.",
                "This course was super engaging, especially after mid-semester feedback was accounted for! I really liked the in-class polls. David was also a great prof! You can really learn a lot when the professor is passionate about the subject. :)",
                "This course has a very straightforward grading policy and it is really easy to communicate with the professor David Kinney. Albeit I did not heavily interact with the professor or my assigned TF, it was easy to maintain a moderate level of engagement with this course. The grading is very fair and the study guides posted by Professor David Kinney are very representative of the content on exams and the content from the lectures. A weakness of this course is that it is perhaps too general; we often spend 1-2 lectures on a given genre of topic related to cognitive science (e.g., linguistics) and then move on to a new topic that is completely different with low levels of cohesion between topics and this sometimes makes it difficult to follow the course's topics. Otherwise, there are not many weaknesses to this course.",
                "strengths: super clear\r\nweaknesses: material didn't always feel linear",
                "Strength: very very accessible and kind Professor. Love the way he teach, and the course structure is very well organized and everything is super clear. Can't think of any weakness.",
                "This course was absolutely fascinating, both the readings and the lectures, and the workload wasn't too high.\r\n\r\nHowever, this class didn't have an effective mechanism to check for learning. The tests were designed so that memorizing all information was good enough. There wasn't any critical thinking.",
                "The weakness of the course was the readings that were assigned us to read. Some of them were very confusing and had a lot of jargon specific to a field that I had been left feeling confused after reading. A strength of the course was how the lectures were interesting and the surveys that we took throughout the lecture cleared up confusion, so I didn't have to ask questions.",
                "Strength: Responsive TFs and study guides\r\nWeaknesses: not given lecture videos until right before final exam, lecturer was not engaging, lack of benchmarks to tell you how you are doing in the class, weak attempts to make lecture more engaging, barriers to try and get grades back.",
                "Strengths = review days were incorporated into the syllabus and structure of the class. They were extremely helpful. Study guides were helpful. \r\nWeaknesses = sometimes, the reading responses were a bit overwhelming.",
                "Professor Kinney is amazing! He is the most encouraging teacher I have ever met. He always was on top of his emails and took in student's suggestions. Examinations were focused on us demonstrating what we knew rather than trying to trick us.",
                "There are a lot of readings, and some were very difficult to understand without going over it in lecture. The content and lecture were interesting though.",
                "Strength of the class was Prof. Kinney's enthusiasm and engagement with the material. The biggest weakness for me was the lack of feedback on the homework assignments and exams/essays. Since there was no discussion section for the class, it was hard to understand what I knew and what I didn't know. I think an improvement could be adding a discussion section, or somehow creating a way for us to get our exams back so we could see what we did well on and what didn't go well before the final.",
                "Lectures are not that exciting. It's easy to fudge the reading questions cause they're really just based on completion. Prof. Kinney isn't a particularly engaging lecturer, but he got better as the semester went on. Study guides were fantastically helpful. Exams were graded VERY weirdly though.",
                "The strengths were that the instructor adapted to course feedback. He was always looking for ways to improve the course and I appreciate that he was trying to cater to us since the class is for us, after all. A weakness of the course was that we didn't have any interaction with our TAs and that made it hard to build a connection with the people who graded our reading responses and thought papers. The thought papers were another weakness of the course; an arbitrary and difficult assignment with little to no guidance on what exactly was expected of us.",
                "The main weakness of this course was the lecturer. He didn't seem to have a complete grasp of the material he was teaching, and often slides would have incorrect or logically inaccurate information on them. Often, this material would end up being communicated verbally during lectures with no corrections for accuracy. Additionally, the course structure seemed weak and could have benefited from having sections to discuss material.",
                "Strengths: I loved how hard Professor Kinney worked to make the class accessible for ushe made study guides for the exams which were super clear about what the exams were on, posted his lecture slides, constantly communicated exact dates for when we would get grades back on things, etc.\r\nWeaknesses: Just not super engaging, could be improved by making lecture even more interactive",
                "Strengths: interesting content, logical structure, fair exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I enjoyed the lectures and felt I learned the most from them, whereas I often found readings very dense and they typically didn't make a ton of sense prior to the lecture on the topic, so I found them less helpful as not as worth my time.",
                "Well done I liked it",
                "I think that this course covers some really interesting material. I think that one of its weaknesses was that it was taught in a very \"methodical\" way. It was difficult to stay engaged because the lessons felt very mechanical",
                "I wish this course had had a discussion section, especially due to the argumentative nature of most lectures. A major strength was that Professor Kinney was always willing to work to make the course more manageable for us, and took onboard a lot of feedback. Lecture slides were clear, and clear study guides were given to us ahead of exams.",
                "Strengths: engaging lectures that synthesize and clarify concepts really well, mostly insightful readings that provide a glimpse of the type of research that can be done in cognitive science. No major weaknesses, though a discussion section would improve it to help students discuss and synthesize the content from both lectures and readings in smaller groups.",
                "I like the topics, the lectures were a bit long",
                "Strengths -- a nice variety of readings, not too much of a workload, plenty of resources to get help, and a nice grading scale \r\nWeaknesses -- the readings were at times unengaging due to their length or technicality: maybe having some sort of general guideline of what to expect would be helpful",
                "The one weakness is the grading of the final paper. I worked so hard and received feedback and I still did poorly.",
                "strengths: very engaging content, very good lecturer, interdisciplinary nature of the course makes it very approachable for everyone\r\nweaknesses: disparity in the depth of different material",
                "The course is mainly composed of lectures and reading assignments. The readings were sometimes a bit complicated and overwhelming. Also, the course content is quite broad, which made it a bit difficult to gauge what could come up on the exam and what was additional information. Yet, David Kinney is a great and supportive instructor, and he resolved both of these issues by providing detailed explanations of the readings as well as summaries of course content before exams with a detailed overview of what was expected.",
                "Four reading responses per week was quite a lot, however there were only 2 exams and one paper so the overall workload was understandable. The course covers a lot of important topics. I found this course more interesting than psyc 110.",
                "The strengths of this course is that its a pretty easy to understand overview of famous findings in Cognitive Science. Weaknesses is that Professor Kinney can be really boring at times but he does try to be engaging and he got a lot better as the semester went on.",
                "Well structured. Content was concise and well explained.",
                "Strengths: professor was receptive to feedback, office hours were very helpful \r\nWeaknesses: wish there was more feedback from TFs",
                "I think Professor Kinney was a great lecturer-- super enthusiastic, compelling, entertaining, and knowledgeable about the material that he presented.  I think that the lecture format of this course really played to those strengths.  One thing I think could have improved the course would be a more organized method of returning feedbacks on assignments-- throughout the semester, I would submit homework assignments and never receive any feedback on them (not even confirmation that those assignments had been received by my TF).  I think it would have been great to have more interaction between the instructors of this course and the students.",
                "It is a little all over the place in terms of what we learn and some of the topics near the end of the course were harder to engage with. Other than that it was great.",
                "Incredible course, David is a great lecturer and really takes feedback into consideration when preparing slides, readings, and overall course content.",
                "The teaching style of Professor Kinney was really engaging. Not an Easy A but truly not a Hard A either. The essay was no graded incredibly meticulously and the reading questions are graded pass/fail and worth 20% of the grade. The midterm and final are very close if not identical to some of the questions on the study guide. No curveballs or anything. Professor Kinney listens to feedback from students and wants students to live this subject as much as he does. I know for a fact that because of this Cognitive Science class, many students switched to be a CogSci major. I think the TFs were not super helpful.",
                "The course could be made a little more exciting with more variety in each class. The material is very interesting, but it gets a little difficult to sit through the same structure of lecture and homework every time. Now structures for the homework could be interesting as well as more interactive lectures.",
                "I believe that some of the articles used for Reading Questions, where we read one to two articles before class and answer questions, are too complex for an introductory course. In some cases, we were expected to parse through scientific research papers; in other cases, the English was very old and therefore hard for us to understand. However, I enjoyed the interdisciplinary range of topics covered, from neuroscience-y questions (how do fMRIs work?) to analogies to artificial intelligence (the brain and sentience) and even how the brain reacts in game theory. The content of the course is widely fascinating to many types of people.",
                "strengths: the study guide was extremely helpful (what is tested on the exams are never unclear, aka the exams are predictable), the lecture slides are detailed (although the prof does read most of the slides so you don't really need to go to lecture) \r\n\r\nweaknesses: the grading of the tests are pretty specific in wording and that can be quite vague, some readings were quite unrelated to the lectures",
                "This course should host sections for better engagement. Additionally, the weekly homework should be evaluated to aid exam preparation.",
                "The course was very informative in addressing the breadth of the cognitive science field. One thing that could be improved is the number of engaging class activitiesI felt that the use of PollEverywhere and turn-and-talk opportunities were effective, but it would have be great if we did more of that!",
                "The lecture style was alright but not that engaging because it felt like I could've understood most of the information by reading off the slides on my own, and I also think the minimum page count for the essay was a bit high for a pretty straightforward prompt. Additionally, the exams could be reformatted to include some multiple choice questions. My biggest issue with the class was how laborious it was to get exam feedback. I feel like having to physically go to the Professors office and look over the questions with him on top of not having a clear rubric was unhelpful for my learning, even if there was not a cumulative final. An upside was the generous curve which made sense for an intro class. The reading questions were effective at keeping me on top of the readings.",
                "I enjoyed the reading and think it could be more interactive.",
                "Strengths: manageable workload, really fascinating content,\r\nWeaknesses: essay criteria could have been more clear",
                "The lectures for the course were engaging and easy to follow, readings were relevant and not incredibly difficult or time-consuming, the content was relevant and interesting, the tests were reasonable, and the essay was a good opportunity to look deeper into a specific topic. No complaints.",
                "The lectures were very dry and boring. Instead of providing basics of topics given that this was a survey course, lectures gave blatantly wrong information on psychology and neuroscience topics. Material was not presented well at all, and professor basically read off of slides.",
                "weaknesses: that was the first time Professor Kinney has taught at Yale, so the course was a bit of a mess at times.\r\nstrength: even considering the weakness mentioned, Professor Kinney made a huge effort to make the course the best and fun in some ways",
                "The course material was very interesting, and laid   out in a way that made it easy to follow and review. When reviewing for exams, the study guide provided was very useful in ensuring we were as efficient as possible in our studying. \r\n\r\nA weakness of the course is that, as it is a lecture, it can be easy to not engage with the content and get distracted during class.",
                "Strengths: selected responses served as a good motivation for the reading questions component; interesting material; the course is very well-structured overall; instructor's engagement\r\nWeaknesses: exam feedback, more direct instructions on the essay component would be appreciated.",
                "This course was very strong in having interesting readings for class, very fair grading policies, and overall interesting material in class.",
                "dont need to go to class and can do well on exams. lectures not interactive at all, just read from slides",
                "Grades were weighted in such a way that allowed room for confusion and mistakes, which was especially helpful considering that cognitive science can be quite overwhelming and complex for someone who has had little exposure to the fields that comprise it (psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, computer science. Review lectures were held intermittently to help digest content.",
                "Strength: professor is amazing and the lectures were engaging. Weakness: homework was kind of boring and I found myself having to stay engaged with material.",
                "There is a lot of interesting information in this class. However, I think the way that it is presented is not the best way for the students. I feel like outside of the slideshow presentation, there was not much information being added to the class. I wish there was more engagement with the class or more real world examples that would allow for people to be more engaged in the class.",
                "Feedback-\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n\r\nI found a lot of the material to be pretty engaging- especially the neuroscientific and linguistics-focused lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nThe formatting of the slides were bad. They need to be fixed, especially if you do not record your lectures and when we have to depend on the lecture slides for reviewing and studying purposes.\r\n\r\nWe had to do mandatory reading responses, which is fine. But we never got any feedback. For all I know, my TF could just look at my email submission and not even read what I spent an hour or so writing. Also, I wish we were able to submit our responses on Canvas-- 1. to make everything more trackable (we had 4 skips); and 2. To make sure that we are getting credit for what we are submitting. Not hearing back from our TFs was a good thing, but I like feedback. \r\n\r\nThere was also no way that we could even request a regrade, which is something I have never heard of before while taking a course here.",
                "The strengths were that the course had a relatively low workload, and covered many different topics which allowed for an understanding of what cognitive science really contains and kept the class fairly interesting. The readings tended to be fairly dense and sometimes uninteresting or hard to interpret, and the lectures covered interesting topics but at times could have been more engaging or more focused on which topics were key to know. The study guides were very helpful to prepare for the exam and study relevant topics."

                "Yes! Interesting and light workload. You also knew what to expect on exams, so that was helpful when structuring your studying",
                "Definitely would recommend! Only if youre interested in cognitive science though. If youre not sure, still take the course and by the time add/drop period is over, youll have enough insight to see if this is the course you want to take.",
                "Yes",
                "If you need it for a credit and it's one of the only options, or if you want to do cogsci, I recommend it.",
                "Yes, the workload is not demanding and the content is engaging and interesting.",
                "Yes. I think Cog Sci is a major that most people should at least consider and this course shows you why.",
                "Absolutely! If you're interested in cognitive processes, psychology, neuroscience, computer science, philosophy, or just how you think about stuff in general, this class will be really worth your time!",
                "I would recommend this course if someone is considering majoring in cognitive science or is in need of a relatively fair Social Sciences credit. Otherwise, I would not recommend it; the topics of the course are a bit sporadically introduced and I imagine it might not be very interesting. The course is very fair though and David Kinney does a good job at presenting the course content. Even if you find it tiresome to attend the lecture, the slides of the lecture are always posted and accessible to all students. It is easy to do well in this class as you follow the content in the slides.",
                "yes, only if they're interested in cogsci/neuro/psyc",
                "YES!! Definitely!! There isn't many workload just two exams to prepare and a paper. Good way to learn about Cognitive Science.",
                "I would recommend this class because it provides an overview of many topics, so it could help a student understand what they like and what they don't like.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to other students as it opened my eyes to the world of AI and language and human development. It was also cool to learn about the philosophical debates that surround the world of cognitive science even today. I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in majoring in neuroscience, computer science, philosophy, linguistics, or psychology as well.",
                "No unless necessary for pre req or major requirement, but even then, would caution against taking this course if taught by same lecturer next year.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in or curious about cognitive science because it does provide a very new perspective to the brain and life.",
                "Yes! This class is a wonderful introduction to the discipline of cognitive science. It covers multiple fascinating topics and Dr. Kinney is a great lecturer. I would recommend this class to everyone whos interested in cognitive science regardless of their major.",
                "YES YES YES but only with Professor Kinney. He is an amazing professor.",
                "Yes, very interesting content even if you are not majoring in cognitive science. I think it teaches you new ways of thinking.",
                "Yes! It's a terrific intro course. There are probably easier courses out there if you just want a SO credit, but if you're interested in cog sci, I would recommend this course.",
                "Yes I would. It's challenging and interesting. You are constantly learning new things and your brain is always working. However, since Cognitive Science is so interdisciplinary, when the topic is not interesting to one, it is very easy to get bored and fall asleep.",
                "I would recommend this only to (prospective) CogSci majors, I think there are better So credits in general!",
                "I would if they have no experience with cognitive science and want to get a sense of what the field entails. The workload was reasonable and the exams were very fair, so I think that is a benefit for sure. It wasn't always extremely engaging though, especially the assigned readings and responses, so if someone isn't trying to get a general sense of the topics and is looking for a course that will really change their perspective or spark an intense interest, this may not be the right course for that.",
                "Yes if professor Kinney is teaching!",
                "I think that the subject matter is very interesting, and I enjoyed learning about it. But I thought that the course was, at times, difficult to be engaged with because of how the material was delivered to students.",
                "Yes, especially if you're curious about what cognitive science is, since this gives you a very interdisciplinary overview of the subject.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, it's a great intro class that really shows the breadth and relevance of the field.",
                "Yes its a good introductory course and the prof is nice",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, and if they are interested in the applicability of certain topics such as CFGs and Turing Machines, I would encourage them to take CPSC 201 in conjunction with this class. I found the topics extremely interesting, and overall if you're looking for a class with great topics you'll think about outside of class taught by a passionate and knowledgeable instructor, I would absolutely recommend taking this class.",
                "Yes, it is pretty fascinating, but some topics are not. However, for the exams you can choose out of categories and do not have to study every topic which is good.",
                "I would. Given its minor shortcomings, the course was still interesting.",
                "Yes. The class was taught in a very organised, clear, engaging way. Professor Kinney was great at listening to the needs of the students, despite it being a huge lecture class. The content gave me a better understanding of some of the cognitive processes we experience on a daily basis.",
                "I would only reccommend this course to a student thinking of majoring in cog sci",
                "I would, especially if the student is interested in the topic. The layout of the class allows one to gauge their interest in each subtopic, as well as the whole topic.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course - I found that I didn't really need to go to lectures, and I was generally able to glean all of the information that I needed just from the slides. I think that this class provides a really clear-cut understanding of a slew of cognitive science topics.",
                "I would recommend this course because I found the topics that we discussed extremely interesting, and these topics would definitely be applicable and useful to all students since they are so interdisciplinary.",
                "I would but I would consider the fact that there is a pretty tough essay in the middle of the course which is graded pretty harshly with no feedback.",
                "Yes! It was fun, low-stress, and because the content was so interdisciplinary, there's bound to be something there of interest to everyone.  Cognitive science is a young and rapidly developing field; it was exciting to see how the ideas we were being taught were being actively debated among scholars even as we were discussing them in class.",
                "Absolutely.",
                "Yes! This class was really fun and not a class that will harm your GPA.",
                "Im neutral. The course content itself was very interesting, but I was a bit discouraged from the pace of the course and the high-level sophistication of some of the reading material.",
                "definitely!!! a great lecture, study-able for exams, and honestly really fascinating interdisciplinary content that i wouldn't have learned otherwise.",
                "Yes, I loved the course material and would encourage other students to take this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in exploring cognitive science (thinking about the major), as well as anyone interested in the brain, AI, or linguistics. I think the topics we discussed, when put together, offer a unique, invaluable perspective.",
                "no",
                "I went into this course thinking I was going to be a cog sci major and have now decided against it. If you are considering the major, I recommend it.",
                "Yes, it was a great introduction to cognitive sciences.",
                "Yes! Its extremely interesting to learn about the mind and how it works, especially through a social science lens.",
                "Yes!! Definitely take this course if you are even remotely interested in Cognitive Science, AI, or similar topics. The professor is excellent and makes the course engaging. Coming away from this course, I feel equipped with a strong foundation of Cognitive Science necessary to take higher-level courses in this field.",
                "The workload is low, the course is relatively easy, and the content is relevant and engaging. Highly recommend.",
                "Not unless required.",
                "YES!! An amazing course and amazing professor.",
                "yes, even if you are not sure if you want to major in related field to cog sci, I would still take it - I've learned a lot in this class",
                "I would! I really enjoyed taking the course as it introduced new, interesting material in a way that is easy to follow and comprehend. The workload was not too heavy, and was appropriate for the course considering the material viewed in class.",
                "Yes! I would prefer this over Intro to Psychology",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to students interested in cognitive science, computational theories, or psychology. It offers a lot of interesting concepts that are essential to our knowledge of the mind. The course also has very fair grading policies and a very reasonable workload.",
                "yes if you want an intro to cog sci. besides office hours dont get feedback.",
                "I would recommend this class to people who are interested in at least two of the following fields: neuroscience, computer science, psychology, linguistics, and philosophy (especially neuroscience and computer science). If you are not interested in any of these fields, cognitive science might be a little boring for you. I would especially recommend this class if professor David Kinney teaches it again. I would be a little wary of taking this course if it wasn't taught by him because I've heard bad things about it when it was taught by someone else.",
                "Yes this is a great course to get a broad overview of the CogSci field.",
                "Yes! I learned a lot, but just be prepared for this not to be a gut.",
                "Not particularly. It was a fine class, but if you are on the fence about cognitive science this probably will not do much for you.",
                "If you want to keep taking cog sci classes, great place to start! Or if you just want to learn some of the topics",
                "Yes, CGSC 110 was overall very interesting and a good introduction to the interdisciplinary field with aspects of psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics.",
                "Honestly, I am not for sure. The course was balanced with engaging and unengaging material for me. In all honesty, the course did not live up to the expectations I had set prior. I definitely had a different estimate of what Cognitive Science was before, and even though I know now, I do think that I would have taken a different course instead.",
                "Yes! I would recommend the course to anyone who thinks they might be interested in cognitive science or is curious to learn what cognitive science is. The course covers this field which is fairly unknown and it was interesting to learn about these topics that often aren't covered by other subjects."
