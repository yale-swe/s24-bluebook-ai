                "Obviously, I learned a lot of Chinese  both vocabulary and grammar, much of which I had never really studied before in an academic setting. I also learned much more about certain elements of Chinese culture, and I think one of the benefits of being in a heritage class is that you're also among students who have a similar cultural background, who you can kind of communicate with well.",
                "Increased my knowledge of vocab and grammar structures. You'll be able to recognize words in daily conversation that you couldn't before!",
                "I was able to maintain my chinese skills even in college very well thanks to this course. This was honestly my favorite class this semester, even though it was just a chinese class and I had never particularly enjoyed language classes before. Fu Lao Shi is just so passionate and engaging that our class really felt like an incredibly open environment for learning.",

                "- Good workload that is challenging but not overbearing\r\n- Lots of discussion\r\n- Interesting lessons",
                "I would have preferred an every day class and possibly pre real world course materials. Although the readings as provided suited the course quite well, I do not feel like they reflect the complexities of real world Chinese.",
                "Strengths: Does well in fostering camaraderie, lots of work to facilitate reading\/writing\r\nWeaknesses: Reading and writing skills are tied together in a way that slows down how much vocab students learn to read",
                "I can think of no weaknesses. It was a wonderful course. Perhaps I might have wished that we got the opportunity to read easy literature in addition to the textbook, but in general, I would say the class was very well-structured and very engaging.",
                "Teacher is incredible and is by far the thing that got me through this class. I wish there were more opportunities for student-led activities, instead of listening to the teacher talk or only calling on one or two students per activity\/question.",
                "Strengths- You will learn so much. The workload is very manageable, but does not come with a tradeoff in learning quality. The pacing of each chapter of the textbook also works incredibly well\r\nWeaknesses- As a student, I think I could have benefitted from more practice in reading\/ reading comprehension, of which we had some but not many. Also, I think some of the contents of the textbook tackled very important issues, but they were approached in a way that was perhaps not the most tactful. For example, the chapter on gender inequality and its history in chinese culture was very important, but treated with an it-is-what-it-is approach that I think could have been done better. The same applies to normalizing tiger-parenting methods that surprised me a little bit.",
                "Really good class, especially if you want to improve quickly at your command at the language.",
                "Strengths: The nature of the course is definitely a little slower paced than other Chinese courses I've taken here, which definitely allowed me to focus on improving my spoken and written Chinese, as opposed to only forcing myself to complete the homework assignments. The discussions that took place in class were also very useful and helped me improve my listening skills.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The amount of vocabulary we were expected to learn in a week felt rather far-fetched, especially since we were expected to know how to write the characters as well. What this ended up achieving was a sort of , as I felt like I would only remember the words\/characters for each quiz and then immediately forget them after. I think it would have been a lot more useful if we were allowed to stagger out the character learning or if we were made to incorporate character learning in other ways (For example: weakly small assignments\/essays)",
                "Strengths: Awesome instructor (Fu Laoshi)! Very engaging and enjoyable class times. The small group setting and general energy level of the class made it one of my favorite classes, although this may have been particular to the specific group of people. The structures we learned were generally useful and I believed helped me to speak more fluently. Nightly homework and weekly dictation quizzes were reasonable and manageable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Somewhat inconsistent pacing; some weeks were quite easy, but other weeks felt very rushed, especially after the midterm."

                "Yes! I think this is a great class to take as a first-year because it's a small class where students get to know each other pretty well. I recommend a section that leads into lunch.",
                "Absolutely! It's very good for practicing one's Chinese speaking, as well as for learning writing. It also gives you access to a community of students who have similar backgrounds, and I certainly know that I made a lot of friends because of the class.",
                "Absolutely! Although I initially took this course just to satisfy my language requirement as I suspect many future students will also I was quickly surprised by how much of a community this class felt like. If nothing else, I would take this course just to maintain my chinese language skills outside the home!!",
                "Hands down the most thoughtfully constructed and well-taught class Ive taken at Yale thus far.",
                "Yes, I would! Fu Laoshi is amazing! This class is also definitely not one of the cutthroat language classes, which makes actually learning the language so much more enjoyable and fun.",
                "I'd recommend this course especially to students who feel a little awkward with their chinese language skills, including speaking. I don't speak Chinese at home, so I originally believed I would be in the non-heritage track, but my listening capabilities were strong enough for 152, and my speaking and writing improved dramatically in the first few weeks."
