                "the course is hard. I expected it to be hard but I did not expect it to be so hard. While the teachers are doing what they can, no matter how much help I got the material is not clicking. I cannot say I have settled for a C in the course, I am absolutely fighting for my life to earn that C. I want more in class examples of questions like those on the test, sometimes the test questions seemed from another class they were so different.",
                "I feel like the course hits the bases of basic understanding of the phenomena but isn't as challenging as 180 was.",
                "Easy to catch up on due to the nature of the course and the textbook is helpful for learning. Some lectures are more useful than others but you can go to office hours and study hall when confused which is very helpful.",
                "A strength was that the homework was similar to the tests, so you really did get real practice for the tests by doing the psets. A weakness was that there were not many ways to engage during class.",
                "Lectures were much more understandable than 180, I liked this class a lot better. Information was taught well. No corrections were given on exams, making it a bit more difficult compared to 180.",
                "More disorganized than previous 180 segment but appreciated the quizzes and also the use of the textbook as it provided good opportunity for help",
                "Tests did not correlate well with classwork and homework.",
                "not well structured AT ALL, unnecessarily difficult for an intro physics class, concepts were not well explained",
                "This course could be improved with clearer lectures. It was often difficult to see the point of what we were doing, and while I appreciate that the professors wanted us to understand where every equation came from, that came at the expense of learning how to solve problems and practicing things like what we would have on the test.",
                "Strengths: course was dependent on the textbook, which made it easier to re-learn/prepare for content introduced in lectures. Homeworks were also just assigned directly from the textbook, so the workload was insubstantial.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: extremely disorganized, and it felt like a bunch of difficult material was just thrown at us without much structure or cohesiveness. It was a marked contrast from PHYS 180 in the previous semester.",
                "The lecture of this course was difficult to follow and did not work through problems in a way that helped reinforce the concepts or prepared us for the exams.",
                "It was not quite as well run as physics 181 but that makes sense since the professor changed last minute",
                "The main strength of this course was how well the homework problems typically reflected the material learned in class. The weaknesses of this course were how the homework and the material taught in class were not well-reflected in the exams(typically the exams were much more difficult than what was presented in class, the homework required, and the practice problems given out beforehand), how poorly organized the course was generally(my professor was often unable to answer specific questions about upcoming exams in terms of their format, the formula sheet, and material required), and how out of touch the professors seemed to be with the students' levels of understanding of the course material.",
                "workload was very manageable, but more problem solving in class would be helpful",
                "Weakness of class-- the lectures were hard to follow, and we spent so much time deriving the equations we were supposed to use, which was not at all part of the homeworks or the exams.",
                "strengths: I liked how the class followed a book. It was easier to get practice problems to study with. \r\n\r\nweakness: I feel like the exam didn't really capture what we would do in the homework. It also wasn't super clear what material was important to understand. I think this class would benefit from having recorded lectures and to have an entire syllabus listing the sections to study. I felt like this class could also benefit from doing reviews of the material from physics 180",
                "-i hope we could get more practice problems that are similar to the difficulty on the exam",

                "The course is a little disorganized. I wished curves and grade distributions were more clear. I also dislike how much more difficult the exams are than the problem sets. Lectures were quite confusing at times and the content within lectures weren't always super relevant and helpful.",
                "Lectures felt very unorganized and very rarely left feeling like I understood any of the material. Thankfully the course followed the book closely, so the textbook was a great resource. For the most part, I felt that peer tutors were better resources than TFs when asking questions.",
                "Well rounded",
                "Professor Gozar is a clear, engaging, and thorough teacher whose lectures were well-organized to help us succeed! The weekly problem sets and quizzes were a great way to reinforce the content taught in class.",
                "It could be improved by clearer, more organized powerpoints",
                "The professor was very willing to edit his teaching style so that students could better understand the material being taught. As a course I wish there were a few more examples shown in class that directly related to what we were learning.",
                "There wasn't much taught in lecture that I couldn't learn from the textbook.",
                "Strengths are simple nature of most of the problems but the weaknesses for me were the quality of the lectures. I felt like we went way too fast through most of the material. I also thought it was hard to grasp the simple concepts from lecture in class before going into detailed derivations involving multiple variables.",
                "Lecture content and resources were plentiful, problem sets were very simple compared to the exams",
                "Unlike Steinacker's PHYS 180, where you get lost in the details of the problems, Gaza's 181 left me with a great look at and understanding of the big pictures of electricity and magnetism. So it was good for big-picture topics. The problems for homework probably weren't as hard as they should be, but they got the job done. Teaching was overall terrible in this course, and it seemed like a lot of people weren't really getting anything. I often had to read the textbook. The slides were good at just listing the equations we needed to know, but overall were confusing because the examples in them had too little words/explanation and sometimes had mistakes. Quality of teaching seemed to decline more and more as the semester went on, since Gozar drew out fewer and fewer examples on the board and seemed more and more tired as the semester went on.\r\nMy exams also were sometimes graded unclearly and there were mistakes (like points were not allocated as according to the posted grading rubric).",
                "The instructors were so inconsistent and always changing grading policies. The exams were way harder than the homework with clear instruction on how to prepare.",
                "Strengths: There were many fun experiments done in class, and I felt interested in the topics.\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of topics went completely over my head, and the same is true for the rest of the class. I felt like I was lacking a good understanding of what was going on during the last month. It was hard to gain much valuable information from the slides Professor Gozar posted."

                "Pretty much everyone takes this as a requirement. I think if Gozar is teaching, you should know that it won't be much work, but if you really want to learn the material you'll need to read the textbook. Steinacker usually teaches this class, and I think her version is a lot harder and much more work. Overall it's very cool material, especially for electrical engineers. Teaching was really bad but textbook is great.",
