Assessments: short answer vs multiple choice. (1) homework was often new material instead of review, meaning it took much longer to complete. (2) quiz and midterm format were different (short answer vs multiple choice). (3) our section did not receive an interpreter when others did for service project presentation. (4) grading was much harsher and never clearly explained.",

There's generally a lot of room for engagement even outside the classroom. Something that could be improved is the deadlines being assigned by day rather than all at the end of the week.",
