                "I learned about foundational ideas, concepts, and theorists in modern social science and how these theories applied to three distinct case studies in recent African societies. The course provided a novel way to think through the importance of bureaucracy and the state, while also illuminating the centrality of ideology in periods of African statecraft.",
                "Theories of bureaucracy and governace, the histories and politics of African bureaucracies",
                "This course offered an insightful exploration into how historical events have influenced the development of political institutions and the exercise of power in various countries. The detailed case studies of South Africa, Rwanda, and Ethiopia were particularly enlightening. They not only deepened my understanding of these nations' histories but also highlighted the unique ways in which politics and power manifest in different contexts. The course effectively utilized a reliance on Jonny and his expertise on African history and politics, class discussions, and guests on scholars and individuals we discussed in the course to bring these complex topics to life. What stood out was really insights in different theories such as high-modernism, Weber's theory of bureaucracy, states need to see their civilians, which provided a deeper context and helped in understanding the nuanced impact of historical events on current political events and strategies within very complicated and complex situations. This approach greatly enhanced my comprehension and appreciation of the subject matter."

                "Strengths: Great readings, great topics, great conversations. Also, the reading response structure really helped have a starting point each week without being overwhelming and the class was really good at covering a lot of ground in a relatively short time. Also Professor Steinberg is great at explaining things and just a really wonderful professor to work with. Weaknesses: The only thing I think could have been improved would be to involve more students in the conversation. Sometimes I felt anxious to speak and would have benefited from some prompting or some help in speaking up so that I and other quieter students could have participated more.",
                "I really enjoyed the case studies used to explore the main concepts in the course. Analyzing concrete examples was really helpful for understanding the theoretical material. In terms of case study selection, I think the post-genocide reconstruction in Rwanda needed a bit more attention -- it is a very good example of a high-modernist project, and is a great example to explore in the course.",
                "Professor Jonny Steinberg demonstrated exceptional expertise in the subject matter. His selection of course readings was particularly insightful, contributing significantly to the depth and quality of the course content.The way Professor Steinberg conducted the course during class and outside in meeting with him was commendable. His guidance and feedback were pivotal in navigating the complexities of the subject. While the course benefitted greatly from Professor Steinberg's direct involvement, it would be beneficial to incorporate more structured opportunities for student-to-student interaction. This can be achieved through group projects, peer lead starts to the class or review of the previous week or discussion groups centered around the course readings."

It's a really great introduction to the field, to each of these topics, and one of the few Political Science seminars that is really engaging and worth the effort you put into it. Each of the topics is very carefully chosen and the overall course is really relevant to anyone who wants to seriously understand African states and what bureaucracy means as more than a throwaway term about inefficiency.",
