                "It would be borderline impossible to express in words how much I developed as a student and as a person through my time in this class. I came into college with a very narrow and instrumental view of what my education should be for; namely, a certification of my intelligence and work ethic that I could present to employers in four years' time. But over this semester, as I grappled with the ideas of Christian, East Asian, contemporary, socialist, and feminist writers and forced myself to become receptive instead of dismissive, I began to pick apart the protectionist shell that sheathed my identity and critically examined a good chunk of my identity. What were my core values? Why was I placed here at Yale? Who did I want to become in four years, and how should I shape my education to realize that future self?\r\n\r\nBeing my first and only college course with a writing component, I can confidently say that I've learned to gravitate towards substantial rather than flowery writing, to outline properly rather than diving headfirst into an essay, and to seek help (thanks Poorvu!) rather than rely on self-evaluation. Although it wasn't easy to snap into it at 9 AM on Mondays, I learned to craft responses to my classmates during discussions that were constructive and thought-out. and I realized the value of taking notes and listening with intent, as being required to do end-of-week self-assessments compelled me to not zone out.",
                "This course made me very comfortable sharing my experiences or thoughts to the seminar.",
                "I developed a deeper way of thinking about how I approach my college education.",
                "This was the most incredible course! I learned how to analyze and look at the direction of my life to find meaning. I also learned about religions and had meaningful conversations.",
                "I gained insight not only into many scholars throughout history and time about the pedagogy of education, but also about what makes a life meaningful beyond performance, numerical evaluations, and competition. I think that this course allowed me to consider and reconsider everything that I felt had meaning and weight in my life and consider whether these stakeholders were healthy for me.",
                "I learned how to live a more fulfilling and meaningful life.",
                "Learning about Confucian, Christian, and modern education models.",
                "This course was a wonderful introduction to not only Education Studies, but to understanding myself with the help of various religious and moral frameworks. I was exposed to fundamental pillars of Confucianism and Christianity, and the thoughts of authors like Paulo Freire and Mary Wollstonecraft. \r\nIdentifying these pillars allowed us to discuss how religions and certain philosophical beliefs influence people's vision of a life worth living, and the role education plays in a life worth living. I do not think I would have been able to identify and isolate the type of person I want to become in college and ways in which Yale can help me achieve this (or deter me from achieving this) without EDST 065."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The selected readings represent a wide variety of viewpoints, and the questions that we are asked to discuss often lead to some very interesting tangents. More generally, I think the broader topics that the course covers are necessary for every freshman to reflect on, and while doing so might stimulate more questions than answers, the process of finding said answers is the essence of college, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was not uncommon for 2-3 students to completely dominate the discussion and leave other students without space to make comments. Towards the end of the course, when we got into Paolo Freire and bell hooks, it sometimes felt like students were throwing around the same politically correct buzzwords to signal their alignment with the authors' viewpoints, making for an echo chamber of sorts.\r\n\r\nImprovements: The instructor could be more deliberate in encouraging roundtable discussion instead of discourse among a select, vocal few, either by breaking the class up into smaller groups or calling on people who haven't spoken yet to share their ideas.",
                "Strengths: Professor!",
                "I wish there was more FGLI inclusive topics about college.",
                "This course is truly amazing and has incredible sources to have a holistic understanding. There were so many meaningful conversations and a welcoming environment. The only weakness is that it was hard to write final papers with no examples, as the instructions are broad. But once you book office hours (1 on 1 conversations/walks) it is so helpful.",
                "I really enjoyed how the instructor was supportive of everybody's comments, and made each student and their work feel valued and worthy of being in this class. I do think that the seminar was a bit larger to ensure that everybody was able to contribute meaningfully, but the engagement was still very high.",
                "Everything was amazing from the content to teacher.",
                "Although it was a very cool course, I wouldn't describe it as life-changing as many other evaluations had said so when I chose to take the course. Read the course syllabus, you will be interacting with Confucian and Christian texts the most. If you want to interact with diverse authors and perspectives, this course is not for you.",
                "This course had a really good balance between small group activities and seminar discussion.",
                "I am really grateful that this course was offered as a First-Year seminar, as it helped hone my writing and reading skills, and challenged me to participate every class. One potential weakness, which is perhaps unavoidable, is how quickly we skimmed through certain works and books. I wish we had more time in class to discuss what we were reading, and I wish discussions were a bit more engaging rather with more people participating so that we could have a range of perspectives represented."
