            "comments": [
                "Moves too quickly",
                "You come out with such a breadth of knowledge of organic chemistry, and a broad understanding of how drugs can be made. However, it's honestly two semester worth of content. Huge workload with dozens of individual mechanisms to learn, but if you put the work in, I think you can learn a lot.",
                "The biggest weakness of the courses is that it is a lecture and is super low engagement which does not help solidify anything that you're learning about. I did ochem I in the flipped classroom model and that approach was so so much better at keeping you engaged and actually thinking about the course content than just listening to a lecture. I found myself having to individually go over all of the topics covered in class using the textbook. Additionally, the course went super fast. We went through so many mechanisms in class just one after another so after a while it all just became a big mush of hexagons and arrows; week after week you would go into class just to copy down mechanisms from the board without really having time to think about what you were actually copying down into your notes.",
                "Prof. Miller seems very passionate about this course, but he is not the best lecturer. His exam questions also do not reflect content he covers in lecture/section.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- The content: I absolutely loved the content of this course, more so than O-Chem I. I also preferred the lecture format (I came from CHEM 174, which was flipped classroom); it was more conducive to learning. \r\n- Dr. Miller, Dr. Clark, and the TAs are incredible, and office hours are very accessible. It's no exaggeration to say there are office hours every day, and every single person loved talking about organic chemistry. They were also extremely approachable. \r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Sometimes, it felt like the course moved too fast. I understand that this is due to the nature of the course (we are covering a lot of content) and frankly, the content is manageable by reviewing lecture notes after class, as Dr. Miller advises. That being said, during lecture, it is a little overwhelming how much information is being covered.",
                "go through material too fast with not enough review/practice makes it hard to learn/retain and keep up in the course",
                "i'm thankful that lectures were recorded so that i could go back and look at them. i'm also thankful lecture notes were posted as i usually find lecture only stressful when i have to copy down everything and listen at the same time.",
                "This semester of organic chemistry was great. Professor Miller is a wonderful lecturer. Aaron and the TAs did a great job providing support and additional research. I feel that the grading and organization of the course were fair. It was a little fast paced at times but that is typical.",
                "The course has many strengths. It's organized to facilitate student learning. The TAs are always ready to help, Aaron is AMAZING and always there to provide assistance, and Professor Miller is so kind in truly wanting students to learn. He is very knowledgable and presents content in a way that is clear and well-taught. It's clear he cares (:",
                "Strengths: Professor Miller is a good professor. You can tell he is really passionate, knowledgeable, and loves talking about organic chemistry. He also seemed very nice and approachable - a breath of fresh air from some other STEM professors I have had at Yale. I really liked having the lecture notes beforehand - that way if something was messy/hard to read, you could always go back and look it up. \r\nWeaknesses: The first and second midterms of the semester were very fair - and I felt like I had time to go into the content, do practice, and really understand it. The last third of the semester went WAY TOO FAST. It felt like after spring break, the teaching team said \"oh dang, the school year is almost over\" and started going two times as fast. I woke up in the middle of the night, my heart racing, thinking about the insurmountable amount of content you had to know for Midterm 3. And it WAS insurmountable, I felt like I needed 2 months of studying nothing but the content for Midterm 3 (not any other classes, not taking any time for friends or rest) to even hope to feel comfortable with content for the exam. It came down to cramming a little about a lot of reactions into your brain for the third midterm. So what's the solution? SPREAD OUT THE CONTENT so it's not a mad dash to the end, and so that morale is not so low at the end of the semester. A lecture pointing out the patterns - instead of just alluding to \"there are patterns\" - would also be helpful.",
                "Strengths: I think Professor Miller is a great lecturer and person in general, so most of his lectures were definitely pretty interesting and comprehensive. The course was super comprehensive, so there was no doubt that we learned a lot of information, which is definitely a positive. The TFs were also really dedicated to the course and helping students. Lastly, I think the difficulty of the course was great in developing a sense of community among the students.\r\nWeaknesses: This course was comprehensive, which I said was a positive, but the negative part of that was that it should have been better balanced between Orgo I and Orgo II the second semester had 15x the amount of reactions and mechanisms that had to be memorized. The exams were rather hard, but they averaged out pretty low so that kind of compensated for it. I think Prof. Miller, while great, was a little bit disconnected from the course, but I guess I understand that given how busy he is. Lastly, I think it's slightly unfair to have Aaron, a PhD in teaching organic chemistry, teaching sections. Not that the grad students don't do a terrific job on their own, but the averages in Aaron's sections were always a bit higher than the other sections.",
                "I think the exams were too removed from the content of the course and the questions were too unpredictable as a result.",
                "I think it's unfair how the grading of midterms works toward your overall grade. We get 1 drop and 2 midterm grades that we keep. I got the average grade on the first midterm. I dropped my second midterm, and was slightly under the average on the third midterm that we took. However, the average on the first midterm was 75% and the average on the last one was below 60%. People who got average on other midterms which had a higher average are going to do better in the course because they comparatively did better on easier tests that ended up being my drop. They dropped the harder ones which I did better on comparatively. \r\n\r\nBesides this, I think that the course is well structured.",
                "Strengths: Plenty of practice material. Lectures are clear. Sectional is helpful. Tests are decent.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures can get dry and when Miller tries to show a real life example from a paper it is often unintelligible. I like the concept but it could be executed a little better.",
                "Strengths: Professor Miller, psets helped make sure I understood the topics, TAs, group work in section, lectures were clear \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: exams were extremely challenging and unfair, we often didn't have enough time for the exams",
                "the lectures are very boring, I would suggest using the study guide and textbook to help understand the structure of the class prior to him lecturing.",
                "Strengths: professor cares\r\nWeaknesses: Averages were in the F and D range. Felt like a hole once you did bad on one test. Didnt seem the phase instructors and worried about how grading will be done",
                "I think it would be better if all concepts were thoroughly taught in class and not just gone over during sections, as different sections cover different levels of info.",
                "Solid course.",
                "This class was heaviliy exam focused, which made it slightly stressful when it came to grading.",
                "The strength of this course was the way it was taught. The lecture were clear and the concepts were very well described. One of the weaknesses of this course was the speed of the lectures and the way that the content was taught, because it was easy to fall behind in your understanding of the concepts of one chapter by the time that you moved on to the next chapter.",
                "Professor Miller was incredible; he explained things in lecture really well and in a clear way/order of ideas; I also liked the way he tried to connect topics to real life, current day applications in medicine/science. The assignments helped me learn the material and the pacing was quick but doable, and the exams were challenging but also interesting to take. Overall, great class--I came into it not really liking orgo but at the end I was sad that I was done with orgo!",
                "The last portion of the course felt a bit rushed.",
                "The biggest strength of the course is that it focuses on the underlying principles and understanding the reasons behind things instead of memorization. I also think Prof. Miller is an excellent professor who really cares about the material, which makes the course better. The biggest weakness is that it goes really fast.",
                "I wish we could do more synthesis practice and mechanism practice in class, but I thought lectures were very insightful.",
                "Professors are kind; however, I wish Professor Miller was more aware that a lot of us are not organic chemistry geeks and need a bit more background information on topics.",
                "Strength: Prof Miller, TAs\r\nWeaknesses: Achieve problems were A LOT. I could barely make them some weeks. They werent a grade like last semester, but I was still trying my best to get to them.",
                "Lack of support from peer tutors which I heavily relied on for the first semester of orgo",
                "Strengths  Professor Miller clearly loves what he teaches and his enthusiasm for the subject matter is infectious. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses  the exams were unnecessarily hard and often went far beyond the course material, requiring students to apply principles that we had only covered briefly in class to exam problems that were completely new/required a few leaps in logic. This was the first stem class I have taken at Yale (and I am a stem major) where I had to read the textbook multiple times just to understand the basics of the course material before taking exams because the lectures didnt cover the material in detail enough to ensure success on an exam. The practice midterms posted to Canvas also were not really indicative of the level of difficulty of the actual exams.",
                "very interesting and well organized",
                "Professor Miller was good at teaching the concepts in a way that made them easy to remember. The TAs and preceptor (Dr. Clark) were all very helpful. One weakness was that Prof. Miller would go on tangents about things that were too specific for us to need to know, and while they were interesting, they weren't helpful to us and they came at the expense of rushing through material that was on the syllabus (we unfortunately didn't get to the last 4 chapters in much detail). Overall, it was a very interesting class though, I enjoyed it more than the first semester of organic chemistry.",
                "Strengths: They provided a lot of resources for extra practice if you wanted it.\r\nWeaknesses: While understandably this has to be a fast-paced course, sometimes important content that was tested on exams was rushed.",
                "Very well organized, notes and lectures were very clear and designed to facilitate student learning",
                "Certain Tas were much more effective than others.",
                "The courses was structured exceptionally well. No complaints.",
                "The lectures moved very quickly and did not seem to Go to the depth required for the exams. Exam grading was very harsh and little partial credit was given. In addition, several students from first year organic chemistry joined the class, and since their first semester curriculum was more comprehensive than ours, they were much better prepared for the course (for example, we never formally covered Grignard etc in first semester but they clearly did).",
                "One strength was the collaborative homework which led to a lot more communication with classmates than I wouldve taken on. Another strength was the review sessions for each midterm (and the extremely accommodating midterm schedule).",
                "Difficult and volatile: I never knew how I was doing in this class.",
                "The course lectures were always very engaging, and I found it helpful that materials (and recordings) would always be posted on the Canvas page for the class. I also appreciated how many resources were available if students needed help through TA and peer tutor office hours or via email. \r\n\r\nSometimes I found it difficult to know how to prepare for assessments in this class, though.",
                "Strengths: availability of practice exams, amazing TFs\r\nWeaknesses: course was extremely ambitious and instruction was uneven, forcing students to do a lot of learning on their own",
                "Strengths: Dr. Miller is a generally good lecturer, though the course moves quickly. The TAs set you up in groups for homework submission, which was helpful.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The tests, while not unfair, were often harder than the practice exams, so its kind of hard to know what youre in for. This course is a lot of content - the less you can miss lecture the better.",
                "The strengths of this course is the teaching staff and workload. The workload is very manageable and the exams were fairly reasonable. The weaknesses were the problem sets. The assigned problem sets were just from the textbook and I wish they would've been more like organic chemistry I where they were separate from the textbook and more similar to exam questions. Problem sets weren't very collaborative as I preferred to do assigned textbook problems independently as I'm doing the reading.",
                "I felt like support from TAs was a little lacking, what with a lot of office hour changes. It just wasnt as well founded as organic chemistry 1 was. The lectures were a bit hard to follow also.",
                "Overall, the course was structured fairly well. The order of the presented material was logical, and it was a great benefit to have all lecture material posted in Canvas in clearly delineated locations. The one weakness of the class is probably that the problem sets, which are entirely made up of denoted textbook problems, do not match the difficulty of problems presented on the exams. Additionally, the practice exams also did not match the difficulty of problems presented on the exams. At the very least, it would definitely benefit the class to have written problem sets (not taken from the textbook) that more closely resembled what students were likely to see on exams.",

                "If youre pre med its not fun though",
                "If you need it for your major. Otherwise, it's better to learn the content elsewhere without the incredible pressure of so much content in such little time. We basically did a topic a lesson.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who has a genuine interest in organic chemistry. Ochem II is no joke compared to ochem I, so think hard before committing to the second semester if you don't absolutely have to take it. If you do not have a genuine interest in organic chemistry, this course will become miserable for you very soon. The workload is greater than for first semester ochem, so if you're not truly fascinated by some of the more complex organic reaction mechanisms or synthetic tools I don't think this course is for you.",
                "Of course, especially if Dr. Miller is teaching it! Before taking this course, I read reviews noting the difficulty of Dr. Miller's instruction and exams and frankly, I was terrified. However, from the first class, Dr. Miller + the CHEM 221 team make it very clear that they are there to help you learn, no question is too trivial or stupid, and the focus should be on learning organic chemistry. This ended up being my favorite course of the semester, and I'm not even a chem major!",
                "You are probably not taking this class because you are interested, but for some requirement. However, this is a great way to take the second semester of organic chemistry. The class was so much more fun than the first semester and I felt like I understand the material much better coming out of lecture after learning it for the first time. Professor Miller is incredibly smart and caring.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! It is amazing, you learn a lot, and it facilitates working with your peers for PSETs!",
                "You probably need this course as a requirement. It will take A LOT of your time. The teaching team should remind themselves that Orgo II is not the only difficult class or time-consuming experience students are participating in. A little grace, an acknowledgment that this is hard and that we are trying our best would be nice.",
                "As with most reviews on advanced STEM courses, I would only recommend this course if you need to take it for your major or for career goals. It is extremely dense, and you will be spending large amounts of time trying to digest what happens after each lecture. Some of the lectures were so dense that they left me with my mouth open. That said, if you put the time into developing some instinct when it comes to reactions and mechanism (i.e., partial positive charge on carbonyl can be attacked by a nucleophile to start a mechanism and/or pKa trends to predict mechanisms of attack) then you should have an upper hand. Definitely go to each of the sections, as they are good review for what to expect on exams. The exams are tough  not going to sugar coat it. I think that it's a very comprehensive course, but difficult and will eat up a lot of your time throughout the semester. Stick through it, and you'll get out of it okay.",
                "While the content is interesting to study, it is hard to predict what will be tested.",
                "Not unless its required for your major. The workload isn't worth it.",
                "Only if you need it for med school, as a major requirement, or you really like orgo. Generally, the class is good, but not sure how beneficial it is after Orgo 1.",
                "If you have to take it or if you REALLY like organic chemistry.",
                "Don't really suggest unless you need to take organic chemistry or you really love it.",
                "Only if you have to take it",
                "I would. it is a fun course with interesting material and its challenging, which prepares students for future hard courses.",
                "Yes, its actually pretty interesting and even if you do bad you will learn a lot of cool stuff.",
                "Yes, this class taught me valuable topics that I believe will help me later down the line.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I struggled in Organic Chemistry I, but by the time that I took this course, I felt like I understood the concepts much better, and I was able to appreciate the applications of organic chemistry in medicine and other natural sciences. The course is very challenging, but if it is a requirement for a student's major or pre-professional track, then it is a highly worthwhile course. It is especially rewarding to understand the concepts taught after struggling through problems or lectures at the beginning.",
                "yes; much preferable to my orgo 1 experience and actually really interesting, although a good amount of work",
                "Yes",
                "Absolutely not.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course if you're interested in chemistry!! It's definitely a lot of work, but you learn so much throughout the semester, and the work is manageable if you actually want to learn the content.",
                "Yes I would due to the professor and TAs being excellent in teaching this course",
                "If you are interested in the chemistry, I would take this class--but know what you are signing up for. The class goes through so many reactions, it can be exceedingly difficult to remember them all without putting in regular time to review and study them. As someone who was not the best about that this semester, I felt overwhelmed when I finally sat down to study for exams and had so many reactions to cover. It can be easy to put this class on the back burner and realize too late that you don't have the time to properly learn everything. My advice would be to take ~half an hour each week to write down every single reaction you covered that week and review the ones you'd done before. Honestly, maybe even ~5 minutes a day just to stick them in your head. I know it sounds cliche, but I think it would really help deal with the immensity of this class.",
                "Yes, yes, and a thousand times yes. I think the information is useful to anyone aspiring to go into medicine especially. Dr. Clark made a really good point when we were learning spectroscopy and NMR about how were probably never going to use this specific information later, but were practicing the skills of taking in a bunch of information about a compound and deducing its structure, much like a diagnosis from symptoms.",
                "I would not recommend this course to anyone, unless it is explicitly required for a major. Most medical schools do not even require two years of organic chemistry-this is not worth it. The lecture notes posted often do not match up with what is taught in class and the professor also tends to write things wrong both in class and on the notes so it is very confusing to figure out what is going on yourself.",
                "I would recommend this course with Professor Miller and this teaching team to any student who loves chemistry or is interested in learning more about synthetic chemistry.",
                "yes",
                "If you took the first semester of organic chemistry, then yes I would recommend it because it is an interesting expansion on the material you learned with new applications and concepts. Even if it's not required for your major, then it still is an interesting class to take, though it's a pretty high workload if you want to really understand it.",
                "Yes, you can only say you learned organic chemistry at an undergraduate level by taking orgo ii",
                "Yes. Organic chemistry is tough, but this course is structured very well to facilitate learning.",
                "No, this class made the spring semester one of the most stressful that Ive endured at Yale. Even for premed students I would not recommend putting themselves through another semester of this.",
                "Definitely, even if the student wasnt pre-med. Its such a unique kind of problem-solving.",
                "Yes if they need this class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I originally dreaded having to take another semester of organic chemistry, but Im very glad that I was able to take this class and would encourage a student to take it even if it is not necessary to fulfill a major or distributional requirement.",
                "Yes, if required for premed.",
                "Professor Miller seems to be a generally good orgo professor. Hes personable, explains concepts well enough, and seems to really care about the course. Its a lot of content and takes time to learn well. You have to use your agency to get help if you need it, but there are TAs and peer tutors if you make the time.",
                "If you are pre med and are not required to take orgo II for your major and did well in orgo I, I would still recommend taking this course. I feel like I have a much better grasp on organic synthesis and other concepts that will be very beneficial in biochemistry. I found this course much more interesting than orgo I as well with more biological and medical applications. Especially if Dr. Miller is teaching it, I would 100% recommend taking this.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless it is for a chemistry major requirement because of the rigor of this course.",
                "If you think itll help you then yes",
                "Yes -- CHEM 221 is a great follow up to 220. 220 is only scratching the surface of useful and powerful organic reactions; take 221 to dive deeper. That said, the central themes of 220 -- resonance, inductive effects, and hyperconjugation -- still play a big role in 221."
