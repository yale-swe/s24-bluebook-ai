It was a great, well-rounded intro to deep learning not only as it is used in various applications, but also some of the theory behind deep learning architectures. The course is also very up to date, with a portion of the content being developments within the last year or two. The only potential weakness I could say is that there is a significant gap between when the material is taught and when it appears on Psets, but in a way, this helped reinforced what we learned.",

The class was very interesting and a student can learn a lot about neural networks in this course.",

Exams are written to trick students, mostly, and do not really test knowledge that has any intrinsic value other than duviding those who took notes about the smallest things said in lecture from those who did not. \r\n\r\nProfessor Scaz is, however, engaging and very dedicated to the field, which is apparent in the way he teaches the class.
