   "comments": [
    "Knowledge of less-familiar vocal repertories and of early-Modern\/nationalist era aesthetic trends across Western Europe; comfort in performing (singing) regularly in front of a group of my peers, which was terrifying at the beginning of the course; various technical improvements in vocal production",
    "Vocal technique, performance skills, diction for french, spanish, english, and swedish songs.",
    "How to accompany wonderful singers!",
    "I learned how to learn and perform classical art songs in various languages.",
    "I learned how to sing and how to become a better accompanist",
    "I learned how to sing classically.",
    "How to perform art song in English, French, Spanish, and Swedish and recite sonnets.",
    "I learned the music of Virgil Thomson, John Ireland, Reynaldo Hahn, Wilhelm Stenhammar and Fernando Obradors. I learned poetry by a wide range of poets, perfected my Swedish, worked on my French, and learned some new English-language repertoire.",
    "In this course, I was constantly pushed to be learning new music and quickly. Vocally, I've always had problems memorizing music and with the piano, I've always learned slowly (and now I know why: due to low practice hours and ineffective practice hours). Despite having performed a ton as a singer, I had an insane lack of confidence and fear of failing when it came to playing piano in front of people. The repetition of performance - I really can't stress how much it helped me identify and push through hangups. \r\n\r\nThe motivation you get to do well when you're performing for people you like - people who become your friends - is far more powerful and also feels more meaningful than any pset deadline.\r\n\r\nI also had the privilege of meeting with both Professor Lalli and Sara Kohane every week. They are both extremely patient and accommodating and are responsive to what you need to get better. After a class where I felt I embarrassed myself, Sara and Lalli would come up to me after class and gently provide suggestions to make my piano practice more helpful. Whenever I asked for help, they shared a wealth of practice tools that helped me learn how approach a passage of music in a less daunting way (and with a metronome lol) and how to balance my playing with a singer (and vica versa)."

   "comments": [
    "Wonderful music! Geared really well both to the pianists and singers, no complaints!",
    "This class is awesome! I improved and learned so much over the semester! Sometimes instructions and exact expectations could be a little clearer, and it might be helpful to assign pieces to everyone from the start instead of two people picking and learning the same song. However, the class is always super fun, and it is a great way to spend your Tuesday evening.",
    "Good classroom feel, tight bonds with classmates. Curriculum is too Western.",
    "It is the greatest course Yale has to offer. Prof. Lalli and Sara are brilliant. You will get as much out of it as you put into it.",
    "This course is designed for singers who have at least some experience. It's strength is that it allows us to learn a wide range of repertoire thoroughly and fairly quickly. The weakness is that it is not the easiest for a brand-new singer.",
    "The biggest strength of this course are the repeated performances. They really force you to identify and push through your performance problems.\r\n\r\nOtherwise Professor Lalli and Sara are incredibly helpful. They'll help you with anything given that you ask. And they go out of their way to identify problems and give you the tools to get better."

    "Better experience will invariably result from SMALLER class sizes; the more individual attention you get, the better. If singing is your passion there's no better organized course here, other than lessons; if you're not enthusiastic about doing this in an operatic manner, you're out of luck, though it's my opinion that that's where the best vocal training is to be found. Regular (daily) practice required to progress effectively - not much, just make sure it's regular (half hour per day is fine). I would recommend going into class with a set of specific objectives, i.e. reducing performance anxiety, working on specific technical\/stylistic aspect, etc. Lalli is a character and a great experience, and Sara Kohane (pianist\/coach) is simply wonderful.",
    "Yes! Both for singers who are just beginning to study art song or singers who have been studying for many years!",
    "Yes if you love singing and\/or vocal accompaniment- self-selective",
    "If you want to become a better singer, definitely take this class. It will help you in everyday, and it is so much fun! Also, it is a very low pressure environment, so it is a super safe space to make mistakes and learn.",
    "Yes. If you get in you will absolutely regret not taking this opportunity. This applies whether you want to pursue a career in singing or not.",
    "Yes, take this class if you are at all interested in classical music or want to sing more.",
    "In this course, I was constantly pushed to be learning new music and quickly.
