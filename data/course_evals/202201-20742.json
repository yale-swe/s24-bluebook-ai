Mostly focused on African American English, but also learned about unique constructions from other dialects. Talked about how all languages/dialects follow consistent internal rules and about the impacts of linguistic discrimination in criminal justice/education/etc.",

                "Interesting material. The variety in the linguistics background of the students can sometimes feel slightly disruptive, but I think the instructors have done a good job managing this, all things considered.",
                "Strengths: good blend of linguistics majors + people with no linguistics background (like me); totally accessible for someone with no background; readings do a good job explaining the basics; chance to explore what interests you (research projects are pretty broad); professor is lovely and tells interesting anecdotes; class community was very positive\r\n\r\nImprovements: didn't anticipate so many small assignments/quizzes (weren't listed in the syllabus); sometimes class discussion felt like it spent too much time reviewing the readings",
                "Kinda repetitive at times but interesting",
                "Strengths: interesting material and readings, fair assessments, Raffaella and Milena!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had done more on sociolinguistics",
                "The course was really well taught, and what we learned was very interesting. The quizzes covered lots of lectures and were a little hard to review for, the papers were a good amount of work but not too much, and there were several small assignments that were easy to forget or not notice like the reading response but overall a great course.",
                "The strengths were that the course felt extremely interesting, the course material we covered was diverse, and even with someone with no linguistics background I was able to follow along for the most part. You'll definitely learn a lot and the \r\nWeaknesses: The class was very disorganized. There was no syllabus, last minute assignments were added, there wasn't a clear sense of how to organize our studying, expectations could be confusing, and homework was sent out for the week (class on Monday and Wednesday) on the weekends.",
                "I found that this course seemed to really focus on AAVE, which is fine, as I know there is much stigma around this particular dialect. However, I do wish we looked at a wider range of regions. I feel like some regions were only mentioned in passing, and I was expecting to get a good look at the different regional dialects in America.",
                "The course does provide an overview of linguistics, but it quickly dives into specific ideas and terminology that are difficult to understand if you are not a linguistics student or already familiar with the concepts."

If you have already taken many linguistics courses, I would recommend this class as long as you either want an easier class or you are willing to put in effort to go more in depth into the material than many other students in the class for whom this is their first linguistics class (it's more rewarding this way).",
                "This is a great introductory linguistics class. Raffaella is terrific!",
                "Definitely! If you want to explore linguistics without taking a big intro lecture course, LING 211 is fantastic -- you learn a lot of basic linguistics but also get to dive deep into research topics that interest you and think about real-world applications. The professor + TA were both very supportive and engaged.",

                "I took this class in my final semester, and it was one of my favorite courses I've taken in four years. If you want a class that will regularly make you share what you've learned with your friends at the lunch table, this is the one.",
                "Yes, but it's not a super easy class. The psets aren't challenging but expect a decent amount of work in learning how to write a linguistics paper if you're taking this as a non linguistics major",
                "Yes, it was personally a really informative, fun class. I learned a lot-- there were a lot of party tricks that I could pull out (linguistic knowledge, trivia, etc.) However, it was frustrating because the grading was inconsistent and harsh. We didn't know what was going on in terms of assignments because the grading was really harsh.",
                "I would recommend this course. I found it was interesting and had new things to teach me as a linguistics major, though it was mostly taken by non-majors this semester and was therefore taught in a way that was accessible to them.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in diversity within linguistics, but be wary of the complex ideas that may push non-linguistics majors to credit D the class."
