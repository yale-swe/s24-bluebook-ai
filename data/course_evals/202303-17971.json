In this course, I learned to flexibly and rigorously approach complex, abstract ideas and put them into conversation with one another. This course equipped me to give a thoughtful answer to the question of what Existentialism is and to elucidate various philosophical debates about its subordinate ideas.",

                "very interesting readings, and we cover a lot over the course of the semester. extremely well organized.",
                "The readings were really dynamic and interesting to read with one another. I especially liked the music aspect of the assigned material, so I think integrating even more multimedia assignments could be interesting.",
                "Strengths: Professor Khawaja is a fascinating thinker.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes it felt like discussions without a fundamental common understanding of the text. This made conversations not very fruitful.\r\nAlso I wish we hadnt (mid-semester) cut the piece on antisemitism.",
                "Jorge and Noreen really really care!!! There's so much in that",
                "Existentialism with Professor Khawaja is a fantastic course. Its strengths are manifold. First, there is the strength of the syllabus. It's an exhilarating selection of works, ranging from philosophical tomes to literature, art, and music. In this way the course is 'interdisciplinary,' not in the buzzword way, but rather because it takes seriously human thought in whatever form it manifests. For another, there is Professor Khawaja. She is a remarkable instructor not only for her depth of knowledge, but also for her attentiveness to pedagogy. Rather than 'debate' or 'dissect' texts on the syllabus, we were encouraged to try ideas on for size, embedding others' thinking into our way of being and examining not only its internal consistency, but also what personal and social obstacles the existentialist tradition can reframe. Professor Khawaja's thoughtful teaching extends to her assignments. While fewer in number and shorter in length than in most other seminar contexts, writing for Existentialism is a stimulating and productive experience. This is due to the fact that Professor Khawaja creates seminar conditions where good questions are just as valuable as good answers. Her advice for both writing assignments--rather than insist that we formulate and defend an 'original' idea--was that we isolate something we don't understand and make a project of understanding it better. Knowing that I was going to be evaluated on the integrity and thoroughness of my thinking rather than the rightness or wrongness of my idea made writing for this class feel vibrant. \r\n\r\nI think that the course could be improved if it met twice a week. Some texts on the syllabus are dense, not only on a first, but also on second and third readings. Discussing them in a marathon 2hr class can become tiring. I think that meeting twice weekly would alleviate fatigue by making for slightly shorter meetings. It would have the added benefit of reinforcing new concepts.",
                "I enjoyed the readings and the discussions a lot. As a non-philosophy or RLST student, I felt a little overwhelmed by the speed of the course towards the beginning of the semester and might have appreciated a bit more of a framework or a lead-in. However, as the semester went on, I got used to the way that philosophical reading, discussion, and writing worked, and I ended up getting a lot out of the class.",
                "Noreen and Jorge are both fabulous, the reading is fascinating, and they do a great job of structuring the class such that everyone really comes prepared. Classroom discussion was always dense and engaging, though sometimes I felt the topical distribution was a bit off - we sometimes avoided the trickiest parts of texts, or only got to them at the end. I also found that the same few people sat close to the professor each week and ended up monopolizing certain discussions, though their contributions were always astute and usually helpful.",
                "strenghths-- professor and TA knowledge \r\nweaknesses-- minimal outlined expectations for papers, not a lot of feedback, could have had more biographical background \/ context on the authors prior to reading"
