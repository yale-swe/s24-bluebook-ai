I came into the class first semester with no prior knowledge of the language, and now after two semesters can have conversations with Persian speaking family members in Persian. Not only did I learn a ton of vocab and most important grammar rules, I came away with a better understanding of my heritage and culture.",
                "I've learned a lot about Persian culture and language in a very detailed way. I am now able to write several page essays, perform skits, and hold long conversations in Persian.",
                "This course will build effectively on PERS 110 and will improve your grasp of Persian grammar and your ability to write. Taken together, L1 and L2 build a significant amount of knowledge for the beginner. If you are unfamiliar with Persian culture, the course also includes a number of great activitieswe watched contemporary films, visited the Babylonian collection at Sterling Library, celebrated Nowruz, and even took a day trip down to New York to visit the Met. The small class size and five-day-a-week schedule contributes to strong bonding among the students.",
                "I learned about Persian language and culture, including a lot more vocabulary and useful grammar. I can now have comfortable basic conversations",

                "Strengths: I learned SO much and our class is so close, Professor Shayesteh does a lot with what little she has funding for (we were able to go to NYC and eat at a Persian restaurant and look at Iranian art at the Met), even though the textbook/workbook is terrible, Professor Shayesteh is able to make her lessons and the class flow very well, Negin (our TA) was AMAZING\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Shayesteh is the only Persian language professor in the department which is crazy, so, unfortunately, there are not a lot of section/time options for classes, the textbook/workbook is terrible there are vocabulary words that repeat, it is hard to understand what each exercise is asking you to do (to be fair there are probably not a lot of textbook/workbooks out there and it is better than nothing), it is A LOT of work: we have mandatory section on top of an every day course and homework every night",
                "Strengths: you learn an immense amount over the course of a semester. You have to take the course seriously, but if you do, you will not be disappointedyou will learn to speak a beautiful language. Professor Shayesteh is engaging and always willing to help.\r\n\r\nTo do well you must put in a lot of work, but it is well worth it. If you are motivated to learn the language, you will find the course incredibly enriching.",
                "This course really helped build a strong understanding of Persian grammar, vocabulary, and conversational customs. Our class went to the MET, a Persian restaurant, and the Babylonian Collection in Sterling and learned a significant amount from each experience. In order for this course to be improved, it would be great to have the opportunity and resources to have more of these kinds of visits, which really enriched the class.",
                "The Persian department at Yale as a whole is underfunded. Our professor does a lot of work with the resources she has but additional resourcesto update the textbook, include more activities, etcwould improve the learning experience. \r\n\r\nThe professor is attentive to the needs of the students and when we approached her with requests she would adjust her syllabus to meet our needs.",
                "Strengths: We learn a ton of Persian, and the curriculum itself is strong (ie. textbooks, vocabulary). We have access to multiple tutors. We do Persian culture learning such as the Persian new year and trips to the Beinecke and Metropolitan Museum of Art.\r\nWeaknesses: The class is a lot of work, and grading feels arbitrarily frustrating at times. We rarely ever receive A's on assignments or exams because of the small, inevitable mistakes of learning a new language, and because we lose points for things that we haven't even learned yet.",
                "The course is excellent at building community to encourage language use outside of class. More practice resources would be very helpful in the future.",
                "I really appreciated the interactive and experiential portions of the course, like visiting the MET to look at Iranian art, incorporated into a Persian culture day at NYC, or like visiting the Babylonian collection at Sterling Library. Sometimes it felt hard to met the requirements for succeeding in the class, but overall was really great and I feel like I learned a lot."

The trip to New York and our Nowruz party were particularly highlights, as was the film screening at the end of the semester. Also, since the class is small and meets every day you really get to know your classmates. I made so many friends in my Persian class, and after two semesters with almost the same group, we all are close.",

                "Persian is a rarely-taught language so this is a great opportunity to learn!",
                "Yes, you should take this course if you're willing to be patient and put in the work - a serious challenge. It's extremely rewarding to learn Persian language and culture, both of which are beautiful. You will become close with the other students in the class (that's how I've made some of my closest friends at Yale). You'll get to go to the Met, Beinecke, and Babylonian collection to view historic artifacts. The Persian music, movies, and videos we listened to in class were fun, too. I'm grateful for the course.",
                "I would recommend it, especially to students interested in critical languages.",
