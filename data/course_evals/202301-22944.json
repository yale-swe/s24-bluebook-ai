                "Strengths are that the lecture slides are generally clear, the problem sets are applicable, and quizzes are just challenging enough. A weakness is that some lectures are a bit dry. Although the professor did warn about this when we got to a particularly dull section on navigating the tax system for example.",
                "The course perfectly balances economic assumptions with cutting-edge research! Case studies provide opportunities to dive further in depth. If anything, problem set takeaways are not easily applicable.",
                "I love the practical nature of the classI have learned so much about personal finances, including topics that I did not know require as much attention from me and topics that I have never heard of before. Professor Choi is a great lecturer (love his pacing and teaching style) and keeps the class interesting with guest speakers. The class is less focused on testing and grades, and more about personal growthyou get as much out of the class as you want from it.\r\n\r\nA big weakness of the class is the out-of-class support, especially for homework. Given that homework represents a significant portion of the grade, I expected more support and structure for the class, including office hours. Instead, the TAs seem to be uncomfortable with both the questions and the topic of the PSETs, and Office Hours are done sporadically, at challenging hours (e.g., most happen at 6 PM, right during dinner hours) and announced very late (1-2 days before), making it difficult to try to schedule Office Hours into the day-to-day plan.",
                "Strengths: Professor is very knowledgeable in the subject and goes above and beyond when explaining certain topics of the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very limited number of office hours for problem sets.",
                "The psets and quizzes were a little hard, but they were intellectually stimulating exercises. I often wished we did more examples in class that applied to the psets, but the material was well distributed through the semester.",
                "This course is very well organized with very comprehensive lectures. The material itself can be dry at times (probably unavoidable when discussing things like taxes), but it is overall well structured to keep students engaged. The *almost* daily pop quizzes help provide incentive to keep up with lecture material and the homeworks offer a chance to go in depth on a topic covered in class.",
                "Very practical stuff in my opinion, my biggest complaint would be that there is no clarity on the grade cutoffs, I really have no idea what grade I'm going to end with",
                "Strengths of the course were that it was engaging, relevant information was provided and their were class speakers that provided different insights from different parts of the field. Sometimes I felt that on the problem sets the wording was a little bit ambiguous which can throw off your calculations and answers and I often had to email TAs for clarification on the wording so that I understood exactly what the questions were asking. This could also be a reflection of my lack of exposure to this type of work previously in my undergraduate career.",

            "comments": [
                "I would not recommend this course unless you have poor personal finance skills or looking for a relatively low-workload course to fill your schedule. The course does push you to think more about your personal finances (great), but most of the information is obvious or may not be relevant (e.g. not having credit card debt or the formulas to calculate thresholds for mortgage refinancing). Other than a few practical pieces of advice, the course offers very minimal intellectual engagement and is poorly structured. Attending lectures and reading the slides packet are basically interchangeable. Professor Choi is a decent lecturer, but he has poorly written problem sets. The problem sets confuse students not due to the difficulty of the content, but rather the wording and inconsistencies in terminology. Many of the TF OH questions were just clarification questions on the writing. The course is also incredibly rigid and runs through exam week for undergraduates. This is stated upfront, and I would recommend students not underestimate the inconvenience that this causes when considering the course.\r\n\r\nAll else aside, the worst part of the course was the quizzes. I assume that the purpose of having beginning-of-the-class period quizzes is to encourage lecture attendance and see if students have an understanding of the materials. The quizzes accomplish both--however, poorly. Yes, twice the amount of students shows up in quiz lectures than in non-quiz lectures. However, some students leave right after the quiz, and lecture participation is no better even with more people. Students who attend regularly, but a missed quizzes due to unforeseen conflicts fare worse than students who show up for the first 10 minutes. Moreover, reading the lecture notes briefly vs. paying attention in class results in the same level of preparedness for quizzes since the questions are either common sense or specific to one bullet point on a slide that you happen to flip to. Life happens, so know that there are better classes out there where students are not graded on having perfect attendance. Class quizzes are stated directly on the syllabus, so it's perfectly fair. However, I would caution students to carefully consider whether taking a mediocre course is worth dealing with glorified attendance quizzes.",
                "Yes, I have already recommended some friends to take this course. I find the material to be very beneficial and helpful to planning my life's financial plan.",
                "This course will assure that you make wise decisions with your money! It's a no-brainer for everyone, even those outside the ECON major.",
                "I would definitely recommend the class for students who are interested in Personal finance skills; the class exceeds expectations in terms of content and relevance to my day-to-day life. The class also helps build on and apply economic concepts (like tax shields, discounting, and PV) on very tangible issues like mortgages, renting a home, credit card debt, and other aspects of daily life. Overall would recommend for anyone interested to develop their personal finance management skills.",
                "I would recommend this as an econ elective for other students, especially seniors. The psets tended to be quite hard (had to go to office hours or really look over class slides), but the SOM students said the same. The daily quizzes were a little annoying, but definitely do-able as they were open note and short. Professor Choi is super well connected, and if you want to gain insight on being a professor or being able to meet the guest lecturers, this is a great class to take. Overall, I learned a lot about the practical aspects of personal finance and implemented parts of it in my own life.",
                "Yes, this course is incredibly practical. You will learn things that are directly (and at times immediately) applicable to your life. This course has helped remove a lot of the mystery surrounding how I should handle my personal finances. The pop quizzes can be somewhat difficult at times, but the class is overall great.",
                "yeah, i think it's good stuff to know just as a financially independent adult",
                "I would recommend this to any student looking to learn more about personal finance, attain more literacy, learn from different perspectives and develop excel skills.",
                "Yes, everyone is better off gaining information on how to manage their income and other expenses.",
                "Def, very pertinent class. You'll save some money by learning tricks you didn't know, but the key is to increase revenue first.",
                "Yes, it gives very helpful information that would be difficult to learn all on your own. You get a structured environment to learn some essential personal finance information with a very knowledgeable professor",
