It has made me spend a lot of time thing about the future of the medical field and contemplating the benefits and detriments to including or excluding race as a social or biological category.",
                "A chronology of historical events in America concerning the intersection of structural violence, medicine, capitalism, and social structures, such as race",
                "A lot about the history of health and how the conversations around race and how they are entwined with disease.",
                "It helped me improve my writing skills and I had a great time engaging with race and medicine, and how marginalized communities have been treated in the past.",
                "history of race and disease in American medicine, discussed through the lens of specific diseases, economic systems, histories, and perspectives. ability to analyze primary sources as well as a lot of secondary source material.",

                "I would suggest adding more indigenous history to the course. We did one module on indigenous, medicine and colonialism, and I think it couldve been more emphasized.",
                "The course was very well structured. Short student presentations followed by class discussion with a short break in between was a good format. The assignments were very well planned, the first (shorter) paper was a great exercise in analysis and understanding how to approach the topic. The primary source analysis and paper proposal assignments were great for preparing us for the larger paper. I do wish there was a required meeting for the 15 page paper.",
                "My only regret is that I didn't take this course any sooner. I think Professor Abedin is a very insightful and honest perspective on practicing medicine. Additionally, the content is really something I think every student interested in healthcare\/medicine\/pharmaceuticals should be aware of. In my experience, this course is one of the best taught at Yale and really deserves more resources in being able to accommodate more people.",
                "I think that at times it could be a bit centered on black race and disease instead of other groups but at the same time I think it is a central discussion that needs to be had for those groups.",
                "I think if we included more discussion about various marginalized communities and compare how and why the narratives are different would be very cool. Strength was that the Professor was always engaging and very knowledgeable.",
                "Strengths: the amount of material in this course is one of its strengths. With each week being on a new topic and\/or disease, each discussion is new and lively. This made for a class which was engaging and interesting. Professor Abedin has a lot of experience and it was very interesting to hear her perspective both as a Professor and Doctor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class discussed potential ways to shift the course material around, and so I would say that is probably the only thing one could do. This class is great.",
                "It was very very read heavy and a 3 hour once a week class so that was just a logistics thing that was difficult for me"

                "Yes, this course is really interesting, although it may be a little challenging for those with no understanding of the intersection of race and disease. The readings were very informative and I learned about topics I had never heard about before - a lot of my prior understanding of race and disease was from the US pre-civil war period so it was interesting to learn about post-bellum medicine.",
                "I would really recommend that any student interested in healthcare should take this course. It is very insightful into the history of biomedicine and its longstanding ties to colonialism and capitalism. I believe this knowledge is necessary for students, in that it enables a greater sense of critical thinking about social determinants of health and medicine, beyond the cultural competency that is taught in schools.",
                "Yes, I think it was a good course.",
                "Yes! 100%! If you can get in, I think everyone who wants to work in the health field should have some discussions about the intricate relationships between race, illness, and the frameworks of American Medicine.",
                "Absolutely; this class opened my eyes to the troubled history of race and disease in America. The course has a very unique lens -- each week's reading was on a different disease, and the class conversations were always very interesting and engaging. The reading workload is on the high side but reasonable, and there's always time to complete them. The readings always felt relevant to discussion and valuable.",
