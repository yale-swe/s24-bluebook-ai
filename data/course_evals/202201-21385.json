I have become a much better writer and have been able to significantly improve my writing skills. Specifically, I have become clearer, and better at elucidating arguments. My structure has improved, and I have incorporated stronger idea-driven topic sentences, and productive clarification. Most importantly, I have learned the value of shorter sentences in my prose.",

                "Strengths are the readings are mostly engaging other than the very academic ones, which are hard to read\r\nAnother strength is the drafts, which are beneficial to making corrections and improvements. \r\nWeaknesses are that the last essay being the length it is takes away from the close reading and forces us to dilute the quality of the work.",
                "I liked the class's small size, and the readings were expertly selected. The professor truly knew how to facilitate the seminar environment. I have no criticisms of the actual course. However, the one minor thing I would say is that the syllabus\/course introduction mentioned texts and films that were not a part of the actual class, which may be misleading at first glance.",
                "This course was really great. There were a lot of readings, but that is to be expected from a literature course.",
