            "comments": [
                "All the topics covered are interesting and Prof. Paul is an engaging lecturer! No immediate weaknesses come to mind",
                "There could be an opportunity to write essays for real grades rather than being so dependent on in class examinations. Lectures could be more related to the material we read. Readings could be more understandable for people who have not taken logic, or the class could state that some logic would be helpful.",
                "Occasionally, it felt that the lectures diverged to far from the reading material, or that the material we had to read contained too much information for us to be able to cover it all in lecture and section.",
                "Strengths: Professor L.A. Paul is an extremely clear and precise lecturer. I came away from every class feeling that I understood the week's readings and could reconstruct them in clear language. I also appreciated Professor Paul's accessible style and openness to meeting with students outside of class. Udit was another strength--he was a knowledgeable, reliable Teaching Fellow and excelled at situating our course of study in a broader philosophical context, as well as at entertaining objections to whomever we were reading.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Evaluation consisted in two midterm exams (20% each) and a final exam (50%), plus participation in section (10%). In addition to these exams, students were asked to write two short (~1500 word) essays, which were graded on a pass/fail basis. I was surprised to find that the examinations were a successful and fair means of assessment. The midterm examinations forced me to rigorously review the course material, and I felt that the examination questions were written so as to allow me to demonstrate the full extent of my knowledge. I hope that more philosophy courses employ exams in the future. That being said, I found that the grading scheme was unnecessarily skewed. A fairer distribution, one that more accurately reflected student contributions over the course of the term, would have been: midterm exams (25% each), final exam (40%), and participation in section and lecture (10%). Making the final exam worth 50% of the course grade was unnecessarily harsh. \r\n\r\nI think that the course could be positively reformed if students had the option to either write two pass/fail essays (which would keep the grade distribution as suggested above) or write two drafts of one slightly longer paper, the first draft of which would be pass/fail; the second draft of which would consist in 20% of the course grade. If students elected this option, then the grade distribution would be: midterm exams (20% each), final exam (30%), participation (10%), and final paper (20%). In my experience, the process of revising a philosophical paper based on instructor feedback is extremely valuable, and I would have appreciated the opportunity to deepen my thinking and research on one of the course's themes in this way.",
                "LA Paul is excellent, very engaging, and very passionate. She knows the answer to any question you might have. The only problem is that often classes will become sidetracked on tangents because of her extensive knowledge. Generally well structured but sometimes classes less so.",
                "This is a great class if you like to just talk about philosophy!",
                "Strengths - excellent class and section discussion \r\nWeaknesses - balance between topics and between psych and philosophy was sometimes off",
                "Strengths: Professor Laurie Paul is fantastic, and the topics explored in this class are fascinating. / Weaknesses: The only forms of written assessment that actually counted towards our grades were timed essays, which is unfortunate for those of us who give a lot of thought and care to longer papers, who spend a lot of time crafting and revising arguments for them, and who don't do as well under pressure. I understand that ChatGPT poses a problem for identifying the author of a particular text, but I seriously doubt ChatGPT could produce a philosophy paper worth its salt. Students should not be penalized wholesale for the mere possibility that someone will plagiarize, whatever the method of plagiarism is, and especially when most Yale students' papers would be recognizably better than anything the source of plagiarism is able to produce.",
                "Strengths: Laurie is an amazing lecturer, and she makes the class fun to be a part of. The pass/fail essays felt fair and were not stressful, and the readings were (for the most part) engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only weakness is that the exam structure was a little stressful and felt hard to prepare for before seeing the test. After taking each exam, though, they all felt fair and reasonable (though it did not mitigate the stress of having to do a timed essay or two for 20% of our grade, or 50% for the final)."

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. My recommendation comes with the caveat, however, that in my experience the course material was most appropriate for students without a strong background in philosophy. Devoting significant lecture time to issues of cognitive science and psychology was advantageous insofar as it exposed philosophy students to new disciplines. In my experience, however, the course ultimately sacrificed depth for breadth. My understanding of the cognitive science we covered is superficial at best. As such, I would have appreciated devoting more of that course time to deepening my understanding of the philosophical issues at stake.",
                "I would recommend this class to everyone, regardless of if they are a philosophy major or not. This class was super interesting and is easily the best class I have taken at Yale. The reading list is varied and engaging. Professor Paul also does a great job of teaching metaphysics in a way that is access to students of different backgrounds.",
                "Absolutely. If you have any interest in metaphysics or some really fundamental aspects of philosophy- take the class!",
                "Definitely a fascinating introduction to contemporary topics in metaphysics. If a philosophy major, definitely take it. If youre into cognitive science but interested in the topics on the syllabus, take it. People looking for first encounters with philosophy could take it, but some of the topics are really abstract and writing philosophy essays is a beast of its ownbut Prof. Paul is a fantastic explainer. Take it for an intellectual challenge, really engage with the material, and your work will pay off!",
                "Absolutely! The topics we explored in this class are so fundamental that I would honestly say my undergraduate education wouldn't feel complete if I hadn't given at least some systematic thought to them, even though I'm not a philosophy major.",
                "Yes, for anybody interested in metaphysics and philosophy as a whole. Even though metaphysics is a particularly difficult branch of philosophy, as someone with no experience in philosophy whatsoever this class felt accessible and well-explained. Laurie was an amazing lecturer as well, and it felt amazing to better understand the concepts taught in this class."
