I learned how to apply perturbation techniques to solve for the eigenstates of quantum systems approximately in both time-independent and time-dependent situations. I also learned how to deal with scattering in three dimensions and how to use Dirac's relativistic wave equation.",

                "A really strong foundation of undergraduate quantum mechanics. Shankar really does a great job of rigorously teaching the fundamentals.",
                "A good understanding of quantum mechanics.",
                "I learned about the topics of approximations, the Dirac equation, scattering, spin, and angular momentum, among other topics. This course helped me develop strategies for approaching quantum mechanics problems, and I even became much more comfortable with topics from the previous semester of quantum mechanics (PHYS 440).",
                "The second half of \"Principles of Quantum Mechanics\" by R. Shankar including angular momentum, the hydrogen atom, spin, variational and WKB approximations, time dependent and independent perturbation theory, the photoelectric effect, scattering *shudders* and introductory Dirac Theory. The last of these was so inspired that it almost makes me want to take RFT. I think I learned about more different concepts in this course than any other at Yale, and they were fascinating (except scattering)!"

            "comments": [
                "The biggest strength of the course is the extensive resources available for understanding the material. There are lectures, lectures notes, problem sets, and lecture videos. The material is challenging so often you need multiple passes to really internalize it. The biggest weakness of the course is the lack of feedback. Almost none of the problem sets were graded by the beginning of reading week, which makes it hard to know how much to prioritize studying for the final.",
                "Strengths: 440 gave really good fundamentals for this class, derivations and motivation generally made sense. It was cool to see \"real\" physics like the photoelectric effect, fine structure, and the Dirac equation arise. Professor Shankar is a legendary lecturer and storyteller, and does a great job highlighting the history! Weaknesses: The scattering unit was generally a bit unclear, I think the treatment of spherical harmonics and neumann functions\/general solutions to spherically symmetric problems could have been more complete to aid with the scattering part. Selection rules eventually made sense, but when they first come up they could be treated a bit more carefully so it's faster later. Also, the grading was very slow, faster feedback would have been more helpful to improve from Pset to Pset",
                "R. Shankar is a premier expert of the field. The learning goals were exceptionally helpful and it helped that the same professor who is teaching the course also wrote the book.",
                "Great course - Shankar made all the zoom lectures from last year available online and there was a lot of supplementary material on Canvasto help us understand the lectures. One weakness was that we didnt really get psets back regularly, which made it hard to gauge how we were doing.",
                "The course is well structured and follows Shankar's book closely. The workload varies throughout the semester, but is generally manageable. The exams are designed to test your understanding and don't try to trick you. Grading and feedback takes a while, but TAs are very helpful.",
                "Problem sets were too long at the beginning, this was flagged to the professor (Shankar) and he was good about making subsequent ones shorter",
                "Strengths: Professor Shankar. He really cares about our learning and will make sure we understand concepts as long as we are willing to ask for help. Also, lectures and notes\/summaries (with very helpful practice problems) were posted online so we could review them outside of class. Weakness: Sometimes the psets were so long that we got lost in the sauce, but upon raising this issue with the professor, we were able to come to a compromise to help our learning.",
                "Strengths: Professor Shankar. He knows the material inside and out (because he literally wrote the textbook) and gave very clear explanations on everything except scattering (which is fair because, well, scattering). The amount of resources that he offered (live lectures, recorded lectures, learning goals, textbook) really helped me to grasp the material when used in tandem. He put more work into this class than ever before and it really shows. It also helps that the material is all beautiful except scattering. Overall a great course. Weaknesses: The TAs' grading. We did not get back over half of our problem sets until the day before the exam, and Ridge did not return any helpful comments on his. Also, this is not so much a weakness as a necessary evil, but scattering is miserable."

I feel like I have a really strong foundation in and a growing intuition for the subject. Plus its a chance to learn quantum mechanics from an absolutely brilliant physicist.",

                "Yes if you're interested",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. You get to see the cool ways quantum mechanics has played a part in major scientific discoveries and see the logic behind the universe for yourself.",

Despite its reputation, it is not a particularly hard course (except scattering) and one gets to see a lot of amazing topics in quantum. It is a step up from QM I, which exists essentially for the sole purpose of building up the math to do this course."
