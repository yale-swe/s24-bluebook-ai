In addition, the material covered issues that American cities face, like public education inequalities and struggles, segregation and inequality in housing, crime and drug use, and more.

                "The content of the course was interesting and the professor was good. The homework, however, felt excessive at times with 2-3 hours of TV coupled with 2 or so hours of reading. One did not necessarily need to do all the reading, but I would prefer a course where that choice (whether or not to do the reading) didn't have to be made.",
                "This course was very unstructured. There was never a lot of course direction and the show was not very relevant to the actual class. We didn't discuss the material in depth and I thought the lecture was very surface level.",
                "Strengths - very engaging (you are watching an incredible show for homework!), great lectures, guest lectures, TFs, very manageable workload, both online and in-person options which were very helpful this year\r\nWeaknesses/Improvements - Somewhat surface level on many topics instead of getting deep into any specific topics",
                "I thought the course was very accomodating and flexible to students' need. I also found the course material very engaging.",
                "I thought the course was taught with good content, but in a monotonous way. I wish it was a little more interactive or had a mechanism to keep students engaged.",
                "The lectures were very engaging and watching The Wire was super fun.",
                "I thought this course was amazing, but I wish we spent more time directly analyzing themes of the show instead of stepping back to talk about things like political science research methodology.",
                "The Wire is a great TV show and is a lot of fun to watch. The readings were well chosen and supplemented the show well. However, lectures seemed to largely be a regurgitation of the readings instead of introducing new things, which is likely why so few people actually attended class in person. If I were trying to improve this class for next year I would focus on making lectures a place where new/different concepts and points of view are introduced.",
                "I did not think that this course was well taught. I found lecture to be unengaging and to be honest a waste of my time as I felt I was not learning anything or getting anything out of it.",
                "The course is really interesting in that Prof. Harris provides unique readings to match up to the episodes we are watching in class. Everything is linked very deliberately and it is super easy to follow course content from start to finish. The workload is very manageable in this sense and lectures are interesting.",
                "Strengths: Good discussion leaders, good readings and a good structure for learning overall. Also, a really creative way to learn a new topic that keeps things interesting and combines a lot of different disciplines. Weaknesses: The main challenge with this class is that every single week there was some adjustment, or change, that made it hard to feel the benefits of a consistent learning environment. I don't believe most would be replicated in a non-COVID world, because a lot were changed to accommodate changing attendance/risks, but it did feel very adhoc and it was frustrating to not know what was happening most of the time. Nevertheless it was still an enjoyable and insightful class.",
                "Lectures tended to be repetitive, sometimes we would be taught the same concepts over and over. Other times, I wished we would have gone over more history or data.",
                "strengths: creative content\r\nweakness: not sure if class was necessarily adding to watching the show without it",
                "Strengths: \r\n- The Wire is a fantastic show and it's also super cool to watch a show in an academic setting\r\n- the readings were amazing! (do them, seriously - they're by far the best part of the class)\r\n- very easy course: super straightforward midterm/final essays, very little work each week, lenient grading\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- lecture was pretty boring and predictable, usually just summarized the homework assignments\r\n- honestly, this class should be a seminar and you really notice that as the semester goes on",
                "Strengths: great section discussion, really enjoyed watching the course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: disorganized",
                "The show is phenomenal but it definitely moves at a fast pace in order to keep up with the amount of episodes in the show. I think more episodes on weekends and less episodes during the week is easier to keep up with though.",
                "I really liked how this class worked off of the show to ask questions about real issues in the American city. However, I do wish it aligned more with the show. I felt like lectures referred to the show and often used the show to provide examples for the lecture material, but I would have loved for the lectures to closely follow the episodes and the real life topics that they touched on as we watched certain episodes for homework. In other words, I would have loved for the class to have been more of a discussion of the episodes we watched for class rather than a broad overview of the American city that roughly used the show to provide examples for the material.",
                "I did feel, at times, that it was hard to keep up with the pace of the show and the pace of the issues we were covering. The guest lectures and TA lectures were awesome additions.",

                "More course material!",
                "Make it clear that there is a lot black trauma poor in the show although it makes lots of sense.",
                "great at analyzing the show and applying it to outside sources. theres too much work to do though, and its hardly possible to keep up with outside commitments, but you decide how much work you put into the course because of the grading  (80% of the grade is the midterm and final.)",
                "Relevant social issues. Good discourse. It needs to involve the show a bit more. readings could explore ideas in more depth.",
                "Strength: the show. Weakness: the class.",
                "The course was very disorganized. The show was amazing and there was so much interesting content to discuss which I felt like we never really dove into.",
                "While the course overall was good, many of the topics discussed in lecture seem rather intuitive, and many of the lectures seem to have only one or two minor takeaways. This being said, each lecture was themed clearly and did connect back to the episodes for that class.",
                "The Wire is an excellent show and provides an excellent framework for discussions of life in an American city. It's an incredibly nuanced show that gradually builds over time with each season focusing on a new sector/area of city life (crime, drug organizations, labor unions, local politics, and the media/press as the main setting and area of focus in the show for each season). This allowed for the introduction of several topics over the course of the semester, lending itself to discussions of the ways these communities and sectors overlap and affect one another. However, despite all the promise of the Wire as a framework for discussing a modern American city, I think the class fell short. I think several topics were discussed ad nauseam without the introduction of more nuance with each discussing. For example, lecture content discussed redlining and its effects over the course of the semester, a discussion which began on the first full week of classes. But by Week 12, I didn't feel like my understanding of redlining had deepened or changed significantly from that first discussion. It just felt like a waste of time even though I know there's more nuance to introduce and discuss. This goes for many topics presented in lectures. The readings were interesting, academically rigorous and offered a variety of viewpoints but lectures mostly summarized this content without adding much more interesting or useful context. This made it so it felt unnecessary to do both the homework and also attend lecture--you'd be fine with just doing one or the other. Lastly, we were often dismissed 10-15 minutes late from a 50 minute class. Now, I'm a college student so I always appreciate an early release class--more nap time for me. But it was consistently early release in addition to several classes being asynchronous for a variety of reasons (some of which I completely understand given Professor Harris' work and family commitments). This made it feel like my attention, prep time for class, and my attendance were unnecessary. That there wasn't even enough content to cover a 50 min lecture twice a week (which there definitely is because housing, policing, crime, local politics, the media, education are all extremely rich topics with centuries of history to unpack).",
                "The coursework was strong, but the lectures were weak.  I think more connection between the show and the readings, more real-world moments in lecture would really improve the engagement.",
                "I think the lectures could be in a smaller lecture hall and cover new material. The lectures were often very repetitive and did not elaborate much on the readings."

                "YES! The Wire is an incredible show and this is a great excuse to finally watch it! You also get a lot of great discussions on issues facing our cities today, and how the show addresses them in the early 2000s, and how we should tackle them today.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone else who also wants to engage with social science research about low income communities of color.",
                "I would if you like the Wire Show or would like to learn about the issues the class covers.",
                "This was a really good intro course. It was not a ton of work (I guess watching the show can be fairly time consuming, but its really worth watching), but I do feel like I learned new ideas and concepts. It would be a lot of review for people who have taken similar courses, but if youre interested in the topic/subject, I would definitely recommend!",
                "Yes, definitely. It's a really interesting class, the workload is manageable, the assignments are straightforwardly explained and graded, and you get to watch TV for homework!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if a) they are interested in the material, more specifically if they are interested in actually watching and engaging with The Wire. The way the class was structured this year, it would definitely be a low-workload class, maybe a gut, except for the fact that there are so many hours of The Wire to watch, which takes up a lot of time. However, the amount of reading is comparable to any other political science class (probably a little less because of the time needed to watch the show) and the assignment workload is very low  no papers, just three activities that took one hour each, a midterm, and a final. Definitely one of the less challenging political science classes out there, but worthwhile if you're actually interested in learning what the class has to offer. I guess it could just be an easy workload credit, but I would not recommend as strongly to someone with less interest in the material.",
                "No I would not. I did not enjoy the course.",
                "Yes! The class is a really good one in my opinion, because the workload is super manageable but the course material is also really interesting. If you're interested in political science or urban studies or anything in between, you'll get so much out of watching The Wire. And that's really the bulk of this class; doing readings and taking notes in lecture is honestly supplementary to actually watching the show and understanding the themes that come up. Prof. Harris is also really accommodating and just has some in-class exercises + midterm + final.",
                "Yes! Just keep in mind it is a weird balance between being not that intellectually challenging, but still quite challenging time-wise to fit in all of the episodes. I would highly highly recommend finding a viewing partner in or out of the class, because I think it would have been really fun to have someone to watch all of these episodes with. Also, just keep in mind this course won't really make you an expert in anything or change your worldview, but it will be a fun course to add on. Definitely a great Social Science distributional or just another PoliSci credit.",
                "Absolutely. TAKE THIS if you need the distributional and/or a sixth class.",
                "Yes! This course is a great gut, super easy but also interesting and engaging (especially if you actually do the readings, which you should if you are at all interested in American cities or even social science/economics/research methods in general).",
                "Yes! An easy political science gut.",
                "The Wire is hands down one of the best shows I've ever seen and I would not be able to thoroughly appreciate it had I not watched it through this class and learned out to pick out everything the show teaches.",
                "Absolutely! I learned a lot from this class, and the topics covered in this class are important for Americans to understand. It's a great opportunity to watch a great TV show and to learn about the real issues this show is meant to highlight.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, its a poli sci class which also informs on historically grounded issues. The readings and episodes bring everything together.",

                "Overall, I would recommend this class to another student, especially if you are looking for a class with a relatively low workload. This being said, there are a lot of episodes you are expected to watch each week and this combined with the reading makes for a decent workload.",
                "It's a gut, in my opinion. If you're looking for an easy 5th credit or an easy Social Sciences credit (that's what I believe this counts as but I'm too lazy to look it up to make sure), this is a good class. Also, the Wire is an excellent show, it's not excellent for a tv show, it's excellent as art. Seriously, it's that good. And I know I probably would not have watched it if not for this class and having to literally watch for homework. But if you've already watched the Wire or want a more academically rigorous and challenging course then I do not recommend this course. (If you've already seen the Wire then this course will be even easier for you which may be a plus but also may be boring)",
                "Yes!  If the student wants a fun social science credit that will not take up too much time, and will teach them the basics of social science.  The show is fantastic, and I really enjoyed watching it this semester.",
                "Yes, this was very interesting and it was fun to watch the show!",
                "Yes! This course was a great way to learn more about political science in a very inviting manner, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the field that may fear its novelty. The use of television to demonstrate principles and concepts was excellent."
