            "comments": [
                "While it was really interesting to learn about different laboratory techniques, I was under the impression that this course's primary purpose was to teach us how to write our research proposals for our senior thesis and this course did not do this. We had one Background and Significance assignment that we did not receive feedback on and we rarely talked about the end of semester proposal assignment. While we worked on our presenting skills much more after spring break, which was quite helpful, and we received more in-class feedback, I often felt lost in the course and I think more timely feedback would have alleviated this.",
                "I really loved the days in which we sat down and troubleshot our presentational skills and nerves. It was good to deconstruct what went well and what went poorly in our presentations, and I felt this helped me a lot when I had to plan my later two presentations. It was also interesting to learn about some of the technologies being used in molecular biology (the single-cell multi-omics was the most interesting to me), and I also liked when we had guest speakers come to introduce us to their research or new skills. One weakness was that there were not enough opportunities to discuss our research with each other as a class. The class was structured as either a 2-hour lecture or day of high-stakes presentations. It would have been nice to have something in between so that we could feel more comfortable answering questions and thinking about our research on the spot. It was also confusing what we had to turn in for grades, and what were meant to just be exercises for new skills.",
                "The course is extremely disorganized. Also, some of the workshops seem boring and unnecessary.",
                "Strengths: You will definitely become a better speaker and presenter. You get to meet a lot of students also in research. Dr. Moreno and Dr. Nelson are highly passionate about teaching and truly care about making you the best scientist you can be. Excellent for fulfilling lab course requirements for medical schools. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Assignments are graded very slowly and very rigorously. Additionally, the time commitment is very high; you complete class assignments, keep a comprehensive lab notebook, and do 8-10 hours of actual research every week. That translates to 4+ days of the week where you are investing a solid chunk of time into this class.",
                "I think the strongest portion of the course was the public speaking components, as well as Dr. Morenos lectures regarding them. I wish we had more time to do more with this, as I found the focus on scientific communication the most useful. \r\n\r\nSome of the lectures, particularly the ones on techniques and technologies, did feel very long and I had a hard time concentrating and actually internalizing the information.",
                "I think the class was good overall, I thought we didnt focus as much on the writing aspect of the proposal though",
                "It was interesting and allowed for me to work in lab. There was not much feedback on assignments, so it was really hard to know what you were even being graded on or how to improve."

                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in research in the biological sciences.",
                "Yes, but not if you have significant research experience. I found it helpful as a newcomer to research, but it was somewhat discouraging when my classmates who have clearly been doing research for years presented their work, which was very obviously a culmination of years of work, and often made me feel like I wasnt doing a good enough job. I know this isnt true, but this class was marketed for juniors with little to no experience and I dont understand why some of my classmates were in this class at all.",
