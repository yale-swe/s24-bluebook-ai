                "This class created a great environment for learning how to approach an air pollution problem and how to collaborate and plan research to come to a conclusion.",
                "The course gives an overview of key issues in air quality and the science behind those key issues. While students definitely learn important equations and applied math, the course focuses a lot on structured ideation and problem-solving, which is such a valuable skill.",
                "What an excellent crash course on all things air pollution! There's so much to cover that you don't realize and this class does an incredible job. The class does a great job of teaching you how to think like an air pollution scientist, it gives you the necessary tools to solve problems from the start.",
                "I learned about the categories of air pollutants; simple mass-balance models for pollutant concentrations; how pollution gets transported, vertically and horizontally; the formation and dynamics of particulate matter at different sizes; the causes of climate change; the atmospheric chemistry of ozone and NOx formation; emissions sources and management, especially related to combustion; and ways to systematically evaluate air pollution problems.",
                "I learned so much in this course. Understanding various components of air pollution and the entire process of locating, mitigation, and determining effects of various pollutants. This class is one of the few ENVE courses I have taken where I feel like I have a much stronger grasp on a topic I had very minimal knowledge of going in.",
                "This course covered the basics of air pollution such as the types, sources, and mitigation strategies. It also went more in depth where time allowed. It provided a great review of some basic chemistry concepts.",
                "After taking this course, I feel better equipped as an engineer, and this is because I feel this course gave me problem solving skills specific to air quality control issues, which makes me feel a lot more confident in going into this area of work. I learned about how air quality is approached by scientists and engineers and the mathematical and chemical knowledge required to solve some issues in the area."

                "I loved the way it was taught and how interactive it was.",
                "Strengths: The class is so engaging. Prof Gentner does a great job of breaking up lectures with small group discussions and activities, which is awesome. Also, throughout the class, he encourages students to engage in structured ideation and problem-solving, which is a useful skill for whatever future people are pursuing. The exams and assignments were all very fair and the instructors were flexible with deadlines and helpful with tough questions. I also loved the mini research projects as a way to apply course content to real air quality issues of interest to each student. \r\nWeaknesses: None. I loved this class.",
                "I don't think this class had any weaknesses. You know exactly what you're getting into, and it does a great job of teaching you that. Professor Gentner's teaching style is refreshing and really helps you learn how to think critically. You really gain the necessary tools to go out and tackle real-world problems.",
                "Strengths: Prof Gentner is great. He knows his stuff and is great at explaining concepts. He's also tried to make the class more interactive, which is nice. The class has a case study/qualitative approach to air quality problems, which is a fresh perspective. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The first third of the class drags, especially if you've had experience with dimensional analysis and basic control volume models.",
                "There were many strengths in this class. One of the best was having the many interactive group activities in class that involved problem solving before going over as a class. This kept class much more engaging rather than just having lectures. HW was also good and it was nice that it wasn't every week. I felt I was still learning the main concepts without stressing so much just to get it done.",
                "The course is structured to facilitate learning in a low-stress environment. The lectures are interesting and often interactive. Professor Gentner is really passionate about the subject and wants students to be as well, so he allows students to take the final project in any direction they want. Office hours are extremely helpful and the homework prepares you well for the exams.",
                "The strength of this course was how it engaged us students in all the class discussions and all the opportunities to talk and ask questions about the material in class as well as practice solving problems. It introduced the material in a way that seemed very accessible to someone with now much previous knowledge or experience. I don't really see any weaknesses, except having more office hours available to work with the T.A. in person instead of over email."

                "Yes! Great professor and very fun class.",
                "Absolutely. This is the best environmental engineering class I have taken. Students learn equations and applied math, knowledge about the processes behind key air quality phenomena, how to structure thinking about novel air quality issues, and how to apply concepts to research questions. The class does such a good job at teaching skills. It is also just a fun class.",
                "If you are interested in environmental engineering or policy, this course is great for learning how pollutants are emitted and move through the environment.",
                "Yes. If you're in the major, it's a solid core class. Air quality is a really cool topic that doesn't get enough attention in the intro class, and Prof Gentner does a great job making it interesting.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for an engineering elective, it's also great. There are very manageable psets every other week, and cheat sheets are allowed on exams. Especially if you're coming from chemE, it's a breeze.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in air pollution in general, it's pretty good, too! There's algebra and some basic chemistry, but in general there's a big focus on analyzing air quality problems over calculations.",
                "Absolutely. Great class to understand air quality, and I felt I learned a lot of useful information that can be applied elsewhere. If you are interested in taking this class as a elective or you're required, it's great either way. Workload isn't too bad at all and you come out with a great deal of useful skills.",
                "Absolutely. This is a great class for someone with even a small interest in air pollution control. The math and chemistry needed is minimal so it's a good class for almost anyone.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in environmental issues as well as people who would like to learn how to address environmental issues. It offers introduction to air quality issues, but it also allows for the student to formulate approaches to the issues, and apply these approaches at the end through the final project."
