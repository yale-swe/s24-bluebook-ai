In addition, Juliana spent significant time on the varying cultures between different Spanish speaking countries putting particular emphasis on those less commonly talked abut in the U.S. She encouraged students do do their on research on topics which encouraged Spanish literacy and then present on those topics which developed presentational speaking skills.",

The assignments are given out consistently and often throughout the semester, but they are generally not too difficult. Using only Spanish in class was also really useful as it helped develop my ability to speak more coherently. Professor Ramos-Ruano is also great and brings a lot of enthusiasm to the class, making the material more engaging."

Zoom is not exactly conducive to an interactive class, but the small class size \"forced\" participation, so that really wasn't a problem.",
