    "I learned about West African Dance styles and how to perform them. It's super different than any other class you'll ever take.",
    "The course helped me to improve on two skills I had been working on before:\r\n\r\n1. Listening to music for its rhythm\r\n2. Carrying a rhythm in my head as I dance \r\n\r\nThis has helped me immensely in becoming a better dancer. In addition, I learned a lot about various West African traditions and attitudes towards movement, music, and dance, which Lacina gave great explanations for.",
    "I was able to expand my view of dance and use it to incorporate into my lifestyle. I found Professor Coulibaly's teaching to be exhilarating and engaging and it allowed me to express myself in ways I did not imagine\/"

   "comments": [
    "You are really able to get into the material through the in-depth movement practice. Its nice that we also take the time to sit down and discuss readings and ask Lacina for more information.",
    "My favorite parts of the course were when we were given time to experiment with creating our own movements to certain rhythms. I think I would have enjoyed even more practice with improvisation in the course--that is, creating new rhythms on our own while dancing or creating movements to rhythms in the music without any planning.",
    "For me, I hope to see more breaks in the course."

   "comments": [
    "YES absolutely take this course if you can get into it. It is so incredible enjoyable.",
    "I took this class with very specific goals in mind as someone trying to learn more about rhythm and dance, and learned a LOT from not only the dance practice, but also from the readings and from conversations with Lacina. The final paper was one of the most enjoyable papers I've written as an undergraduate, as I really got the chance to articulate what I had learned. Practice on your own if you want to really improve!",
    "Yes, this course is an excellent class to take."
