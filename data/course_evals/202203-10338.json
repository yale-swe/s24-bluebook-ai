                "I learned a lot about current issues and the great power competition.",

                "This is very much an easy intro to Global Affairs at Yale; however, the real value lies in the speakers that Prof. Skye brings in to discuss their area of expertise with the class. Speakers are primarily drawn from the World Fellows Program and bring a wealth of knowledge and experience that they are more than happy to share with you. You will also likely encounter views you will not find openly expressed elsewhere on college campuses or in the Western world in general. For example, one of the speakers was a government official in a regime that has strong ties to the US but had its aid package recently reduced over human rights violations (think pyramids), and we (students, professors, and TAs) had a very spirited (but respectful) in-class discussion with the presenter over their strong support for their government.",

                "A basic understanding of major world issues.",
                "I learned about different areas around the world in very, very broad strokes and also in very specific topics. It was a blend.",
                "This course was exciting and helpful in gaining a foundation on global affairs. The set up of discussion sections motivated students to participate in intelligent academic discussions and hypotheticals about the world's future and the guest speakers of the class each brought new perspectives and insights that students were required to respond to.",
                "Basic Global affairs matters.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Sky is truly fantastic\r\nWeaknesses: For someone reasonably up to date with world affairs at times it can be a little basic and guest world fellows lectures whilst great to have are rather hit and miss",
                "Strengths: Topics of lectures were always contemporary and interesting. Discussion sections gave us the opportunity to engage with the course material in a smaller setting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough lectures from Prof. Sky, I loved when we were able to hear from her frequently (mainly at the beginning of the semester). Once the global fellows started to control the lectures more and more, I sensed that a lot of people's engagement with the course decreased substantially.",
                "I love it that the course invites World Fellows, this really gives a comprehensive look at different regions and occupations in the world. I hope the contents can be more inclusive towards different regions of the world such as Latin America and Africa.",
                "I thought it was extremely interesting and I learned a lot of material. I loved hearing from world fellows.",
                "The course was good at having interesting guest speakers, but there was often a disconnect between lecture material and discussion section material.",
                "Strengths: Interesting POVs from around the world with a range that will not be matched by most Global or PoliSci classes at Yale, Low work-load (Weekly discussion questions (submit 3 of them based on the articles you read for class) (Midterm consists of short essay (approx. 5 pgs) and short memo, Final consists of short essay (approx. 5 pgs) and group presentation)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion Sections were often carried by the TA - great if you're not looking to speak much, but not that great if you want more",
                "Strengths - Interesting topics, engaging assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Little incentive to go to lectures. They are interesting and the speakers are great, but there is no final exam and the papers don't really relate to the topics presented in class.",
                "strengths: SUCH A COOL COURSE, guest speakers were amazing, learned about loads of global issues, rly good overview of many issues so u have conversational-level knowledge about loads of diverse topics, etc\r\nweaknesses: group presentations were not it  especially since theres no way for the ta to know if one member is messing up the dynamic, more diverse prompts for the papers would be great, recorded lectures or slides would be great since they move thru the content pretty quick sometimes",
                "Strengths: the opportunity to hear from many accomplished lecturers from around the world\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: due to the fact that we would jump from region to region every week, it felt like we never really got to dive deep into a certain issue, and that we only learned a surface-level understanding of each concept. The fact that the lecturers were different every week also made the course feel quite disjointed, with some lectures being much better than others.",
                "Strength: the reading, midterm, and final assignments were very interesting and engaging. I liked being able to choose from several topics for the midterm and final papers. I also enjoyed the group project. Its also amazing to learn from and meet the world fellowsits an experience everyone should have at Yale. Weaknesses: some of the lectures were very, very specific to the interest of the world fellow talking which made it less cohesive throughout the lectures. I always felt like I was getting something different each class, making it super unpredictable.",
                "I thought the essays were a strength because the research aspect was interesting and allowed for in-depth independent learning on a topic of your interest. Improvement in the course may be simplified/less reading materials and reading materials before guest speakers that pertained more to the speaker and their topic specifically rather than a more general understanding that then was not discussed in class.",
                "Very impressive world fellows. It however is not enough to really learn about specific matters, but the course provides you with an opportunity to discover your interests in the wide global affairs scope.",
                "The setup of lecture was both a strength and weakness of the course. Good and well organized presentations were engaging whereas others that often didn't seem as well put together or had technological issues were often hard to follow.",
                "One issue with this course for me was that the assignments had little to do with the course material.",
                "The course was fascinating, and the survey style of the course allowed us to cover a broad amount of information, making it a great introduction to the field of global affairs. The course is taught by Professor Emma Sky, Jessica Faieta, the teaching assistants, and the current World Fellows. While this allows for many different topics relating to each lecturer's expertise to be taught, the distribution of topics and content sometimes felt unbalanced. We had an entire lecture on Belarus and then only one lecture on the entirety of the African continent. While I understand that this is largely due to the demographics and backgrounds of the world fellows in a given year and the Belarus lecture was very fascinating, it still felt rushed to try and discuss all of Africa within an hour and 15 minutes.",
                "I enjoyed how much creativity the midterm and final assignments allowed room for. I also thought the discussion sections, lectures, and readings were very interesting. Though, the lectures varied greatly based on the speaker (in terms of how engaging they were)."

                "If you're looking for a laid-back but interesting class that will give you a general picture of current/world events, this is the course for you. It is very much an introductory course so not that much is expected of you. The real hidden gem of this class is Prof. Skye and the World Fellows she brings in to speak. You will likely not find another class where speakers come in with such a vast array of expertise, with everyone from leaders in international/regional development to playwrights to mobile educational app development entrepreneurs represented (depends, of course, on the makeup of the World Fellow Program). I would highly recommend!",

But if you're an upperclassman, I would probably recommend taking a more upper-level course that focuses on a specific region/issue.",
                "Yes! Its a low-workload class that has interesting lectures and content. Its a great introduction to global affairs or political science, and its also great if youre a non-political science/global affairs major that just wants to learn more about the world. Very accessible and low-key. The grading is also super lenient and nice.",

                "Yes, I would. I think it's a good course to get a basic understanding of global affairs.",
                "Yes, for a student interested in majoring in global affairs, this is a great course to explore the different aspects of the major and can help a student decide if they want to continue studying global affairs.",
