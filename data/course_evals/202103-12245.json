                "I think that the tests should be in person, at least the oral and listening portions. I really did not enjoy the technological glitches with Lingco and having to deal with scheduling when to take the listening and oral portions. I guess oral is fine online, but I really think the listening portion should be in person. \r\nI think the strengths are the speaking practice during class. The weakness is the use of Quia homework and online Lingco tests. the Quiz homework was unclear how it was graded, and I didn't really know if what I was doing was counting. I also felt like the Quia was unnecessarily difficult and probably lowered my grade inaccurately.",

                "Strength: Daily engagement\r\nWeakness: Lots of memorization",
                "This course is full of strengths. The pacing is fast but manageable, the tests are very fair, and in general I would say the workload and stress level was decreased compared to the first year of Chinese at Yale. The textbook isn't the most aesthetically pleasing book in the world -- it's very bare -- and it's a bit outdated (for example, we had a chapter with some vocabulary about making long-distance phonecalls by calling the operator and requesting a particular extension, etc.), but it strikes a great balance between reviewing already acquired vocabulary and giving new vocabulary. A big strength to the textbook and the course is the range of useful expressions that we now know how to say; it's really rounding out our ability to say any sentence we can think of. The textbook in some ways is a weakness to the course because it doesn't have the sort of clarity on grammar that textbooks like Integrated Chinese do, and it also doesn't really explain the usage of important vocabulary items -- I feel like without my professor's guidance, I wouldn't have gotten a good sense of the meaning of certain words and how to use them grammatically.",

The class itself is relaxed and pretty easygoing, and there are a lot of completion assignments. However, the tests were pretty hard, and the homework was at times very challenging. So, while it is fun to learn Chinese, just be prepared that it is not easy.",
