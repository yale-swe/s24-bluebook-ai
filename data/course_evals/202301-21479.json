                "PHYS 382L taught me about a select few experimental systems, and more broadly, how to write an experimental physics paper.",
                "Collaboration in data processing and writing (it's the first course where u actually churn out reports with a labbie instead of separate ones)\r\nActual modern physics and intuition of how instruments work",
                "I gained more experience in carrying out scientific experiments from start to finish. I got to practice doing a literature review to learn more about a topic, designing an experiment plan and staying on schedule, more experience in data analysis, and learned about presenting data and analysis at a publishable level in physics through the construction of lab reports.",
                "This course developed my laboratory skills including keeping a lab book, using lab equipment, and developing an experimental procedure. In comparison with previous lab courses, there were no set guides for the labs in this course. Beyond the introductory material, it was up to the students to conduct research and create an experimental plan. Another important skill developed in this course was writing academic papers. I learned how to develop convincing figures and follow unwritten conventions for academic writing. I also learned important stylistic conventions such as eliminating section headers.",

            "comments": [
                "The labs are fun and the mini lectures are helpful. The biggest weakness is differences between instructors resulting in unclear expectations. Prof. Navon wanted reports in a very different format than Prof. Newburgh, so I didnt feel like feedback was consistent. The expectations and advice of the TAs were sometimes contrary to what the instructors wanted, which is frustrating.",
                "This would be a good course if it were taught by different people. It is the closest there is to research, but having it for a grade is unnecessary. No one in grad schools actually cares about students getting good grades in a lab course. At the end of the semester, I simply gave up because I felt completely subordinated to whatever whims the grader had.\r\nWeaknesses: there are many.\r\n1) Sid and Nir are rude and pretty insensitive. This made me want to avoid coming into the lab. Laura is okay, and the TFs do what they can to help.\r\n2) There are no clear grading guidelines, and the Writing credit is a scam both to students and to the Yale administration. This should NOT be a writing course and it doesn't follow the actual guidelines of a writing course (no actual writing feedback is provided).\r\n3) Feedback is inconsistent and variable across faculty members/TFs. It is also variable across the same grader (Nir), who pointed out more errors in the final reports than in the exact same one that we had for our report draft.\r\n4) We have no clue why exactly points were deducted from all of our reports.\r\n5) It seemed like the instructors were constantly trying to humble us, which made me feel disrespected. I am an undergrad, not a grad student. This course definitely steers me clear of academia and of my goal of going to physics graduate school. This should NEVER be the outcome of a physics course.\r\n\r\nThe Physics department would do well offering students an alternative to this course comprised of 2 semesters of independent experimental research if they are concerned with students learning what research is like. Taking a course like this is a complete waste of everyone's time and, in my case, it discourages me from continuing in physics.",
                "Overall I thought the class was extremely well done. It's very personalized and the profs/TAs give you everything you need to succeed. The only thing I would change is that the grading feels very artificial. I.e. everyone gets basically the same grade for each lab report. Also sometimes different instructors give opposite/contradictory feedback.",
                "Strengths: Since you only choose three labs for the entire duration of the course, there is enough time given to thoroughly explore each experimental setup. Weaknesses: It would have been nice to be given a little more clarity and feedback on the structure, style and presentation of our papers. There was less than ideal interaction and feedback from instructors/TAs.",
                "Honestly not much, maybe have equipment that works better/ more guidance for when experiments fail or when calibration doesn't work / isn't working.",
                "This class is great in giving students the space to practice key components of scientific analysis and presentation. More prepared material on some of the labs would be great, as some experiments had comprehensive lab guides while others had much less.",
                "This was an incredibly strong course. I got to work closely with several knowledgeable instructors and received careful feedback on my work. I learned relevant skills that will inform the way I approach physics research and academic writing most likely throughout the rest of my career. I worked closely with my lab partner and developed collaborative writing skills. The one way I think it could be improved is by eliminating the Ising model lab requirement. This computational lab was required for all student groups, but I felt that I learned more from the other labs, and given the option, I would have chosen a different lab.",
                "The long lab sessions are nice because then you don't have to do as much work outside of class. I like that we got the freedom to choose which experiments we did. I wish there was a little more consistency in the grading of the lab reports from professor to professor and a bit more transparency regarding the grades themselves. Also, several of the lab guides were very outdated leading to confusion amongst staff and students."

This course is a waste of your time and a motivation sink.",

I feel that the skills I learned in this course will be invaluable to me in the future. Furthermore, I learned concepts and vocabulary in experiments such as pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and laser cooling which help me understand topics of current interest in physics.",
                "Yes-- it's required for the intensive major. It's also a writing credit. If you're in the major or plan on going into academia in physics, I definitely recommend it."
