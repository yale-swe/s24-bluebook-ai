                "It was a great introductory course to Central Asian history that allowed a lot of deep engagement with primary sources across time.",
                "I got much better at critically analyzing primary sources and my writing skills were sharpened!",
                "I had virtually no knowledge about Central Asia and the countries that compose that region prior to this class, which was the reason I wanted to take it in the first place. I feel like coming out of this class, I've gained a foundational knowledge base to understand some of the historical developments in the region, especially during and immediately after the Soviet period. We spent a great deal of time discussing the reforms pre-Soviet, the Soviet rise to power, and the post-Soviet era in Central Asia. I also learned how to critically analyze primary AND secondary sources -- we don't normally spend a lot of time critiquing and critically thinking about secondary source bases, but in this class you do just that. I honed my critical and close reading skills, too, and learned how to talk about history and historical sources more generally. I could tell you about the jadid reformers in the pre-Soviet era, why Kazakhstan is still reeling from a population shift, why there is a border/migration crisis across the region, and trace the origins of the problems in Xinjiang, just to name a few things that we learned.",
                "I gained an understanding of Central Asian History from the 1800s until the present. Most of the readings for this course consisted of primary sources, so I was largely exposed to Central Asian poetry and art.",
                "I gained a basic working knowledge of the history of modern Central Asia, as well as the key themes/handles with which to understand this history. We learned about early forms of political legitimation in Central Asia, the development of nationalism and nationalist movements, Russian and Qing colonialism in the area. Around a third of the class focused on Central Asia under the Soviet Union, with the last 2-3 classes focusing on modern Central Asia and finally on Xinjiang and the Uyghur genocide. \r\n\r\nOutside of content, I learned about how to critically analyze sources and to carefully read scholarly work. These are skills that weren't entirely foreign to me, but I felt like I really benefited from really having to break down the provenance of a source (and its author), or carefully examine the way an article is put together and structured. I thought that Professor Roosien was very intentional and rigorous about exposing the students to the sources that were used to write the history articles that we were reading. This slightly more formal process of source analysis/critique gave me a much clearer framework for thinking about sources, and a far greater confidence with my own ability to select and think critically about the contributions/gaps that a source could have for a written argument.",
                "I learned about the history and politics of Central Asia from the mid 19th century to the present. I also gained insight into how to better analyze and construct academic arguments.",
                "I had a comprehensive introduction to Central Asia, and learned to work with primary and secondary sources effectively."

            "comments": [
                "The course was very engaging.  The seminar format combined with the use of a variety of source materials always made class interesting and productive.  I don't see any significant weaknesses of the course; it was a wonderful experience learning about a region that I'd never really studied before.",
                "Professor Roosien is very organized and I really liked her flexibility in terms of extensions and understanding regarding various circumstances. She also is a tough grader but I think it helped develop my skills in the end! Sometimes when going back over the slides to study it was kind of hard to use them because they have very limited info on them so its hard to use them to study if your notes didnt keep up with everything she said verbally  about the slide.",
                "Strengths: Professor Roosien has a seemingly never-ending knowledge of Central Asia and its history. The assignments are really well tailored to student learning. The smaller papers are really interesting, too, and she provides prompts so that you don't have to scramble to come up with your own ideas. The readings, for the most part, are very interesting, especially as we moved into the more 'modern' period. I think if you're looking for a sort of crash course in Central Asia, its history, its countries, its major developments, this course is really tailored to such an endeavor. She is also incredible amenable to feedback; at the midterm we asked for more guidance in reading the large quantities of sources and material, and she provided guiding questions for our reading comprehension and discussion posts. For the papers, we also got examples of how to write in a more sophisticated manner and used published journal articles as a basis for comparison, breaking down the argument and finding the evidence to substantiate it.\r\nWeaknesses: the reading quantity. In addition to an incredibly dense textbook by Adeeb Khalid, every class we had to read upwards of 40 additional pages of primary and secondary sources. So that's a 20-40 page textbook chapter in addition to a myriad of other sources. I want to be able to give my due diligence to each and every reading, as I feel like you shouldn't skip these readings (especially on a course that's teaching material from a rarely taught region) but with the sheer quantity, it gets difficult. We'd end up spending so much time talking about some of the sources, that we'd never discuss some of the others -- which I sometimes found more interesting! I am also a little suspect of the term 'modern' in regards to this class; some of the most recent developments in the past 30-40 years, even the past 10-20 are some of the most interesting and bizarre things going on in the world right now, and for a class marketed as \"modern Central Asia\" I wish we had spent so much more time on these periods, instead of things going on in the early 1800s.",
                "Strengths- Well-organized into comprehensive units of Central Asian history, lots of interesting primary sources to look at. We spent a day at Beinecke looking at a primary source from the 1930s USSR! Professor Roosien also allows you to re-write your essays and gives clear feedback on them, which is super helpful.\r\nWeaknesses- The leminar format of the class was sometimes confusing. Lectures felt somewhat disorganised, and we frequently didnt finish going over all of the readings assigned for that day. Discussion posts also often felt unnecessary.",
                "Overall, I thought that the class was well-designed and extraordinarily forgiving/supportive. Even though there were a lot of assignments, there were a lot of built in arrangements (e.g. automatic 24 hour extensions, allowing 4 missed discussion posts, resubmitting papers for a better grade) that helped to make it less stressful on the student. I am a little torn on the final because I definitely felt like having a final exam on top of a final research paper was too much, but I also gained the most insight into the class while preparing for the final, because that was when I really thought about all our lessons holistically (which I likely would not have with only the final paper, which allows you to focus only on a specific area) and figured out big-picture insights about everything we had discussed.",
                "Strengths: The syllabus was diverse and fascinating, and I really enjoyed reading all of the primary sources Prof. Roosien included. I appreciated how this class gives students a chance to engage firsthand with historical sources and emphasizes an interdisciplinary approach. The assignments Prof. Roosien gave were well-designed and helpful for developing historical methodology skills. Weaknesses: Sometimes class discussions on a given source were fairly brief, and I would have liked to talk about certain materials in more depth. One other minor point is that I felt our study of Xinjiang was at times very separate from our study of the rest of Central Asia. Of course, this is a consequence of the region's imperial division, but I would have liked to spend a bit more time examining cultural, political, etc. connections that reached across the Chinese border into Xinjiang.",
                "This course is very well-organized and well-planned. It is also wonderfully presented and taught. I think some of the grading practices could be somewhat unclear, though.",
                "The course was very well-organised! I did wish we read more secondary sources apart from Khalid though!"

                "I would recommend this course to anyone who's interested in the region or interested in taking a history seminar in general.  The course seemed very accessible to students with varying levels of knowledge about the region and Prof. Roosien offered a lot of support with the writing process for each of the papers.",
                "Yes! Very informative about modern central asia especially in relation to various conquests by regimes throughout history",
                "Yes. I think Central Asia is a largely under-discussed and under-studied region among American college students; while it may be receiving a lot of attention throughout academia, the students themselves aren't spending nearly as much time on the region as professors and scholars. I think, however, that this emphatic \"yes\" needs to be accompanied with a warning: there is a bucket-load of reading to complete for each class, in addition to a discussion post. You have two short papers, which aren't super difficult, but you also have a final paper due in the middle of reading period in addition to a final exam. While the final exam is open-note and open-book, I don't see the necessity in having a paper AND an exam. The exam was actually a breeze, just as Professor Roosien wrote in the syllabus, and the paper was also not super difficult, but it's a lot of work to have to do both in the middle of exam period as the semester is wrapping up. I'm also a student who has taken no prior history courses at Yale until this one, so I had no idea what to expect, and thus participating in class was sometimes rather difficult when surrounded by so many... much more familiar with the material smart history students. I will say, some of these readings are fantastic, especially the things coming out of the 70s, 80s, and 90s, and I especially enjoyed the last month of class in comparison to the rest of the course. We made use of the resources available at the Beinecke, too, which I thought was a really nice touch. Also have to add that you can take a no-questions asked extension on the short papers, which is incredibly kind -- I think almost everyone did so on the first paper. You can also rewrite your papers, which is fantastic.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in Central Asian history, Russian history, or Chinese history. Probably not as a random elective, though.",
                "Definitely take this class if you're interested in Central Asia and the region. I would not recommend taking the class if you're interested only/mainly in Russia, but if you're interested in the Soviet Union or in post-Soviet nation-building, this is a great intro course to the history of the states/the region. Note though that the course focuses mainly on events (and key ways of understanding these events) in the general, so it may be frustrating for those who are interested in in-depth engagement with specific topics (e.g. water)",
                "Yes! This class is a great introduction to a fascinating and under-studied region.  For students who have an interest/background in REEES, this class provides a nuanced look at Central Asia and offers a perspective on Eurasian/Soviet history that is often overlooked. For those who are less familiar with the region, the course is very accessible, and it is deeply interdisciplinary  course materials include literature, art, poetry, photographs, memoirs, etc. The course also teaches historical and analytical skills that can be applied to a wide range of topics and disciplines.",
                "Yes. If this is an area of the world that interests you  or just something you want to learn more about  I highly recommend the course! Professor Roosien is lovely and dedicated to her students.",
                "Absolutely! Prof Roosien was a great facilitator and she created such a wonderful learning environment. I also received great constructive feedback on my work throughout the course."
