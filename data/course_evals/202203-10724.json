                "I was hesitant to take this class at first because I tend to focus on domestic studies, but I'm so glad I did! I learned so much about transnational theory and how gender and sexuality (among other things) are interpreted across the world. This class taught me how to think critically about queerness, identity, and cultural difference as a whole in a way that I wouldn't have picked up otherwise but that I think is so important for anyone in social science or identity studies. Most importantly, this class taught me that the world is far more complex than I had ever imagined and that it is far more valuable to discuss that complexity with nuance than to try and simplify it into categories.",
                "I learned so much in this class. I truly recommend everyone take this course, from every major. I can't even put it all into words. I think it was just so valuable to learn about transnational insights of citizenship, race, gender, etc, especially through Professor Savci's perspective.",
                "I learned about a transnational approach to feminism, thought, and identity formation. Overall, I gained a lot of knowledge from this course.",
                "So much stuff. As the title suggests, this class teaches you what transnational analysis even isfeminist analysis interested in breaking down normative, binary ways of thinking about identities, nations, people, and the world by taking into account crossborder migration, the global flow of people, ideas, goods, labor, and capital, and the nuanced historical, political, and economic forces underpinning such binariesand why it is so important for anyone to know.",
                "foundational knowledge on what transnational feminism is and how its lens can be applied to everything.",
                "This class opened my eyes to the different ways gender and sexuality (and related concepts and ideas) are conceptualized around the world and how the very nature of these ideas existing in a 'globalized' world changes and shapes their meanings. This class taught me how to write in a different way, and gave me further experience and exposure to various queer theory and feminist theory scholars and academics.",
                "Critical thinking skills of topics through the lens of transnational feminism, specifically thinking transnationally about power structures in my own life.",
                "I learned a lot about transnational feminist movement building as well as the ways in which more mainstream feminism and gay rights work often reinforces neoliberalism and hegemonic power. I learned how to apply transnational analysis to other real world examples that we did not read about, and I also improved my critical thinking skills."

                "Strengths: The readings were enlightening, the class discussions were insightful, and Evren was always so kind and understanding whenever any of us reached out with a problem. I had a great time learning with her, and it's really evident that she's an expert in the field of transnational studies, especially in the context of gender and sexuality. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None. Evren did a great job!",
                "It was a large seminar so sometimes it would take the whole class to get through everyone's thoughts.",
                "The reading selections and essay prompts are amazing! I think there would have been a bit more productive conversations if the class was smaller (it was a larger seminar), but, nonetheless, the conversations were always great. It was an amazing class!",
                "Strengths: very well-selected and well-ordered readings, low yet engaging workload (only three 3-page papers and an 8-10 page final paper, all of which were so interesting and fun to write), amazing professor (Evren is a genius and is so welcoming and accommodating of students needs). I can honestly only think of one minor weakness, which was that the very first class meeting felt really chaotic and lecture-like as Evren had *every* person shopping for the classand there were so many that the room literally ran out of seatsintroduce themselves at the start, leaving little if any opportunity to actually participate afterward. I understand that this is somewhat difficult to avoid, though, and it only happened during the first class meeting.",
                "I really liked this course! Overall, the workload was super reasonable and all of the readings were exciting, even the ones I wasn't as excited about. Evren is an amazing professor, and I love her approach to the world and to teaching. Every week had a really interesting conversation, and Evren was super flexible and kind about deadlines and expectations.",
                "Strengths: passionate professor, interesting readings, GREAT essay topics (I love how they are related to our own lives)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think this course could benefit from more small group discussion, just because we were a large group for a seminar.",
                "Evren was amazinggggg as a professor and incredibly smart. I think the best parts of our discussion were when she would go off on tangents, or drop facts about herself or other subjects that were so insightful but clearly effortless to her. Evren was also great and understanding when it came to pushing back assignment dates and giving personal feedback on our essays, which was always appreciated and helpful. She really cares much about each individual student, not just in a superficial way.",
                "I think this course could benefit from being a slightly smaller class since sometimes the class discussion felt inorganic if we were spending so much time trying to go around the whole table. I really enjoyed the small group discussions that we did and I think that is a great way to promote participation and learning. I think another improvement could also be more contemporary readings since many were from the 90s/00s and I am pretty sure there are more recent examples of similar things. Overall the readings load and work load is manageable and helpful for grasping the material."

                "Yes! This course was honestly so transformative for me. It's so so important to be critical of widely-accepted models of justice and this class tackles just that. The readings were comprehensive and enjoyable (and of course, transnational). This class does a good job at grounding abstract theories in actual movements for justice. I appreciate how many of our readings and conversations became applicable to our lived experiences.",
                "Absolutely! Evren is a delight, and I'd take any class she teaches. Her syllabus is clearly created with immense knowledge that she truly wants to impart upon you, and the environment in this class was always welcoming and fun but intellectually stimulating. If you have any interest in WGSS, take this class, even if you're not interested in global affairs/international relations. I wasn't either, and after taking this class I believe that anyone studying identity should have a baseline knowledge in transnational studies. The workload is manageable, and the class is loads of fun...take it if you're interested in it!",
                "Absolutely!!!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student so long that they can manage the reading workload. All of the readings are great!",
                "YES. Everyone should engage with transnational analysis. This course taught me so much, the readings were well-selected and so insightful, and the papers were light (only three 3-page papers and an 8-10 page final paper) and very fun to write. Also, take any class Evren teaches. Seriously, this woman is amazing, and you shouldnt miss the chance to take a class with her. I also felt extremely welcomed and supported in the classroom, even as a nonmajor.",
                "Yes, Evren is absolutely amazing, and transnational feminism offers a different perspective than many American-based classes.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! It is accessible to people of all majors, and I found it to be a really nice complement to my other courses. The assignments and readings were interesting and not too intense, allowing me to appreciate all of the content and really sit with the new ideas and challenges to my thinking.",
                "Yes! I'm a prospective WGSS major, and this course was awesome for understanding one strand of what WGSS is all about.",
                "Yes! I would pick this to fulfill a WGSS major requirement, but if you don't need it for that, I think that this course was quite easy and wasn't exactly intellectually challenging, even though I had a positive experience taking it.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this class to someone interested in thinking more critically and radically about gender and sexuality."
