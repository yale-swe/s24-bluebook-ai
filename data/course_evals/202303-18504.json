                "This class provided background knowledge about the origins of liberal and conservative ideologies, as well as their development pathways. A great deal of this course focuses on the tensions revolving around the French Revolution, a conflict which I knew little about prior to taking this course. As for more tangible concerns, the class improved my debating, writing, and organizational skills.",
                "From this course, I gathered a critical repertoire of early conservative and liberal concepts, and discovered how the tensions between liberals and conservatives both shrunk and grew in surprising ways. As a US citizen, I found the information refreshing and the professor's presentation fair to both sides of the debate. I exercised my debate skills, critical thinking and capacity for political understanding. I feel more sympathetic to liberals and conservatives because of this class. I found the pivotal section on \"the revolution controversy\" especially stimulating.",
                "Knowledge of philosophy, and skills in critical thinking, writing, and argumentation",
                "Honestly, hands down one of the best EP&E classes I've taken at Yale. I developed a really nuanced and holistic view of how conservatism and liberalism developed historically in Western Europe, and became really entrenched in philosophical debates about concepts such as the state of nature, the secularized state, and much more."

            "comments": [
                "I mean the strength is that it does cover this ideological framework. The weakness is definitely the discussion management. Other than one day of debate, we essentially just spent class saying quotes from the readings. There was not a lot of meaningful back and forth.",
                "I think that this course is very well structured. An honest reading load, challenging papers, good class discussion... Top notch all round!\r\nI do think that class conversation could be better managed. The mechanical process of taking down a list of a dozen names before turning to each person in turn did not facilitate na exciting or insightful discussion.",
                "Manageable reading load, interesting class discussions, lively group of students. In this particular iteration, the class size was too big, so in order to accommodate everyone's contributions, there was limited time to discuss a specific point of contention. Even with the efforts to streamline discussion, we spent half of pretty much every next class finishing up the discussion from last time, so the last two weeks felt more like catch-up. The course could be improved by capping the class at 15, and capping the material at the French Revolution. Since the class is about the origins of the two schools, tracing the modern applications isn't necessary, and there isn't adequate time to do so. Maybe the conclusion class could tie in the present, but taking off the two modern classes would leave enough time to adequately discuss the earlier interesting material.",
                "A strength of this course was that class discussions remained engaging and civil. Another strength is the fact that the course spans all the way back to proto-liberal and proto-conservative thinkers in the seventeenth century and culminates with a dive into prominent thinkers associated with modern American conservatism and liberalism. A way this course could be improved is by allowing students to have more time to adjust to instructional changes associated with the exam and essays; however, the need to adjust to under new guidelines helped develop my ability to adapt.",
                "Collins is very knowledgeable and good at making sure students hit the important points. Sometimes the readings were a bit long but we would always cover 90% of them so they are worthwhile. The quizzes were also intimidating at first but as long as you control F the readings you're fine. And for the papers, talk to him in office hours!",
                "Strengths: interesting content, great professor\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Something that I actually really appreciated about this course (which might not be for you if you're looking for an easy class) is that Professor Collins set up the class in that there was no way to get out of the readings. This let to really fruitful and interesting debates each class that everyone was able to get involved with because we were on the same page, despite certain readings being a little difficult to understand at times. Before every class, we had to complete a Canvas quiz on the material, each class he picked a random person to give a presentation on the readings (which was part of our grade), and participation was 10% of our total grade. As someone who often skims readings when I can, it was surprisingly enjoyable knowing that I had to commit fully to the readings, because I ended up learning much more than I possibly could have otherwise."

                "Sure. I mean youre almost certainly taking it because you have to take a classics course, and its not bad. But it was just kind of boring.",
                "Yes! Intellectually stimulating and leads to nuanced appreciation for political thought.",
                "Absolutely, one of the best versions of the Classics class now that the original class by Prof Kapustin is no longer being offered. A lot of individuals in the class gained a stronger understanding of what each school of thought holds at its core and where each school originated from, so the class was a welcome respite from the usual political echo chamber.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning about the original sources of intellectual divisions which led to conservatism and liberalism as they exist today. This course will also be beneficial to students who wish to connect ideological concepts to specific textual arguments. The reason I say this is because the reading quizzes and possibility of presenting on the readings essentially compel one to complete all the readings prior to each class. As a result, students will become familiar with the specific texts linked to the ideological concepts of liberalism and conservatism.",
                "Yes, this course is a critical take for anyone who wishes to evaluate their political convictions from a bird's eye view. It will challenge your pre-conceptions and biases and cause you to rethink the origins and development of conservative and liberal thought to the present day.",
                "It's a lot at times but Collins is fair and a good prof. You'll hit the important points.",
                "I definitely would! It's a tough class, but very much worth it. The class is designed in such a way that you have to do the readings thoroughly in order to do well. But the readings are pretty manageablethe professor takes pains to only assign what is needed. And the fact that everyone has done the readings makes the quality of class discussion very high. The grading is somewhat harder than in most comparable classes, but I wouldn't let that dissuade you from taking it.",
                "Yes with Professor Collins! I briefly took this class in the past with a different professor and ended up dropping it, but I loved taking this class with Professor Collins."
