It also strengthened my mathematical analysis skills by covering topics \/ biological systems that integrated a quantitative approach in modeling. The final project allowed us to experience how mechanics can be modeled by introducing us to software and walking us through a comprehensive analysis that delved into topics covered during the semester.",

            "comments": [
                "The strength of this course was having a final project instead of a final exam. Fewer exams, especially over the virtual format, made the course more about learning and applying the concepts instead of only trying to score well on an exam. The professor was very engaging and made the overall experience very positive.",
                "I think the course is strong. One large weakness was the availability of office hours however I understand that this particular semester there was a very low TA allowance so they did the best they could. I personally think this is a course that would really Benidorm from a weekly discussion section.",
                "Strengths of this course include the homework problems sets, which were organized in such a way as to emphasize significant models and well complemented the material covered in class. In addition, the highly interactive aspect of lectures (particularly with lectures being online due to the pandemic), encouraged all students to remain engaged and immersed in the new material. The real-world applications and medical scenarios covered in the class were also very helpful in improving students' comprehension of the material and its importance. After lecture, the professor would spend a few minutes reviewing over the material covered that day in a holistic way, which was IMMENSELY helpful in improving the student's understanding of the material. The lectures focused on review were also very beneficial in a similar way. \r\n\r\nOne weakness was the scheduling of office hours for the professor and teaching fellow, which were both on the same day of the week, within less than two hours of each other. Due to this proximity in office hours, students who couldn't make it to one office hour, likely couldn't make it to the other either.",
                "Strengths: new course format with a final project rather than a final exam\r\nWeaknesses: compared to previous years, there was no MatLab involved at all (I thought we were going to engage more with the software); class could be structured a little better with more in-class problems (I felt like some of the psets were a lot of manipulation of equations that we didn't go in depth in class)",
                "I loved Prof. Murrell's energy throughout the course, and it felt like all the material was well-taught. However, some of the quiz questions were based on lectures we hadn't yet gone over, and the homework tended to be a little more quantitatively-based, despite us not always going over the math portion of biomechanics. In addition, I wish we had been able to use ImageJ more, since we used it only for I think one problem set and the final project.",
                "Strengths: Professor Murrell was very engaging and passionate during virtual lecture. He always does a review of the previous lecture at the start of every class, which is super super helpful. Additionally (hot take), I was a fan of the quizzes before class. They were decently easy and were helpful ways to keep up with the material while also getting extra points. This year, we had a final project, which was really enjoyable and a great way to research and learn the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Office hours were all on the same day - the day after the PSET was posted. It would have been helpful to have office hours at different times. Also, the last couple of PSETs are extremely math heavy and unnecessarily long.",
                "My favorite class days were when we learned about applications of biomechanics because it put it more into context for us biomedical engineering majors. The daily quizzes were a bit of a pain, but I understand their purpose. Engagement in class was high, but no one put on their video camera. Maybe because the class was taught at 9am, and we all looked sleepy.",
                "The only real weakness I found in this course it that the daily quiz scores were not released until long after the next quiz so it was hard to see how well\/poorly I was doing.  I think I could have done better overall if I knew how many mistakes I was making and would have been more motivated to make sure I understand everything from last class before the next class.  The strength of this course is Professor Murrell-- he's a really great prof and I felt supported throughout the course.",
                "I thought overall the course was structured very well. Some of the homework assignments were a little tedious though and were hard to get through.",
                "The problem sets vary largely in difficulty. Some of the PSETs are extremely hard and take a long time to complete while others tend to be easier. I hope that problem sets for students in the future could be made easier.\r\n\r\nA strength of this class were the ties to application. I thought Professor Murrell did a great job of emphasizing how biomechanics can be applied to technologies we see today. I also enjoyed the last lecture, where some of our students presented the research they were doing.\r\n\r\nA weakness of this course is that there are really few office hours available. It would be helpful to place office hours available closer to the due date for PSETs instead of on the same day that the PSET is released. Additionally, it would be helpful if quiz scores could be released sooner so that we can study and learn from past mistakes before taking the next quiz.",
                "Strengths: engaging professor and great TA support\r\nWeaknesses: none really! I feel like the semester went well!",

                "I think the live lectures and homework worked fine with COVID. Professor Murrell encourages questions in class which is great. However, often times questions dont come up until after the class and when doing homework thus there is need for a better time to ask questions that just TA office hours",
                "Although the online nature of this course made interaction between the professor and students more difficult, the professor asked many interactive questions throughout the lecture and allowing students to respond through the chat was very successful in keeping students engaged and participating in the class. These questions served to test our understand and allow students the opportunity to ask their own questions that may arise. Integrating the chat function so extensively was quite effective, more so than each student vocally speaking out  (which may have caused issues with timing also). \r\n\r\nHaving the professor teach by using the whiteboard\/drawing option on zoom was also very effective (as opposed to using pre-made powerpoint slides). This method allowed students to follow along and take their own notes rather than passively looking at powerpoint slides.",

                "The recording feature for Zoom lectures was generally good for watching the lecture later except the very last lecture failed to capture the professor's iPad screen. I recorded him for 1.25 hours, so I could not re-watch class for understanding. The professor replaced exams in the class with one final project to encourage us to work together during isolated times, which I appreciated a lot.",
                "I love having recorded lectures to watch later-- that way I don't feel bad taking up class time asking to explain something again when it seems everyone else got it.  In general I'm a huge fan of the recorded lectures for studying purposes and to help with the homework, because I always am too slow to take good enough notes in class because I'm too busy trying to make sure I really understand (true for all of my classes, not just this one).  I found it really difficult to engage with the online course.  I'm not really sure what a good solution for this would be-- probably having all of our cameras on would help but as someone who had to take courses from an RV over the summer, I understand that some people would rather not share their living conditions on camera.  I'm not sure what the middle-ground is then.",
                "I thought it was great that we didn't have formal exams, but that the content was still tested very well through the homeworks, daily quizzes, and the project. The only thing was that it would have been nice to have additional office hours.",
                "Professor Murrell's kept the class engaged by asking frequent questions during live lectures. Furthermore, I thought that the daily quizzes helped keep me on track with the material. However, I do wish that the class was more forgiving of different time zones. Given that I was studying remotely in PST, mandatory live lecture started at 6am.",
                "I think the virtual learning went well.",
                "Lectures, even in person ones, should always be recorded. In-class participation polls can be done for participation and attendance purposes, or recorded lectures should only be made available to those in person on the lecture day, but even when we return to in-person learning, lectures should be recorded as it gives equal opportunity to all students, especially those who may not write as fast or take longer to understand the concepts. Being able to rewatch and pause lectures 100% helped my understanding of a lot of the material in this class.",
                "The recorded lectures worked great as well as the whiteboard that was used. I think this class ran very smoothly over zoom.",
