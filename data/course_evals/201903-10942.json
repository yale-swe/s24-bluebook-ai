   "comments": [
    "I've learned important critical reading and analysis skills that I will take with me to future English (and writing) courses. I've learned the fundamental building blocks necessary to construct a tragedy and the ways we connect\/categorize literature through shared undercurrents.",
    "My writing skills really improved in terms of articulating my ideas and structuring essays well, and I was able to apply these writing skills to other classes.",
    "I learned a great deal about not only literature but also European traditions, themes, and how they've both traveled through time.",
    "I learned how to contextualize Tragedy and understand it in a more sophisticated sense. I was able to broaden my historical and cultural understanding of the material, and partake in engaging discussions with my peers. This course illuminated the similarities and differences of a single medium across millennia, which allowed me to compare and contrast texts I never would have thought to view together.",
    "I learned a lot in this course. I become a more nuanced writer and a more logical thinker. I have a deeper grasp not only of the tragic genre but I've learned a lot about history and authors and philosophy. I am more educated human and better because of it."

   "question_id": "YC403-YCWR",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: As a small seminar, each student was really forced to actively engage with literature and share their interpretations with the class, making everyone feel important, which I think not only enriched discussion, but made the class feel like a high-level book club, which I really loved.\r\nWeakness: As one play is read per class, the course doesn't always allow for discussion to achieve the depth which our writing does in analyzing the texts (but that is expected in a course of this nature).",
    "I feel that some of the texts could've been skipped or changed in class, but learning the contexts of all of the time periods and authors was incredibly interesting and enlightening. It's also arguable whether the texts toward the end of the class count as tragedy or if they just draw heavily on tragic themes (the class goes from classical tragedy to medieval tragedy to philosophical \"tragedy\").",
    "This course covers a lot of material over a short period of time, which is both a primary strength and weakness. The pace of the class allowed for many works and many perspectives, but because of the short time frame, we were unable to go into as much detail as I would have liked.",
    "This course was awesome. I really liked how we started with the classics and moved our way up to some modern renderings of tragedy. It's interesting to see how conventions are changed and subverted. I also just learned so much more than what was written in the books. Maybe the course could use some more other mediums like films, but regardless it was very comprehensive."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Not only did the class expose me to so many major texts in the Western canon, but it allowed me to really dissect a genre; and as an aspiring writer, taking a course where we tracked the recurring components of a powerful genre I think will really benefit my creative writing.",
    "Yes I think it was really valuable as an intro writing course where you can get one on one feedback to improve writing skills",
    "If you don't mind reading the Illiad in four classes, take this course. It starts with a heavy reading load and doesn't quite let up, sweetheart.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. They would have to be ready to do a lot of reading and put in the effort, but it is completely worth it. It is incredibly interesting and, despite the difficult texts, facilitates substantive and exciting conversation. I also generally feel much more informed about the Tragic canon and how it reflects and changes the world.",
    "Absolutely. I think the things we read in this course are very pertinent to our lives today and wrestle with some of the greatest questions about fate, religion, and morality. There are certainly things in this course that make you think and having a background in the tragic genre and its surrounding context and conventions is something you can bring to anything you read in the future."
