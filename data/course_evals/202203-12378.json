                "I thought sometimes there was a lack of connection between my physics 170 and lab material, maybe some clarification or more content on what we are learning",
                "Too much work, not enough time; too many students to 1 TA",
                "The labs often were a bit long.",
                "manageable course, well explained",
                "Strengths: Good lab environment with good experiments. Mehdi is also a gem\r\nWeakness: Lab handout background/derivations can be condensed to make them more digestible. Basically, no practice material or information was given about the skill tests. No need for 95% of this class to be error propogation.",
                "The course has interesting labs that take a reasonable amount of time to complete. A weakness of the course is the handouts. Sometimes they didn;t provide enough context. I was taking Phys 170 concurrently and some of the mechanical topics we never covered so I had to rely on my partner, TA, or handout to learn about it ahead of time.",
                "I liked that it was an appropriate amount of work for half of a credit.",
                "STRENGTHS: Labs were chill, pretty easy to do well on the lab notebooks/reports. \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: Sometimes the labs were extremely tedious, like they were almost designed to waste people's time. In some of the labs, half of the time was literally just solving for uncertainties. Also, a few of the labs had nothing to do with the lecture course, making it difficult to understand the concepts. \r\n\r\nThey didn't tell us anything about the \"skills tests\" until like November. Super vague about the whole thing and how they were going to work until literally like 2 weeks before they started. It made it really difficult to prepare for these tests. Also, some of the questions on the tests were ones that we never did in lab or were shown how to solve which I thought was a bit unfair.",
                "The exams at the end of the course were really difficult and did not replace the course work we did in labs.",
                "I think that although the concepts applied in this course are relevant, there were a few experiments that did not completely align with the material learned in lecture, so it was the first and only time hearing about it.",
                "Strengths: very well organized, straightforward instructions. Weaknesses: you're giving a lot of independence (which is a strength too), but I wish there was more of a recap at the beginning of lab to get us all on the same page.",
                "Strengths: the lab handouts are always very detailed and explain in painstaking instruction how you are supposed to run the experiment, which means the experiments almost always run smoothly without any confusion on what we are supposed to do. The lab reports and notebooks are also very easy to write up, so the class overall was relatively light in workload, as fitting for a 0.5 credit class.\r\nWeaknesses: the one exception to the rule in the above strengths that I listed was the Radiation lab. The lab handout was formatted differently from every other handout that we had used, and the wording of certain steps could've been phrased better to prevent confusion while reading the directions. Overall though, the course was good.",
                "This class is great! Organized well, very understanding, not too much work but we still get something out of it.",
                "The success of the course is highly determined by the lab TA and lab partner, and more continuity across sections would be greatly helpful",
                "Strength of the class is that the material is quite relevant to the PHYS 180 lecture, I sometimes felt like I could understand the lecture content better by doing the labs. Weakness of the class is that the labs are pretty boring (rolling stuff down an incline, doing tedious Logger Pro adjustments) and if you get stuck with an incompetent partner you will be doing the lab for longer than everyone else.",
                "fine course, requirement for my major",
                "The strengths of the course were the length of the lab sessions, which were usually less than the full three hour time slot for the class, and which helped ensure that students would complete the lab on time and without rushing. The pre-lab readings and lab handouts were carefully created in order to help students maximize learning from the lab sessions, while the lab reports and lab notebooks were integral to solidifying the material learned during and after the lab sessions. \r\nOne of the weaknesses of the course is that the experimental skills tests were all at the end of the semester. I think it would have been helpful to my learning if they tested skills at the midpoint of the course (such as at midterm), and splitting the four experimental skills tests into two tests at midterm and two at the end of the course would have alleviated some of the stress associated with taking all four near the end of the semester.",
                "Strengths: Very informative handouts\r\nWeaknesses: Lab would often run over the allotted time or I found myself rushing through without fully understanding",
                "I feel like a lot of the lab reports/notebooks were busy work. I don't think that I learn as much as I should have relative to the amount of writing that each notebook/report required.",
                "I think the strengths of the course are the consistency with which topics are taught and assignments are completely. I think the weaknesses are with preparation for the final test.",
                "The labs were generally interesting.",
                "The lab sections were all very well organized and experiments went smoothly. \r\n\r\nThe one page summary/reflection felt like busy work and did not contribute much to what I learned. I feel like a short reflection could be better, as all of the summary is the same as the lab report.",
                "Strengths: The labs are quick and expectations are clearly communicated. Part of the grade in the course also involves giving feedback to the instructors on the labs, so they are very willing to receive feedback from students regarding what works and doesn't from the lab. I also quite enjoyed learning from my TF, and she made lab enjoyable. Lab expectations were also clearly communicated, and lab sessions were focused more on teaching physics concepts (shout out to Dr. Ghiassi-Nejad for his clear explanations). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The labs are definitely hit-or-miss, but again, the professors learn about this from the feedback survey.",
                "Strengths: well-designed labs; very friendly & helpful instructors\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: tedious error propagation calculations; 1 page lab summary is often redundant",
                "It's generally a good class with good set up. Really well run as a lab course. The only weakness is the skills tests at the ending - wasn't much preparation for those and they take up a good percentage of the grade. If we had a few more resources to prepare us for such examinations the course would have been perfect. Overall the TAs and the support in the course were good, and you learned a lot of important material that would also help in general physics lecture",
                "The lab handouts were really clear and walked us through the experiments and their associated concepts in a very effective manner. It was also really great to be able to work in pairs and with different partners every class.",
                "I believe this course is structured very well and the lesson plans/reports really support my learning in the course. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
                "The course is a very reasonable amount of work, both in and out of lab. I feel the lab reports are a little rote and unnecssary, and coul maybe be made slightly more useful if they required a bit more thought and applicaiton of new concepts. Teaching staff was very supportive.",
                "The strength of this course were that it was well organized and mostly straightforward. However, it had a weakness in that there was very little opportunity for interaction with instructors and clarification.",
                "I really liked the class because it was engaging and my TA would be very quick to help us. Work load is fair for .5 credit class. Overall great lab.",
                "Strengths: I think the skills tests were mostly fair and the experiments were not bad at all. There were many times that we finished earlier than the three hour time slot.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think it would be more helpful to have the first one or two lab classes be more straightforward and have more explanation in the beginning of the class about the experiment. I remember the first day a lot of the students were confused since we were just told to look at the lab sheet, so having a formal introduction to the class by the TA would be nice.",
                "strengths: well structures and organized, helped me better understand certain concepts from lecture, the workload was manageable \r\n\r\nweaknesses: we didn't have clear directions on what to do during the labs, practical exam kinda came out of nowhere and we weren't given much information on how to prepare for them",
                "Strengths: interesting material\r\nWeaknesses: lab grading fluctuates highly among TFs -- my TF was quite harsh, especially during the beginning of the semester, while other TFs were much more lenient in their grading. Often, I spent more time making sure all my formatting was right and ensuring that I had answered every single question with as much detail as possible than actually learning physics when writing lab reports. The skills tests at the end felt a little unnecessary.",
                "Some of the labs were long but they were all interesting",
                "Strengths: Lab format was standard for each week, so it was easy to dive into the labs. The lab handouts were easy to follow, and I enjoyed conducting experiments. Compared to past chemistry labs, this course was much more focused on learning the subject matter as opposed to learning lab protocol, which I prefer.\r\n\r\nWeakness: None. My own gripe was that I felt unprepared for the experimental skills tests from the lab handouts. Otherwise, I liked the course.",
                "I enjoyed how this course was organized to follow closely with lecture content. I thoroughly enjoyed applying topics that would be learned in lecture before they are taught to more fully understand lecture content.",
                "I thought this course pretty much nailed everything it needed to. The labs were manageably difficult and genuinely helped me learn about physics",
                "The labs were interesting. I think at times the lab reports could have been a little confusing, but they were largely helpful and informative.",
                "I found the TAs to be a major advantage of the course. They offered very good guidance, and it helped me complete the labs with ease while also learning a lot.",
                "Strengths: clarity of exercises, both in terms of what is expected of students and why we learned what we learned; my TA and professor were helpful and provided thorough feedback.\r\nWeaknesses: lack of preparatory materials for final exam.",
                "the strength of this class was having a different partner every class, and making sure that we worked with everyone in the class at least once. also the fact that we had a week to complete the lab",
                "The course is fairly well-organized, but if you're taking Physics concurrently, the labs don't always line up with the material for the week. We were doing a torque/angular momentum lab several weeks before those concepts were introduced in class. If you didn't learn those previously, best to read up a little bit before the lab. The TFs, though, were quite helpful in guiding us through the labs, so there's no need to worry.",
                "This course was difficult at times because we would cover topics that we had not yet covered in physics lecture, yet we were treated as if we were supposed to already know what these topics entailed. This course should include a more in-depth explanation of the terms we will be using in each lab to ensure no one is left behind.",
                "I like that the labs don't require too much prep beforehand and the reports are simple.",
                "The class was very straightforward. You get instructions and you follow those instructions to get a better understanding of physical models and concepts. Lab instructions were very clear and the instructors were always available to answer questions or make things more clear. The final experimental examination resembled what you did during the class. It ensures that you knew what you were doing the semester and eliminated the stress of having some complex final.",
                "I like that they consistently ask us for feedback/improvement and that we really hone the same skills each time like uncertainty.",
                "Some of the lab handouts could be rewritten for clarity but otherwise it was easy to perform the labs.",
                "Strengths: Pretty straightforward lab in general, manageable lab reports. Weaknesses: Could seem pretty pointless at times and a significant amount of prior physics and math knowledge was assumed/wasn't taught super clearly.",
                "I thought that the pre-labs were great in terms of providing enough information...sometimes concepts were a bit unclear but our TFs were super helpful in clarifying. I know there were a couple labs that did not go as expected but the TFs were super efficient in modifying the labs to be better for students. I thought that the content was pretty in line with the physics course, building upon the knowledge we gained in class and the material was super accessible for those who did not have a lot of lab experience.",
                "The strengths of the course were the structure where we did not have quizzes and could focus our time on the lab reports. By not have weekly quizzes, we were able to focus our attention on the content of the lab manuals during the entire lab session, without unnecessary stress and fear. I felt that I was able to retain the content far better in this context, which was useful in my general physics course. Additionally, the TAs were a strength. Although I cannot speak for other TAs, my TA was extremely helpful and always made sure that we understood the process we were conducting. Another strength was the feedback surveys that we completed after our lab sessions. I felt that the surveys were a great way to offer improvement for future courses. The weakness was the skills tests, which did not seem to apply to what we did in lab this semester. I did not feel prepared for these skills tests even though I studied the lab reports and manuals tremendously. I feel like there was a massive disconnect from the procedures and calculations we did in lab to what was tested on in the skills tests, especially the first and second ones. The third and fourth skills tests seemed to apply more to what we worked on in lab. I do think it would be unfair for the final determinant of our grade to be these skills tests as it is an unfair playing field between those with way more experience with physics and those who are beginners in the field.",
                "STRENGTHS: I think this class is probably one of the best STEM classes at Yale - definitely one of the best lab courses. The teaching time is kind and encouraging, and clearly really wants you to learn and understand physics. It is a safe space to ask questions, explore, take risks, and make mistakes, and you feel supported and welcome the entire time. The course packets are super well-designed, and they guide you through figuring out the physics concepts. I also really appreciated that we had the chance to prove and disprove physics equations/models that are known. The lecture classes are so theoretical, and this class really gave you the chance to understand the practicality of physics research and its applications. WEAKNESSES: I'm not sure how much learning came from writing the one-page summary, although I appreciated how brief the lab reports were.",
                "This course did a great job of creating challenging but manageable labs. The labs were easy to understand and prepare for. This course could be improved by sending out a rubric for the reports to make grading more standardized possibly.",
                "The strengths of this course was that we could work with partners and collaborate. A weakness of this course was that some of the lab handouts were confusing. I think this made it harder for students to actually do experiments more independently (without help from a professor or TA) and understand the lab experiment and results when outside of the lab classroom.",
                "Strength: reasonable workload. Clear manual. Allowed to leave upon completion of day's work -- much appreciated. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Not enough info in the realm of a syllabus / grading info. Also, a little more information about how detailed the lab notes / report needed to be would've been appreciated.",
                "Strengths: I like how this course was done in partners, as it made the interactions in lab a little bit more interesting and entertaining, although it does depend on if you like your partner or not. I also think that this course had some pretty good TAs who were really good at understanding the sometimes vague questions in the lab handouts. The experiments were not too long, and were pretty simple to do a lab writeup for. This course did not require too much time per week, which was nice if you're taking a lot of high-workload courses.\r\nWeaknesses: I think that the only weaknesses with the course that I would describe is that the lab-practicals at the end of the year were a little difficult to study for, and that the grading at the end-of-term is a bit unclear.",
                "This lab was very clearly structured and was very simple to follow.  The lab instructions were straightforward and the instructors helped us organize our lab notebooks correctly.  One slight downside would be having to rotate lab partners constantly.  While it didn't bother me much, keeping a partner for the semester may have been helpful.",
                "One strength of this course is the number of assignments. In addition to weekly surveys, lab notebook submissions, and one-page summary essays, students complete four experimental skills tasks by the end of the course. The magnitude of assignments lessens the pressure for any single assignment, and the ability to use two 48-hour extensions without penalty further reduces any pressure.",
                "Strengths: \r\nThe physical activities during lab and the experiments being conducted.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSome of the lab reports felt like they had too much information regarding physical systems and some of it did not seem useful to the lab itself.",
                "Some labs took forever",
                "It was very interesting, but portions of the lab could be tedious.",
                "The strengths of the course are that you are able to take on multiple interesting labs that go well with the PHYS 180 course, and get to work with and meet new people as you explore these different concepts. The weakness I found was the guidance from TFs and others was limited at certain points and it didnt always feel like we had clear instructions on what to do.",
                "The general engagement that the course requires is manageable and helpful.",
                "Course needs better organizing and feedback",
                "Very specific instructions that were easy to follow",
                "Sometimes the labs were a little too long but overall it was well-paced",
                "Strengths: This course was at its strongest when the labs directly corresponded to the lecture topics from PHYS 180 that week.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the labs -- the coding in python lab, and the radioactivity lab, for example, felt very random and removed from the lecture course.",
                "the test at the end was very difficult and did not correspond well with the rest of the term.",
                "I really appreciated how we were able to take the skills tests early (before thanksgiving break). It gave me the opportunity to truly focus on and prepare for them. Then I was a lot less stressed during reading period because I had already done my skills tests. I hope that option is available in the future!",
                "I really appreciated the clarity and organization of the course. Every lab handout was easy to follow, which made doing the actual experiments a simple matter of following the methods. I also appreciated the workload of the class  this is the first lab course I've taken at Yale that has actually felt like half a credit. The lab reports were easy to write, given the helpful feedback from the TAs and sufficient note-taking during lab time. I don't really have suggestions for improvement  the course was great.",
                "The strengths of the class was that the lab manuals were very helpful and clear for doing experiments. A weakness in the class was that it would have beneficial if the TAs would briefly go over the lab in the beginning of class so it was clear what would be expected during the lab. Additionally, some of the lab were a little too long to be performed in the time of the section.",
                "Very informative packets and kind TAs. Preceptor Hanson was also very helpful and the system of the course was structured so that the students actually focused on learning and enjoying the materials during lab rather than being worried for grades (no in class quizzes or weekly assessments).",
                "The course was very well organized but at times was challenging to connect to the lecture material",
                "Strengths: Weekly lab report was fairly straightforward to complete. Well-prepared and efficient course materials that explained the lab goals. Without a high school physics background, the labs were not too conceptually difficult.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Preparation for the practical skills exams was poorly explained yet worth a significant amount, difficult under time constraints. Some labs were a bit long and required rushing.",
                "Very good feedback and fun class",
                "Strengths: The professors and TFs are extremely supportive during lab! They're always available to answer questions. Overall a very straightforward course\r\nWeaknesses: The content is a bit dry, but I'm not sure how this could be improved.",
                "Some of the instructions are confusing. Slows down experiment progress",
                "Strengths: Amazing TAs and amazing course coordinators. Every teaching figure I interacted with in this class was always so helpful and willing to answer all of my questions. Most of the labs were interesting and well designed and there was always the option to leave feedback after every lab. I thought the reports and the lab practicals at the end of the semester to be very fair \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the labs I did not think were that well designed or a different type of lab could've better explained the content at hand",
                "Strengths: very manageable workload, not too much and not too little. The practical exams were very reasonable. Also the fact that the course was over by Thanksgiving was amazing\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: we never got our scores back for the practical exams",
                "Very nice and helpful TA!",
                "Strengths were the teaching staff and how organized the class was. No significant weaknesses",
                "Strengths: this class tied pretty well to 180, and I felt like it was a good complement \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: at times, it felt like we were doing tedious tasks that were not very helpful. There was a huge emphasis put on uncertainty and there were several times where the preceptor and TAs were like this doesnt matter that much for a few things but we still had to do it.",
                "It wasnt too bad of a lab it kind of is required so your probably taking this for a requirement but the labs werent too bad",
                "I really enjoyed the hands-on labs. The lab handouts could be clearer but these could often be clarified easily by the TAs. I appreciated the feedback forms after each lab. I understand the reasoning behind assigned partners but it was sometimes really frustrating when your assigned partner would disappear for over half the lab period.",
                "I think this course was great for serving the general interests of students, but for people more interested in persuing higher-level physics and engineering, the class atmosphere wasn't great enough.",
                "Strength: well organized, good TA feedback\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Great methods and easy to follow instructions. Could improve with just a little refinement to lab manuals to rid confusion.",
                "The strength of this course is how organized the labs are. I appreciate that we know what is expected of us when submitting assignments. I also understand how we conduct our experiments in the lab with a descriptive lab manual. The lab manuals have lots of background information that I found to be useful during the lab and in writing the lab reports. Additionally, another strength of this lab was how collaborative the lab space felt. I was able to work with different students, and I developed teamwork-building skills because I had to adjust when working with different partners every week. A weakness of the lab is that sometimes there were small notes in the lab manuals that were difficult to understand and I needed clarification. A way of improving this would be to add more hints to the questions, especially for harder and more difficult worded questions.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Very short lab reports that took me ~15 minutes each week\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- A good 3/4 of the class is essentially busywork copying numbers with multiple decimals down into your lab notebook.\r\n- Lots points on the lab reports based solely on minutia. For example, your graph titles needed to be a certain size - otherwise they didn't count as titles.",
                "Strengths: We prove physics equations using actual demos, which solidifies information and helps us see real-life applications of physics.\r\nWeaknesses: The lab is not really \"taught,\" meaning you show up, and you do the lab. The teaching fellows answer questions, but that's it. We're not assigned lab partners either, so there can sometimes be a bit of awkwardness in getting a partner. Not all of the labs are clear."

                "Yes, i mean if you are interested in physics and or need it for premed or major.",
                "Ehh, if youre premed you probably have to take it.",
                "pretty easy lab course that is actually the workload of a half credit",
                "Yes but know its not the most engaging, educational, exciting class. If you need the credit, want an easy class, then yes",
                "I would recommend it to students who only need to take it or those interested in the physical sciences.",
                "If you need it for your major or you are pre-med, this is a relatively easy lab compared to other labs (such as gen chem). I wouldn't just take it randomly though.",
                "I would recommend this course to those interested in completing the pre-med requirements, it is necessary and a good course to be in.",
                "I would recommend this course if you want to supplement your physics lecture course with laboratory examples, but not necessarily as a standalone course.",
                "Definitely recommend! Great way to get your foot in the water for physics lab work.",
                "Yes! One of the best stem labs I have taken. Very chill",
                "Yes, it's a well run lab course that introduces you to what you need to know, but is supportive and has excellent structure",
                "The only people taking this class are premeds. Out of the 12 or so students in my class, I didn't meet a single one that didn't say that they weren't premed. Keep this in mind for your grades.",
                "yes, but only if you need it",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I think the course is well-designed to maximize learning while minimizing unnecessary work, and the assignments were designed in such a way to be helpful in improving students' understanding of the material and the necessary laboratory skills, without being overwhelming or contributing to an unnecessarily high workload.",
                "Yes, if required. Otherwise not really.",
                "yes especially if its a requirement",
                "I would only recommend this course if you have to take it for your major or premed.",
                "No, the lab concepts did not match very well with the lecture, so it felt like everything we learned was random. In addition, most of the reports felt like busy work, and the lab sections were predominately repeating trials.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The labs are a wonderful opportunity to supplement lessons from physics lecture, and they are also fairly easy to complete. Outside of the lab session, there is a pretty low commitment (only a one page write-up), and TFs are very clear about what they expect in the report. I also think that the instructors do a good job of explaining physical concepts during the lab, so the course feels more like an interactive lesson rather than a simple plug-and-chug lab.",
                "Yes; low-stress class that adds a helpful supplement to the lecture",
                "Definitely, it's probably the best general lab course at yale. A lot of students are taking it because of the premed requirement, but it's really not that bad compared to other labs that are required. You also learn a lot too.",
                "Yes! When taken with PHYS 180, it was really helpful in understanding concepts we were learning in class.",
                "Yes, if they are taking a physics lecture and desire to supplement their knowledge.",
                "If you need a lab course, or physics lab, this is a super great introduction. It is not much work at all.",
                "If you need it for major, obviously yes. If you enjoy physics, I think it's a great class.",
                "Yes, a painless lab class that is most likely required depending on your major.",
                "It was a good course but I wouldn't take it unless it's a requirement",
                "It's probably a requirement, but it's not a bad course to take anyway. I wasn't taking the lecture at the same time, but if I was I'm sure it would have complemented nicely.",
                "Yes, the experiments are interesting and rewarding and the workload is perfectly manageable.",
                "If you're interested in physics and observing physics phenomena, then yes. I didn't come into the course with a strong interest in physics. I took the course as a major/pre-med requirement. Still, I enjoyed the labs. The labs weren't too complicated, and it was interesting to apply physics principles. Overall, I would recommend this course.",
                "I would! I enjoyed this application of lecture content!",
                "I would recommend. This class allows for you to learn about some of the fundamental and interesting physics ideas without too much work.",
                "Yes. If you need to do a physics lab, this is definitely preferable to any of the other labs available.",
                "Yes, if you have to take a physics lab. Very chill and got a decent \"bang for my buck\" in terms of what work-put-in to lessons-learned.",
                "only if you have to.",
                "It's a very chill class. Most people finished the lab well within the three hours -- I never stayed overtime to finish. Grading is more lenient and workload is much lower than other intro science labs -- you only need to upload your lab notes and type up a one-page report every week. The experiments were rather dry and uninteresting, though, especially if you already know the content or have previous lab experience.",
                "Yes",
                "Anyone going into engineering or some field in the sciences should take this lab. It builds up the fundamental skills needed for each respective field.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who wants to learn how to perform simple physics experiments or if it is required for your major.",
                "Yes, would recommend: not hard and easy to do well as long as you follow the instruction.",
                "Yes you have to take it with physics and it's a nicer lab course than others.",
                "I would, it was a lot of fun to take.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class if your schedule is packed up since this class isn't a lot of time commitment outside the 3-hour lab section.",
                "If you have to take it, it's a fine lab/not too stressful.",
                "Yes! I know a lot of people have to take lab as a major requirement but it is also a great course to take just for fun. The TFs are great, students are super collaborative, and it is especially rewarding to finish a lab early.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they have to take it for a requirement, but with the way in which the skills tests were administered, I would caution them. Taking into account the other parts of the course without the skills tests, I think the course is well-structured and clear. I felt like the lab reports and manuals were mostly helpful in teaching complex physics concepts. However, sometimes the lab manuals were unclear and confused most of the students. I really liked the feedback surveys that we submitted since they offered areas of improvement for the future course.",
                "You probably have to take this class as a requirement, but I would definitely recommend it. It's definitely one of the best lab classes you will take at Yale, and you learn a lot without a ton of stress.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone taking intro physics.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it was a good way to apply physics knowledge and concepts. I also think that this course was a good way to understand other concepts in science such as uncertainty and comparison of data and relationships between variables.",
                "Fairly certain that anyone taking this is doing so to fulfill major requirements or premed requirements, and this is certainly not a course that'll dissuade you from the natural sciences / pre-medical track. Decently complements PHYS 180.",
                "Definitely. I think that this course is a great, relaxing way to get some hands-on, fundamental physics experimentation skills. While I wouldn't say the experiments are revolutionary by any means, it's a great way to get your physics lab out of the way in a low-stress environment. Try to make friends with the kids in your lab, as it makes it much more enjoyable.",
                "I would definitely recommend taking this lab, especially if a student is taking PHYS 180.  This helped to put into perspective what is taught in lecture, and the labs are actually interesting and thought-provoking.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to others. Although the concepts covered within this lab may not always be perfectly in sync with the PHYS 180 lecture, the experiments nevertheless help to clarify fundamental concepts of linear and rotational kinetics. This course is well-organized, and ample resources are provided should students have questions about the experiments conducted.",
                "If they are going to be an engineering or science major then yes otherwise it is not that enjoyable.",
                "If you are taking this course, there is a 99.7% chance it is because you have to, so this section means nothing. I will say this is the best core science lab course I've taken so far. It is well organized, has a very fair grading scheme (in my opinion), and actually tends to line up with the material being taught in the accompanying PHYS 180 course. Also the lab reports are nothing like the general and organic chemistry lab reports, the PHYS 165L reports are much more manageable and I think are better at making you engage with the material in meaningful ways.",
                "Only if they have to take it",

                "Yes, it is a good way to learn more about physics.",
                "I would only really recommend this course to someone if they had to take it. The labs dont carry much meaning other than being more work, unless your major is related to some of the topic areas.",
                "Yes. I enjoyed it.",
                "Nope",
                "Yeah, good introduction to physics lab principles",
                "Yes if you are pre med",
                "Honestly I did not enjoy this laboratory course as much as I enjoyed the general and organic chemistry labs.",
                "not unless you have to take it for your major.",
                "Absolutely! It's a great way to have a hands-on experience with physics, and it's not a crazy workload.",
                "I would recommend this class if you are required to take a physics laboratory class. This class gives a nice introduction to how you should perform physical experiments and the material often aligns material covered in PHYS 180 when you take them synchronously.",
                "Yes if the same structure is upheld , I would strongly recommend it as many of the ideas and topics covered were very interesting and applicable to real life. In addition, I really enjoyed the way the course was structured with weekly lab reports and summaries, and 4 skill tests to wrap up the course. It really facilitated my learning process.",
                "Yes, it went well with the course",
                "Yes",
                "If it's not required for your major, I wouldn't recommend this course. There are more engaging ways to learn about physics.",
                "Yes. It is an all around easy-going and interesting lab course that stands to its 0.5 credit course load.",
                "Yes!!! I really dont like STEM but this class was so manageable and I think I learned a good bit! Youre probably taking this for a requirement but I actually think this would be a good course for a gut science credit",
                "Yes, it is well taught if you have a good TA and, therefore, you learn a lot!",
                "Yes, this is likely a requirement but its still manageable and well structured",
                "Yes, although its kind of an annoying class in terms of the lab reports and stuff, it did help me learn physics concepts.",
                "You probably have to take it but its not too bad",
                "Yes! pretty straight-forwards physics lab course",
                "I would recommend this course to a student, as it is a pre-requisite for many STEM classes they will partake in during the future.",
                "If you must for physics or premed req",
                "Yes its a great class to go along with physics.",
                "Gotta take it for so many majors. It sucks",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if you are taking the physics lecture course. Although it didn't perfectly align with the lecture course, there were definitely topics that I was exposed to through lab which made understanding lecture material easier.",
                "Only if you must.",
                "If you're specifically interested in doing a physics lab, then yes. If you're just interested in physics though, I'd only recommend taking the lecture class, since that's where you actually learn the concepts."
