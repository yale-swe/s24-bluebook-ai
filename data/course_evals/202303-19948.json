Professor Card facilitates discussions and group work nearly every class; I felt like I became a better participant and collaborator. We were exposed to a diverse range of sources on the history, present state, and future of universities. We also learned a lot about Yale as an institution which was really cool.",
                "I developed an array of writing skills that allow me to successfully create and develop complex arguments. Apart from creating arguments, this course has taught me how to correctly cite scholarly texts, something that was confusing to me in the past.",
                "I sharpened my writing skills tremendously, and learned how to more effectively communicate my ideas with clarity and concision. The assigned readings were thoughtful and always led to engaging and spirited class discussions which collectively offered fascinating new insights into higher education and its relationship with the surrounding communities and society. I also gained better research skills and improved my ability to integrate sources to support and expand upon my claims."

                "This course is fantastic. The syllabus features a fascinating and diverse mix of essays, films, promotional videos, and novels; the Canvas is incredibly well organized and always up to date; Professor Card is responsive to emails and feedback. For example, he created reading guides for each reading after students in our class said that theyd find them helpful. Class each day was fresh, engaging, and collaborative. Professor Cards feedback on my writing was the most thorough and helpful Ive ever received. It felt that every aspect of this course was carried out with thought and intention. If I had to say a weakness, it would be that a couple weeks felt more dull as far as readings, though the more academic and dense texts are an integral part of the course.",
                "I appreciated how all assignments were on the syllabus from the beginning of the year and that the professor took time to explain each one. At the same time, I wish we had more time to discuss certain texts.",
                "Strengths: excellent professor who really makes the class what it is; varied, interdisciplinary readings about the university (fiction, nonfiction, statistics, philosophy, urban architectural studies, sociology, religion, etc). Weaknesses: not enough time to thoroughly discuss each reading",
                "Weaknesses: none. Strengths: Everything about this class was honestly great. Prof Card's enthusiasm and warmth stand out in particular. Take the class, you will not regret it!"

                "Absolutely. The class is incredibly well organized and interesting, Professor Card is responsive and committed, and the feedback you get on your writing is remarkably thorough and helpful. This class will make you a better researcher and writer and allow you to explore your interests in anything related to universities. It was a highlight in my schedule and week.",
                "Absolutely, you learn a great deal on American higher ed and Professor Card facilitates this well with great reading choices and conversation",
                "Yes, highly recommend",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to other students. This course truly opened my eyes to the space that Yale occupies in broader society. As a Yale student, it is important to understand the history of the institution which we attend and this course successfully does that.",
                "Yes. It is especially helpful to take it as a first-year and learn more about Yale, as the course had that emphasis. It may be less interesting if you're not curious about universities and their motives, but there's a lot of room to find something you enjoy. At the least, you may be indifferent with occasional passing interests -- I don't see this being a bad class for anyone.",
                "Yes, absolutely! This class embodies the best that Yale has to offer: intriguing and thoughtful course materials, a supportive and accessible professor who is genuinely invested in seeing their students grow as writers and succeed, engaging class discussions that deepened my understanding of the readings, and flexible assignment topics that enabled students to focus on subjects of personal interest which helped facilitate the writing process greatly. If you're considering taking a 114 writing class, this is a fantastic section. The workload is reasonable yet well-paced and stimulating. Also, the feedback and support from Prof Card throughout the semester was invaluable. I'm not a very gifted writer, and was somewhat dreading taking 114, but Prof Card made the experience memorable and rewarding. Once and Future Campus became the sleeper hit of my semester, and as a STEM major that says a lot! I looked forward to each lively class discussion. A final shout-out to having one of the best organized Canvas course sites I've seena much appreciated finishing touch to an excellent course."
