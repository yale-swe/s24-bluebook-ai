   "comments": [
    "Many, all the relevant ones pertaining to this skill level of macroeconomics. Also I learned that a curve for a class can be down-curved, which has been stressful",
    "Basic macro knowledge",
    "I better understand macro economics.",
    "Learned a lot about macroeconomics as a whole and how it applies to our country and about our world. Learned to think and synthesize explanations for why certain behaviors occur in the economy.",
    "Developed a basic understanding of macroeconomics",
    "I took the microeconomics lecture last semester, and decided to take the seminar this semester because I felt like I got too distracted in the lecture. I am so glad I did take the seminar because this class has been very organized and made my learning process so much easier than I thought it would. The material was sectioned off in a way that made a lot of sense, and the order in which the topics that were taught also made the learning process easier. I think I learned how to better think in terms of economic concepts, and gained a better understanding of how economics work in the world.",
    "Really cool macro insight",
    "thinking about the world in an broader sense",
    "Basic macroeconomic knowledge, much better data interpretation skills",
    "basic macroeconomic skills and also a bit of history from the economic side of things",
    "You learn a pretty broad base of macroeconomic topics having to do with labor markets, business cycles, financial crashes and inequality from both a theoretical and practical standpoint.",
    "I learned about the macroeconomic nuances of the economy. I also learned how to apply the topics I learned in Microeconomics.",
    "I learned about introductory macroeconomics! I can now pick up a newspaper, read an article, and determine whether what journalists\/politicians are saying about economic policy is accurate or not. It's great!",
    "Knowledge of Macroeconomics in a variety of fields.",
    "Macro terms and theorys, as well as quantitative and qualitative thinking skills.",
    "Basic understanding of macroeconomic topics",
    "This course is a broad overview of major topics in macroeconomics. I learned terminology and real-world facts to interpret macroeconomic events. We also learned some basic data analysis skills.",
    "I learned how to use different macroeconomic models to analyze changes in an economy. I also learned overarching principles of macroeconomics and their relation to the financial economy.",
    "We learned about how economists look at the world and several models on how to understand economics.",
    "I learned all about fiscal and monetary policy, labor markets, sources of national growth, and much more. Great intro to how the American economy works."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Well taught, cares about students, easily accessible through piazza and quick on email, homework was helpful in learning concepts",
    "Fewer people would be good",
    "I think we covered too much in such a short time span. I think this course could benefit from slimming down the course material.",
    "It was the seminar but wasn't really a seminar because of how many people ended up taking it. The material is great though because it is interesting and more applicable to my life than I think Micro was.",
    "Strengths:\r\n-material is tried to be made as relevant as possible \r\n-problem sets and exams relatively easy and simple \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-curve (at least this year) is not great. For example, there were 7 bonus points on one of our midterms, and you needed at least a 101 to get an A",
    "Strengths: great organization, order of course material made sense, concepts clearly taught, we knew what we were supposed to know\r\nWeaknesses: wish there was more room for interactions between students in the seminar",
    "This course was much more engaging than the microeconomics seminar course I took last semester. This course has many strengths because of the relatively small amount of people, easy access to professors and office hours if you need help, and the psets are good preparation for exams. You really do learn a lot. Some weaknesses of this course are that sometimes it moves a bit fast, so if you don't keep up then you might fall behind, especially when the concepts build upon each other.",
    "Great content, Professor makes it really engaging",
    "engaging class, would like more worksheets during class",
    "I really liked the activities we'd do in class and the prep quizzes, because they kind of forced us to keep up. I also liked that the curve incorporated 116 and 111. Piazza was incredibly helpful - not only could I ask questions anonymously and have them answered quickly, but I could also see what other people were struggling with and learn from their questions. I do wish the class had been smaller, as advertised.",
    "Strengths: not too much work and not too difficult to understand\r\nWeaknesses: people did too well on the tests and cutoff for scores were way too high",
    "The course is a very good introduction class. The class is set up to offer a lot of support for what can at times be a lot of information. I don't really have any complaints about the course's organization or implementation other than the fact that the seminar being uncapped prevented it from having the feel and environment of a seminar.",
    "The class was very well taught and the professor gave lots of real-world examples. I only wish that the class was smaller.",
    "Weaknesses: I think the tests were too easy (especially the final). I'm not saying I did particularly well on these exams, but the curve was essentially deflationary; many people scored very, very highly, so that you have to get near-perfect scores to get an A\/A- in this class. That means a tiny miscalculation could drop someone in the ranks by a ton while what should really make the difference are conceptual understandings (which, understandably, are more difficult to quantify...).",
    "The seminar style brings with it a lot of strengths- student engagement, familiarity with the professor, and clarity through the ability of asking questions. Not much could be improved! Great class.",
    "A lot of resources (online quizzes, psets, piazza etc) to check our understanding. Pace of classes was a little too slow.",
    "Seminar would have been great had it been smaller. That being said, I think Yale has the resources to create more seminar sections that will accommodate the number of students wishing to take 111. The solution should not be to stick to the two sections and enforce strict cuts.",
    "The course did an excellent job of seeming relevant to real-world economic events and providing us with the theory to explain them. I think the course attempted to cover a bit too much material and we sometimes had to rush through major concepts.",
    "This course is very well structured - the material is taught in a straightforward and understandable manner with lots of opportunity to practice the concepts. I appreciated the large number of assignments and the fact that I always knew where I stood in the class grade-wise. The expectations in the course were clear and there was rarely confusion, which made learning the material much easier.",
    "The class was very well taught and I learned a lot. Professor Hawkins kept class extremely organized and on track and we often had time to think through ideas with our neighbor. However, there were 50 people in this seminar so more seminars should be available and classes should be capped.",
    "Professor Hawkins is an enthusiastic and outstanding professor. The material is fascinating and relevant. I think any more ways to tie the information to real-world discussions and debates is always useful, although Professor Hawkins did a good job of this already. I think monetary policy and fiscal policy could have used an additional class.",
    "I personally loved the smaller class feel. I felt a lot more engaged and learned a lot more than I would have in a large class setting."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes--although I would have liked to know in advance, or even now, how the curve is so high",
    "Yes if required",
    "I would, but I would offer the caveat that it goes quickly and you should take it knowing that.",
    "100%. Macroeconomics is a class that I think many people should take because it is so relevant to the world. For anyone interested in going down a path of finance, this class is a must.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Usually both interesting and easy.",
    "Yes!",
    "YES! Hawkins is amazing",
    "Yes, it is a great intro course to help you understand the way our world and country work",
    "Yes, especially the seminar - was personal and engaging.",
    "Yes, taking the seminar is better. It forces you to go to class and helps you understand the material better.",
    "Yes, because I think it is a well-taught and only moderately challenging course that leaves you with a broad base of knowledge. It's also a course with engaging material and the professors allow students to pursue a class interest for the last week of class.",
    "Yes! Even if you aren't majoring in Econ, it's great to learn about the inner workings of our economy.",
    "Yes! I feel like macroeconomics is much more applicable than microeconomics on a day-to-day basis, and lets you understand critical aspects of taxes, trade, interest rates, and more (which affect almost every aspect of our lives!). It's also less calculation-based, which can be refreshing after a whole semester of taking derivatives and maximizing utility...",
    "Maybe. I treated this as my 5th class and maybe as a result didn't do as well but if you're an Econ major I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Definitely. Prof. Hawkins makes an effort to get to know all his students!",
    "If it is required for your major",
    "Anyone considering Econ should definitely take this course. I enjoyed macro a lot better than micro because the real world applications were clearer and the lecture style was efficient yet substantive.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who has to or wants to take intro macro. They would gain a solid foundation in macroeconomics taught in an understandable way. I can't speak specifically for ECON 116, but having taken the large lecture version of introductory micro, I would also recommend this course over the large lecture.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in getting a basic knowledge of the American economy...which should be nearly everyone. If you are willing to put in a little additional work for the seminar, I think it is so worth it. The seminar is so much more engaging than the lecture, and it is much easier to learn the information.",
    "Yes, Professor Hawkins cares about his students and the topics are pretty interesting to learn about. The seminar format allows you to ask questions in class and get better clarification on topics. The coordination with Econ 118 was helpful, but also sometimes confusing because Professor Hawkins would skip through some of the Econ 118 slides very quickly and it was hard to keep track of what was relevant."
