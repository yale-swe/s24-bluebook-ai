    "I learned a lot about Tokyo's evolution from the end of the Edo period to the present though watching films, taking excursions, reading literature, analyzing and writing about texts, and living in the city.",
    "By taking this course I acquired a deeper understanding of what it means to be analyzing a piece of writing through a Humanities viewpoint along with many insights on Japanese culture and what shaped the country the way we see it today.",
    "I gained a contextual appreciation of Japanese history and culture.",
    "I gained a lot of insight about the cultural history of Tokyo, as well of Japan as a whole.",
    "Discussed the development of Tokyo from Edo period to modern times."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved? ",
   "comments": [
    "The course offers the unparalleled opportunity to live directly in Tokyo while learning about its cultural history. The excursions are very well-planned in advance and allow you to contextualize the discussions in the seminars. The host family was another amazing aspect of the program because you get to experience living in the city like an ordinary Japanese person. There is also a lot of freedom outside of class and opportunities to explore the city.",
    "A strength is the the various pieces of literature that the course assigns as readings since they provide students with a very broad understanding of Japanese culture. A weakness is that discussions in class were rear and a lot of times the class was thought as a lecture not a seminar.",
    "There was more of a focus on architecture than I expected, and it was often hard to understand for someone without an architectural background.",
    "The films and literature used in this course were very good! I really enjoyed all of the readings and films. The lectures could feel long at times, but that was more a function of the course structure than of the course content. Discussions during class and essay topics were interesting as well.",
    "Strengths: Very interesting material and wide range of topics ... you'll find something that clicks with you! Professor(s) willing to work with you and help you with any misunderstandings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Yeah, some lectures were kinda ... not for me."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Tokyo is a fascinating city that never ceases to amaze me. The class does an amazing job in ensuring that you study the city from as many approaches and angles as possible.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking to gain a deep understanding of a foreign country without feeling the pressure of the overwhelming workload of a college course over the summer.",
    "I would recommend this course, as it is a balanced study abroad course that leaves time for learning and exploration.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are looking to learn more about the foundations of the largest metropolitan area in the world, particularly through the lenses of literature and film. The readings and movies were very interesting (and entertaining)!",
    "ABSOLUTELY!! My friends would keep asking if I was studying or vacationing in Japan. Great class that's made to help you learn about the city you're living in and explore it. 100000% recommend",
    "I would recommend this as an experience in Japan, not as an academic course."
