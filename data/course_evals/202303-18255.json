The instructors were also very responsive via e-mail. \r\n\r\nHowever, there was not much course coordinator engagement with students throughout the course. I understand that the course coordinators expect the PIs to give feedback on our work, but it would be helpful if the course coordinators could leave a few comments as feedback for our initial proposals so we can be sure that we are on the right track. Also, it might be helpful to introduce optional office hours where students can go ask questions/ask for guidance; if this resource existed, it was not easily accessible from Canvas.",
