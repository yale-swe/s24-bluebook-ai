The interaction between environment and the organism, what functions different hormones have in determining the trajectories of growth, etc.",
                "This class is fantastic. It gives you a broad insight into the field of anthropology that is useful for science and non-science majors alike. Professor Bribiescas is engaging and highly knowledgeable about the subject material and much of our readings feature his research.

I find myself referencing what I learned in this course in casual conversation more than any other course I took this semester which is surprising because I am a social science major, not a Bio major.",

This includes a discussion of the basics of evolution as well as the different aspects of this process which can be focused on (this class has a recurring focus on tradeoffs), and then a transition to how this has shaped a variety of different aspects of humanity, from reproductive functioning to stress.\r\nOverall gained a better understanding of how the process and outcomes of evolution are studied in modern humans, as well as gaining a deeper knowledge of how that evolution has shaped us to this point.",

                "Strengths: readings are very approachable, even if you've never taken a science class at Yale before\r\nWeaknesses: problem sets were usually graded very generously, but when they took points off it tended to feel arbitrary",
                "Not that interesting of a topic",
                "This course had some really interesting content and it was really fun to hear about prof bribiescas' experiences in the field that related to the content we were learning about. I thought that sometimes the content was organized in a way where I didn't understand how some tangents related to the main point, and some readings were extremely dense and difficult to parse through.",
                "The p-sets were kind of BS. Would always lose a point for something silly.",
                "This course is laid out very wellcontent progression made sense, readings closely followed the lecture material, and the midterm content was as expected. No specific weaknesses come to mind.",
                "I liked the information that we learned, I thought it was very interesting. I think the content could be better organized. It would be nice if at the beginning of every lecture there was a slide showing the key takeaways from each day so we know where the lecture is going. I thought the exams were fair for the most part. Sometimes there were points I thought were very important because the professor harped on them a lot but then they were never tested.",
                "Strengths are the predictable, routine syllabus and the use of technology to archive lectures and materials",
                "The material in this course was very interests and Professor Bribiescas is a very engaging lecturer. However, my engagement in the class felt limited by the disproportionate focus on exams.",
                "Strength: easy, psets are easy, exams were fairly easy\r\nWeakness: tedious, lecture can be boring, readings were sometimes dense",
                "I thought that the course was well organized, but the readings sometimes did not feel entirely relevant to the course.",
                "I thought sections were very helpful for reviewing the psets and relevant lecture material.",
                "strengths: I liked Dr. Bribiescas- hes a pretty good lecturer, but he is really great at explaining things one on one. The ideas from this course are broad enough to be applied to a lot of topics in evolution, not just human evolution. \r\nweaknesses: you have to do the readings really really well, because the exams tend to get very specific. Your TA is also going to play a big role on what you actually get out of the course, so watch out for that too.",
                "Passionate prof. Good TAs!",
                "Strengths: organization, like the three midterm schedule and the problem sets kept me engaged and the readings were fair and manageable\r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps the sections could have been more organized and beneficial to understanding course material",
                "Perhaps a few practice exams would be nice to get an idea of how the questions are",
                "Strengths: clearly formatted, well structured\r\nWeaknesses: I wish they had given us a clearer idea of what tests would look like/cover",
                "The strengths: Bribiescas is a really passionate lecturer, the material really connects from different lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there are a lot of problem sets (though not mathematical), which only sometimes help understand the material. Also, it is sometimes unclear what is a verified finding vs a hypothesis because we talk about so many explanations for human traits that defy easy evidence.\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by summarizing the key points at the end of each unit/before each midterm. The second unit on the immune system and growth would have benefited from this because it tries to cover a lot of material on the same period of time as the others. Perhaps it would have been better to put this unit last? In general, you learn a lot about how different bodily systems work. It would have been nice to know how much we had to know about how these function vs their relevance to ev bio/life history. That would have streamlined my studying.",
                "Lectures are enjoyable. I wouldn't necessarily say there are any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: manageable workload, but was still able to teach students a wide variety of information; relevant information for everyday life (especially for womens health)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings were a little long and kind of dense which was challenging without any class time spent covering the readings",
                "It was a great course all in all",
                "It was super interesting material but exams were super hard (felt like exams tested more of if you could memorize every word of the readings or what Professor said in class ). I came out of the class learning a lot but my exam and scores didn't reflect the amount of learning I did with the course.",
                "As a science class for non-bio majors I think the course is well structured.  You have to do the readings/attend or watch the lectures to properly solve the problem sets and do well on midterms, but nothing is so difficult that it requires a lot of excess stress, and I enjoy what I learned. Sections exist for people who would like more assistance in understanding the material but are not optional.",
                "variety of content but lecture is too monotonous",
                "Strengths included the professor himself. Prof B was extremely knowledgeable and engaging. It was evident that he was very passionate about the subject, which made lecture a lot more interesting!",
                "Strengths: Fantastic lectures, Professor Bribiescas clearly cares a lot about student engagement, sections helped make sense of readings, super manageable workload, exams are fair\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lockdown browser exams were not ideal, last midterm covered a lot more content than the first two did, class took up a lot of time per week with 2x 75 min lectures and a 50 min section (section was not required but definitely beneficial)",
                "Professor is a total gem and the pacing of the class is excellent",
                "Strengths: You actually cover a fair bit of material, and to really feel confident going into the midterms you have to actually memorize quite a bit of it. I put this as a strength as it means you really do have to engage with the material and not just coast by, and this I consider a strength. Another strength is that the readings we do are often of actual research, which is good because it shows the actual paradigm of research in the field. The TFs/Sections I thought were a strength, as they both reviewed major themes and covered some of the harder readings in a more digestable fashion (would definitely recommend attending!). Lastly, the 3 midterm structure made it so that studying never was truly overwhelming, but the material was sufficiently cumulative that I still actually remember quite a bit of the basics from the beginning of the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures often felt like they jumped around between topics inside of each slideshow. This made it sometimes a little bit tricky to see the whole thread of the lecture and exactly how each thing related to what. This semester they recorded the lectures and made in-person attendance optional, this was a weakness as it meant relatively few people consistently came to lecture which made it less engaging and lower-energy. Lastly, some of the readings were really long and contained too high a ratio of minor-details:important-insights, which made the HW somewhat of a slog for many weeks of the course.",
                "The course moves at an interesting pace, and is not very suitable to non-STEM majors.",
                "Well-taught. I liked having three separate mid terms so you can really focus on the topics in between the tests.",
                "I thought that it was an interesting class even if you are not an anthropology or science major, but it was very challenging at times.",
                "You will read a lot of really, really dense papers. You will sit through a lot of really, really confusing lectures. The only way to do well in this course is to proactively clarify with your teaching fellow what information is and is not important. Aside from a student's own capacity to engage their teaching fellow, this course does nothing to help non-science majors digest and parse through content--pretty tough, given this is a class that a lot of folks take to fulfill their science requirement.",
                "the midterm exams require you to study a quantity of information that began to feel overwhelming, and the format of these tests made it so that only a limited amount of what you studied would even be on the tests.",
                "I think Professor Bribiescas lectures could be more organized. Lots of times he will have a slide at the beginning with subpoints that he will go into throughout the lecture, but then he doesn't actually go into all of them during the lecture. Or some of them are main points and some are subpoints. Taking notes in class you have to structure the info for yourself because lots of the time his internal lecture structure is confusing or unhelpful. \r\nAnother weakness is for several concepts the level of specificity was confusing, aka how much you had to know. For some of the hormonal systems I was confused about what things meant because we didn't know basic systems that that knowledge relied on. Sometimes I felt that we knew things too superficially or too in-depth. I think a better balance could be struck.",
                "Strengths: well organized, straightforward, interesting, engaging, and passionate prof.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some parts of the course felt a bit repetitive at times but perhaps this was necessary for the course?",
                "Weakness: very boring class; exams are all memorisation \r\nStrength: easy psets",
                "Professor Bribiescas was an amazing lecturer and classes were very clear. Reading assignments were interesting as well.",
                "Strengths: interesting content relevant to our every day lives! not a high workload -- weekly psets that were basically reading comprehension and 3 exams total. Prof. Bribiescas is also nice and understanding and a wonderful lecturer, but what I did not appreciate was him telling us AFTER the final exam that he planned on changing the grading structure. Throughout the course, he kept saying that there would be no curve and no change to the grading (even though people were struggling due to COVID and asking for grading changes), that 90 and above = A/A-, 80 and above = B's, but all of a sudden during finals period we got an email saying he would drop the lowest midterm score (because of COVID complications) and so everyone's grade was bumped up significantly -- but this was already PAST the Credit/D deadline. he should have informed us beforehand. the bump was definitely appreciated by people who didn't Credit/D though.\r\nWeaknesses: there should have been more focus on how eugenics has impacted science. there was very little discussion about this even though it is pretty important when talking about science pertaining to humans. also, tests were not a good measure of knowledge at all. they only tested memorization of the course material, no critical thinking skills whatsoever and that would be fine if the exams were fair but they weren't. the exams were hard and nitpicky. the questions were not straightforward and the answers needed to be very detailed in order to get full points. it was tedious and not at all a productive academic measurement. it would make more sense for us to submit short research papers/short presentations in lieu of the exams where we dove more deeply into course content and actually showed our learning by incorporating course content rather than just regurgitating details. plus, the exams weren't cumulative so we'd end up forgetting information anyway. but in general, it's really not helpful to just have courses where we can't fully exercise critical thinking skills or meaningful exploration of the material because all we're doing is memorizing what the instructor says and trying to remember as much as possible so we can just repeat it on an exam."

Just literally taking notes for an hour and fifteen minutes while he lectures.",

                "Yes, it is not a gut however (unless you're really into the material): like many other \"not-guts,\" the content is straightforward but there is a lot of material to memorize. The worst is that there is no practice material so it's hard practicing material going into it.",

                "I would recommend the course, but they should know its not a gut. They should enter with the hope of learning something about human evolution and life history. If they pay attention and give it some effort, they will. Youll definitely learn more than in a course like Intro Biological Anthro.",
                "Yes if they are interested in the variation in different health factors across human populations and/or evolutionary theory.",
                "Yes I would because even for non-STEM students the course material is decipherable and relevant to other aspects of life.",
                "Yes i would but be ready to work",
                "Only if they can Cr/D it or are really great at memorization.",
                "Yes, I think it's a really great intro to biological anthropology course for those interested in the field, and a casual but not gutty science credit for non-majors.",
                "Yes!! Strongly recommend because it is a fair science credit and prof B is an amazing lecturer! It was so interesting to also read many of his papers and listen to him speak about his research.",
                "Yes! Took this for a science credit and really loved it. Would take it again even without needing a science credit",
                "Yes absolutely! Great if youve always wanted an explanation for evolutionary things in day to day life",
                "Yeah, I guess so. I came in needing another science credit, and this was more work than I was expecting (sometimes weekly readings were quite long and studying for midterms took a while), but also I clearly got quite a bit out of it. I think about humans slightly differently than before, and the idea of evolutionary trade-offs is ever-present in my mind now. Also, learned some cool trivia/themes regarding how humans respond to e.g. environmental factors, so overall a successful course.",
                "I would only recommend it to another student if they were a STEM major, or willing and able to put a lot of independent time and effort into the calss.",
                "Yes. Professor Bribiescas was great and his own studies and experiences in different countries really added to the lecturees.",
                "No, only if it was a major requirement. This class is not worth the stress and difficulty for a science credit",
                "i wouldn't recommend this course without having a great interest in the subject and prerequisite knowledge of biological anthropology. the things studied are interesting and relevant, but can be hard to grasp in exam settings, whereas problem sets are much more digestible.",
                "Yes, I loved this class, Prof. Bribiescas is very kind and funny and I looked forward to the readings each week",
                "I would because at the end of the day I thought the concepts were very interesting. Life history trade-offs provided a unique lens through which to understand evolution and stages in our lives as humans.",
                "Yes, if this sort of thing interests you like it did for me! I wanted to get a science credit and was also interested in picking up some cursory knowledge of evolutionary biology and that is what I got. Well taught, good standard college course honestly. Not much to complain about. We did the readings, attended lectures, and took tests, and it was all fine!",
                "No there are better guts. Do not take as gut",
                "Yes. For anyone looking for a not too hardcore science course or interested in ecology and evolutionary biology, this is a great introductory class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. I thought the course material was engaging and Professor Bribiescas was a great lecturer. As someone not from a science background, I found the course captivating while still accessible; if you are looking for an interesting science credit, I think this is a great choice!",
                "i would recommend it ONLY if they change the course structure. 75% of your grade was based on exams that solely test memorization which was not at all a good measure of knowledge and was not engaging. plus, the exams asked very specific questions and if you didn't remember the details, you were docked points. he should have a mixture of exams and short research papers where we meaningfully engage with course content instead of just regurgitate information. the course content was pretty interesting though and relevant to our every day lives. but what was also lacking was discussion about eugenics. there should have been more focus on how eugenics has impacted science, as it is pretty important when talking about science pertaining to humans"
