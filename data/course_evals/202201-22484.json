We began the course with electrostatics and electrodynamics, discussing coulomb's and Gauss's law, as well as how to understand the concept of potential, since the electric field is conservative in this case. We then progressed to magnetostatics and learned about the formulas\/laws that govern how an infinitesimal piece of wire creates a magnetic field, as well as how moving charges experiences forces due to magnetic fields. We then introduced time dependence and learned about the relationship between current, magnetic field, flux, and induced emf, finally arriving at the complete list of Maxwell's (corrected) equations. \r\nIn the last few weeks of the course, these equations were used in lecture to derive the wave equations, and to understand light as a self-propagating EM wave. The dual wave\/particle nature of light and electrons was then used as a launching pad to discuss quantum dynamics.",

                "Through taking this course I learned about the fundamentals of electrostatics such as Coulomb's Law, dipole interactions, Electric fields, electric potential, Gauss's Law and its applications, Magnetic fields, and Ampre's Law and its applications. We discovered the effect different combinations of resistors, capacitors, and inductors have on the behavior of current, voltage, and charge over time in DC and AC circuits. In this unit I learned how to use complex exponentials to model sinusoidal functions and solve difficult differential equations. I also learned how to use phasor domain to understand the relationship between the frequencies and phase shifts of current, voltage, and charge functions in both the complex plane and real space. We derived in class Maxwell's equations in integral and differential form. From these equations, we determined the wave equations for electromagnetism describing the wave-like behavior of light. We then studied the particle nature of light through the quantization of properties such as energy and momentum. From this, we then dove into quantum mechanics, studying wave functions of definite state of momentum using the complex analysis techniques learned in our unit on circuits. I'd say my biggest insights from this course were a deeper understanding of the fundamental connection between electricity, magnetism, and light, and how the properties of these fields influence the foundations of quantum mechanics. The mathematical tools I learned and developed further in this class  techniques to solve ordinary linear differential equations, surface and line integrals, and phasor domain  were incredibly interesting and will definitely be useful in future physics, engineering, and math classes.",

                "The pace of the class is one of its biggest strong points. The class is not too fast-paced, where you are scrambling to take down notes without understanding the derivation as its being done, but rather you are able to work through the logic behind the math and assumptions behind the derivations for each formula. Professor Poland is also a good teacher that can answer questions and explain physics concepts very well.",
                "This was a very solid course overall-- taught clearly and assessed fairly. My only critique would be that the extra topics at the end (relativistic electrodynamics and basic quantum mechanics) were glossed over too quickly to be of much use to students. Having taken a full-semester quantum mechanics course concurrently, I can say that the two-week introduction given in this class likely would not have made it any easier to learn the actual formalism. Furthermore, usage of the electromagnetic tensor in special relativity doesn't mean much when students don't have the opportunity to see it actually derived. Instead, I would have preferred to use these final three weeks going into more details on classical electrodynamics, including the vector potential and gauge transformations, as I feel like this would have given the course more continuity and depth, as well as preparing students better for relativistic electrodynamics when they eventually study it.",
                "Strengths: Professor Poland is awesome. Even though it was a decently large class, I was comfortable asking questions and knew that his answers would always help me improve my understanding of the material. I haven't had a professor that's been better at answering students' questions. He's also an engaging lecturer and physics actually felt exciting at times.\r\nTA's like John were also awesome. Would dive into some fascinating tangents with John and came out with a deeper understanding of physics.\r\nLots of wow\/woah moments in class and in office hours.\r\nWeaknesses: Physics is hard.",
                "I thought the whole teaching staff and the office hours scheduling was definitely the strength of the course. There were so many opportunities to get help on the PSETs and ask questions. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
                "Lecture is well-paced, not too fast to be able to take good notes. The problem sets are challenging but doable if you go to office hours, which are super helpful and abundant throughout the week. The TA's are all amazing.",
                "The course was really enjoyable, but I think sometimes Professor Poland forgot that that we are not experienced physics students yet. He sometimes overestimated our understanding, so it would be helpful if he could spend a bit more time on concepts. We might not get through certain material, but we would have a better understanding of the material we did cover.",
                "Strengths: good lecturer, good pace, great course notes are available online. Weaknesses: none.",
                "I feel like the work outside class was very well structured to help us learn the material and prepare for exams. Sometimes lectures could be a bit hard to follow but professor Poland was always receptive to questions!",
                "I liked the lectures and notes, but the notation was very confusing and the psets started off way too difficult for an intro class.",
                "The study halls were accessible to everyone.",
                "There was a focus (or at least, more of a focus) on the math, though explanations of the math in lecture could have been more comprehensive (especially when we had to do similar calculations on the problem set, but the process of doing the math itself was skipped over in lecture).",
                "Strength of the course is how the psets and exams adequately reflect the material learned in class, and the structure of support around helping students along the way with many TAs.",
                "It was a class that was taught very well and run very well with the TAs!",
                "The course was very good; however, there was a long period in the course where I could not attend lecture as I was hospitalized. It would have been extremely helpful to have had the lectures recorded.",
                "Strengths: clear expectations, lots of resources (great office hours), solid introduction to concepts on syllabus.\r\nWeaknesses: I felt the lectures weren't the most engaging and I primarily learned the material through the problem sets.",
                "This course was very difficult and often delved into hard material without much fanfare. I did learn a lot about E&M, but I feel as if I could have gotten a better intuitive understanding for how each of the concepts works. This class was very mathematical in nature, and it could have used some other materials -- say practical demonstrations or computer visualizations of different concepts.",
                "Solid class overall!",
                "One strength of this course was the pacing. Because Professor Poland wrote out his notes by hand on the chalkboard, the material never felt too rushed. Additionally, Professor Poland answered student questions in class, which was very helpful because it helped me to understand the material more thoroughly as I was learning it. \r\n\r\nHowever, the lectures could occasionally feel a tad dry, in the sense that the only notes we ever took were off of the blackboard. That is, I think the lectures could be improved if there were occasionally small demonstrations of the topics, or perhaps if images relevant to the topic could also be shown in a short powerpoint, etc. \r\n\r\nThe homework assignments were also a strength of the course, as they built off of the lecture material in a productive way. Questions that I had after reviewing lecture notes often resolved themselves after I worked my way through the problem sets and checked my answers at office hours. Another major strength of this course was the availability of office hours.",
                "The lectures were really engaging, but sometimes we didn't cover its applications \/ review material necessary to begin work on problem sets, which was an occasional challenge.",
                "Strengths: The course was well organized and the problem sets were thorough and interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Unfortunately, we did not get to cover optics at all and did not cover very much quantum (though this was due to weird scheduling due to COVID and because we emphasized relativity).",
                "This course was phenomenal at building off previously learned topics to introduce new concepts, tools, and ideas. We started with the foundational properties of, and laws of interaction in, electric and magnetic fields. From there we learned about the interconnectivity between electricity and magnetism, and how both quantum mechanics and special relativity are a product of this essential connection. The material was always fascinating and engaging, and there were tons of office hour sessions throughout the week where students could get help from TAs and ULAs on problem sets and with understanding course material. This class was incredibly well taught, so I don't really know of any significant weaknesses that jump out. Questions on problem sets were sometimes difficult to start because we weren't provided an example problem in lecture, but that was solved by the availability of ample office hours and study sessions with Professor Poland and all of the TA staff. Overall, this sequence was a fantastic introduction into physics at Yale, and has definitely got me excited to take more physics courses.",
                "Super well organized, great pace for learning without background but not dwelling on things for too long, clearly presented, and satisfyingly complete introduction to range of topics.",
                "Strengths: interesting material, well-written problem sets and tests, good teaching style.\r\nWeaknesses: pacing of material was a little too fast and surface-level",
                "I think the strengths of this course are the way lectures are organized and the office hours offered to students. The lectures taught the topics in a way where one day always connected to the next, starting from the basics at the beginning of the semester and ending with the more complex material. The flow from class to class helped a lot in the area of keeping up, and whenever I came across topics I did not fully understand, the structure of the class made it possible to look back at previous topics to draw connections from there. In addition, Professor Poland always wrote notes while lecturing on the blackboards, which was really helpful in visualizing concepts. As for office hours, the almost daily office hours every week made it really easy to ask for help, and it made doing homework a lot smoother. The teaching assistants and peer tutors were always easy to approach and always helped explain concepts that I had questions with. Generally, the course is designed really well, but a weakness of the course in my opinion is the lack of review for past topics taught earlier in the semester. While everything is conceptually connected so every class constantly drew upon things learned since the beginning of the semester, I think it would be really helpful to have small reviews interspersed throughout. Additionally, I think that not enough time was spent learning about the topic of waves in specific. Personally, I think it would be helpful to spend an additional lecture going over that topic.",

It made me disappointed not to be doing more physics, so in that regard it was a success. That said, we moved very quickly through the material.",
                "If you are interested in physics to a higher level and prepared for a challenge, then this course is a good one to take. If a physics prerequisite is needed, consider 181 instead as it moves at a more manageable pace as this course moves very quickly through material.",

                "Yes, take 201 instead of 181. We briefly learned about quantum mechanics in the endthe prof managed to teach the concepts very well with appropriate level of math",

                "Yes. Professor Poland and the TAs are amazing, and the course material is very interesting! The work load was not bad either, so thats a plus.",
                "YES. This course has a comparable workload to some of the harder STEM classes I've taken at Yale, but the office hours and study halls are WONDERFUL and make the work so, so much more manageable. The problem sets were challenging, but also really genuinely interesting and kind of fun to do, especially with a group. Exams were consistent and very fairly written. Shankar's textbook is amazing, and hilarious. The grading scheme was pretty generous as well. If you do take this course, plan to clear out one or two of your evenings to sit in study hall and finish the problem set \/ listen to the TAs go over the material. \r\n\r\nIf you're deciding between PHYS 181 and PHYS 201 - I took PHYS 180 first semester, and I had a really difficult time engaging with the content. There were a lot of topics that were barely related, and we didn't ever go deep enough to really understand any of them. Much of 180 was learning how to apply math tricks to extremely specific problems. In PHYS 201, I was able to see how everything connected - a lot of things \"clicked\" for me. I also think that people who take 200\/201 are generally more interested in the material, which makes the learning experience super collaborative. Poland also writes challenging but very fair exams, and strikes a good balance of emphasis on computational and conceptual understanding. My experience in 201 was 10x better than in 180. I HIGHLY recommend the 200\/201 sequence over the 180\/181 sequence, the workloads end up being comparable, but 180 is more tedious and 200\/201 is much more enjoyable.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in electromagnetism and the fundamentals of modern physics! The subject matter is fascinating and we dive into a lot of incredibly interesting areas of physics, such as quantum mechanics, with enough mathematical treatment so that we're able to solve problems in these fields and understand their fundamental properties without feeling lost in equations and drowning in derivations. Professor Poland was a fantastic instructor for this course, whose lectures were easy to follow and who explained the course content in an accessible way without sacrificing specificity and mathematical rigor. TAs and ULAs host many office hour sessions throughout any given week (and they often host special study sessions during exam weeks) and are always happy to help students work through tough problem set problems and answer any clarifying questions about course content. Though PHYS 200 is a prerequisite for this course, the class is structured in such a way that prior physics knowledge is not heavily assumed in class derivations, and the teaching assistant staff is always happy to go over prerequisite concepts in physics and math during their review sessions. Overall, this is one of the most interesting courses that I've taken so far at Yale, and I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in taking a physics course.",
                "Absolutely. For anyone who enjoys or felt comfortable in high school physics, but either doesnt want the challenge or feels underprepared for 260, phys 200\/201is the perfect balance of a course that requires no previous exposure to the matierial, but goes quickly enough to engage students with strong preparation and talent in calculus and mechanics. This speed allows a more thorough treatment of topics and breadth of material that you wouldnt get in 180\/181.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course is designed really well in helping students learn electromagnetism, and the large amount of support offered in office hours makes it so students can always find help when they need it. Even if students are not physics majors, the mathematical and logical challenges of this course make for a really fun class.",
                "Yes, it is challenging but I believe it is a happy medium of Phys 181 and 261"
