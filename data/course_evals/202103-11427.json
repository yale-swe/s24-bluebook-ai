                "I learned more about biological research, including the techniques it relies on. I also learned about SARS-CoV-2 and current research involving the pandemic.",
                "This course focused primarily on scientific literature surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Topics ranged from the structural biology and evolutionary history of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to antiviral medications and antibodies. Through reading, analyzing, and discussing a handful of research papers, I was able to learn a lot about COVID-19 as well as biological research as a whole. We also developed skills such as interpreting scientific writing, brainstorming experiments and novel solutions, and writing grant proposals.",
                "I learned to read biological and medical research articles, give presentations, collaborate in a group setting, and write an original grant proposal. This course is an incredible preparation for learning how to science works on a study-to-study level. Additionally, Dr. Sandy Chang is the Dean of Undergraduate STEM Education and on the Board for MD PhD admissions at Yale. His advice on how to approach your time at Yale is invaluable.",
                "By taking this course, I learned to read and understand scientific research papers, as well as present the findings of those papers. I believe this class improved my comprehension and analytical skills as well.",
                "I learned how to read scientific papers and then present that information back. I learned how to communicate scientific information clearly and effectively.",
                "I gained in-depth knowledge and understanding of the molecular biology behind COVID-19, the focus of the class for this term. More importantly, I also gained an array of valuable skills, including analysis of research papers, experimental design, presentation of scientific material and writing of grant proposals.",
                "This course is an excellent introduction to biological research. While it focused on a specific topic (SARS-Cov-2), it taught me skills that are very transferable like reading and understand research papers and common experimental techniques, designing experiments, and grant-writing.",
                "Reading scientific literature",
                "I learned how to read, interpret, and write scientific literature. Taking this course allowed me to feel more comfortable sharing my ideas and encouraged me to ask questions more often.",

                "I've become better at understanding the data presented in research papers. From this, I've also acquired the ability to be able to present this data to classmates."

            "comments": [
                "The course is good at introducing students to research, although more structured\/formalized instruction would have been very helpful.",
                "This course was highly interesting and informative, and I found that the way we were introduced to scientific concepts and assays by reading about them in actual papers was very effective. Dean Chang is also very enthusiastic and a great professor, and he is always willing to give feedback and guidance.",
                "I felt that the first half of the course where we read a new article and learned the associated scientific techniques with it each week was incredible. My knowledge base grew so much over such a short period of time. During the grant writing portion of the semester, I felt like the class got somewhat less valuable. Generally we would go around in a circle and hear what each group's grant was, and then address a specific section each week. Office hours became much more unnecessary during this time as well. If I were to retake this class, I would appreciate 2 more weeks of COVID papers and 2 fewer weeks of grant proposals.",
                "I think one of the strengths of this course was collaboration with our group members because it encouraged the sharing of scientific ideas and allowed us to see different perspectives. This course could be improved perhaps by the occasional lecture to consolidate all the information we have learned so far.",
                "The class was split into small groups that we worked with throughout the semester on problem sets and presentation, which I found really helpful as it ensured we would collaborate with others and helped me get a lot more out of the papers. I also liked how the class had a large student-lead component since one group would present the week's paper that we had all completed a problem set on; since we all did the problem set on the same paper, everyone had a base level of understanding of the material, and presenting one of the papers provided an opportunity for deeper understanding. Splitting the final grant-writing assignment into smaller steps rather than having one deadline was also very helpful in preventing procrastination. I would have liked if there was also more time for direct instruction from Dean Chang to teach or review the experimental methods(BLI, FACS, SPR, etc.), as some of them difficult to fully understand on our own or when taught by other students as part of their presentations.",
                "Discussions very strong",
                "A strength is that everyone had an equal chance to grow and participate. There was lots of room for conversation and opportunities to learn from my peers since we had to teach parts of the material ourselves.",
                "I was very overwhelmed at the beginning because I felt behind the other students in the class in terms of my background\r\nbio knowledge on techniques and specific methods. As the class progressed, I gradually became more comfortable and definitely became more confident in my ability to discuss with my classmates on articles that I would not have been able to understand at the beginning of this semester."

The focus on reading various research papers in this course allows for great exposure to scientific writing, biological concepts, and experimental techniques. While there is a somewhat heavy workload with weekly assignments, it is mostly manageable thanks to the assigned groups and is well worth it in the end.",
                "Incredible course which introduces you to a wonderful community of other students interested in biology, the Dean of Undergraduate STEM education, how to effectively read and understand scientific papers (and not just the abstract\/figures), and write original grant proposals. Truly a wonderful combo and one of my most enjoyable classes. Probably more like one credit of work than half a credit, but definitely worth signing up for - just be careful if you are trying to do 5.5 your Freshman Fall!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anybody who is hoping to do any sort of research in the future. It's a bit daunting at first, but there is a lot to learn in this class and I think it was one of the most enriching science classes I've ever taken.",
                "Yes, I would especially if you enjoy learning about the topics covered in the seminar. We read many scientific papers about Covid and learned about it super in depth. I came out of this class with a lot of new knowledge and many new skills.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wishes to carry out biological research in the future, as you will gain knowledge and insight essential to that career path.",
                "Yes. This course made me much more comfortable understanding research, and I think it would be a good course for anyone interested in biological research, especially if they have not worked in a lab before.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course, especially to students who havent had exposure to research methods and scientific literature beforehand.",
                "If youre interested in research, yes. Its a great way to get familiar with what the field is like. However, if youre looking for a fun and chill first-year seminar, this is not it. Its a lot of work and very academically challenging. It is fun, but not the relaxing first-year seminar class you might be looking for",
                "If a student is particularly interested in learning how to understand research papers and interpret the data, then I would recommend this course.",
