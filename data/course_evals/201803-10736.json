   "comments": [
    "Interpersonal and presentational Chinese skills that enabled me to communicate and read effectively.",
    "This course introduced basis vocabulary, grammar, Chinese characters and simple conversation phrases to non-native Chinese speakers. Students learned how to hold simple conversations with each other, while being able to write and read as well.",
    "Through Chinese 110, I feel I truly began to adjust to the rigor of a Yale education in general. The multifaceted ways we approach Chinese in Chinese 110 really do reinforce each other. While the course is fast paced, I feel as though Ive taken away the necessary skills for L2.",
    "I really learned a lot--basic Chinese vocabulary, grammar, and characters (both reading and writing). I liked the textbook a lot. The dialogues are funny, the characters are well-developed, and the vocabulary is surprisingly useful in everyday conversations. I also learned how to speak pretty well. My tones and pronunciation greatly improved over the course of the semester. I learned a little about Chinese culture and traditions as well.",
    "I learned so much from this course. Highly recommend.",
    "I learned how to read, write, speak, and understand the Chinese language."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: in depth teaching style, how much the review is emphasized, manageable speed and rigor\r\n\r\nCons: perhaps a little rushed in the latter half of the course as more characters are learned",
    "I wish instructors for L1 would consistently post grades throughout the year, so I could track my progress and standing in the course. I would consider this a weakness, as it leaves me feeling very in the dark about whether or not Im studying the right ways. Another thing is that the daily quizzes sometimes do not cover the material we learned the night before, or they require us to learn more or less certain times. While this assessment forces a student to study a lot, sometimes were left with only a day to learn all the pinyin & characters from one dialogue. To me, this was sometimes difficult to approach and maintain. However, I feel like this course is strong in all other ways the curriculum, assessment schedule, and wonderful instructors.",
    "The course is a great balance of speaking, reading, and writing. It pushes the students to step outside of their comfort zones and make sounds that feel uncomfortable. The professors are passionate and wonderful teachers. They really make sure the students understand the material, and they pay attention to each student's needs and successes. The course covers a lot of useful material. However, the course syllabus was a little repetitive and highly textbook-based; I would recommend working in some more creative projects or exercises to the curriculum.",
    "I loved how small the class sizes were and how we met on a daily basis."

   "comments": [
    "Yes; for any student who wishes to start learning Chinese, this is a fantastic introductory course.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chinese 110 to an incoming student if they had enough time to dedicate to the course. I think the Chinese departments course load & schedule of assessments is rigorous and demanding, but it disciplines you as a student at Yale and truly helps you make quick improvements in Chinese learning.",
    "Yes, definitely! It was a really fun time. My professor was awesome, encouraging, and really nice. Also, if you just put in a little work for the course every night, the workload is very manageable. I thought the pace was perfect, and I learned a lot. It was more like a high school course than a college course, so everything is set up for you to succeed (many exams, quizzes, etc.). It's a great introduction to Chinese. It also got me really interested in Chinese culture and China in general. By the end of the semester, I was going to Chinese language table and Chinese character writing club every so often.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. Even though the workload may be high, you learn so much and it is so worthwhile.",
    "Yes, learning Chinese is a very rewarding process and allowed me to reconnect with my roots."
