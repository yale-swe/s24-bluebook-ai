   "comments": [
    "I had never taken philosophy before and this was a whole new experience. Im not totally sure if its my thing, but I definitely learned how to think in a whole different way.",
    "How to read philosophy effectively.",
    "I developed the ability to understand and familiarize myself with philosophical arguments from Plato to Aquinas, and to analyze and develop those arguments in papers.",
    "Key differences between the beliefs of various hellenistic philosophers, studies specifically in the soul, body, the obtaining of knowledge, the nature of things, free will, how to live well, death, and God. We also covered methods of approaching, understanding, and responding to philosophical thought.",
    "A greater comfort with logical argumentation and arcane texts comes with this course. You will engage with systems of thought and ideas spanning generations.",
    "Obviously, I developed a much broader understanding of the development of Western philosophy. I could see how different philosophers built upon and responded to each other. I also became better at interpreting their writings accurately and forming my own philosophic arguments.",
    "This course is a good introduction to thinking and writing about philosophy.",
    "-I learned to think in a more logical, step by step process (or at least to justify my thoughts in this way) (or at least to strive to do this)\r\n-I developed my close reading skills\r\n-I learned how to write a philosophy paper\r\n-I got an introduction to what philosophy is and its purpose (at least according to the authors that we read)",
    "This course helped me to develop my ability to look at arguments critically."

   "comments": [
    "Less reading I guess",
    "This course is packed with material, and by nature therefore can move quite quickly at times.",
    "I overall enjoyed the course. I think that the coverage of different topics and interesting readings was generally good, and section meetings were helpful in covering the key ideas in each author's writing. I would suggest two areas professors could consider for improvement in the future. First, it would have been helpful at the beginning of the course to share some strategies for reading and note-taking that have worked for students in the past. This would have helped students who have not handled similarly difficult reading-loads in high school. I often found philosophy readings difficult to parse, and somewhat frustrating to try to understand on my own. Secondly, the lectures are often quite difficult to follow, even for a student who is fully attentive and trying to take notes. This could be improved by setting out clearer structures and 'signposts' in lectures (e.g. noting the key claims and ideas in the lecture at the beginning of the lecture, and noting as we go through each one), or using presentation slides or more clear\/detailed handouts which correspond more closely to the content of the lecture. Handouts right now are often just collections of quotes, which can be confusing for someone who isn't incredibly clear on what is happening in the lecture at the time. The most useful handouts, I have found, delineate the structure and claims of the lecture as well as the sources\/evidence used. One very clear lecture, I found, was our lecture on Skepticism. Very useful handouts that we received included the handout for the Metaphysics (Verity Harte), and our Aquinas handout. These are more useful for reference and understanding in lecture, and are much easier to study with. I believe addressing that this final problem that I have described in particular would help with the lecture attendance problem DS seems to face.",
    "I loved teasing out how interlinked the Western philosophical tradition was. This courses challenges you to think differently and look upon the ordinary and divine with a new light.",
    "The strengths of this course lie in the quality of the material, the knowledge and teaching style of the instructor, and the detailed feedback students receive on their essays. I can only think of a single weakness of this course -- the fast pace makes it hard to catch up. I'm not sure how to \"improve\" upon that though, given the nature of DS.",
    "too much aristotle with not enough guidance",
    "I feel that some works were deserving of more time than they received."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you like DS then you will like this course.",
    "Absolutely I would recommend, the class was fantastic",
    "I would recommend Professor Werner's section to students who are ready to put in a fair amount of their own review outside of class. This is essential to keeping up with the fast pace and being engaged in discussion.",
    "Yes, dependent on their interests. If someone seems like they would enjoy learning about classics or philosophy at a thematic\/broad level, I would definitely recommend this course as an effective way to do so. If they show less interest in these topics, I would think that they would gain much less from the course.",
    "Prof. Werner enjoys helping his students and we see this in his enthusiasm for philosophy in and outside of the classroom. You can easily find ways to incorporate and expand upon your interests in philosophy, if not in the classroom through office hours.",
    "yes, because it exposed me to a different way of thinking and the authors we read are important to  have some understanding of",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Directed Studies as a whole promotes a higher level of thinking that is necessary for professional life in my opinion."
