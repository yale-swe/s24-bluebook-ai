It felt similar to what the real design world is like, so while it was grueling, it was a good test of how things work in the real world.",

                "I really enjoyed the variety of projects that we did over the course of the semester. The class environment was also fun, supportive, and challenging. I think my one area of improvement would be in timing the critiquesthere were many class days where we would spend 20 minutes on three people, and the have to spend 5 or less on everyone else. This really shouldn't be an issue - if there was someone timing for each person, the problem could be avoided and everyone's work given equal class time.",
                "Strengths: Alice is an amazing instructor. You learn so much if you follow her advice. Weakness: Not really a weakness, but the workload is remarkably heavy. But that's what it takes to learn well.",
                "Strengths: projects are engaging, focus on different topics/skill areas and are evaluated in phases/versions, allowing each project to both show off ones learned skills and the growth between/application of critiques. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes projects were overlapping so much that it was difficult to know what to prioritize. Certain projects fell more to the wayside, which was fine, but I believe that having a better-defined categorization system for each project (ie important/will be part of your final critique/stretches all semester vs. skill-building/important but more for internal practice and exploration",
                "Strengths: 1) Alice Chung and Cat Wentworth as a teaching team was awesome. Their depth of knowledge about typography was cool, and they were generous/humble teachers/sharers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) I found the overlapping assignments thing to be difficult to manage, especially in the beginning when I did not understand that many of the assignments are sort of \"warm up tasks\" or \"technique tasks\" (my words, not Alice's) rather than big creative projects. In the future, it might be helpful if Alice distinguished between the big projects (book cover, typeface, chapbook, typography journal, posters) and the other assignments. 2) I tried to do the readings in the beginning of the term, but I found it hard to stay on track, especially when they weren't referenced in class. In the future, if Alice mentioned what was assigned and why at the close of each class, I might be more motivated to do the reading!"

                "Yes!!! If you're willing to put in the time and effort it requires, you'll learn tons. Alice is one of the best in the Art department!",
                "Absolutely.",
                "yes",
                "Absolutely, IF you are willing to do the work. Many of my classmates and I spent upwards of 10 hrs/week on an updated version to showcase for just one class period. Its tough and it requires patience, discipline, and commitment, but it will be fulfilling and interesting the entire time.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this to a student who wants to be able to design their papers in beautiful ways, who wants to be more fluent in typographic convention, and who wants to be more aware of a whole other mode of understanding the world. This class is remarkable in how much it influences the way you see the world with little cognitive effort. It is one of those \"eye opening\" classes that I really enjoyed. \r\n\r\nThe intensity of this class is something to know in advanced. Twice a week you are expected to show new creative work. Falling behind sucks for you and for your classmates, so this is by no means an easy fifth class."
