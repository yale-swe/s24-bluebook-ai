   "comments": [
    "Knowledge of axiomatic set theory, set-theoretic definition of various objects such as the natural numbers, functions, relations, ...",
    "I gained a rudimentary appreciation for set theory and mathematical logic. It was a very different way, perhaps niche, of thinking about mathematics in general, and constructing the entire mathematical \"universe\" as we know it from a few Axioms. I now know I know nothing about this subject, even after taking this course.",
    "Got a total beginners introduction to some ZF set theory.",
    "Got a really good understanding of sets, relations, functions, orderings, etc. Professor Zuckerman goes through the first four chapters of the textbook and develops the axiomatic theory of sets in a very rigorous fashion, building it up from the foundations of first order logic and the basic membership relation. This class teaches you to think in a rigorous, logical way using the formal language of set theory. In terms of the syllabus, Zuckerman goes over Zermelo's set theory but does not go into ZF or even ZFC. While the class includes no discussion of axiom of choice, you get the benefit of deeply understanding the foundations of set theory.",
    "I wish I had learned more set theory than was covered in the course. We didn't even get to ordinals or cardinals. I covered more set theory in two weeks of a philosophy course than I did in the entire semester of this class.",
    "Defined rudimentary elements of mathematics through first-order logic and an axiomatic framework of sets: set operations (membership, inclusion, union, intersection, pair, Cartesian product, power set, successor), relations, functions, orderings, equivalences, partitions, natural numbers, and cardinality. Also discussed Russells paradox and the difference between membership and exclusion extensively.",
    "How to work with and prove things within a rigorous axiomatic theory, how to derive notions like functions, partitions, and natural numbers from fundamental axioms."

   "comments": [
    "The class moves too slowly most of the time. The exams are fair. Prof. Zuckerman is a funny guy who can be extremely entertaining at times.  Only a few psets that don't take more than a few hours to do each. Grading is fine.",
    "Professor Zuckerman was a very kind professor and went through the early parts of the syllabus in great detail, making sure that we understood the basic notation and concepts before we moved on to more advanced topics in Set Theory. Perhaps a bit too much detail, since we only got through maybe 50% of the syllabus (Chapters 1-4 instead of Chapters 1-8), and the course did move quite slowly in the beginning. The lectures were related to the textbook that we used, though sometimes Professor Zuckerman did not make the link to the text strong enough, so we were left wondering how this related to the subject, and other times the proof for a theorem took up the entire lecture. I feel like most of these issues would go away if the course had a more detailed weekly schedule rather than just one outlining the chapters that are planned to be covered.",
    "This course was comprehensive, so maybe its pace should be forgiven. That said, at times we moved quite slowly, to the point that it became difficult to stay engaged with lecture.",
    "The material is interesting, and Professor Zuckerman goes through it at a very reasonable pace (unlike most other math classes at Yale). Zuckerman explains material very clearly and offers the students interesting questions to consider. The workload (maybe five homeworks over the semester) is very reasonable, although it didn't always align with what was taught in class or on the exams. My only qualm is that the class does not go into the axiom of choice, like one would hope a class about set theory would.",
    "This course was awful. Professor Zuckerman went so slow, and did not end up covering any of the interesting parts of set theory. I feel utterly unprepared for any future set theory I might come across. I had to teach myself pretty much all of the set theory I know. The one class we had a substitute professor was the class when I actually learned something.",
    "This course moved at a shockingly slow pace. Of around 30 chapters in the book, only the first three were entirely covered, with a few sections each of chapters 4 and 5 covered in the last few weeks of classes. It really needs to move faster to make the material more engaging.",
    "The course went very slowly, which had its pros and cons. The discussions in class weren't terribly on topic a lot of the time, but the textbook was straightforward enough on its own, and professor Zuckerman was nevertheless able to answer any questions about the textbook material very well when need be, so I didn't mind this too much."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Sure, if you want a relatively chill math class that you can still get something cool out of.",
    "Only if you need to take it for the Mathematics and Philosophy joint major or deeply interested in the subject. Otherwise, the course is quite vacuous and I'm often left wondering what is the point of this class, for the entire subject is based on an abstract universe that only exists in our minds.",
    "Tough question. The psets, first midterm, and lectures will all make you feel like you know whats going on. That second midterm is TOUGH, though, and the final is nothing to laugh at either. You can feel rock solid on every pset prob and everything from lecture, and still not have a clue as to what you should be doing on the tests.",
    "Definitely if interested in the foundations of mathematics. It helps if you've taken first order logic but it's not a necessity. It's a good class if you need an easier math class.",
    "Don't take this class if Zuckerman is still teaching it. Even if you need it as a prerequisite for math and philosophy, just wait until next year to take it. Trust me. I wish I had learned more set theory than was covered in the course. We didn't even get to ordinals or cardinals, never mind the axiom of choice. I covered more set theory in two weeks of the Infinity philosophy course than I did in the entire semester of this class. In an ideal world, this class would be the core of the math and philosophy major. Instead, I learned nothing. And worse yet, succeeding in this class was extremely difficult because Professor Zuckerman had no clue what was going on. He literally introduced the Continuum Hypothesis on the final exam, after not mentioning it the entire semester (even though it's one of the most important parts of set theory).",
    "Honestly, I wouldnt recommend taking this course with this professor. It was interesting material, but the professor moved far too slowly through the course material and focused on the same few philosophical topics throughout the course rather than brunch out to any new or stimulating conversations.",
    "It depends.. if someone is looking for an engaging or demanding course that offers a comprehensive introduction to set theory, this is not it. But if you don't mind a more laid-back course that will still give you a decent set theory bass, it's perfectly find."
