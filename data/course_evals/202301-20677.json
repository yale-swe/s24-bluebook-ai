They do not ask super rigorous questions during the presentations, more expanding questions and if you do not know the answer they will help you out. Another strength is that the class has nice people and outside of the presentation and paper, the workload is not too excessive. One weakness is that we did not get a rubric for how we would be graded in the class. Perhaps to engage students more, they could have one pair of students assigned to another to peer grade their presentations.",
                "Really enjoyed this course! The topics covered were exceptionally interesting. However, I wish the format of the class was differentits very student presentation focused. While I understand that its important for students to develop presentation skills, I would love to have heard from the professors more for lectures.",

                "You probably aren't taking this unless it's for a requirement, but I really enjoyed this class. I think the econ focus makes the class very engaging, and it's accessible in the sense that you don't need to have an insanely rigorous math background to understand what's going on. I didn't know anything about auction theory beforehand, but it's really interesting and I feel that I've learned a lot. I really enjoyed the focus on math research because I had never read a math research paper before this class, and it was great looking into current work that is happening in math and how it's applicable to real life. We also had a guest speaker come who was really cool. I definitely think this is a great math senior seminar to take!",
                "I would recommend the course if you need it for Econ/Math, but probably not beyond that. The course is basically structured so that students teach most of the time, and I personally do not love this, as it reads the material to feel somewhat disconnected, and professors tend to do a better job than students at teaching.",
                "I would recommend this course to people who are interested in learning about the different types of auctions. This is also a requirement for the Econ/Math major so not entirely an option but Professor Bergemann is nice and even though this had an additional paper compared to Math 480, it was worth it to have a nicer professor in a low stress class.",
                "Yes! Especially w/ prof. Bergemann, he is awesome, funny, nice, and a joy to learn from!",
                "Yes, the professors made this class interesting and worthwhile.",
