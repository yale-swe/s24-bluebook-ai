                "Strengths: online learning did not hinder ability to perform assignments, Professor was very understanding with deadlines, learn a lot\r\nWeaknesses: theres a learning curve, lots of material put into the semester so makes it hard to fit in all of the assignments",
                "It is very time consuming, but you get a lot of satisfaction at the end.",
                "The strengths of the course were the tutorials on how to animate, the guest speakers who were very cool, and the breadth of our projects. The weakness was probably organization. Some of the projects earlier on could probably be shorter or eliminated in favor of leaving time for the last two projects.",
                "One of the strengths of this class was definitely the different projects we got to work on and the related works we were exposed to. There were also quite a few cool and inspiring guest speakers who came to talk to the class.\r\n\r\nI think the timing of the projects could be improved since we ended up extending one project's deadlines by a few weeks because of exams and other classwork but the professor was really understanding of the situation.",
                "It was a great class, I wouldn't say there are any inherent weaknesses with the course itself. At times it can be time-consuming (but this is all Yale courses and students enrolling are explained the time factor this in the course description) but at other times not so much, which is nice."

                "Yes, as a beginner to animation, this class was extremely rewarding. It was not easy, but I learned a lot and found the work worth it in the end. It opened me up to new types of animation and inspired me creatively. Professor Rader values ambition and passion more than technical skill which fostered a comfortable and supportive environment for someone like me who was unfamiliar with the programs. Highly recommend for anyone willing to put the work into their content.",
                "Yes, but only if you are willing to put in the time.",
                "Absolutely, this was a great class and I learned so many cool things. It was a good mix of practical skills (editing, premiere, photoshop, etc.) and conceptual skills (artistic practice, developing ideas, etc.). All of the assignments are fun and interesting; definitely recommend for non-art and art majors!",
                "Absolutely! Especially if you like animation and drawing and have the time to devote to it, would highly recommend. One of my favorite art classes at Yale. But be warned about the time commitment! Animation is not a quick and easy task so be prepared to spend hours and hours on projects. But i promise its worth it in the end",
                "Yes, I ended up making some great animation(s) that I'm proud of, and was surprised by my own advancement at the end of the course.",
