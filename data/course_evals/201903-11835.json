   "comments": [
    "I learned more about speaking Spanish in general conversation. I developed my skills in speaking Spanish smoothly and confidently.",
    "I learned to write and read at a high level. I also learned to speak much more fluently than in L2. I loved the application of language to different cultures through readings and movies.",
    "Cemented what we learned in Spanish II and expanded our reading and speaking abilities.",
    "My Spanish listening, writing, reading, and speaking skills all greatly improved. I feel after this class I could have a decent conversation in Spanish.",
    "Increased fluency in the Spanish language",
    "Learned how to speak and understand spanish much more. Past and future tenses, subjunctive, more proficiency.",
    "I definitely developed a stronger vocabulary and stronger writing and reading skills in general. I feel like now, I can pick up Spanish articles and books (none too esoteric though) and understand the reading.",
    "I significantly developed my Spanish speaking skills. Whereas before, I was mainly only proficient in writing, now I am able to read through a Spanish text with the help of just a dictionary and speak at a beginner-intermediate level.",
    "I improved upon the grammar and speaking skills I learned in L1 and L2.",
    "I learned advanced Spanish vocabulary, grammar, and cultural knowledge.",
    "I developed speaking and written comprehension of the Spanish language.",
    "I learned to speak\/write Spanish",
    "Spanish grammar, working in groups, speaking in general, vocab, study skills"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There were a lot of readings in this class that often dipped outside of the knowledge base for L3 Spanish. This made them either difficult to understand and\/or follow.",
    "My professor was the ultimate strength of this course. She made coming to class every day fun and exciting. I'd say the course's biggest weakness is when we read the novel. I wish we would have spent more time on it, maybe up to two weeks, instead of just 4-5 days.",
    "Prof. Tordin was definitely the biggest strength. She clearly puts a lot of time and effort into coming up with creative and engaging activities, and giving comments on assignments and exams. She is a very fair grader and creates a very supportive classroom environment. \r\n\r\nThe course also has a very structured syllabus, which is nice, and generally we move through content at an appropriate pace, but there are some periods where we will have 3 exams in 2 weeks, which I think is too much. I also think that we need two weeks to read the novel, it took me hours to get through the assigned reading at the current pace.",
    "The course itself puts a great emphasis on grammar, but there were many other activities so we often did not review the grammar or vocabulary in depth that was necessary for the exam. The book at the end of the course was too difficult to be read in a week. The book required hours of reading every night during a week when many students had exams.",
    "Strengths: solid amount of work that is not too much nor too little. Weaknesses: could use more oral discussion assignments because the tests are far more geared towards writing and in class answering of the teacher's questions is far too limited to help build conversational fluency.",
    "Too much material covered on the second exam, but everything else was good and fair.",
    "Much of the course goes over the content studied in L2, which is very helpful, especially coming off summer break. The content in the CC was a helpful supplement. One aspect of the course that I struggled with was the novel, which I felt was a bit above my reading level.",
    "Strengths - our homework and reading material was interesting, lots of partner work and opportunity to practice speaking in Spanish\r\nWeakness - the frequent exams were annoying and were often based off of rote memorization rather than testing real proficiency in the language, additionally the essays had too many vocab\/grammar requirements to truly focus on writing a good essay.",
    "The strengths of this course are that it promotes full emersion in hispanic culture, not just learning grammar. Additionally, it exposes the student to a great range of Spanish texts which are not found in a traditional literature classroom. An improvement is that some of the readings were not as engaging as others; perhaps a greater variety in selected genres could help.",
    "The strength of the course is the plentiful number of opportunities to practice Spanish in class and on assignments. The course truly emphasizes immersion and makes sure you are applying what you've learned in assignments involving speaking and writing. A weakness of the course is the lack of feedback on the daily homework assignments--given how many of them you have to do, it is frustrating that the \"Supersite\" does not provide explanations for mistakes.",
    "The course was very interactive but could have benefitted from more concept enforcement.",
    "It would be better to have more outside of classroom low-pressure writing opportunities rather than just all in-class essays"

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It was well structured and a very manageable foreign language course.",
    "Yes! After taking it and looking back, this classroom experience and what I got out of it will always be one of my favorite at Yale.",
    "Yes, if you can take it with Tordin",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they have a love of the language and a genuine interest in learning the language. This course does require a decent amount of time to be put in outside of the classroom, but the course will improve someone's Spanish.",
    "Absolutely! Very fun course, especially if you enjoy building fluency in another language.",
    "Yes! if you want to learn how to speak spanish and read and understand it, its great.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I liked that this class exposes students to more culture than L1 or L2, particularly via Spanish short stories and a Spanish film. Also, Professor Tordin is amazing.",
    "Yes, if you are looking to improve your Spanish, take this course!",
    "If you are a beginner to intermediate student of Spanish, this is a great course to acclimate you with Hispanic culture and learn how to engage in a completely Spanish speaking environment.",
    "A student taking this course due to a Yale College requirement should not fear taking SPAN130. The course for the most part is manageable and will help you hone in your Spanish speaking and writing skills. Like other courses in the series, it does demand a lot of your time, what with daily classes and daily homework. But overall SPAN130 felt more interesting and worthwhile than previous courses in the series.",
    "Yes. My teacher was wonderful and very helpful.",
    "Yes. Felt it was fair and a reasonable amount of material over the time it was covered."
