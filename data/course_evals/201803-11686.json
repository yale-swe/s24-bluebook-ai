    "Scientific paper reading, op ed writing, research",
    "I gained a lot of insight into problems and solutions of global public health through studying the HIV\/AIDS epidemic. I definitely have a better understanding of the way health is handled on a wider scale both in the United States and elsewhere. I also got a lot more familiar with reading and comprehending scientific papers.",
    "As this was a seminar class, this course taught me how to speak in an academic setting about certain topics. I learned a lot from the course material that will help me in the future.",
    "This course taught me a lot about the AIDS crisis and how it affected the global community through many lenses including an examination of the social and political consequences, as well as the science and medicine involved in understand the disease and its treatment.",
    "I learned about the multifaceted origins, effects and solutions of HIV\/AIDS, including many intersections that I would have never expected (with other diseases, with activism, etc). Skills-wise, I learned to look for scientific undertones\/connections in mainstream media and in other classes.",
    "This class gave me a thorough and deep understanding of the HIV\/AIDS virus: specifically its history, mechanics, and the way it has affected the world.  I took away much more in this class than any other class this semester.  Throughout the semester, you learn so much about the history of the virus from its first inception to how it affects various groups across the world. Overall, I left with such a great appreciation for public health and a desire to do more against HIV\/AIDS wherever possible.",
    "I learned more about HIV\/AIDS.",
    "I previously knew very little about the world of global health, and I learned not only extensively about the history and biology of HIV\/AIDS but also how multinational organizations and governments govern their health care systems and drug administration."

   "comments": [
    "Little focus on HIV globally relative to the focus on the US",
    "This course's material is incredibly interesting. The readings are extremely diverse in form and content, which greatly adds to the instruction of the subject matter. I was able to get a sense of the multi-faceted perspectives on HIV\/AIDS and public health through watching documentaries and movies, as well as reading news articles, scientific journal articles, and memoirs. However, class time often took a repetitive form where we would learn from Professor Bazell's PowerPoints and then divide into groups and give presentations on what we had read for class. Classroom time definitely could have been more organically discussion based and dynamic. That said, Professor Bazell lived through and has become an expert on exactly what we learn in class, so getting to hear his insight was a strength.",
    "Strengths of this course include the relaxed nature of the course and the ability to engage with other students.  A standardized quiz system could improve this class.",
    "Especially towards the beginning of the course the evaluation style did not accurately reflect the style of learning and discussion that were emphasized in the class.",
    "The course was strong in its content and in the professor's first-hand knowledge on the subject. However, the format was a bit repetitive and sometimes not as engaging as it could've been where a student or group of students had to present on things we had all already read. It felt like it was meant to fit a lecture, not because the class should BE one, but because its design failed to take advantage of the benefits of a seminar. Opening the class up to all-group discussions or more debates rather than fact-listing would have made it more engaging and potentially easier to retain that information.",
    "The course's small nature (like all first year seminars) definitely allowed for us to form meaningful relationships with Professor Bazell and to feel comfortable talking and contributing in class. Professor Bazell himself was very keen in getting us to talk and participate which made many classes feel engaging and interesting.  The readings were all manageable and interesting, and we oftentimes focused our discussions on them so they were all pertinent to the topics being discussed.  The one drawback was the quizzes he would give every two weeks which were slightly unrealistic in the knowledge we were supposed to recall from specific articles.  However, the structure of the quizzes improved an I'm sure they will continue to in future years.",
    "It could be more organized.",
    "Our readings were very informational and interesting, but my understanding of them would have been improved if we had been able to discuss them openly during class rather than through presentations to the class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Very interesting.",
    "Yes, this first year seminar should be done again due to the intersection between humanities and science that it presents.",
    "Yes, especially someone considering pursuing public health.",
    "Yes, in the case that they were interested in a science course with sociological connections that was not TOO overwhelming. However, I would not recommend it to a science student looking for a challenge.",
    "If anyone gets the opportunity to take this course, please do.  Professor Bazell cares about teaching us the history and importance in fighting HIV\/AIDS.  you leave the class with many new insights in how difficult and multifaceted prevention and treatment efforts are for infectious diseases, and you will have a greater appreciation for public health.  The workload is very manageable too.",
    "I would because it teaches you about the importance of public health.",
    "It is a great class for both those interested in public health and biology and those new to this area of study."
