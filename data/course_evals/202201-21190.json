I wish ART 264 was not a prerequisite for this class because a lot of people fulfill their requirement in the graphic design concentration with 264 and then have no space left in their schedules to consider 265. Actually in 265 you get to learn the same ideas from 264 plus an intriguing introduction to moving graphic design."
