                "Very chill environment! The discussions and lectures were always thought provoking, and the assignment\/grading scheme was reason. A weakness is that some of the problem sets were over the top at first, but they got a lot better as time went on.",
                "strength: interesting topic I had no previous knowledge about\r\nweaknesses: difficult to follow the map of the course through the lectures",
                "Course moves slightly slowly, but content is exceptionally interesting.",
                "This course was taught by in chunks by both Larry Samuelson (econ) and Dan Greco (philosophy), meaning that one prof would teach for a few weeks and then the other would take over for a few weeks. A strength was their knowledge of their respective areas, but a weakness was the way they engaged the class. It was an ~8 person class, but didn't really feel like a seminar because there was so little discussion.",
                "The coursework began too heavy, and since its a multidisciplinary course, problem sets can be a little disorienting as they switch from quantitative questions to philosophical questions. However, the two professors care very much about their respective fields, about their course topic, and about student engagement; they are both really responsive and ready to continue to refine the course with the help of their students. Additionally, both professors are clear and engaging lecturers.",
                "The instructors of this course are, in short, amazing. The lectures were interesting, and I thought that the professors made themselves very available for assistance. I do think that the class would have been more productive if some economics classes (like Intermediate Microeconomics) was listed as a prerequisite, as the problem sets and content in the beginning went super fast. The pace settled down a bit as things continued."

Although some of the class is devoted to psychology\/behavioral economics and philosophy of science, a good amount of it is economics. Sometimes it got pretty mathy. Otherwise, I thought the course was really interesting and engaging."
