    "I developed my argumentative and analytical essay writing skills",
    "Academic writing skills\r\nAnalysis and evaluation skills \r\nDiscussion participation skills",
    "I learned new skills about how to improve my writing style; I found new places where it fell short, and gained new tactics to help improve them.",
    "Developed skills to address academic writing at Yale. Learnt methods to do effective research for papers. Gained knowledge related to the theme of the class through multiple discussions held in class, over the semester.",
    "Ability to analyze complex literature focused on one topic.",
    "My writing, critical thinking, and analysis of text greatly improved during the course. The subject matter as well interested me greatly and challenged my beliefs about genius before the class.",
    "I greatly improved my writing, critical thinking, and research skills all while learning about genius from perspectives I had not considered before.",
    "Through this course, I improved my writing skills in terms of highlighting to the reader what matters, making my piece coherent and easy to read, and analyzing my sources and their content. \r\nThrough this course, I also learned about different definitions, interpretations, stereotypes, and other opinions about the concept of genius."

   "comments": [
    "This course functioned very well. It taught me how to write in a much more refined and academic way, and the in-class discussions were very interesting.",
    "The conversations are very interesting, most students have insightful comments to contribute and I felt very included in the conversations to point out my views. However, it wasn't as much focused on improving the student as a writer over the course of the whole semester.",
    "The course is very strong in that the content it addresses is consistently engaging, and does not feel repetitive from week to week. Discussions are always thought-provoking and help us reveal larger problems in how we consider geniuses in our own society.",
    "The class provided an extremely thorough introduction to academic writing. The various assignments gave me an idea of the different types of papers I could be expected to write and gave me the skills to effectively complete them.\r\nThe fact that discussions were encouraged in class not only made me more knowledgeable, but also helped me improve my confidence and public  speaking skills. \r\nWhile the class did make my writing skills better through multiple papers, it did not contribute a lot to making the process mechanical or methodical.",
    "The course was very fast paced at times and it was difficult to give all of the readings and essays their proper amount of attention. Otherwise, I really liked English 114.",
    "Strength: lots of personal guidance to your writing and allows you to grow as a writer. In-class discussions were engaging and rich.",
    "This course is engaging, and students are encouraged to participate and work their hardest."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It teaches how to write well academically and had interesting subject matter.",
    "Yes, it is a great intro course into analytical writing and thinking if you find the topic of interrogating genius interesting.",
    "Yes. Would totally recommend because of the interesting balance between writing tasks and stimulating discussions.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. If you are considering a 114 or 115 writing class, this is a fantastic introduction to the rigors of a class at Yale through the lens of an immensely engaging and thought-provoking topic.",
    "For a person not experienced in the area of academic writing, I would definitely recommend this course. \r\nThrough its multiple assignments, it gives exposure to the different types of papers one should expect to write at Yale, and provides ample resources and assistance to complete these assignments. This allows a student to understand the work associated with writing a paper in a relatively stress free environment.",
    "Yes! Great class and Professor",
    "This course greatly improved my writing and exposed me to a really interesting subject area that I would have not otherwise have a chance to study. I would recommend this course strongly.",
    "Absolutely a great first-year course to take beyond simply satisfying the requirement. You learn so much that can be applied outside of English class and the small class sizes are a great experience.",
    "Yes, because it is intellectually very intriguing."
