                "I went into this class with absolutely zero knowledge of ancient Greek or any other dead language. Studying a dead language is very different from studying a living one: the immersion factor is largely gone from learning dead language. Replacing this immersion factor is a very, very in-depth grammatical study of Greek to create formulae and patterns in the Greek. I joke often that I don't know how to say \"hello\", but I know how to say \"Demosthenes has sacrificed a goat\". \r\nAll of this to say, GREK 110 has taught me how to study Greek and, more broadly, any dead language. With the more grammatical focus on ancient Greek comes an entirely new skillset. I am now much better at pattern recognition, which has come from looking over sheets of principal parts and noun declension patterns. I am much more open to trying completely new things: reading a sentence aloud to the class on my first day of learning Greek was quite scary! Most of all, I learned that college can be really, really fun when you study what you love. I am currently figuring out my interests but I am pretty certain that I want to go into classics because of GREK 110. I am very grateful I took this class and it is without a doubt my favorite class of my first semester.",

                "This class was very well organized. There was a ton of material to cover and I think Erynn did a great job getting it all in without it feeling overwhelming. Homework assignments were really helpful as were the grammar quizzes and the addition of vocabulary quizzes. The weakness of this course was probably the volume of work but it was to be expected as an introductory language course.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is how flexible Erynn was with our needs as a class. What comes to mind in particular is our quiz on conjugations of the middle voice. The quiz was ubiquitously everyone's worst quiz out of all the weekly grammar quizzes. Rather than barreling ahead in spite of our difficulties, Erynn dropped the quiz grade and gave us an extra week to work on the middle voice, slightly editing the curriculum to backload the content we would miss as a result to next semester. I really appreciate how human this decision felt. Other classes, especially really big classes like in the math department, feel as though they do not listen and accommodate to the students. But Erynn accommodated 100%, and for that I am very grateful.\r\nI can't think of any weaknesses of this course, honestly!",

                "I think Erynn did a really good job of teaching us the basics of the language. The course was very intensive and did a good job of making sure we remembered the vocab and grammar."
