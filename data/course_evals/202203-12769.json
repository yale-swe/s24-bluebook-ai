                "I gained a much deeper understanding not only into the basic concepts we learned in 285, but also saw how nuanced things were in real life.",
                "I learned a ton about material science in this course (honestly more than I learned in my actual material science class). I also got a lot of practice with technical report writing and learning how to make presentable graphs and tables. Lastly, we got some presentation practice.",
                "This course taught me a lot about material science principles and lab techniques. The experiments in this course gave me a solid understanding of various practical analysis techniques, such as tensile testing or nanoindentation, including both how to perform the experiment itself and how to later analyze the data. I also learned how to write a clear and concise technical report.",
                "In this course, you will learn all the fundamentals of material science. In the classroom you will cover all the core concepts. In the lab you will gain valuable experience using the lab equipment and learn how materials are tested in research.",
                "This class reemphasized the basics of materials science that were covered initially in MENG 285 such as microstructure, and causes of macro mechanical properties, and various material applications. Throughout the semester, we were able to explore various material testing methods and eventually had the opportunity to create our own experiment with the machinery used in earlier labs. I also learned how to properly write a technical report, which is a very crucial skill to have in the engineering world.",
                "This course provided a great experience in using laboratory equipment which was new for most of the class. I also enjoyed getting constant feedback to best improve my technical writing skills.",
                "I developed a broader knowledge of materials science. This course builds on Meng 285 with hands on experience and a good overview of the field and applications of materials science. I developed skills with many different testing techniques as well as writing a solid lab report.",
                "This class provides a much deeper and more intuitive understanding of material science, material properties, and material analysis than 285 does, and it will leave you confident in your ability and knowledge. You use many machines and learn generally the techniques of materials analysis."

            "comments": [
                "The material covered in lectures were specific to each lab, which was great for understanding what was happening. The course does rely a fair amount of knowledge from MENG 285, so it should be noted that that class should either be a prerequisite or taken concurrently. The material did not align with the material covered in MENG 285.",
                "The Professor gives you room to learn and grow by your own initiative and allows you to learn by curiosity and research. He takes the time to walk you through scientific reasoning and how to deduce conclusions from scientific observation.",
                "Strengths: you definitely get an understanding of the material as you have to do a lot of independent research to understand the concepts. TAs and profs usually easily accessible for advice on reports\r\nWeaknesses: TAs and profs will not explain concepts to you, often saying you should understand or be researching the material on your own",
                "Strengths: Amit is a great, great professor. He spends real time reading over our assignments and gives us meaningful, thorough feedback which we used to improve our reports. Lectures were also very well done and engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  Honestly can't think of anything significant.",
                "Strengths\r\n- The feedback you get on your lab reports is very detailed and helpful in figuring out what you need to improve on\r\n- Very well designed and organized\r\n- Personally, I had a good experience with the group lab reports. I found it very beneficial to have a set group of people to work through data with and divide the work amongst\r\n- Quick grading and feedback; Professor was always readily available for questions and responded quickly to emails\r\n- Good balance between breadth and depth of material covered\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- Learning as we went worked fine but it may be beneficial to give a brief intro to formal lab reports at the beginning (even though it isn't technically a part of this course, it seems that most students don't have experience with them from prior classes)\r\n- There were things I would have liked to have experiments about, like corrosion and friction, but there simply wasn't the equipment for them and other things. Although not the fault of the course nor the professor, more equipment would greatly aid in the students' learning\r\n- Sometimes the machines are operated for you by the TAs so although you learn about the machines, you don't necessarily become an expert at operating them",
                "Strengths: I think that this course is actually really well taught to foster student learning. Because of the small size and the teacher's teaching style, everyone feels invested in the material and attempts to learn any concepts they don't fully understand. Additionally, I think that the group lab reports are good because you constantly have to be checking your understanding of concepts with your teammates, and it also likely decreases workload.\r\nWeaknesses: In a couple of the later labs, we were not actually playing too much of a role in the experiments. This was understandable given that these machines are very expensive, but some level of undergraduate involvement could have been good. Also this lab should get more equipment!!",
                "The feedback on the reports submitted was always very prompt (generally within 24 hours) and pointed out specific areas for improvement. Moreover, the professor and the TAs were always willing to explain any concepts that anyone didn't understand, whether it was directly related to the assignments or not. The organization of the class was also a strength; the balance of labs and lectures meant that we learned the theory behind each experimental technique and analysis method right before performing the actual lab. Moreover, the fact that each lab report was submitted only for feedback and not for a grade (other than the final lab report) meant that we had more incentive to take the time to fully understand the material without having to worry about the grade we would receive on the report. Compiling the reports at the end of the semester was also very helpful to review the entire class, especially as each concept builds on the previous ones, and correct all of the mistakes we originally made. Overall, this class was very well taught and very well organized; this is likely the class I learned the most from so far at Yale.",
                "Strength: I learned so much in this course that extends beyond material science. I have a much better understanding of the properties of materials, why they are important, and what can be done to acquire the desired material characteristics. I really enjoyed using the lab equipment and Amit was very good at getting us engaged in the material. I feel like this class has spiked my interest in the material science.",
                "This course provides a great window into the world of materials research and allows for students to really see what it is like to determine properties of a material in a quantitative way. Of all things that could be improved for this course, the most significant would be an improvement in machinery. Some of the machines are quite old like the cold rolling machine, and others can vary in their degree of accuracy. With newer machines, the data analysis portion and understanding/processing of that data in students' minds would be clearer.",
                "The strengths were the combination of lab and lectures and the minimal punishment for early mistakes in the course and we become familiarized with technical writing. The weakness of the course was that there often appeared to be experiments that were not able to be run due to lack of lab equipment. I imagine the course would be even more beneficial for future students if lab equipment is added or upgraded.",
                "This course was very good overall. I enjoyed working in lab groups and being able to work with a variety of interesting equipment. In the future I would like to see more equipment available to use, especially for the final project.",
                "This course could be improved by an enhanced budget for analysis devises. The more machines that Dr. Datye has, the more useful and instructive examples he can give to really enhance our understanding of, for example, friction, diffusion, shear thinning liquids, etc. \r\n\r\nThe strength of this course is both how well run and though-out the labs are and the engagement that the course structure spurs."

            "comments": [
                "Yes, especially if it is with Amit Datye. You get proper hands on experience in analyzing and testing material properties.",
                "Yes! You learn alot of useful skill in research and labwork",
                "This class will take over your life at certain points of the semester. Make sure to do your short reports by the deadline and update as you get feedback. It is incredibly time consuming as the formatting and research necessary for each report can be very frustrating, especially when you don't understand the background material for the lab. TAs and prof are very helpful in terms of being available to you, but meeting with them often means they will go on unrelated tangents for a lot of the time and not answer your original question. If you are confused, they will often tell you to do your own research or google it instead of explaining the concept you are confused on coherently. If you're a BS12 MENG major, don't take it; if you're ABET, you have to. Amit is kind of an asshole who grows on you; he starts off very standoffish but in the end you can see that he is very invested in student learning and supporting you as an engineer. This class was incredibly stressful, but definitely learned a lot.",
                "I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in materials science.",
                "I would! Definitely take 285 before this class. It'll be a great way to apply and test what you learned in 285 to better solidify concepts. The workload is very manageable but note that there is some variability depending on the group you end up with. It's more of a class people take as a requirement but I think, more than other labs, this is one that someone who isn't required to take it could enjoy.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. While it might take a little bit of time to get used to the class structure and the teacher's teaching style, you will quickly see that Prof. Datye is a super funny person who is deeply invested in his students' success. He will be jokingly harsh at times and make fun of your lab report for not following the guidelines, but you will quickly learn to take these comments in stride as you become personally closer with him and the class as a whole. As you go, you will feel like you don't really understand much of what you are writing in the lab reports, but in talking to others in the class, I think it is something of a universal experience where towards the end of the course, you start to put the pieces together. Thus, I would definitely suggest this course for anyone interested in mechanical engineering or material science. Even if it isn't required for your major, this course is a super fun way to learn material science and getting a lot of hands on experience in the lab. To be honest, I wasn't interested in material science at all when I started, but I am now interested in doing research in it moving forward because of the course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in material science, engineering, or even any other STEM field. Even though this class covers more specific material science concepts that might not be directly applicable to someone interested in biology, for example, a) there are still many basic principles that could be applicable across disciplines that are learned throughout this course, and b) this class is also an excellent way to learn how to write a clear and concise lab report, how to find more resources about the concepts you're learning, and generally how to get the most out of a lab. The labs themselves were very interesting and fun to do, especially the final project, as we got to create the procedure and entire plan for that by ourselves, and the structure of this class was focused on making sure everyone understands the material, rather than everyone just trying to get an A.",
                "I would recommend this course to everyone studying mechanical engineering. The course is very engaging and I feel like I learned the most in this course out of any other courses I have taken to this point.",
                "For anyone curious about what materials science research is like, I would definitely recommend this course. It allows for a student to get a first person point of view into what a materials scientist really has to do and why their research is crucial now more than ever. Plus,. if anyone is wondering if they would enjoy research as a job or career, this class would be a great chance to explore that interest deeper without as large a commitment.",
                "Yes, it is a great look into research within engineering.",
                "Yes, this course is well run and will be very interesting and engaging for anyone interested in materials science.",
                "Yes, if you have to take it you should absolutely take it. If you do not have to and are willing to fully engage, it will be one of the best courses in the major."
