                "I learned how eugenics has shaped Yale, emergent thinkers, and many academic disciplines. After taking this course I've realized that eugenics has affected and continues to affect so many aspects of society  we cannot separate ourselves from this history. I've also realized the importance of doing anti-eugenic public-facing work that engages with the community.",
                "I learned about how interdisciplinary eugenics was as it started and how it didn't disappear from those fields but sank (or was purposely baked) into the foundations of everything from psychiatry to genome research to LGBT+ rhetoric to body building.",
                "This course empowered me to not only learn about the history of eugenics at Yale but also to contest it! I engaged with a broad overview of how eugenics is embedded across different academic disciplines including music and the performing arts, education, economics, the and the natural and biological sciences. Additionally, I engaged with themes of abolition, reproductive justice and anti-colonial resistance. In hosting student visitors from Naugatuck High School and Bulldog Days I learned more about how to (and how not to) make academic research engaging and useful to the general public.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of eugenics and how connected it is to Yale. It's very upsetting. We also studied the way eugenics is related to a lot of the disciplines of study that people use every day.",
                "Information about the history of eugenics and how to engage in anti-eugenics research",
                "This has been the single most fulfilling and influential course that I've taken during my time at Yale. We learned about the eugenics movement, Yale's role building it, the interdisciplinary and far-reaching implications, and how eugenics lives on today. This course really expanded my archival skills and helped me learn how to navigate Yale's resources (shoutout to Melissa Grafe!!!!).",
                "I learned about the history of eugenics, both in general and at Yale, and how it has impact multiple academic disciplines.",
                "The class offers a very comprehensive survey of the history of eugenics it applies to different identity groups and as it impacts different parts of society. The class is also independent work and research focused, which also students to learn about relevant topics particularly that interest them.",
                "This course has really helped me to understand the continued role of eugenics in my discipline, and pushed me to think about what an anti-eugenic future can actually look like. The biggest impact of this course has definitely been that once it brings your attention to how eugenic thought is still present in practically every aspect of day-to-day life, you cannot unsee it. This course has placed eugenics on my radar in a way that feels so inescapable and enlightening.",
                "We learned about the origins of eugenics as well as its contemporary legacies (e.g intelligence testing, DNA editing, forced sterilizations). A large focus of the class was exploring how Yale was involved in pioneering the eugenics movement.",
                "This class allowed me to take a deep dive into a topic that really interested me, and Im very grateful for that. I learned about all the different disciplines which contain remnants of eugenic thinking and frameworks, and how these things manifest in contemporary ways.",
                "SO much knowledge about eugenics at Yale. Yale avoids so many important conversations and those are the exact conversations we have in this class. there is unfortunately a deep history of eugenics at Yale (the American Eugenics Society was co-founded by Yale professors IN NEW HAVEN) and many prominent Yale professors (econ, med school, etc) in the 1900's were eugenicists. but most students don't know about this and Yale doesn't ever talk about it. i honestly just learned so much about the history of eugenics in the country and around the world and it really made me rethink about how i engage with the world -- there are so many eugenic tendencies that we still seem to value (gifted and talented programs for children -- which have much more to do with wealth and not \"inherent knowledge/genes,\" genetic testing to get rid of disabilities, etc) and it really made me question my own values. furthermore, the course pushed me to not just see things as bad/good. we learned about how eugenicists think they are making the world a better place and how simply seeing them as \"villains\" isn't productive to conversation. instead, professor hosang pushed us to think about the systems in place that foster eugenic thought and pushed us to think about concretely how we can combat eugenic tendencies to instead create more inclusive environments that uplift marginalized communities."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: readings and guest speakers were very interesting; class discussions were engaging and provided many insights; I loved how this class centered public-facing work and provided many opportunities to do so\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish some of the public-facing projects had been on the syllabus so that I had planned for how much work it would be; even though the readings were interesting, we oftentimes didn't get to everything in class because there was so much packed into each class",
                "The course was very well structured in terms of the syllabus and workload. The readings and discussions were all incredibly engaging and harrowing. The guest speakers brought in were also helpful for us to explore different fields of research on eugenics, anti-eugenicist work, and the biggest weakness I think was lack of clarity with sudden group outreach workwhat was expected of us, what counted toward the class, etc.",
                "This course could be improved by decreasing the discipline specific readings and shifting those into recommended reading guides for students' with particular research interests. In place of those disciplinary readings, students could be asked to engage more deeply with primary sources at Yale and local organizing and anti-eugenic contestations.\r\nMore in class time to workshop final projects with Professor HoSang or course alumni could additionally service the longevity of this work.\r\nIn my opinion, writing and reading discussion posts was more valuable than the class wiki pages. If more emphasis can be placed on discussion posts, that can be a space not only for academic reflection but also for personal connections. In Education and Empire, the class is split into Team A and Team B, with Team A writing their posts before class (on the readings) and Team B writing their posts after class (reflecting on class discussion and in response to Team A's posts). Then they rotate. I found this to be a very useful and intentional way of being present with one another, while still maintaining a structure for incentives and accountability for students to do their readings.",
                "It's amazing that this class is offered. I think in future years it would be interesting to have a lecture course for the history and a seminar for the planning about how to undermine the eugenics mission that plagues our society. I think it would also be worthwhile to really plan out how the class will go, though I'm also a fan of going with the flow. I felt a bit confused about my trajectory in this class, not entirely sure what was happening at every moment, and that's okay!",
                "A lot of things came up in the middle of the semester -- wish we had more advanced notice",
                "Strengths: \r\n- A focus on public-facing work that goes beyond the classroom! (Anti-eugenics tour, poster sessions, conferences, etc)\r\n- The capstone projects allowed us to continue projects we were really passionate about and Prof. HoSang was incredibly helpful to guide us to potentially useful resources/sources. \r\n- The vibes of the class were so good. Such a fantastic group of people and I'm really glad to have met everyone! \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Some aspects of the course would work better as a lecture (for example, when we explore the disciplines and their ties to eugenics). However, the seminar format was incredibly for helping us work on our research projects.\r\n- In the future, I think there could be a lot more resource sharing between students! It would help if at the beginning of the course a groupchat is made (in future iterations of the course, we could have an alumni groupchat too to help share what we know!). \r\n- I think having more checkins on our research projects would have been really helpful. It became a hectic race to the finish at the end and I think there's some more structure that could be provided for it (weekly optional sessions at Manuscripts and Archives, optional group research sessions, shared drive of everyone's primary sources)",
                "I think this course would benefit from a lecture + discussion format  it was difficult to go over the readings, listen to student presentations, and have class discussions all in the same class because there was so much content to cover.",
                "The workload for the class was pretty reasonable! This course did require constant engagement but was not overwhelming at all. Professor HoSang was extremely understanding when it came to deadlines, and was very willing to work one-on-one with students as they came up with final project topics, etc.",
                "I love the non traditional quality to it and all the public facing projects; I always wished there was more time. Maybe a twice a week seminar would be good.",
                "Strengths: Lots of opportunities to be involved in anti-eugenics work outside of the classroom, plenty of opportunities to engage with different people in the class, great guest speakers, incredible flexibility with final project, great readings, Professor HoSang is fantastic \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I almost wish the core curriculum of eugenics across Yale and the disciplines was taught as a different lecture class. This class was a lot of work and I think we could have put more energy into the anti-eugenics work if we all had the foundational knowledge going into the class.",
                "strengths: engaging discussions and completely new ways of teaching and learning! professor hosang invited high schoolers to come to new haven and we told them what we learned about the history of eugenics in New Haven and beyond. I've never had a class that gave us the opportunity to showcase our learning like that and it was such a valuable new experience. professor hosang also had us do group presentations and allowed us to create our own final projects which made the course much more engaging and interesting. we also frequently had guest speakers on Zoom (and some in person!)\r\nweaknesses: none"

                "Yes!! I loved how this class focused on anti-eugenic public facing work. In other words, we didn't just write papers and do the readings to complete the class, but we actually engaged with the community and brainstormed ways to make our work more impactful. One of the projects we did was host Naugatuck High School students and teach them about the pervasive impact of eugenics. I helped give the students an anti-eugenic tour of Yale where we pointed out key buildings and professors at Yale that had contributed to eugenic work. Some students also presented work at the Yale & Slavery Research Project Student Symposium in April, which was very fascinating. We were given a lot of freedom in our final project to do what we wanted, which I appreciated as I was able to develop a curricular unit for high school students on eugenics and immigration. As Yale students, it's very important that we expose the way in which Yale continues to perpetuate eugenic thinking and this class helps do so.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to students who are interested in engaging with New Haven and other local communities through their Yale education.

                "Sure! I think it's interesting. Definitely do the reading. That is how you learn! There is a lot to learn about eugenics and a lot to interrogate about your own relationships to it, especially at Yale.",

                "Yes! Every student at Yale, no matter what discipline they are interested in, would benefit from taking this course. By far the best class I have ever taken at Yale.",
                "YES 100%. this course opens your eyes to so much that isn't discussed at Yale and really challenges your view of the world. and professor hosang always finds new ways to engage us: inviting high schoolers to yale for us to engage course material with them, inviting us to conferences and having the keynote speaker (Angela Saini) speak in our class (we also were able to get dinner with Angela at a local New Haven restaurant), discussions in class. this was one of my favorite courses thus far."
