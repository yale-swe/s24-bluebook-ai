Sometimes we ran out of time for discussions or the lectures were rushed and we didn't get through all of the content.",

                "Strengths: Engaging discussions, clear expectations of workload, doable and enjoyable even over the summer!\r\nWeaknesses: Too much of a focus on Morocco, many of the conversations were dominated by the same people",
                "The readings were engaging, and the writing assignments were well designed to facilitate learning. The course was also quite well organized; the creation of broad \"themes\" for days and weeks helped me keep track of the ideas we were covering.\r\n\r\nI don't really have many recommendations. One thing I might mention is that I was excited by Professor Wyrtzen's assertion at the beginning of the term that he loves maps, and would have loved to see even more maps and graphics related to the topics being covered."
