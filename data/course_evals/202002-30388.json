   "comments": [
    "strengths: variety of in-class activities, interesting topics, material was covered efficiently\r\nweaknesses: it was sometimes difficult to apply the material we learned about to our own lives",
    "I think that the course was terrific, especially for it being entirely online. The presentations were thorough and planned and the delivery of material was excellent.",
    "Strengths: definitely easier than taking L4 during the school year, exams still feel relatively spaced out even though there is a shorter timeline.\r\nWeaknesses: the course moves really quickly (like a tense a day quickly) and there are a lot of moving parts in the course (e.g. Supersite; reading quizzes; and optional oral and written practice exams).",
    "Strengths: the course is very organized and resources are easily accessible. Professor Diaz and Professor Garcia are both great professors who have their specific style of teaching. There's office hours two times a week and Professor Diaz even added some extra office hours for students who cannot attend the other ones. We receive clear feedbacks for all exercises even if it's just for completion\/voluntary. There's always more practices if you ask. Weekly conversations with Yelsy provide more opportunities to practice speaking.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there are errors sometimes on Canvas.",
    "Clear syllabus"

    "Not unless they are desperate to finish Spanish",
    "Yes. I felt like I got a lot out of this course in a short amount of time.",
    "Yes, it was a fantastic alternative to the regular semester course and I felt that I learned everything that would have been covered in a fall\/spring semester",
    "Yes! This is such a great way to get your L4 language requirement out of the way. I will say that the tests were a bit difficult, but the class felt very laid back and definitely made me feel so much more confident with my Spanish.",
    "Yes, it was very well organized to grow your understanding of the spanish language.",
    "YES, this is a great course for students who want to improve their Spanish. Sometimes it's hard to motivate yourself to self-study a language, but this course has all the resources you need. The curriculum is developed with the students in mind, and if you put in the work given or more there is no doubt your Spanish will improve.",
    "Yes, I think it was a good course to improve my Spanish"
