   "comments": [
    "Close-reading skills (down to singular words), a better understanding of the importance of specificity in writing",
    "I gained much insight into the breadth of the formation and presentation of poetry. I learned a ton.",
    "I learnt how to close read poetry, and my appreciation for English as a discipline was deepened.",
    "An overview of contemporary poetry",
    "I think I learned a lot about poetry and how to write about it in this class. I think I really have a strong vantage point for poetry now because I read so much of it for this class. I think it was really beneficial for me to learn about how academics have written about poems and poets because I didn't know the level of analysis that existed in that field and I was really interested in it. I also learned a lot about the general cultural things that were happening during the time period we looked at how it interacted with poetry.",
    "Joe made it easy to spend over an hour with a poem that could be as short as a stanza, as he taught us to read deeply into word choice, rhyme, meter, and context. I didn't expect to enjoy this class so much, but I left it with a real appreciation for poetry.",
    "I developed the ability to close read a poem and truly understand all the layers that the poet thoughtfully incorporated into their work. I learned to appreciate the complexity of the poetry and the meaning that can be packed into such a short piece."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is engaging both for folks who have never analyzed poetry and for folks who have had experience doing so. It teaches you how to think about language in a new way, forcing you to interrogate verse on a micro level which then facilitates the interrogation of your own writing with that same level of attention. It covers the classics--Wordsworth, Dickinson, Thomas--but it would be nice to do a bit more contemporary poetry.",
    "The course was a good introductory survey of a few major poets, and I really enjoyed how we dived in-depth into the poetry every lesson. The discussions were deep and meaningful, and I came out of it knowing a lot more about the purpose of English as a discipline and how to analyse a poem than I had before.",
    "Joe North is the best",
    "I think this is a great class. I really liked the reading. I feel like we had the perfect amount, where I read a lot but didn't ever feel overwhelmed by how much I had to read. I liked also that we didn't discuss everything we read because 1) we could go in depth on the ones we did discuss and 2) you still got to read a lot of poetry and get information for essays. I really liked everything about it.",
    "I took this course because it's required for the English major, and it ended up being my favorite class this semester. Joe made sure the class was engaged by starting every class with a go-around of what everyone is thinking about. This created a close classroom dynamic that allowed us to be comfortable going out on limbs and sharing our thoughts with each other about poems. He didn't rush any analyses and made me see meaning in poems that I didn't previously see.",
    "The reading selection is great, very diverse and spans a wide time period which is great for an introductory course like this. However, as a writing credit, I was expecting a little more structured coaching from the professor and more time built into the course to discuss our papers."

    "Absolutely take this whether you are an English major or not! Professor North is a joy and makes poetry accesible to a wide range of people. The class always flew by too fast and, though I hadn't necessarily expected to, I found myself excited to go to seminar each week and even write the papers! You will become a better writer because poetry makes you think about the significance of individual words. I now feel I'm really able to answer the question, \"What are you arguing and how are you conveying it?\" more honestly in all of my courses.",
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "Yes, for sure! Even though it is an introductory course, I felt I learnt not only introductory devices and techniques in English, but also learnt a great deal about why we even study English at all. Professor North always provided us a broader perspective as to why the study of English is important, and it really helped me in framing and grounding my appreciation of the discipline in preparation to take other courses here at Yale.",
    "Yes! Take it with Joe North",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who likes poetry and wants to learn more about it. I would say to be prepared to write a lot and have to be really detailed in arguments because writing the amount we had to about short poems was a challenge for me.",
    "Definitely recommend, Prof. North gives amazing feedback on students writingsuper helpful for developing your writing abilities",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone. It was really engaging and Joe creates a fun classroom environment. Even to someone that isn't an English major, I'd recommend the class, as Joe gives us ungraded opportunities for feedback to assure we do our best in the course.",
    "Yes, I recommend this to anyone remotely interested in poetry. The breadth of authors, time, and topics that we read are well worth it, and you will discover which kinds of poetry you are most drawn to."
