The relationships between the text, the original author, the translator, the readers, the translated language tradition, the tradition of the language translated into, and different cultures. Different translation methods and the rationales behind. How to evaluate a translation. Translation/editing skills.\r\n\r\nTo summarize everything above, I became a better reader and writer, both in English and Chinese (the language I worked with)",

I learned different methods of approaching the act of translation, and also became deeply familiar with the theoretical history of the practice and the various implications of different modes of translation. By learning to pay close attention to the sonic and linguistic intricacies of a text in order to translate it, I also gained a new framework for engaging with literature which I had previously paid less attention to. Overall, I not only learned to be a better translator, but a better reader.",
                "The readings selected throughout the course provided interesting theories that have been present throughout the history of translation, and while we were pondering some of the ethical considerations of translation, we also learned about different approaches to the art. All of this information was directly applicable to the translation projects that we undertook throughout the class. The course readings and working on our own projects not only helped me to learn more about how I read and experienced different texts, but also about how every aspect of language, from paragraphs and sentences down to individual words and punctuation can change how a text is interpreted.",
                "I not only was able to explore Russian literature deeply and learn the theory and practices of translation, but became a significantly better reader and writer of the English language as well. I also took so much from my classmates who spoke other languages.",

Professor Cole's sensitivity to language is MARVELOUS. The syllabus provides a great introduction to the major texts that shaped the world of literature through translation. You read a lot, but it's worth it. Professor Cole and Ryan will help you whenever you feel lost or stuck."

                "The workshops were fun. Some of the readings were kind of confusing, but I think a lot of that was because I didn't have enough background. Professor Cole and Ryan were very kind and willing to offer help/advice/guidance.",
                "I honestly don't see any weaknesses with this course. Even on zoom Professor Cole taught a truly incredible class.",
                "Everything about this course is a strength. The short assignments are very interesting, and Prof. Cole is encouraging and gives helpful feedback. The readings are difficult, and sometimes Prof. Cole references canonical texts that I don't know about. But a lot of times the difficulty and the ambiguity of the text is thought-inspiring, and the humbling experience dealing with hard texts inspires me to read and practice more on my own. Workshops are immensely helpful--especially from the classmates who also speak the same language as I do, people always point out interferences in my translations that I overlook. The midterm is a critical essay on a specific text of translation. It lets me practice my close-reading and translation skills, but it doesn't feel nearly as high stake as a normal research paper. The term-long project--I feel personally invested in it, and Prof. Cole and Ryan are always available for help. Truly, everything is great.\r\n\r\n(not really a weakness but): maybe make this course an 1.5-credit course. Be ready to do a lot of reading and spend extra time every week on your term-long project. Make this course the main course for your semester.",

                "This was a very strong course. The tight seminar structure meant that I became closely familiar with the other students in the class and their literary interests, while the rotating workshop structure allowed for deep engagement with one student's work each week; I definitely felt that I got the full attention of the class when my translations were being workshopped. One weakness of this class might be the high workload of reading; since it was difficult to get the entirety of the reading done, I was sometimes not entirely prepared for class. However, the professor is upfront about the high reading workload.",
                "Literary translation was fantastic--so engaging and so intellectually stimulating. The only thing that might have improved the course was taking it in person.",
                "It was the BEST course I've taken at Yale. Professor Cole is an extremely caring and thoughtful professor. His comments are very rich (like rich rich, he actually gives feedback on a sentence level). You can email him about a single word choice and he will reply with paragraphs about what works and what doesn't. Don't miss this chance. You'll improve as a writer and a reader. \r\n\r\nThere is no weakness to this course."

It lead to a higher level of engagement during our classes and made for interesting discussion. Professor Cole also directed our class meetings with different prompts and conversation tactics (cold calling, asking us to pick each other, asking us to pose questions about reading) all of which encouraged a higher level of engagement on the virtual platform.",

Everything about the way that Professor Cole teaches is aimed to improve our learning and engagement. While the workload was greater than other courses I took it was all useful and fun to do. I cannot recommend this class enough.",
                "Yes yes yes absolutely. This is my favorite class at Yale so far (out of 22 credits). Translation may sound easy but it really isn't, and this class is a continual process of understanding how little you know, and at the same time, how much you can grow. I became a better translator (obviously), and also a better writer, editor, and reader. After all, writing is a process of translating your neuron-encoded thoughts into word-encoded texts, and editing is a process of translating one's own English into another person's English. The process of translation reveals hidden messages in the original and the target languages that is often easily neglected when operated on their own. There are so many opportunities in this class to learn and improve, from the weekly short exercises, to workshops, to discussions, to the final project.\r\nAs a non-native speaker of English, this class also guided me to rethink my relationship with my native language and culture. I won't elaborate much on this point--it will make sense after you take the course. But in short, I rediscovered my passion for the literary tradition of my native language. It almost feels as if I've reconciled with something that has always been part of me.\r\nAnyways, if you're fluent in another language and care about literature, take this class.",
                "It offers the chance to re-learn the languages you already speak.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Cole was an extremely attentive professor whose advice on reading and writing will stick with me even outside the task of translating. This was a fascinating course which not only introduced me to the brand new task of translating, but also facilitated engagement with the new and exciting authors which my classmates chose to translate.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who is even remotely interested in translation, or likes to read in different languages. This course was always engaging and taught me so much about writing and even reading!",
                "Absolutely. Professor Cole is hands down the best professor I have had at Yale. This course will teach you so much as a writer and a reader, regardless of your background or future. This course got under my skin in the best way possible; it has left an indelible impression and will forever influence the way I think about language. If you have the curiosity and the ambition to do lots of work and expand your mind, please, please, please take this class.",
