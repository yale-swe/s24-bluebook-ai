    "I wish there were more summaries and help of all the concepts.",
    "I think the course is taught in a very logical timeline. It first introduces the mechanics of the material and then turns back to applications of these mechanics. One weakness of the course is that it rushes through a bit of how some of the concepts overlap.",
    "strengths: good foundation for multivariable calculus\r\nweaknesses: seems like most students begin the course with some exposure or experience to the content, may be imbalanced for those who haven't had exposure yet",
    "Strengths: the ximera's are extremely helpful (videos + practice problems you can use when you don't understand something \/ can't make it to class) \r\nWeaknesses: Differences across professors in how they teach and what's on the test, psets are too easy compared to the tests"

    "only if they need it for a prereq",
    "Depends on what you are looking for. In retrospect, as an econ major, Math 118 would have been a better choice, but if you are looking into the field of engineering or physics yeah."
