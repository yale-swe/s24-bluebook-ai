I also saw noticeable advancement in my oral proficiency thanks to the frequent in-class debates and reading discussions along with the weekly practice sessions with the Teaching Fellow.",

                "It was a really well run class especially with the online format, everyone was engaged and spoke in Japanese.",
                "The readings sometimes had such a high volume of new kanji and grammar together that it was very difficult to complete and thoroughly understand without spending a great deal of time studying and looking things up. It did help me feel confident with teaching myself even quite advanced words, but it did end up taking hours to understand everything sometimes.",
                "This course helped students thoroughly develop their reading and writing skills through weekly assignments and longer written essays. However, since the  class was held on a virtual platform this semester, it was difficult to fully develop speaking skills and to build relationships with other students.",
                "A clear strength of this course was its use of a diverse set of teaching materials  from news reports to short stories, anime to drama  throughout the term.  These kept each unit fresh and engaging, and allowed students to observe firsthand the differences in formality and vocabulary choice across different contexts and mediums.  Additionally, the weekly one-on-one discussions with the Teaching Fellow were incomparably useful for strengthening oral proficiency and confidence, and learning the types of terms and phrases used in everyday interactions.  An unfortunate weakness of this class was the textbook handout created to accompany each of the materials covered.  Although it introduced a decent variety of grammar forms and expressions, its overall design was disorganized and hard to follow, with some teaching points having only limited applicability to students at this level of proficiency.  This course would be greatly enhanced by either redesigning the textbook or adopting a commercial one.",
                "There was a very high workload but our expectations were very clear. There was a clearly laid out syllabus every week so we always knew what was coming. The class was structured mostly by the reading that we were doing, and the kanji would always follow along with it, so I really enjoyed the organization of the course.",
                "The strengths are the richness of the course material. The weakness is if we could have this course in person."

                "Having everyone engaged and a small class made the class enjoyable. I had a lot of good experiences in that class and learned a lot.",

                "I think this course did well to adapt assignments and presentations to a virtual platform. I think more work could have been done to help with student to student interaction throughout the semester, perhaps with more group projects or one-on-one conversations.",
                "For the discussion-based portions of each lesson, Zoom provided a good platform for class engagement with and review of the materials.  However, breakout rooms were used far too frequently and ineffectively, particularly when students were asked to simply read the text or their answers to each other with no feedback.  In contrast to this, the most engaging and useful teaching moments came when the entire class remained in the main session and covered the materials and questions together, line-by-line.",
                "This class was probably the only class I had this semester that I felt truly engaged in. The small-classroom setting really helped everyone have a chance to participate and since most of the work was reading and doing assignments for homework, it didn't feel too different from a regular semester.",

I was unique in the fact that I spoke Japanese growing up so I didn't go through the traditional Japanese path for classes. This class is a lot different than those because everyone is expected to come in knowing lots of Japanese and the culture as well. I did well because of that, but for other people, this may be a challenge.",

She's incredibly organized and provides really detailed feedback on every single assignment, and she's always willing to meet for extra help if you need it. The course is admittedly a lot of work, especially getting through many of the readings, but I definitely think it is worth it and cannot recommend it enough if you want to sharpen your Japanese.",
