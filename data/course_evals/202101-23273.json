Weaknesses: the course moved quickly through a wide breadth of doctrines, and it was sometimes difficult to trace different themes and similar belief systems through the course.",

The readings were also incredibly interesting. The one thing that was difficult was that, as someone who hasn't spent much time studying philosophy before this class, there was a bit of a learning curve for me.",

                "professor was confusing and material is extremely hard and complex to grasp on its own",
                "The subject matter was interesting but I fo wish we could have had more discussion.",
                "This was an interesting course that spent a lot of time on the details of various schools of ancient Indian philosophical thought. This was both a strength and a weakness--it was a strength in the sense that this is where many fruitful discussions lie and where the schools of thought are at their most interesting. However, this may also be a weakness for some students, because the arguments we learned about were at times very niche/theoretical and may have been hard to follow. \r\n\r\nOne suggestion I have is to maybe re-shuffle the order of lecture. At times it felt like we were diving right in to a highly complicated subject, but grouping lectures by type (eg epistemology, philosophy of mind, etc.) and giving a broad overview of the positions of different schools/of the terminology they use may have helped lecture be more accessible.",
