                "This course was incredible--the first applications English course I feel I've ever discovered! There are no other classes in the English major like this one. This class teaches you what you can actually expect editorial and publishing experience post-grad to be like. You learn the ins and outs of the editorial process from someone who works in the publishing world! It's a must take class if you are considering working in the the literary world post grad.",
                "I had no idea what the poetry editorial process looked like before this class. This was very hands-on and provided the opportunity to read multitudes of contemporary poetry every week and have conversations about how public\/environment\/aesthetics are shaping American poetry right now. I found that because of the volume of poetry I read each week I also developed more of my own taste and aesthetics based on what I liked and didn't like and got to explore poetry outside of the traditional formalisms usually represented in English classes.",
                "I developed my critical skills and got a lot of practice working with others in an editorial and curatorial setting",
                "I learned a lot about the publishing and editing industries of poetry, developed my poetry analysis skills, and sharpened my voice in my own poetry.",
                "I got a fantastic survey of publication through this class, being exposed to the modern poetry industry in a unique way.",
                "I developed a better understanding of what the role of a poetry editor is as well as a deeper understanding of what poetry itself is as a form\/how it operates on a reader. I gained experience with reading as a reviewer for a literary magazine (The Yale Review) and evaluating poetry according to publication standards. I think I also gained a keener eye for making edits and excisions on my own poetry."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths- this course teaches you how to apply the English degree into an actual career path! Hooray! An actual applications english class. Weaknesses- sometimes it felt like the readings we did for this class weren't actually discussed in depth, but that was only because we didn't have enough time to talk about them because we were talking about so many other wonderful things!",
                "Not necessarily a weakness, but an important note: the writing part of this course is quite de-emphasized. There is no workshopping for the original poems you write, and the poems written by students are only shared with the professor. \r\n\r\nOne of the strengths of this class is that it's physically in the Yale Review offices, which immerses you into the project of poetry editorial. There we had guests and roundtable discussions that felt much more like an \"applications\" class than any other English class I've ever had, though it didn't feel overly pre-professional.",
                "This course has so many strengths: excellent teaching, engaging discussions and activities, and challenging but rewarding assignments. I also loved getting to hear from guest speakers, and it would be great if the course could include other speakers from the Yale Review, to get to know different aspects of the magazine. A week on folios would also be another way to improve the course, to incorporate the question + practice of curation as well as editing individual poems.",
                "Strengths: The readings were really interesting -- I loved reading the works of so many contemporary poets, all with their unique voices and styles. Class discussions were also engaging, and I am happy we had the opportunity to talk with so many esteemed poets like Chicu Reddy and Hannah Aizenman. Reading TYR's Submittable queue weekly also challenged my understanding of good poetry, and was really helpful alongside what we discussed in class. I loved that we also got to write our own poetry, while learning so much about other poets' techniques. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had a little more direction or saw a few examples on how to write reviews on upvoted poems in the Submittable queue. Additionally, I wish we had in-class time to read and workshop each other's poems. I know this is a production class rather than a poetry class, but just one class session where we workshop one poem from every student would have been fun and helpful.",
                "this course is a great introduction to the publishing industry, but if you are looking for a class in which you will read and analyze poetry, it is not this one.",
                "I think we could have a more structured class that has certain allotments of time for discussion, editing, and workshopping pieces. Sometimes our time felt more unbalanced than balanced.",
                "The professor (Maggie Millner) was incredibly insightful and hearing her talk about poetry and the editorial eye was a big strength of the course. Also, the hands-on experience of working on a literary magazine as well as hearing from industry professionals was a strength of the course. One area I wish I gained even more skill with was the act of line editing and how to edit\/revise our own poetry."

                "YES! If you are considering working in the literary world, or are just interested in editorial practices, this course is the one class at Yale that will give you a genuine insight into what a career in those fields would actually look like. It meets in the Yale Review offices and is overall a super great immersion into the editorial landscape.",
                "This was one of the best courses Ive ever taken at Yale, and I would recommend it to anyone.",
                "Yes! If you too are mystified by poetry editing as I once was, take this class and learn how it works!",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! If this interests you, take it truly one of my favorite courses I've taken, and definitely my favorite English course I've taken (as a non-major). A great chance for both those who love creative writing and those who don't to try something new, since you both write and read\/edit poetry.",
                "Yes! It gives you such good insight into the literary magazine industry. I really loved being a poetry reader for The Yale Review while also learning so much about the politics and techniques of poetry. If you want to take a poetry class that isn't so intensely focused on constantly writing and workshopping poems, this course is a really good option.",
                "YES! this is a true gut but I also genuinely loved the class. Maggie is fantastic and this is a great opportunity to read and write poems in a very low stress environment",
                "Yes I would! If the student feels like they are interested in knowing more about what life somewhere like the Yale Review entails, this class is perfect to dip one's toe into that world.",
                "Yes; the professor is great (understanding\/considerate and very knowledgeable, well-spoken, and insightful), and the editorial experience is valuable. The workload is also enough to maximize learning but not so much as to be overwhelming."
