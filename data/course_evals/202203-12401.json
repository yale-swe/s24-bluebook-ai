                "lots of support + office hours from peer tutors/TFs/prof, but the problem sets were really time consuming and at times not managable",
                "I get that psets are meant to be long and arduous so that you have to go to office hours. But i still feel they should be less time consuming because most people taking these classes have 3-4 other psets to do, which really doesnt work with the paets of this class that take 5-15 hours a week to do.",
                "Strength: the professor. Weaknesses: the extreme amount of calculus used and memorization of equations.",
                "The class is taught at a very fast pace and the class is often deriving formulas. The homeworks require using the equations and also separate knowledge which we haven't been taught and take an extremely long time even with teaching fellow and peer tutor help. \r\nThe homeworks take about an hour a problem and I think it could be reduced to half of these problems on the weekly assignments or the difficulty of problems should be reduced. It takes far to much time and stress each week on the problems set. \r\nI have done well on the midterm exams, and I still immensely struggle on each weeks problems set. \r\nI think the grading distribution is fair, just the class requires so much time to complete work. By far the most class out of my 4 semesters in college.",
                "This course is unreasonably difficult. The psets problems are considerably harder than anything on the exams. Theyre close to impossible to solve without spending hours with peer tutors each week. The grading is very generous though, which is a big help.",
                "This course was very well taught and organized, from Prof. Steinacker's excellent, engaging and entertaining lectures, resources outside of lecture, problem sets, and exams.",
                "This course is incredibly hard but there isnt anything that can be done about it because it is taken for requirements.",
                "Strengths: Professor Steinacker is a fantastic lecturer. The class was always interesting and she explained the material very clearly. The peer tutors and TFs who were present during office hours and study halls were always very helpful in aiding my comprehension of the material and the completion of the assignments. There are a lot of resources to help students succeed, even if you do not have a lot of previous physics experience. The large weight of psets in the final grade and the ability to do test corrections were really helpful in actually learning the material and concepts thoroughly.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The grading of the tests by TFs was very arbitrary and frustrating. I know of many students, including me, who had to ask for regrades on questions because the TFs ignored where they had written their answers and taken points off, created their own answer keys and marked correct answers as wrong, or other similar problems. I understand that the TFs have a lot of tests that they have to grade quickly, but the number of mistakes being made was ridiculous, especially since the ability of students to ask for regrades was eliminated for the second midterm and is not an option for the final exam.",
                "This course is excellently taught and well structured. The support via office hours and study hall are what makes this extremely challenging and work intensive class manageable.",
                "Strengths: The course is challenging but there is plenty of support all around. Professor Steinacker holds office hours most afternoons, and in the evenings the teaching fellows and peer tutors are readily available to help out with problem sets. Although it has a well-deserved reputation for being an unnecessarily difficult course, the silver lining is that the grading leans toward the more generous side. If you score 90% on the homework it rounds up to 100%, and you can get points back on your midterms by doing test corrections. \r\nWeaknesses: The problem sets, though closely related to the material taught, were often too difficult, to the extent that they hindered our understanding of the concepts. I'm all for an intellectual challenge, but surely a homework question that has everyone stumped and requires the TF to write down the solution step-by-step on the whiteboard is taking it too far. I understand that the problem sets have been shortened substantially over the last few years, but the fact that office hours and study halls are still jam-packed with students every day suggests the psets are still impossible to do without help from the TFs. I don't think the psets need to be shortened -- I would prefer they make them longer -- but some of the questions need to be simplified so that we can actually do them on our own within a reasonable amount of time. If you're struggling with all of the questions to the extent that you need someone to show you how to solve them, how does that prepare you for the midterms/final?",
                "Strengths: Prof. Steinecker is generous with her time and on grading schemes; USE OFFICE HOURS AND STUDY HALLS!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the PSets are genuinely ridiculous - I spent at least 15-20 hours each week struggling through the complex math; I really don't think I left the course with a solid grasp of underlying physics concepts simply because there was such a heavy emphasis on the math and problem solving.",
                "The problem sets are very challenging, requiring you to spend several hours a week in office hours",
                "The lectures are fun and mostly engaging, although sometimes they are too math heavy. Professor Steinacker is an absolute GEM and is definitely a highlight. She cares about all of her students and makes me want to keep taking this class. One weakness would be sometimes the psets took around 8 hours for one week, which was a lot.",
                "Strengths: Professor, Structure, Support, ULA's, Lectures were clear.\r\nWeaknesses: can be very particular in the way she wants you to do it (but not without reason)",
                "One of the great strengths of this course is the number of resources we had access to. The evening study hall sessions with the peer tutors and TFs were great and they allowed me to work with my classmates on problem sets. The office hours were also extremely helpful and helped me understand the material better. A possible weakness of the course is that there is a lot of material to cover, meaning that we very quickly moved to problems that were very complicated, making it hard to internalize and understand the basics of the material and how to apply it to more complicated problems. We just went right to the most complicated things. But, with a lot of material to cover, I'm not sure how much this can be fixed.",
                "Strength: professor is absolutely amazing, so many resources to help with the problem sets, lecture notes are very complete, many additional videos to explain concepts",
                "Strengths: Professor Steinacker is one of the best professors I have had at Yale. Not only is she passionate about the content she teaches (and this comes through in every lecture), but she is such a kind soul. She values appreciating and learning physics over grades, and provides clear transparency on exams. Even though the content was, at times, dry, Professor Steinacker made me care about the material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the problem set questions seemed needlessly convoluted or complicated. On some weeks, I could not go to office hours or study hall until later in the week, but some of the problems required me going to office hours to even understand what was being asked. I don't know that this is a weakness, but it is more a reflection of the difficulty in understanding certain problems. Professor Steinacker, near the end of term, began to clarify some problem set questions at the beginning of lecture, which was very helpful. Grading on problem sets was also very delayed. I appreciated that the answer keys were posted before the exam, but I would have liked scores on my problem sets to know how the TFs graded before the exams.",
                "The lecture notes and layouts of lectures were very helpful as were the numerous office/study hall hours.",
                "Strengths: the professor clearly cares a lot about the class. The lecture notes were always useful and the extra practice questions on the PSETs were great for exam prep. There are office hours or study halls every day and there are endless resources to help you succeed. The opportunity to revise exams is also great for facilitating learning.\r\nWeaknesses: the time commitment is immense. The only way you will be doing well in this class is if you are committing a minimum of 6 hours to PSETs in office hours.",
                "Steinacker is a great professor and really wants the best for her students. It is a hard course if you dont go to office hours or study halls. With that said, the lectures can feel repetitive and might be even more difficult to get to without Steinacker.",
                "I think a weakness is just the large amount of students who need help because it's somewhat unmanageable. A strength is definitely that they have some structure in place for that like nightly study halls.",
                "This course is extremely well organized and was amazing!",
                "This class was very fast-paced and it seemed like some of the p-sets were unnecessarily difficult. They were also extremely long.",
                "Professor Steinacker is the biggest strength; she is the best STEM professor I have had during my time at Yale (speaking as a junior). Her level of passion and dedication is just tremendous, and it is really inspiring to me as a student. She held 10+ hours of office hours a week and extensive review sessions before every exam (we had 4 hours total of review sessions before the final!)? She really goes out of her way to make the course a rewarding experience. She takes the time to really get to know her students in such a large class, which is so encouraging and makes you feel valued as a student. Although people like to talk about how \"hard\" the course is, its challenge is actually a great strength. That said, this course is not mercilessly and impossibly hard because I've noticed that as I put more time into it, I truly do see results in my understanding of the material. The lectures are a delight to attend, and the office hours and tutors are great resources. Do not hesitate to take this course; do not be scared by what you may hear. The course is challenging, but it is really so worth it.",
                "The professor really cares about the subject, but office hours felt disconnected and I felt unsupported in my learning.",
                "Lots of strengths. Good study hall and office hours set up, and exams were representative of what was taught in class.",
                "A strength is the professor because she made the class slightly more interesting. Also, there were a lot of office hours/study halls that were very helpful to attend. A weakness is that the homework assignments were seemingly even more difficult than the tests, but I suppose that at least makes you better prepared.",
                "because the professor is very knowledgeable in this subject, I found that sometimes she went a bit fast. after reflecting, however, I understood why. there is just a lot of material to cover, so it is important to go a bit fast.\r\none of the best things about this class were the demonstrations she did in class. these demonstrations not only were super cool to watch, but they really helped cement the concepts in",
                "Strengths are all of the knowledge that I received. The weaknesses would be the homework. Almost every person that I interacted with in office hours was tired and drained from the homework. Even the peer tutors had questions about the homework questions. Some psets were better then others but every week still felt like a drag to complete.",
                "This course moves extremely quickly. My peers and I have found ourselves frequently lost in class due to the intense amount of content that was taught every day without fully understanding what was happening.",
                "I liked that we had access to detailed lecture notes and lots of office hours.",
                "The strengths of this course are in its peer tutoring and its instructor, Professor Steinacker. She really tries hard to ensure that we are learning the best we can, and takes time out of her day for 3-4 hours every day for after classes office hours! She is so so helpful and really wants her students to succeed.",
                "I think this class has great staff and teachers. This allowed me to fully utilize all resources to do well in the class. However the pace was a bit fast at times and it was hard to fully grasp a concept before moving onto something else entirely.",
                "Strengths: TONS of office hour and peer tutoring hours for help with psets. Psets were really helpful with learning the material and forcing you to stretch your thinking and learn problem-solving skills.",
                "The course has many useful resources, so the learning process was very engaging and interesting.",
                "I thought that the OH of this course was a huge strength. Every week I spent 6 hours in OH with TAs and TFs who were so willing to help students and were extremely useful, not to mention receiving help from fellow peers. I went to one of Professor Steinacker's OHs but did not find them as helpful as the peer tutor/ TF ones. I also think that the lecture style of the course was great. Steinacker went through topics actually a little slower than some of my other professors this semester which was a huge help as it was nice to just pause for a minute and be able to think through concepts. We did so many examples that were useful and applicable which was great. I think that Steinacker sometimes had a condescending attitude with students, but she was also nice to others so a bit more uniformity would have been great.",
                "The lectures were really confusing and I did not like the participation grade because I didn't have a notebook and digital submissions from my iPad weren't accepted. It destroyed my grade when I had an A average on exams.",
                "STRENGTHS: You learn a lot of math and physics. Steinacker is passionate about physics and class feels like a safe space to participate and ask questions. WEAKNESSES: This class is literally so overwhelming. I'm sitting here over break writing this review and I feel a burst of anxiety just thinking and reflecting about this class. Specifically, the last third of the class moves so quickly, and there is literally no time to breathe and really try to understand the concepts. You're just scrambling to finish the problem set and make it to the next week. I think it would be amazing if peer tutors, Steinacker, and/or TFs had enrichment sessions where they reviewed concepts from class much slower and in much more detail. Physics has a lot of patterns, and it would be nice to have these examples worked out a second time and the pattern explicitly said (rather than leaving students to try to figure out patterns on their own). It would also be super nice if Steinacker could also post her examples before class - it doesn't need to be her class notes, but it would be nice to be able to look at the problem wording itself (sometimes, Steinacker forgot to read the question aloud and no one really knew who what we were trying to solve for) and not have to scramble to draw pendulums or circular tracks, and focus on the lecture and the math. I also feel like I have not really learned that many physics concepts - I learned a lot of math and math tricks, but I'm not sure if I have a strong conceptual knowledge of physics. More words and general concepts in addition to the math would be nice.",
                "This course did a great job of covering a lot of material and backing up concepts with mathematical proofs. However, the PSETs were very time-consuming and challenging. While the challenge was important for learning, having the PSETs test our physics knowledge rather than our algebra and calculus knowledge might have helped me them more useful for this class.",
                "Psets are hard",
                "Strengths: Prof. Steinacker was definitely one of the strong points in this course, as her eclectic personality and passion for physics and education definitely shined through. I think that the study halls and office hours were another strong point, and more energy and time should be invested into those (and a bigger space/more organization for both). The review sessions prior to exams were very helpful, and the exams were fair for the most part.\r\nWeaknesses: The problem sets often felt incredibly overwhelming, and not necessarily useful for career applications. While I understand their use in learning the material, some questions felt repetitive, and the bulk of the time spent on it could be reduced without damaging comprehension. I think that also, Prof Steinacker was a weakness, in addition to being a strength. While her teaching was great, and she had a wonderful personality, I think she expected just slightly too much of her students. This was definitely a course where the instructor taught to the upper echelon of students, and expected this to be the only course you put effort into/had time for. This course also NEEDS a discussion section. It's utterly unacceptable that it lacks one, and SIGNIFICANTLY hindered my understanding of the material.",
                "A major strength of this course is the ample resources that it supplies. Students have access to both afternoon office hours and evening study halls most days of the week.",
                "I really liked the study hall hours for this class, they were integral to my ability to finish the psets and understand the material. Prof Steinacker's review sessions before the exams were also really great.",
                "The course material is difficult at times, but I felt fully supported by the many resources this class provides.",
                "Strengths: Professor Steinacker. She is a fantastic teacher who is not only extremely knowledgable, but truly cares about her students. She is also a fantastic teacher. I also really liked how collaboration with peers was encouraged, as it helped me to understand the material much better.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the psets could be extremely challenging and time consuming, and notation could be a bit unusual at times.",
                "Strengths: so many office hours and grading is very fair\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "This course was highly engaging and very well-organized. I found the material incredibly interesting, as there was emphasis on both the theory and mathematics behind certain concepts and formulas as well as their real-world applications. There was an amazing support network in placeProfessor Steinacker hosted daily office hours, and the peer tutors hosted over 15 hours of study hall sessions per week. I found that whenever I had a question about the course material or a problem set, I could always get it answered quickly and thoroughly, which I deeply appreciated.",
                "The course is well structured. The order of topics makes sense and grading is very fair.",
                "The strengths are that there are many office hours and tutors so the engagement with the course is very high. I also really enjoy attending the lectures as theyre always fun. Some weaknesses are that there are no practice exams so I had no idea what to expect what kind of questions were going to be on the midterms and exams.",
                "Strengths: Professor Steinacker is the best professor and best lecturer. Lectures are always very engaging and filled with interactive demonstrations and practice questions. There are so many office hours and study halls so that every student has the opportunity to get help on the problem sets. I thought the problem sets to be very fair and a great way to engage with and learn the material. I always felt adequately prepared for each exam, and had the option to correct each of the midterms. All in all this is one of the best designed courses I've taken at Yale and really prioritizes student learning and engagement. I did not do well when I took AP Physics in high school and did not remember anything so I was worried about how I would manage in this class but as I went through the semester I never felt like I was behind and I genuinely feel like I learned the concepts well and feel very prepared for 181. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No notable ones"

                "only if its a required course",
                "No, I'd say to only take it if you need it for a major requirement and to take the more basic physics if you have the choice. \r\nThis class takes far too long to do assignments and every person I have talked with in the class about this agrees.",
                "Yes. I actually really enjoyed it. Made me even consider physics as a major.",
                "Not unless required. There are more fun ways to engage with physics.",
                "I am a humanities major, and I took this course for a science credit. I would recommend it to students who are interested in physics, not afraid of doing a fair amount of math, and disciplined enough to stay caught up and to take themselves to office hours early in the week to get help on problem sets. This class stressed me out at times, but I enjoyed it greatly and am very proud of and satisfied with my experience.",
                "No, PSETs are very difficult and it is incredibly hard. Only",
                "Yes! Especially if you are a STEM major (even if your major is not super related to physics). Professor Steinacker is great and there are a lot of resources to help you succeed in this class (even if you don't have a lot of physics experience from high school). The workload was high and it was necessary to attend office hours for several hours each week to complete the psets, but it meant that I had a thorough understanding of the course material.",
                "Yes, if needed",
                "If you are a pre-med student, I DO NOT reccomnend taking this class. Although I was able to learn a lot of basic physics, I found the rigor of this course to be unreasonable. I spent 10+ hours each week on PSETS which did not even include time spent reviewing material, going to office hours, and studying for midterms. The math and analytical skills required for this course are extremely difficult to attain if you do not have a strong background in calculus or physics. However, if you're up for the challenge, there is a lot of support and aid available to you wether it be TAs, peer tutors, or Professor Steinacker. If you are a pre-med student, I reccomend taking PHYS 171 instead as you'll be able to learn physics and still have time to dedicate to your extracurriculars.",
                "It depends on who you are and what you want to get out of it. If you're a pre-med student/life sciences major I would recommend you take Physics 170 instead -- the concepts are more applicable to your future career. If you're thinking of studying engineering, and you've got several years of high school/pre-college physics under your belt, this course is definitely doable, even if the psets are sometimes really difficult -- Physics 180 is still your best bet. For the prospective physics majors out there, you should take 200/260, but if that's too hard, you can always drop to 180, and you'll probably have an easier time understanding the concepts. If you're someone who has never done Physics in high school, take a different class. I took three years of Physics and still spent a lot of time in office hours/study hall, so if you're looking for an introductory Physics course, please don't take this class. The catch-22 is that this is the only introductory physics class available so you'll have to take it anyway -- unfortunately Yale doesn't do a great job investing in STEM which means that it hasn't set aside funding to set up a more basic physics course for non-STEM majors.",
                "Only if you really like physics or have to take the class for a major requirement",
                "Absolutely! I love Professor Steinacker and think this class is a good introduction to physics. I would definitely recommend having a strong calculus background though, since you need to differentiate and integrate frequently in 180. Also GO TO OFFICE HOURS they are fun and so so helpful for the psets.",
                "Do not take this course if you have taken AP Physics C, if you have you should definitely take PHYS 200 or 260. \r\nOtherwise yes, the professor is very good and there is tons of support. You will definitely learn physics and how to better approach STEM problems from this class, especially if you are an engineer.",
                "Yes. This course is a good introduction to physics and Professor Steinacker is a great teacher. She will challenge you to do your best.",
                "Yes! I have never learned so much about a subject in such a short period of time. I feel like I have strong bases in physics, would highly recommend.",
                "if they need the course, yes. if not, don't take it. it is hard.",
                "Absolutely, especially if it is taught by Professor Steinacker. This course is a prerequisite for many STEM majors, but I implore those choosing between PHYS 170 and 180 to go with 180 if it is taught by Professor Steinacker. It is more difficult, but her test corrections and general philosophy about learning physics make it a relatively low-stress environment for a majority of the semester, and she is one of the kindest professors I have had in my life, period. Over the semester, I also found that I became more comfortable tackling difficult physics problems, and that was all due to her teaching style and problem set structures. This course is great if students want to learn physics and become better critical thinkers.",
                "Sure.",
                "If you have to fill a physics requirement this is definitely the course to take. It covers the topics you need and isnt too soul crushing.",
                "Yes because it's foundational and interesting while also being challenging.",
                "Yes if you have the time and are willing to put in the work for it. This course is extremely challenging. Both the Psets and the exam require significant effort, time, and preparedness.",
                "I would only recommend this class if it is required (it is ridiculously time consuming)",
                "Yes, do yourself a favor and take this course over PHYS 170 or PHYS 200. You will reap the rewards of the work you put in, and Professor Steinacker is an incredible professor and person. Her passion, dedication, and energy are unbelievable. The course also has a strong support system. Don't miss out on this opportunity to learn physics and grow as a student (and person!). I am sure I'll remember this course long after I have graduated.",
                "Yes, if you're a student that has to take physics. The professor is passionate and cares about physics. Be prepared for lengthy psets.",
                "I would. Physics is cool and you gotta take it with Steinacker.",
                "Maybe if you are interested in physics, but you have to be willing to put in a lot of work and solve very difficult problems.",
                "only if you have to take it for your major",
                "If you need to take this class as a prereq, take it . If you want to take it for fun, dont take it. The workload is a lot and its face paced so dont put yourself through the stress.",
                "I would recommend this course for those who are required to take it, but if you are not required to take this course, do not take it.",
                "Yes!",
                "I know that students have to take this if they are pre-med or exploring that field (like me) but I genuinely learned to enjoy physics and the methodological basis of it all. I especially liked the applications of calculus to the topics. I would recommend this course if Professor Steinacker is teaching it, she really cares.",
                "Yes, this is a great class for anyone interested in physics. It's a tough class, but provides you all the tools you need to succeed and gain a very strong understanding of classical physics.",
                "Would recommend to anyone considering a STEM degree who enjoys challenging math and problem solving! The class is really rewarding if you're able to keep up and master the content because you will learn how to handle very complex situations and break it down into familiar pieces.",
                "Yes, I would strongly recommend this course because you have the opportunity to learn solid and rigorous Physics concepts useful for later courses in college, while engaging and having fun with your peers in lectures, study halls, or office hours.",
                "I would recommend this course if it were required--I think it is great for students to take but if you had taken AP Physics in high school I would say that it is unnecessary. I also think that it is a hard science credit for someone who just needs to fulfill their distributional requirements. However, if someone wants to be intellectually challenged and has hours each week to dedicate to assignments, then this course is for them.",
                "It's a lot of work, so i am not sure if I would.",
                "Gosh this class is super overwhelming. You'll learn a lot, but you'll be stressed and overwhelmed and pushed to your breaking point to get there - you decide for yourself if that's worth it. There really ought to be a level of introductory physics between \"physics for life sciences\" and PHYS180. The math and concept applications are so specific, complex, and detailed, and not everyone needs to have this degree of rigor in their physics training. If you're pre-med, strongly consider NOT taking this class (esp. if prof Demers, a new professor) is teaching it. And, DO NOT take this class at the same time as another high workload class (like organic chemistry).",
                "Yes, I would if they are interested in physics, medicine, biology, or chemistry because the concepts apply to all of these fields.",
                "Yes but it is hard",
                "If you feel that you have a significant amount of time per week to frequent upwards of 6 hours of office hours a week, then yes. Otherwise, unless you are an engineering/physics major, take 170. I think the push for taking this course in the past was Steinacker's strengths in teaching relative to the previous 170 professor, but now, with Prof. Demers teaching, I'm not sure if Steinacker's prowess is worth it for the increase in difficulty, time, and potential decrease in grade. I think it was an interesting way to learn with others, and I'm not sure if I've ever frequented office hours like I did for this course in the past. The exams are fair I suppose, but you do need to go to the review session to have an idea of what will be on it, otherwise, you'll be disadvantaged compared to other students. I said it elsewhere, but this course NEEDS a discussion section. I felt really lost at times and there wasn't a smaller space for me to discuss it since office hours and study halls were often PACKED.",
                "Yes! This course is not for the faint of heart, but the challenge is worth it. This course instills perseverance in a beautiful way, and it is almost guaranteed that students will observe personal growth by the end of the course.",
                "I really don't know if this course or PHYS 170 was the better option. Its a hard class unless maybe you've had a good amount of experience with physics concepts beforehand. Not super suited for people who have no physics background, it moves fast, and is more focused on the math than getting people to actually understand what's going on in physics. Also the weekly homework take so so so long (I was in office hours 10-15 hours a week), and feel like tedious tasks rather than reinforcing fundamentals. Take if you have to.",
                "Only if physics is necessary.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this over 170 as well. Steinacker just makes this class a true experience, but it wont be easy.",
                "I would recommend to another student if they are interested in physics. I personally would not take this course simply for the sake of fulfilling a science/QR credit, simply because it is an intro-level course, but I highly recommend taking a course taught by Professor Steinacker",
                "Yes, absolutely. Made me enjoy physics after having an awful experience in high school. If you put in the work, you will feel good about your performance in this course!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to students who want to further their knowledge of physics. I think it is helpful to come into the class having taken an introductory physics class in high school, but as someone who hadn't taken AP Physics, I was definitely able to follow along throughout the course. The material can seem abstract at times and the problem sets can be difficult, but I found the course to be an incredibly rewarding, exhilarating academic experience. It truly made me appreciate physics in a completely new way.",
                "I would only recommend this course to students who are aware of the workload. The homework assignments do take a considerable amount of time.",
                "Yes I would, but prepare to attend office hours more than 2 times a week every week.",
                "Yes. While the workload for the class is intimidating, it is very conducive for a student to grow their understanding of physics. Love professor Steinacker too!",
                "Yes. If you are pre-med and have taken calculus and are trying to decide between 170 and 180, take 180. Professor Steinacker is the best lecturer at Yale and the class is very well designed. There's always the option to switch to 170 before a certain point in the semester, so if you have the necessary math background (integral single-variable calculus is essential) I would definitely take 180."
