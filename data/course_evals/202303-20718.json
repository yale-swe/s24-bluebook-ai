                "Learned about the contemporary situation of contemporary Germany, such as refugee crises, discrimination, right-wing extremism. Skills: practiced speaking and writing in German, some grammar, and vocab building.",
                "My german conversational skills improved by a lot",
                "I learned about German history as it relates to immigration, racism, and colonialism, though the focus of the class seemed to be less about content and more about improving German skills for this level. I learned more about higher level grammar concepts.",
                "In addition to the speaking/reading/writing/listening skills that would be practiced/improved in any L5 German class, the following topics were covered:\r\n Recent refugee crisis in Germany (e.g. Syrian, Ukrainian, etc.), the refugee experience in Germany\r\n Current German politics/rise of the AfD (in slightly lesser detail, though I didn't mind)\r\n Afro-German Culture/History\r\n German Colonialism\r\nI probably gained the most insight into German history and politics during the refugee/German colonialism units; in both such units, class material was both diverse (e.g. some films, primary/secondary readings, etc.) and highly engaging.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: low-stakes environment to practice German, timely feedback from instructor on all assignments, continuous exposure to language in different forms of media (films, documentaries, news articles, and a book). Weaknesses: it is a course to practice German but it is up to the individual student to use it as a way to also improve their skills.",
                "The strength is how much room there is for conversations with professor and peers.",
                "A strength of the class was the various types of assignments and how we were exposed to German books, movies, and news articles. However, there was less speaking practice than I would have liked. It might be better to format a class like this so that the students feel like they're having a discussion with each other, rather than just talking to the teacher.",
                "Strengths: 1) Liese is a knowledgeable and approachable professor. 2) Course materials were always organized. 3) The integration of new vocab into topic-focused units was an engaging way to improve my ability to talk about more niche topics in German politics/history. 4) Especially towards the end of the course, the material was, for the most part, quite interesting to discuss (e.g. Der vermessene Mensch).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) Class felt a bit repetitive sometimes, especially when we read the one novel covered in the curriculum. During that unit, vocab practice and fact-focus reviews of the assigned chapter often took up the majority of class, even when it seemed that most students had, for the most part, understood what had happened. I would've appreciated a bit more time for analysis of the book and historical context.",

                "Yes, if looking to practice German in a low-stakes environment and/or if interested in current political topics in Germany. You get as much as you put in the course. Some assignments can be pretty long or repetitive, but overall helps with engagement in class.",
                "Yes! Great way to learn more about German society and to practice your oral German skills",
                "I would recommend to people who want to learn a bit more about this part of German history but are mainly interested in improving their theoretical understanding of German.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in improving their German historical/political vocabulary and/or learning more about often overlooked aspects of German history (e.g. recent refugee crisis/Afro-German history and culture/German colonialism).",
                "Yes if you are looking for a manageable but still very interesting German course!",
                "No - there wasn't much focus on developing language skills (despite the fact that even though it was an L5 course only one person in the class was anywhere near fluency). Maybe that would have been ok if there was instead a heavy focus on the course's content (refugees, immigration, racism, etc.), but these were taught poorly and not in depth. This course isn't helpful for learning German and doesn't teach you much about its main topics. The classroom activities are also generally dull - just answering questions about the content of homework readings or videos we'd watched in class."
