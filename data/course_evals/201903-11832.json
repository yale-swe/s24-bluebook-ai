    "I concretized my grammar skills and writing skills throughout the course, which were two areas I needed to improve.",
    "My Spanish speaking skills are much better after taking Spanish 130 with Professor Reymundi. The way the class is taught, the grammar stays with you. I catch myself thinking about using the correct tenses and structure as I am speaking it.",
    "I improved my fluency with speak, writing, and reading Spanish. I learned many new grammar rules and now feel much more comfortable with the possibility of doing time abroad in a Spanish-speaking country.",
    "Basic Spanish grammatical skills and vocabulary knowledge; became more comfortable speaking and writing in Spanish; learned how to analyze long form\r\nSpanish texts",
    "I learned more culturally about Spanish speaking countries as well as grammar and vocab that could be used in everyday conversation.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of Hispanic cultures and histories around the world, and greatly improved my Spanish language skills.",
    "d",
    "I gained more confidence in constructing complex sentence structures in Spanish.",
    "I learned a lot of Spanish  my grammar and reading comprehension improved dramatically and my speaking is on its way."

   "comments": [
    "The straightforwardness of the class, and how well planned out the course schedule was.",
    "Great course. Everything is taught at a great pace. I did not feel under prepared for a single test. If you show up and pay attention in class, do all the homework, and study for the exams, you will do good. Also, Professor Reymundi does such a great job making sure everyone in the class understood the material before moving on. I highly recommend taking this class with her! She is not only an amazing person, but also an amazing professor.\r\nThe one weakness of this course is I wish the novel was spaced out over a longer period of time. It felt like a lot to read in a week.",
    "Strengths: Very well-organized and engaging material (specifically the movie)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Moves very quickly from a very rudimentary level to more advanced grammatical concepts",
    "I liked the use of music and music videos to engage the class. The clear structure was very helpful for scheduling purposes.",
    "Strengths: very immersive. The class is every day and completely in Spanish.\r\nWeaknesses: moves very fast. I had difficulty grasping some of the grammar concepts as we would move on the next day in class.",
    "Im skipping everything to say my  L3 spanish class with lissette reymundi was great, great professor, great organized curriculum. The only bad thing was reading and answering questions about 40 pages of a spanish book every night for a week was very difficult. Overall, everything else was amazing.",
    "Strength:",
    "I think that it moves quickly and efficiently through the grammar, teaching a lot while explaining thoroughly. This pace meant we learned a lot, but it was at time a little fast which meant I had to review a lot on my own. A real strength are the in class discussions. A weakness is that the assessments all tended to be very close to each other, with long berths of time where no tests or quizzes happened. I think they could be better spaced out."

   "comments": [
    "Yes - if you are learning Spanish, it is a crucial step to take.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course to another student because it greatly improves your Spanish speaking and writing skills. By reading 3 short stories per lesson, an entire novel, and watching a movie, in combination with in-class essays, this class lets you apply what you have learned in practical ways.",
    "If someone is very dedicated to learning Spanish then I think this is a great course. However, it is definitely demanding.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who is interested in not only the spanish language, but the culture of Spanish speaking countries.",
    "Yes. It is a good course for any intermediate-level Spanish language student looking to improve.",
    "d",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, especially if taken with Professor Reymundi.",
    "I would! It is a good class to transition to college level language evaluation. It is work intensive, but very informative."
