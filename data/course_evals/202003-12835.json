We got the scientific background (and often did our own calculations in the problem sets, which was cool) on some controversial topics like fracking and methane leakage during natural gas production. We had a really interesting final week discussing energy transitions and the viability of carbon capture and storage. In terms of science skills, the focus is on unit conversion skills, ability to balance scientific equations and name the chemical formulas for simple hydrocarbons, solve equations with algebra, and identify geologic traps on a map.",
                "I learned a lot of relevant facts about fossil fuels, such as how they originate, how their sources are identified, how they are extracted and processed, and how they are finally used to provide energy.

                "Weakness - grading system",
                "Strengths - Prof. Oristaglio has this course down to a science (pun intended). Very passionate, extremely knowledgeable, the course across the board was excellently administered.\r\nNo weaknesses really.",
                "Strength: interesting material, knowledgeable professor, well organized course and lectures, always knew what was going on, manageable workload.\r\nWeakness: Didn't have the passion or charisma that the best yale classes have, no sense of community, perhaps because of zoom recording...",
                "One weakness is that the help sessions for problem sets are very very helpful and almost guarantee a perfect score, however, if you aren't available at the time when they are held you're out of luck. You could email them specific questions, but it's much harder to get the same level of assistance\/clarity via email. Especially with this course being offered asynchronously, the help sessions are sort of an unfair advantage for people in certain time zones\/able to participate synchronously.",
                "Strengths: On the whole, problem sets are really great, especially the ones that involve making calculations around emissions related to methane leakage, oil spill, energy use in China vs. US interesting. They often tied directly to emissions and fossil fuel combustion, and being able to do my own calculations to estimate carbon emissions at Yale, for example, was really rewarding. Plus, I appreciated that the grading weight is on the problem sets, rewarding consistent engagement and participation, and less so on the two exams; second half of course on fossil fuels and environment is relevant and most interesting; engaging lecture slides with cool charts and graphics; Professor Oristaglio is kind, willing to help during the Zoom study sessions we had to walk through problem sets. Weaknesses: Middle half of course on petroleum\/coal geology and the world's fossil fuel endowment felt slow and not as applicable to me. I wish we had really focused on environmental consequences\/emissions and less on the origins of fossil fuels and geology. Lectures occasionally felt too broad with way too much granular detail. I sometimes had a hard time sensing what was most important and what was going to be tested on exams.",
                "In my opinion, this course didn't really have any weaknesses. I took the class to learn about fossil fuels, world energy, and climate change, and that's exactly what I did. Professor Oristaglio did an excellent job teaching the course, and I don't think I could have expected much more from any other instructor.",
                "I though the lectures and ppts were very comprehensive and taught exactly what was stated in the syllabus. The course was well organized overall. The psets were fair and taught me to think about the role that fossil fuels play in our lives everyday. I think a weakness was how the grading worked. It made me worry about every single point that could be lost (pset, midterm, final). If you lost 7 points or more, there was no way you could get an A in the class unless you got extra credit points during lecture.",
                "Strengths: I thought the problem sets were all very unique and challenged us to conduct independent analysis and to form original thoughts. Problem sets were extremely manageable, interesting to do, and we had ample time to complete (two weeks per problem set)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: problem sets didnt seem to prepare well for exams. There were sometimes weak connections on some material between what was studied in problem sets vs what was being tested on in exams. With lectures recorded and the exams being open notes, this was somewhat easy to overlook during exam time, although averages on exams were somewhat rough. Regardless, I wouldnt change the problem sets, those were the best part of the course",
                "I liked the course flexibility. I thought the exams, especially with the canvas format, were very fast paced, and I would have preferred to have printed them out and done them on paper, so it would be easier to check work or skip around questions."

Considering, the mean midterm score was 10.8\/15 unless you are prepared to attend office hours and hw sessions to ensure you get maximum points on the homework.",

                "Yes. Perfect for a real, but entry-level SC credit (manageable for a non-STEM major, but also not a gut that feels pointless). I am a non-STEM major and this was only my second SC credit at Yale, but I really enjoyed the course and am interested in learning more about energy now. I entered the class with a vague interest in climate change, but more just expecting to make it through the course to get my SC credit. I left with a real interest and am hoping to take another course on energy or carbon emissions, even though I don't need the SC credit anymore. I saw this in reviews when I was shopping, but just a warning to anyone that this is a fossil fuels course, and you talk a lot about fossil fuel origins and geology, even though I personally find the intro to the course (world energy use) and the last half\/third (emissions and environmental consequences) more interesting.",
                "I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone who is either simply curious about fossil fuels, the ways in which the world uses its energy, and climate change, or who is, like me, eager to learn ways to fight climate change, which necessarily requires having some background information about the current state of world energy production and consumption.",
                "Taking this class is a way to learn about fossil fuels from an expert, without having to spend hours and hours on assignments. For the amount of work you put it, you will gain proportionally way more than you would from other science classes at Yale. In addition, Professor Oristaglio is wonderful! He really cares about his students, and his lectures are always interesting.",
                "Yes, it is important to understand how the energy sector is shaped by the science of fossil fuels--especially if you want to do public policy work or do anything related to the energy sector. Since fossil fuels will play a large global role in the next few decades even as we transition away from it, I think this is a really relevant course. Professor Oristaglio is also only of the nicest and understanding professors at Yale.",
                "I would absolutely recommend! It was really interesting to learn about the entire fossil fuel system, from its origins, geology, extraction, use, and impacts. Professor Oristaglio is also very knowledgeable and clearly invested in his students & teaching. The class also challenges you to think originally, which is always fun. Overall a very pleasant experience, super manageable, and  a great chance to learn!",
                "Yes! I liked how everything we learned was so relevant, and how we used science, economics, and math to inform written responses about possible pathways countries could take to reduce carbon emissions, etc"
