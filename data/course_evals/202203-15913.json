Professor Ramos Zayas is incredibly insightful, and her expertise in the field really shines through in class. She put a lot of thought into the structure of the class, and did a fantastic job curating a syllabus for this semester.  The assignments were also markedly different from other ER&M classes I have taken, and were very much hands-on.",
                "Strengths: professor is knowledgeable, passionate, and great at cultivating a comfortable and productive discussion setting\r\nWeaknesses: more clarity around whether it is in fact a graduate course, like just putting a statement on the syllabus maybe saying that (rather than saying it implicitly by saying graduate students will also be in the class)",
                "The course was taught perfectly. We read a wide range of readings, which allowed us to learn about Latinx ethnography through a variety of lens. The work, specially the oral histories and the box inventories, we did felt incredibly meaningful and impactful to the documentation of Latinx people at Yale. The reading responses were doable and the final paper was incredibly fun to write as we were given free will to write about whatever we wanted. Great class!"

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student especially if you are a Latinx student at Yale who would like to learn more about the histories and legacies of people who were here before. Even if not, ethnography is a useful tool that helps you understand the world and its racialized populations.",

Professor Ramos-Zayas is an incredible professor who really knows what they are doing and how to best teach and help her students. 10/10 class!"
