Would recommend this class to anyone interested in pursuing research in the future as it is what I image a Yale bio class to be - research focused and producing something novel, not memorization like MCDB and MBB",

                "The course was really disorganized, but I'm not sure how much of it had to do with the content organization versus just the technological difficulties.",
                "Weaknesses: The lecture format can be more engaging. More feedback on exams can be given in a more timely manner.\r\nStrengths: Interesting topic, welcoming of students of somewhat varying scientific backgrounds, professor Fahmy really cared about the material and was approachable.",
                "Strengths: Fahmy is incredibly passionate about immunology and really cares for his students. The final project is the highlight of the course as we are encouraged to come up with innovative solutions along with experimentation that we would perform to test our solutions. \r\nWeaknesses: There were quite a bit of technical difficulties (which quite frankly are out of Professor Fahmy's control). I wish there was more of a focus on the real-world applications\/treatments\/solutions in immunology as in my opinion, that part of the course was a lot more fascinating and engaging.",
                "This course really could have used a TA. I (and many others in the class) got very few assignments back and the class seemed pretty disorganized in general. I was also a little frustrated that we didn't discuss the extremely relevant COVID-19 vaccine race more. The class topics sometimes felt a little random and disjointed.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- interesting material\r\n- very relevant material \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Slides have very little written descriptions\r\n    - Hard for visual learners when diagrams have no axes, or no text\r\n- Lecture videos arent available to watch later\r\n    - Lectures were supposed to be posted, but for the few lectures that were shared, links were sent very late, links dont work, professor didnt respond to email requesting new links.  Later lectures were not even posted at all. \r\n- Lecture slides were posted late and are confusing\r\n    - There are many decks with replicates of slides -- very disorganized \r\n    - later slides were not even posted \r\n- Sometime spends the first 20 minutes on the first slide (or no slide) just unstructured talking\r\n    - Interesting, but VERY difficult for more visual learners, and without lectures posted afterwards, its hard to go back to that monologue \r\n- Professor has sent emails a few minutes before class with information, moving class by 10 min, cancelling class, etc. (this happened multiple times)\r\n- Exam started 10 min late but still ended on time (even though the announcement said that exam would be posted 1 min before class)\r\n- Class ran late almost every day by at least 5-10 minutes (even though the professor was very apologetic)\r\n- Professor could use some organizational help in posting lectures, recordings, home-works\/quiz results, etc. \r\n- Well have homework and quizzes due, but no available resources: the lecture notes and readings are not yet posted, so were basically blindly completing the assignments\r\n- The final project is a huge part of the grade, but the professor wasnt responding to meeting with our team to finalize a topic.  Then we ended up sending in an abstract anyways, but we never got any confirmation or feedback with the presentation a few days away \r\n- The professor multiple times promised to get in grades for quizzes, oral presentations, homeworks, etc. and NEVER delivered on time.  It's fine if it wakes a few days to grade properly, but not good to promise multiple times to send grades on a specific date only to push it later.  Towards the end, if the professor said something would be available to us, I just wouldn't even believe it. \r\n- I can understand if its a class or two, but there were sustained technical difficulties even towards the last week of class.",
                "The material was great and the assignments made a lot of sense. I'd take the class just for the material and the fact that the professor is very knowledgeable and engaged with the material.\r\n\r\nThe class was highly disorganized in terms of teaching and assessment (technical difficulties, grades not returned for months, changing due dates, missed lectures, etc.) However, the professor was aware of his own weaknesses here and seemed to be appropriately lenient with the students considering the disorganization.",
                "I think the course was very good with respect to Material and the Professor, one weakness would be the amount of material covered\/to cover - I would prefer a two semester course.",
                "The course was great - extremely interesting. Would recommend this to other students for sure. The final project (an immunoengineering NIH style proposal) was the highlight of the class.",
                "We experienced many technological issues during lecture on numerous occasions that proved disruptive and reduced the amount of material covered. The class would benefit greatly from the addition of a student tech or teaching fellow who could help navigate the technology space (Zoom in particular). In addition, assignments were graded and handed back very late, making it very difficult for students to gauge progress in the class\/their understanding of the material, as well as preventing students from obtaining helpful feedback for improvement. Lectures did not follow the syllabus schedule and much material was not covered during the semester due to timing. The organization of the class in general (deadlines being pushed, setting up meetings with the professor, when assignments were given\/graded...) did not provide for an environment that fully supported instruction and learning. This course would be greatly improved with greater attention to maintaining an adequate pace, hiring a teaching fellow, and more experience with Zoom\/technology. \r\n\r\nThe final project was nicely structured to demonstrate the process of delving into scientific research in order to formulate a proposal. The instructor provided helpful guidance to aid students in arriving at a feasible and reasonable topic to investigate.",
                "Professor Fahmy clearly knows the subject very well, but he is extremely disorganized. Very apologetic about it, but it makes it very hard to tell how you're doing in the class. This was also compounded by the lack of a TA to help him with the grading and technological difficulties he ran into.",
                "Professor Fahmy is so, so nice and passionate about immunoengineering and his students, but the technical difficulties and unavailability of professor Fahmy combined with lack of a TA or consistent feedback or posting of slides and other materials derailed this course",
                "This course was strong in that it offered us a novel way of viewing medical issues regarding immunology and taught us how to think from a unique perspective to devise more multidisciplinary solutions. A weakness of the class was that it could be more organized in terms of assignments and deadlines."

                "Having lectures via Zoom proved to be difficult due to unfamiliarity with the technology. Lectures frequently began late, there were issues with sharing the screen for presentations, and audio issues towards the first few weeks of class reduced the amount of time available for instruction. Greater training for the usage of Zoom for live lectures would be highly beneficial. The Zoom lectures were primarily instruction provided by the instructor with little interaction between students and the instructor, resulting in less-than-ideal amounts of virtual engagement.",
