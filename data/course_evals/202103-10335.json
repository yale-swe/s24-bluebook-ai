By investigating the intricacies of authenticity I have learned more how to decode abstract topics in an effort to find greater meaning. This course also honed my skills regarding how to order a paper for there to be flow between thoughts."

                "Strengths: good timely feedback, learned a lot about my own writing\r\nWeaknesses: Readings are often confusing, lot of work (readings were continually assigned even during times when we were writing essays), from what I heard from students in other classes this section had significantly more reading than other 114 classes.",
                "Sometimes the conversations would become monotonous or it would seem like our discussions were getting redundant. It would have helped if the course varied more day to day (instead of read, then discuss, then read, then discuss).",
                "Strengths - very thorough and rigorous.",
                "The wonderful class dynamic and meaningful discussions made us all look forward to the class and find ways in which we can connect it to our lives. The readings and essay prompts were also extremely fun and thought-provoking while teaching so much.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- it forced deep thinking; the instructor was flexible when personal issues arose\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- efforts to have students collaborate were ineffective since students had different levels of engagement\r\n- the class was a lot more work than other ENGL114 sections in terms of reading\r\n- there was something a little strange about the grading. The highest grade given on the main 3 essays to anyone according to Canvas was around a 93%, and the lowest grades were like 85%. I worked really hard on all of my essays, but seeing the grade distribution felt like kind of a disincentive for revising my essays a lot since I felt that if I put in less work, I would only drop a little bit. I just felt like the grade range was too narrow -- either the top students should be getting A's instead of A-'s, or the lowest grades should not have been solid B's.",
                "This course does a great job of introducing various types of writing to view authenticity from multiple angles and the various impacts it has on social perception. One improvement to the readings of the course is the inclusion of voices of multiple gender, racial, and ethnic backgrounds throughout the entirety of the course rather than inclusion being mainly a unit."

                "No; there are plenty of other more interesting and easier English 114 classes out there. This class is great to hone your writing skills and learn a lot, but Max assumes that everyone is as passionate about the topic as he is, and it makes for an awkward environment because that is just not the case. Most readings are highly philosophical and often very confusing, and it makes for awkward in class discussions when no one really had any idea what they read. English 114 is a good intro class, but I would recommend finding a section with another professor if you can. Be prepared for a hefty amount of work if you take the class with Max.",
                "Only if they are really into open-ended questions and philosophical discussions.",
                "Yes, but with the warning that this is one of the more time consuming sections of ENGL 114. However, it is an amazing class if the student is willing to work hard and do all the readings.",
