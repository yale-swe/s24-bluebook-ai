                "I think that the Chinese language department at Yale is truly amazing and has designed the course optimally. I think it would be unfair to critique this course as we all have struggled with zoom learning. I look forward to continuing Chinese and in person classes next semester.",
                "I think this course is great and does a good job of immersing the student in the language even though it was all online. A weakness is that some of the questions on homework assignments and exams are really confusing. Sometimes it seems as though questions require us to make huge inferences and can be a little bit misleading at times.",
                "I learned a lot of Chinese and became very well spoken in the language",
                "Strengths: everything about this course is extremely useful for learning, but especially structure -- the Chinese teachers at Yale have it down to a science what they can cover in a semester without overloading you; they create the optimal level of challenge to keep you interested and improving; everything done in class and assigned outside of class is very helpful. Li Laoshi is an amazing teacher. She pushed us, but she is also incredibly kind and she really cares about each of us as students and people.\r\n\r\nThe only minor weakness for me was character writing -- we do not spend any time writing characters by hand for our assignments, and then we must recall characters on the test. I always managed to remember the majority, but I couldn't remember a significant portion even though I devoted a good amount of study to each character. I wish there were a little more structure to learn characters.",
                "The course is well-organized and highly engaging.",
                "This course is almost all strengths and is run incredibly well. Listening and speaking skills stand out as the most exceptionally gained from this course. Lilaoshi cold calls on us all the time, which can be frightening at first, but it keeps us engaged and really forces us to use the language and always be listening. And whenever we makes mistakes, she finds the perfect way to get us to improve without being mean. The tests for this course are also well-designed. Weaknesses center around the confusion digital layout. The Quia homeworks are randomly spread, and many of the answers do not make sense. Also, we cannot see our grade in real time because the Grades tab is not calculated accurately. This makes for some \"in the dark\" grading."
