                "I learned about old Egyptian methods and kings.",
                "I learned about the Egyptian New Kingdom spanning the 18th to 20th dynasties. I learned how to read and interpret primary texts. Beyond that, I learned about making posters for presentation in conferences and how to synthesize information to write interpretive essays.",
                "Learned how to approach historical learning, assess primary sources. Very deep assessment of the Egyptian new kingdom. Also learned how to research for our final research poster project on the Amarna Letters.",
                "I gained a very extensive foundational knowledge of Egyptian New Kingdom Kings, politics and foreign ideologies.",
                "I learn how to interpret and talk about ancient primary texts, as well as much about the history of Egypt in its antiquity.",
                "I learned how to better examine and evaluate primary sources, even ones from hundreds of years ago. I also learned the importance of citing evidence and organizing my thoughts in writing.",
                "Through this course, I learned about the diplomatic, domestic, and military campaigns of the Egyptian New Kingdom empire. It was an engaging, organized course with an excellent professor and a thoroughly interesting subject!",
                "Ive gained so much more knowledge on Ancient Egypt as a result of this class. Initially, there wasnt much I could tell you about Ancient Egypt besides King Tut and what a pharaoh was. But after taking this class, I am confident in my ability to give an account on the history of Ancient Egypt  specifically the New Kingdom.",
                "The key skill developed by the course is that the format of the course was very conducive to introducing me to the seminar format. I feel ready to take a standard seminar next semester."

                "Interesting topics covered however end of the course felt a little rushed",
                "Strengths- the Professor was great and encouraged students to engage in every topic.",
                "The strengths of this course are the organization of the Canvas page. I felt that I could gather information from sources quickly and rarely felt confused on what was to be expected from each class. The weaknesses of this course are that it is very focused on a certain time period, which can lead to lack of engagement. Additionally, this course is very much lecture-style, so the amount of expected participation is confusing to gauge. But, Professor Moeller is extremely accommodating and is a helpful guide to students.",
                "Strength is the Professor who is an engaging lecturer and the content itself which is covered with lots of details and in class engagement. Another huge strength was the fun field trip we had to the Met which really helped contextualize what we learned. One weakness would be there wasnt regular office hours only if you set them up and sometimes the readings didnt match up with the lecture.",
                "I think the final exam was slightly unnecessary given the frequent papers over the course that contained the same demonstration of knowledge.",
                "The MET trip  was incredible and Professor Moeller created a very welcoming learning environment.",
                "The course is fantastic and there are only strengths. It is small, discussion based, thorough, and very engaging.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it's taught in a small seminar, the professor is very engaging, and the work assigned allows deeper insight into the topic.",
                "Strengths - Professor Moeller is the greatest strength of this course without a doubt. She is an expert in the field, mentioned in some of the textbook readings. She taught this course in an organized, engaging, and interesting manner, and we had some amazing experiences while taking the course, including a free trip to The Metropolitan Museum in NYC to look at their Egyptian gallery. Beyond the excellent instruction, the course material was extremely interesting to someone interested in history, and the workload was very manageable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The only one I can think of is the amount of time it took to get some graded work back, but considering the amount of work the professor has to put in to grade 20+ essays for each assignment, this is easily understandable.",
                "Strengths: Well facilitated discussion, emphasis on source texts, well organized, thought out syllabus guided the course well, and a genuinely fun final project\r\nWeaknesses: While recognizing this course as a first-year seminar, sometimes the course content was a bit surface-level. That is, I think in trying to be as accessible as possible, depth in a particular topic was frequently sacrificed. While I don't think this is the worst weakness a course could have, it would be nice if in future iterations of the course there were options for more optional readings, for instance."

                "it was very interesting to learn about the time period which i knew very little about",
                "Yes, this course is really interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course to students with a strong basis and interest not only in the humanities, but also in ancient history, specifically Egyptian. If this does not describe the student considering the class, I would advise against it. It is difficult to maintain the level of engagement required, specifically for the final exam, when the level of interest is not at the high level that this course requires, I would assume.",
                "Yes if you are interested in Egypt history. If youre not you will be bored with the specifics. I personally had an interest and no background and enjoyed the course.",
                "Yes I would. The course provided insights and explanations that I would not have been able to comprehend or develop on my own. Going to museums with Ancient Egyptian objects is much more interesting now.",
                "Absolutely. Even though I have no intention of studying Egyptology or even pursuing a history major Im so glad I took this course. I was so interested in the topic and it was great taking a discussion based course.",
                "I would recommend this course to those who are and aren't interested in ancient Egypt and archeology. The class is incredibly engaging which makes it very easy to learn, even if you don't realize you are learning.",
                "Absolutely! The course was fun, engaging, and taught very well. The workload was very manageable, and the topics were thoroughly interesting.",
                "Given how well this class teaches the fairly narrow focus of the course, I'd strongly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in ancient history or archeology, and tentatively recommend this to other broadly humanities majors on the strength of the course alone."
