                "The course covers the Canterbury Tales, Shakespeare's sonnets, metaphysical poetry, and Paradise Lost.",
                "My ability to dissect a poem greatly improved in this class. I feel like I developed an honest love and appreciation for the artistry of poetry.",

Weaknesses - The material is old, so if you are not interested in classic literature turn away.",
                "Bromwich is one of the few English req. course instructors still to ask for five essays, as opposed to three. He is a very thorough and fastidious essay critic and your writing will definitely improve. I appreciated Bromwich's style guide on certain pernicious words and phrases that have entered the Gen Z essay-writing lexicon. His insights and vast knowledge on English poetry is also worth taking the class for. He was also amazing at being available for office hours for all of the essays, which was a great help.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this class comes from the sometimes poor discussions in class. Bromwich definitely has a presence and I think a few people were quite intimidated. At the same time, maybe some people weren't intimidated enough by him. Although Bromwich is never dismissive, it could be hard to know what it was he was asking for or wanted to talk about. You take this class to talk about what Bromwich wants to talk about, not what you necessarily want to.",
                "This course was excellent, and I really enjoyed class discussions and essays, especially for Paradise Lost. I only wish we spent a little more time covering Shakespeare's Sonnets and the metaphysical poets; that middle section of the course felt a bit fast at times.",
                "I thought this class was very fair.",
                "Strengths: good discussions in class, space for conflicting ideas, good introduction to poetry, didn't feel daunting\r\nWeaknesses: did go a bit fast at some places and slow in others"

                "I would recommend this class to every English major. This class includes many of those fundamental texts without which you cannot truly say you have studied literature. It is a foundational course for a reason, and by the end of the class you will feel so well versed in may of the older poetic works which can appear intimidating to many people when they try to read them on their own without a curriculum.",
                "If you want to improve your writing and hear from one of the last \"public intellectuals,\" you should take this class. Expect to be writing down some of Bromwich's phrases verbatim in your notebook.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Professor Bromwich is fantastic and has very interesting things to say, and there was enough continuity in class discussions for the course to feel cohesive even while covering many different works/authors.",
                "Yes, I loved this class and enjoyed the different styles of poetry that were introduced.",
                "Yes. This was a really good introductory course to poetry, covering a lot of the really famous poems and poets while also introducing us to some new and unexpected works. Definitely enjoyed the discussions in class."
