                "This course helped me improve clarity when writing, helped me to more carefully articulate my ideas, and it became easier for me to engage with the writing of other people.",
                "i felt i became a better writer and learned about the intersection between freedoms and other topics like global warming. Very interesting when we got to the modern aspects of the course.",
                "While I have taken writing classes for many years, this class was the first time in many years that I was actually taught how to construct a powerful analytical paper. We went through the writing process step by step, looking at papers at both the larger level like paragraph structure and smaller level like sentence structure. It was really helpful to learn how to write like a college student before embarking on the rest of my journey at Yale.",
                "I learned a lot about writing - sentence structure, argument structure, incorporating sources, what \"they say\" versus \"I say\" and writing as though I am contributing to an existing debate. I also developed my critical reading skills as well as how to discuss complicated readings and consider various interpretations of them",
                "It was good to get my WR while also attending a class where I could refresh my essay writing skills.",
                "I learned  valuable skills about how to analyze philosophical readings and more clearly write about complex ideas.",
                "I learned how to structure and format and academic essay, and how to position my own perspective within a scholarly conversation by providing context in the form of \"they say.\" I also learned about various possible writing styles, and in the process beginning to develop my own. Additionally, I gained many new insights about different social and political topics through in depth discussions with my peers."

                "Strengths: it's super well-run. Mostly interesting readings. Alaimo was a great teacher. \r\nWeaknesses: Class discussions were super abstract a lot of the time. Was too easy to not do the readings and just participate while saying nothing. I also partly blame my classmates and myself for this.",
                "i like the open discussions, the readings did not tend to be long and it feedback was very benefitical.",
                "Organization was a large strength of this course. Marcus always came into class prepared with worksheets and various slideshows. This helped me stay focussed on the material during a 75 minute class, which can be challenging. He also did a great job engaging the class in conversation and making sure everybody had a voice. My only critique is that I wish we did more of the writing lessons earlier in the year and the readings/discussions later in the year. I only say this because I think the techniques I learned in the final weeks could have really helped me on my earlier papers.",
                "Strengths: good structure in terms of writing assignments (start narrow, manageable, build to the larger research paper that incorporates what we learned in the previous papers), readings were interesting/good fodder for discussion , readings also often demonstrated the writing concepts we were working on, They Say/I Say readings were helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes readings were a bit long/overwhelming during busy weeks",
                "The strength of the course is definitely Marcus, who always made the class environment relaxed and welcoming, and was always available to help us outside of class time if we needed it! As someone who was quite unsure of my writing abilities, I did not feel intimidated at all by the prospect of writing for this course. Additionally, another aspect of the course that was very helpful was the implementation of peer editing workshops. A possible weakness is that little feedback is given for paper drafts, but I understand that doing so is time consuming."

                "Sure. It depends. I'll split it into two parts. Are you a good writer?\r\nIf yes: it's a pretty easy class, so you'll get to do some interesting reading and writing without stressing too much about your grade. But I think I overestimated just how basic \"an introduction to writing\" would be. But if you want more rigorous writing improvement, you're probably better off in ENGL 120 or some other course.\r\nIf no: it's a great way to learn the fundamentals of writing. Would recommend.",
                "Yes if there were interested in the idea of freedom, the course helps a lot but having an interest in the topic is important.",
                "Yes. I think that this course is crucial for any freshman student. Not only are the writing techniques helpful, but the material forces students to look into questions that regard identity and power differences. Those are topics that I believe to be necessary in a college education.",
                "Yes - I think my writing improved a lot, and I really enjoyed the class discussions. I also felt comfortable participating even though it is not at all my area of expertise as a very STEM-minded individual",
                "Yes, sure. The workload is decent and you can get your writing credit but it's not the most fascinating class in the world.",
                "Yes, especially if they enjoy philosophical works.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially first years who have not had any prior exposure to college writing. ENGL 114 is both taught and structured in a way that makes academic writing much less daunting than expected. Additionally, the discussions held in class are always interesting, and encourages deeper thought about various social and political ideas."
