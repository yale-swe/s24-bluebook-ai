                "I learned a lot of experimental methods within the biological field, and how proteins and mRNA are quantified and linked to cell biology. I learned basically everything I could about the plasma membrane of the cell, as well as proteins that are on that membrane, packaging pathways of proteins within the cell, and finally, a little bit of organelle transport and movement using microtubules and the cytoskeleton, along with a basic overview of mitosis.",

The weekly problem sets and the course focus on experimental demonstrations of key concepts pushed me to cultivate a deep understanding of the course material from multiple angles. Furthermore, the need for communicating problem set answers in a concise matter improved my ability to write with clarity and precision.",

                "This course taught me to be self-reliant in my learning. Often times, the answers to PSET questions would require me to piece together bits of knowledge from many different lessons instead of having a straightforward answer. I found that in general, the questions were all very thought-provoking and required an in-depth understanding of the course material. It was great for getting me into the habit of constantly reviewing lessons and pushing myself to think about the \"so what\" of each lecture slide.",

                "I did not develop any long term knowledge of cell biology that will be useful to me in medicine or public health, but I did develop a lot of random knowledge about specific functions of proteins in the cell and laboratory methods. The design of this course would be better suited to students who have already taken cell biology (205) and it seems backwards that it is a prerequisite. There is no introduction to the layout of the cell. You may not want to take this course unless you have taken AP Bio and even so you will need to review in order to place structures within the cell.",

                "The length and difficulty of the weekly PSets encouraged me to not procrastinate and spread out my work throughout the week.",

                "Basic concepts of cell biology and experimental toolkits.",

                "High level understanding of cell biology such as structural and functional properties of biological membranes, biosynthesis of membrane proteins, endocytosis, actin-based and microtubule-base cytoskeletons. Throughout the course, we discussed experiments and learned how to interpret experimental data while reading research papers.",

                "Strength: peer tutors; I literally would not have made it through the course if the bio peer tutors didn't do one-on-one peer tutoring with me or have their office hours; cool if you like actin and myosin and cell bio (i dont think i do LOL)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures hard to follow online (Professor mooseker cares about the course a lot and provides helpful advice on piazza and has sunday review sessions, but i think recorded lectures are torturous for him to make and a little difficult to watch), first pset is like AHHHH WHAT DOES THIS MEAN and noncollaborative psets are kinda AHHH THIS IS SCARY AND NOBODY CAN HELP ME but go to office hours and they help you <3",
                "I thought that a strength of this course was the weekly enrichment sections held by Professor Hartman. They were a great way to recap the material from the week. The weekly lecture that we had to watch were quite long. Additionally, I wish that there was some other form of grade source apart from the weekly problem sets. Perhaps a small research project?",
                "strengths: very knowledgeable professor, passionate about subject matter\r\nweaknesses: inconsistent problem set grading (posting a rubric\/answer key would have been helpful); lectures\/ppts seemed disorganized\/hard to find material when needed",
                "I honestly think the pace of this class was extremely fast, and many times I didn't really understand where we were (especially in BIO 102 -- BIO 101 was not as fast).",
                "I really appreciate that the professors emphasized the benefits of collaboration, especially because the content was quite difficult.",
                "Strengths = enrichment section \r\nWeakness = PSET questions were slightly difficult and could have been more useful to have a key posted after to review mistakes",
                "Piazza is a wonderful resource for quick questions. Lectures were nice to be able to do whenever I wanted, but I also felt very distant from the professors and other people in my class.",
                "love prof. hartman with my whole heart, best professor i've ever had wow",
                "A strength of this course is definitely the utilization of Piazza for questions and answers about the course material. I'm not sure how this can be improved but the difficulty jump from 101 to 102 is really a struggle and those who are fast adapters win here but we want to make the transition easy for everyone.",
                "The recorded lectures go into a lot of depth and are very thorough. Teaching staff are active on the Piazza. The professor's review sessions are also very informative.",
                "Strengths: the format of the course \r\nWeaknesses: Everything else. The delivery of the material was terrible as it was seemingly assumed that we had an extensive background in cell biology, so we skipped over all the basic aspects and straight into the minute details certain parts of the cell. With nothing to attach this to, actually understanding what was going on was very difficult. In addition, there was no continuity in what we learned, as we just jumped from topic to topic and no time was taken to show how the weekly topics related.",
                "Strengths: having the lectures be recorded helped a lot to allow students to be able to pause the video and fully digest the technical jargon and the complex biological mechanisms covered in class. The midterm and final this semester was also converted to what were essentially take-home tests that you could work on throughout the week, so that reduced a lot of stress for this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures introduced a lot of new content that wasn't covered in AP Biology or in a standard high school biology class, but that's to be expected; just be prepared to take down a lot of notes. There was a lot of technical jargon in the lectures though, which will likely make you spend more time than the supposed 120 minutes of lecture per week since you will probably need to pause the recorded lectures a lot in order to fully digest and understand what is going on.",
                "I'd say it was a strength that during COVID-19 Mooseker was kind enough not to give us tests, and the collaborative open-note nature of the psets made them much easier than in a regular academic year, although psets being 90% of our grade this year wasn't the best for stress levels. The strength and weakness of the course could be that biology is taught from an experimental perspective, as it was interesting to learn about biology and analyze it as one would in a lab setting, but it would also be difficult to translate this knowledge to the typical biology curriculum of other universities and other people when talking about biology - it also gave a very limited overview of everything we ever learned.",
                "With regard to strengths, I think the instructors and teaching fellows were all super supportive. However, that's about where the positives stopped for me. I thought the lectures were far too dense and I really missed the idea of \"key concepts\" from BIOL 101. I also felt this way about the textbook, as it was difficult to get a supplementary understanding when the textbook was so dense and hard to read as well. Lastly, I REALLY didn't like that essentially the entire grade was determined by PSets. I think it led to a hyper-stressful environment to the students where every last detail felt unreasonably consequential, and I think we would've been far better served by keeping the quiz\/PSet\/mini-quiz format from 101.",
                "Strengths: The discussion section was really helpful, especially in preparing students for the problem sets. The fact that the lectures were pre-recorded was definitely helpful as well, since it allowed us to pause the video when taking notes.\r\nWeaknesses: The professor was not very good at explaining things, and I felt very lost during the pre-recorded lecture. I felt that I only just barely learned the concepts enough to get by for the problem sets. The problem sets were also super hard and it took about two hours for me to do each problem.",
                "I really loved the collaborative P-SET sections, peer tutor hours were very helpful, and I enjoyed that most of the grade was composed of our P-SETs (as opposed to examinations).",
                "It feels that we take a large jump going from Bio101 to Bio102. I feel like the bare basics of the cell should be explored to build a foundation in Biology and also to provide some context for the things we do learn.",
                "I would have appreciated if more time in discussion section was spent clarifying lecture concepts that weren't necessarily in the textbook but were asked in depth about in p-sets. This course was not as engaging as BIOL 101, perhaps because of the lack of weekly quizzes that made sure we understood the material. Some of the problem set questions were also honestly a bit too in depth for what we were taught in class, especially since there wasn't much explanation supplemented by the textbook at times. I also think that the lectures could be cut down a bit in size since with hundreds of slides per week and zoom fatigue, it can be hard to 'get' everything.",
                "I think the recorded lectures could improve greatly by providing more background and detail on the technical jargon used, providing other online resources to use besides the recorded lectures and weekly meetings.",
                "There is a lot of support in this course in the form of review sessions with Prof. Mooseker, Peer Tutors, and especially Enrichment. The lecture content is admittedly a little boring, but going to help sessions should be a big help to anyone.",
                "One strength of the course was having the lectures available to rewatch. One weakness of the course was that these lectures were prerecorded and questions could not be asked and answered in a quick fashion. This could be improved by hosting live lectures or adding more review\/enrichment sessions and office hours.",
                "Given the restrictions imposed by COVID-19, the strengths included the format (as the asynchronous lectures allowed a lot of freedom in watching and learning the content.) However, the primary weakness was the synchronous discussion section, as I feel that we did not have enough time to go over lecture content, in addition to the weekly research paper that was discussed.",
                "The opportunities for engagement with Prof. Mooseker and Prof. Hartman were very helpful in this course.",
                "This course was exceptional in terms of encouraging students to spend a considerable amount of time exploring lecture and paper content to understand the material in a comprehensive way. The discussion sections and review sessions were incredibly helpful for exploring complex topics, and I particularly enjoyed being able to interact with instructors and fellow students in a synchronous manner. Naturally, meeting in person would offer the greatest improvement to the course; because this will not be possible for some time, I would recommend creating more opportunities for interaction between the instructor and students, whether this be through open office hours or scheduled meetings.",
                "I don't have any suggestions for improvement. I thought the class offered effective resources for getting help (office hours, review sessions, discussion sections, Piazza) and found the lectures relatively easy to follow (even though the content was difficult at times!).",
                "Some of the pre-recorded lectures were difficult to follow; professor used advanced terminology and sometimes his explanations were a little confusing",
                "The material was interesting, but not having live lectures was definitely a weakness. However, this is not an issue with the professors but rather the circumstances we are in. Regardless, this course was still taught very well, I learned a lot, and the format was straightforward and consistent. I want to emphasize how helpful the discussion sections, peer tutoring hours, and Sunday review sessions were to my learning. Those interactions with other people really helped me stay engaged and get the most out of this virtual experience.",
                "I personally believe the prerecorded lecture format is less conducive to learning than synchronous lectures which require attendance, so I think that might have been a better way to run the course.",
                "Loved the focus on research strategies and how detailed the course was. I appreciated that we read papers on the topics we were studying so that it wasnt just memorizing information, but also learning about research and scientific problem solving.",
                "More live lessons",
                "i think it was great, virtual is just hard in general",
                "Format of watching pre-recorded lectures each week was fine. I liked having the Sunday review sessions. Psets were very annoying to do because often the answer involved something that had been very briefly mentioned only once in the lectures.",
                "The biggest strength of the course is Professor Mooseker. He is incredibly knowledgeable and wants nothing more than to see his students become better, stronger scientists. His optional review sessions were wonderful; and while the problem sets were challenging, it was the intellectual challenge that made them fun and engaging. For me, my discussion leader was a strength; I guess this varies amongst the students. Reading academic papers really gave us insight into how the real world of science operates; that practical insight is more valuable than anything covered in lecture. The instructors also did a great job having plenty of opportunities to engage with TFs\/instructors to ask questions; there was always a way to schedule an appointment or ask a question during office hours\/review sessions.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness of the course is the actual lecture itself; it's very tough to stay focused on Professor Mooseker. Because he's such a knowledgeable scientist, he employs a lot of jargon that is tough to understand, and sometimes you don't really know what he's trying to convey. But, this is only a problem because of the remote format. If the lectures were in person, I'm confident they would be more engaging.",
                "The setup of Bio 101 was better in terms of problem set material, style of teaching, and the final project.",
                "NA",
                "It was difficult to stay motivated in the online format of the class without in-person lectures, but given the effects of the coronavirus, I completely understand.",
                "Strengths: The content went beyond just memorization and was very involved. As such, the course does a good job not just telling you about biology, but teaching you about how it is significant in the grander scheme of things.",
                "Some strengths were that everybody involved was extremely helpful and did their best to make sure students fully understood each concept. A weakness may have just been the format of the course being only recorded lectures so you could not ask questions live.",
                "The strengths were the live review sessions, how thorough the lectures were, and how willing the teaching staff was to help us. It was very easy to get help in this course, as the teaching staff is very passionate about helping their students do the best they can in this course. A weakness was probably sometimes the lectures were so in depth that it was hard to follow, but the psets helped to refine that understanding.",
                "The virtual asynchronous portion made it a feel a little disconnected.",
                "Overall the course was good. The peer tutors were willing to help with the PSETs and worked to ensure you understood your question. The weekly homework collaboration was also helpful, though I didn't like that it was so late. Even the professors were very helpful with the content.",
                "The online lectures were clearly exceptionally in-depth in terms of the information utilized, which makes it difficult to say that I disliked the format. The information in the slideshow and verbal lecture was difficult to organize coherently for notetaking or making connections or deducing relationships and applications between different topics.",
                "strengths: Prof. Hartman and enrichment!! It was really helpful to have that weekly emphasis on material and a space to ask the \"dumb\" questions you may have especially for anyone who feels like they don't have a strong background in biology, for whatever reason. Prof. Hartman is super great at breaking material down and making it easier to understand.\r\nweaknesses: sometimes it wasn't entirely clear why we were learning what we were in class. It's a lot clearer by the end that the whole class is working its way through the cell, but it can feel a bit random at first. Will say that sometimes there is an assumption that you know certain basics and terminology, and since we cover a lot quickly it's easy to get lost in that. But Enrichment helps a lot!",
                "Strengths: the level of support from faculty and teaching staff; the introductory bio sequence tries very hard to give people the tools to succeed, and the peer tutors were absolutely phenomenal this past semester. Discussions were very helpful as well, and I enjoyed the exposure to scientific literature.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the only one that comes to mind is that I found beginning with the plasma membrane to be quite overwhelming -- for me, the first unit definitely did cause some anxiety, but that was quickly quenched as the weeks progressed (Unit 2 felt fine). Maybe this was just do to the fact that the general style of the class is different from 101 and I was still adapting -- I'm not quite sure.",
                "I really liked the collaborative PSET sessions as well as the review sessions with Professor Mooseker. They helped to foster a sense of communal learning that was lost in the video lectures. Naturally, I'd wish for more collaborative projects between students and professors, but the current circumstances make that impossible. I think considering the current pandemic, this class was run very well.",
                "The TA's and collaborative PSET sessions were really helpful to this class. Without them, it would have been really hard to do the PSET's by yourself. The material is much more specific than I thought it would be. I expected a general overview of cell functions and structure, but we instead went into depth about specific cells and their functions in the body.",
                "This course does a great job covering a wide range of material, but sometimes felt like it moved too fast to completely process the preceding content. One way this might be helped is by reviewing the concepts from previous units slightly more often.",
                "I liked the live parts of the class like the Sunday review and section. I wasnt as engaged with the recorded online lecture videos but I did like the convenience or being able to watch them when I wanted to and being able to rewatch.",
                "I thought the way the material was structured was great. Instead of teaching just about the parts of a cell, we also learned about the experimental methods and important papers which led to those conclusions. The psets were also fair but challenging so that you really had to think and apply what you learned in class. As were the red questions. However, I thought small very low stakes quizzes at the end of recorded lectures like the ones we used in 101 would have been very helpful in keeping me engaged through the long lectures.",
                "Overall, the course provided me with ample opportunity to apply the course material to different problem scenarios. This was primarily accomplished through problem sets, while a mandatory \"journal club\"  also served as a chance to encounter the material within the scientific field itself. That said, I believe that recorded lectures could have been both clearer and better organized. At times, I found the lectures both difficult to follow and riddled with jargon that proved somewhat difficult to decipher. Problem sets did indeed help me acclimate myself to the material, but I would have liked the lectures themselves to have been more helpful on their own.",
                "Strength: Tutors and the TAs were helpful in clarifying confusing concepts.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Recorded lectures often lacks enthusiasm. The information and concepts could perhaps be presented in a more appealing way.",
                "Strengths great teachers and discussion leader (at least for my section). Covered a lot of material, too. Weakness being online.",
                "it was a very good interesting course",
                "Strengths: review sessions and peer tutoring sessions were helpful when I went \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the fact that this course was conducted predominantly over recorded lectures weakened this course, but that is obviously specific to this year. Also, the fact that basically the only type of assignment in this class was a problem set made the class seem rather repetitive. \r\n\r\nHow it can be improved: Maybe add a little variety in the types of assignments? E.g. maybe replace a pset with a different type of activity for a week or two\r\n\r\nAnother weakness: to the best of my knowledge, course grading procedures (i.e. weighting of assignments) were NOT consistent with what was initially stated, except for the discussion sections. \r\n\r\nHow that can be improved: decide on course grading procedures either before the class starts or early on in the time of the class running so students know what to expect",
                "I think the class did a great job of breaking down biological processes in relation to the smaller components that comprise them.  The one thing I would comment on is I believe there should be a grading rubric from each TF so that we know what each TF expects of us on each PSET.",
                "Prof Mooseker is clearly passionate and knowledgeable about the topics he teaches and there are many resources for students who need help. One drawback is that the course doesn't actually provide a broad overview of cell biology and could be improved with an introductory module covering the basic of the cell.",
                "The pre-recorded lectures for this class were very difficult to follow, and oftentimes doing the psets felt like a stab in the dark. Piazza was a definite strength though, I found it really useful for nudging me in the right direction on homework.",
                "The recorded lectures are very long, and sometimes hard to follow. As a result, some of the PSETs were difficult to complete.",
                "This course's greatest weakness is Mark Mooseker. He is not interested in adapting his teaching methods to the circumstances of the pandemic and has simply accepted that he is \"not very good at teaching under these circumstances.\" I cannot speak to his performance as a teacher during a normal year, but under these circumstances his teaching style made the course very hard to engage with. He began the class being very rude and snappy to students asking questions on Piazza and asking for help with learning difficulties. This continued throughout the course. He teaches using language of a molecular biologist and has no interest in using more simple terms to improve our understanding of the material. Every time I went to a discussion section in this course I was forced to speak because all the other students said they had no idea what was going on in the class and couldn't understand a word of the lectures. I had to spend a lot of time on this course, especially compared to 101, and do a lot of reading from the textbook and online sources (Khan Academy, etc.) in order to engage with the material in discussion section. I think that the idea of reading articles during discussion sections is a good one, but it was executed better in BIOL 101.",
                "The course was good with teaching a great amount of cell material in very a short period of time. The course could be improved by working on making the material covered in the lectures a bit clearer to understand by explaining these topics more in depth and simply.",
                "Lecture content can be shortened",
                "Strengths: Multiple ways to get help, peer tutoring was effective, course material was interesting, the review sessions each week were really helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: At times, the lectures felt a little dry, and the material was pretty challenging and sometimes felt a little specific. It was hard to see the broader picture until the very end of the semester.",
                "I found the Sunday discussion sections extremely helpful",
                "The pre-recorded lectures felt a little useless. Though I continued to watch them, it was extremely difficult to really understand the material. There was not much description of the overall significance of the parts of the cell. However, the biggest problem for me was just how much jargon Professor  Mooseker used throughout the lectures. I just had a hard time following what he was talking about, and so found it extremely difficult to really stay engaged with trying to understand the material.",
                "Obviously COVID-19 made it difficult to engage with the material, but the emphasis on solving problems made it more stimulating than any other biology course I've taken. I felt like each pset question was intellectually stimulating and valuable for my learning. The recorded lecture format did make it difficult to engage deeply with the material, but I still felt like the pset questions were enjoyable and deep enough for me to get something out of the class. Despite the difficulties of COVID-19 I thought the structure of the class was great.",
                "Strengths: fun, relevant problem sets and engaging discussion sections\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were a bit dull at times, perhaps just due to the difficulties of the virtual format.",
                "This course can be improved by providing the enrichment material to all students, not just those who sign up for the enrichment. Also PSETs can be posted the day the past PSET is due.",
                "The material was comprehensive, but at times it was hard to follow.",
                "The strengths are the discussion sections as well as the enrichment sections. Professor Hartman was amazing in that she sincerely wanted all of the students in enrichment to understand the course material.",
                "It's good for students who are in any levels of Biology.",
                "I think the strength of this course was the multiple review sessions, discussion section, collaborative problem sets, enrichment, etc. that were all intended to help students do well in the course. It was clear that even though the course was challenging, the faculty wanted us to succeed. I didnt feel as though this class had any clear weaknesses to me.",
                "Strengths: The professors are very knowledgeable and invested in the success of the students. The course was very well structures and the Sunday review session alongside the enrichment class were extremely helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The material is very hard to understand. Too many technical terms are making it difficult to follow. I felt like I had to stop and do a Google search to understand what I was listening every other minute.",
                "This course was definitely intellectually challenging, however, I feel that the scope of this course was too focused on only a few specific concepts, as opposed to covering a broader range of cell biology that I had expected it would.",
                "The lectures were a bit monotonous, but I'm not really sure how that could be improved. The totally asynchronous format provided some helpful flexibility, and the discussion sections were useful for consolidating understanding of the papers.",
                "I had a very difficult time engaging with the lecture material due to the virtual, recorded nature of the lectures. This was mostly just a result of COVID restrictions, however synchronous lectures and more interactive elements while learning might be helpful.",
                "What was taught through the video versus what questions were asked in the weekly PSETs were drastically different. The questions in the PSETs were much harder and confusing than any of the concepts explained in the videos.",
                "I wish there had been more synchronous activities. I also thought making so many of the problem sets collaborative was a little unfair to those of us who were remote.\r\n\r\nI liked the emphasis on reading complex papers.",
                "Questions on problem sets were occasionally ambiguous or not covered adequately in lecture.",
                "The course ends up having only 5 assignments in the grade book, excluding the few points received from discussion section. Because of this, it is extremely easy to do poorly in the class simply because of a few bad assignments. This would not be so bad, if it were not so hard to get a good grade on some of these assignments. The assignments are all made of \"red questions\" asked in class that are not answered. In other words, the assignments are made of questions about things that you have not been taught, or at least of things that have not been explained completely. In addition, two of the assignments are non-collaborative, meaning that you can't even get help. This idea of asking a hard question in class that we usually cannot answer with the information given to us, and then not answering that question, and then making it our homework is mind boggling as to how that seems like a good teaching strategy. To be fair, there are live Sunday review sessions where the teacher answers these red questions with everyone, so this should seem like I am wrong in what I have said. However, the problem is that the review session occurs in the evening\/afternoon on Sunday, and the assignment is due Monday morning the next day. So, you have an extremely small time frame to check, correct, and fill in your answers. And again, these questions are often unanswerable. I say unanswerable, but I mean in the sense that you can give an answer, but there is no way to know for sure if your answer is actually right or wrong. You basically have to give an educated guess on many of the questions. There are two easy ways to fix these problems. One, as bad as this sounds, is to give us more work, so that there are more options to do good on assignments to boost our grade. BIOL 101 has triple the amount of work BIOL 102 has, yet I did far better in that class because the few assignments I did bad on were outweighed by all the good ones. The other fix, which is a much better fix in my opinion, is to just move the Sunday review session (although really it's a teaching session, not review) to Friday or before that so people actually have time to learn how to answer the red questions. Just moving the session would completely fix the class and make it all okay.",
                "I thought that at times the videos were difficult to understand as some concepts were not explained as clearly as they could be. It was definitely a step up from the 101 in that sense. I did really appreciate the overall format of the class though in which there weren't' any quizzes or tests but rather psets that could be done over a long period of time and at times collaborative.",

                "problem set deadline in the middle of the week\/later in the day on Monday would have been helpful for student schedules and seeking resources (especially for students with weekend commitments)",
                "I honestly did not like the style of using pre-recorded lectures. I understand that they were beneficial so that many people could view them as many times as they wanted and so that time zone changes weren't a factor, but for me they took away the structure from my day, which negatively impacted me.",
                "The zoom discussion sections where we reviewed the papers were very useful.",
                "I think the professors did the best they could with learning biology online, but it was very difficult. I feel like I really missed out on having lecture in person because it is hard to stay engaged when staring at a computer all day. I think having a section every week made me feel less alone while I was learning, but overall it was very individual.",
                "It was a great format.",
                "All changed practices were successful.",
                "The weekly review sessions were very helpful for finishing the psets. The sections were also helpful.",
                "The only part that was successful was the recorded lectures as I had to watch each multiple times. Everything else needs to be improved.",
                "The psets being collaborative were very kind, and I understood the need for their to be noncollaborative psets to assess our own understanding. It would be nice to be able to drop a noncollaborative pset or somehow make the better one weigh more than the other. Otherwise, it was very kind not to give us closed note tests this year.",
                "I definitely appreciated that we could watch the pre-recorded lectures at any time instead of having a hard deadline, as that definitely allowed me to work the class into my schedule more reasonably. An aspect that could be significantly improved is the Sunday review sessions. To be honest, we probably would've been better off if Prof. Mooseker just went over the red-questions in the recorded lecture, or if the course were in a live virtual lecture format. The review sessions just ended up getting monopolized by two students who would answer questions before anyone else even had the chance to breathe, which made it far more difficult for that to be a productive learning space for me and I'm sure many others feel the same.",
                "I think the course adapted well for the COVID-19 environment.",
                "In my opinion I think that as long as this course is online, Problem Sets are the only way to be graded. Tests or quizzes would not be fair based on the scope of material we covered in class.",
                "The facilitated collaborative p-set sessions were incredibly helpful since we could discuss the topics with other people and make sure we were staying on track. I also wish we were allowed to used Piazza a bit more (not just to discuss specific p-set questions) like we could for BIOL 101 since it made us feel a little less alone since everyone had the same confusion \/ questions. I understand that some questions seemed as though they should be asked directly to the professors, but, especially while in an online environment, it can be intimidating to ask general questions about course structure or provide feedback when you have no idea if you are alone in your questions\/concerns.",
                "The lectures felt like they had no passion behind them for teaching the students. It seemed very forced and tiresome even from the perspective of the professor, which only added to the detachment of myself and other students. Somehow, I think this class should've had a bit more engagement than simply recorded lectures of varying lengths and then the corresponding weekly PSET. At least BIO101 had quizzes at the end of their lectures to provide some form of engagement. I think the simple addition of lecture quizzes could drastically improve the class.",
                "The prerecorded lectures were very ineffective. I only learned in the peer tutor and Enrichment sessions",
                "This course succeeded at an exceptional level given the COVID-19 pandemic, as the asynchronous lecture with the synchronous discussion allowed for the most flexibility for the students. In addition, the forum, Piazza, allowed the students to easily ask questions, with the entire class receiving the answer to their question, clarifying many topics and questions.",
                "The review sessions and discussion sections were helpful in encouraging virtual engagement.",
                "The combination of asynchronous lectures (which allow for students to control course pacing) and synchronous discussion and review sections (allowing for increased interaction with instructors and other students) was highly effective in balancing student comprehension and engagement. Sacrificing either of these components would interrupt this balance, so I recommend that both stay in place. The course could be improved by creating more opportunities for students to meet with the course instructor during office hours or one-on-one meetings. Though Piazza was helpful for posing any questions that were not answered in lectures or sections, face-to-face (albeit virtual) meetings with the instructor would be helpful as an additional resource (though Piazza should certainly be kept as well).",
                "I really liked having the live discussion section to supplement the recorded lectures.",
                "Overall, I thought Professor Hartman and Professor Mooseker did a good job of facilitating online learning! Special thanks to Professor Hartman for coordinating 101-102.",
                "The simple model of the class was refreshing since other covid classes have added complexity in the transition to online school, which has been detrimental and frustrating. I think this class succeeded because of the simple and consistent model.",
                "I completely understand why recording the lectures was necessary, and I do think that the length of the videos was perfectly reasonable and manageable. If there could be more live components, however, that would really help with virtual engagement because I found the discussion sections, peer tutoring hours, and Sunday review sessions to really help with my learning.",
                "Virtual meetingS like discussion sections and review sessions were beneficial but I saw the prerecorded lectures as difficult to remain engaged with.",
                "The lectures were great, despite being asynchronous.",
                "i think the recorded lectures are good because you can learn at your own pace",
                "Weekly discussion and Sunday review were helpful. Psets that were due each week made it so that you were forced to keep up with lectures. The lecture format could be improved. I did not like how they were broken down into smaller segments and all dumped into a folder for us to make our way through.",
                "Everything except the lectures succeeded, although I would recommend having two optional collaborative PSET sessions, as I could not attend the only timing they offered. Any way to make the lectures more engaging and\/or ease the advanced, technical scientific language used would be greatly appreciated.",
                "Recorded lectures were helpful.",
                "The discussion sections using breakout rooms in a journal-style based learning was very effective. It would have been better to have the lectures as a synchronous activity.",
                "I'd say all of the live zoom sessions were successful. They helped to clarify my understanding. The one practice I was not a fan of was the red question sessions. During the lecture, the professor asked red questions  that would, in a normal in-person lecture, would be answered by students in the audience. With virtual lectures, however, these questions were not answered until the very last day before the problem set was due. Sometimes, answering these questions was crucial to my understanding of the content, and I did not enjoy that the session was so late in the week.",
                "I think the discussion sections truly succeeded because they were very helpful and formatted quite well. The recorded lectures could have been improved. I think the option of live lectures would have been more helpful because they would allow for more clarification on certain concepts that might be more challenging.",
                "I think if the content with the star next to it could be removed or diminished that would be helpful in terms of engagement in the lectures. Although the content with the star was really cool and I think works well in a normal class setting, in the recorded lectures it was kind of overwhelming at times, and I think the content would have been easier to understand and clearer without the red star content. As well as, the lectures would have been shorter which is helpful in considering most students spend lots of time in front of a screen already during the pandemic. I think the live sessions, peer tutoring, office hours, and discussion sections were great and super helpful!",
                "The discussion sections and the enrichment sessions were very helpful even in the online format.",
                "Personally I liked that the lectures were pre-recorded. I didn't have to worry about accidentally missing something or losing focus. I could pause and rewind as needed. My only critique has to do with the discussion sections: mainly when we all went back home. Not everyone's internet could handle the demand zoom required. That obviously can't be fixed by the biology department, but it was hard to focus when the internet world cut out.",
                "The discussion section of the weekly papers helped expand my understanding beyond a simple memorization; I felt that I genuinely understood both the topics and the reasoning behind them. I would like for a similar matter to be utilized towards the weekly practice questions and lecture notes (which is what the review sessions are for, but the timing makes it difficult to make it. I would advise that the weekly review sessions be moved to during the weekday, during one of the course's reserved times.)",
                "It was really accommodating and understanding, in my experience. They did what they could to make it accessible in terms of setting up time to meet with professors and other students to mirror in person collaboration as much as they could.",
                "One of the best courses to be offered in the virtual format; Intro BIOL (101 and 102) manages to take advantage of the format and produce a class that does not change\/suffer as a result of the pandemic. \r\n\r\nI would say that the more \"review\" type sessions earlier in the week, the better; that way, we have more time to work on our PSETS after receiving help.",
                "Like mentioned above, I think the collaborative PSET sessions and end-of-the-week review session were super beneficial. I also like that the lectures were all pre-recorded, as that gave students more flexibility in their schedule. The peer tutors and TAs were all very helpful and accessible.",
                "The collaborative PSET sessions were really helpful. Having the lectures uploaded at the beginning of the week was also really helpful.",
                "I loved Professor Mooseker's virtual review sessions, they really helped me connect the material and complete the problem sets, but if they could be slightly earlier in the week (for example, on Thursday or Friday instead of Sunday) they might be more helpful. I often found I would finish the lectures early in the week but have a few misconceptions about the material for the rest of the week that would only get corrected on Sunday.",
                "Recorded lectures were helpful. Live discussion sections and the paper discussions were also helpful. It would have been helpful for staying engaged if small very low stakes quizzes were at the end of recorded lectures like the ones we used in 101.",
                "The live sessions were very helpful. I learned a lot from them. I appreciated the recorded lectures because it allowed me to rewatch and fit them into my schedule more easily, but I would have preferred for them to be live and still recorded for viewing later like the Sunday sessions.",
                "the biology sequence asynchronous format works well to teach us",
                "Succeeded: review session, Piazza, peer tutoring sessions\r\n\r\nCould be improved: for remote learning conditions, it might be nice to have a quasi-mandatory short Zoom meeting to just kind of walk through the PSET and the week's lectures so everyone sees it at the same time and allow people to ask clarifying questions. This might reduce the influx of Piazza posts and make it more likely that people will look at the PSET and course material earlier in the week. It also might be nice to just have everyone oriented and more prepared for the week's material.",
                "I think more sessions like the live review sessions on the weekend would be helpful.  I truly enjoyed this sessions as they were engaging and allowed for more discussions of the material and its relation to other subjects.",
                "The recorded lectures need to be shorter and easier to understand. The PSETs instead of exams and quizzes took some stress off.",
                "The course succeeded in getting through a large amount of material, but fell short in interaction with our class mates, which made it difficult to work on the problem sets if we did not have time to go to the live weekly collaboration sections.",
                "Asynchronous lectures were good and live collaborative pset sessions and enrichment sessions were very helpful.",
                "I enjoyed having the weekly review sessions.",
                "I thought that the course as a whole was well adapted to the virtual format",
                "The extra sessions with Prof. Hartman were great. Maybe Prof. Mooseker could do live lectures rather than prerecorded ones to allow for more engagement.",
                "The discussion sections were interesting but relatively difficult to engage with. I think if I got to know the students better it would have been more engaging, so maybe some sort of improvement to the breakout rooms would help. I will say that I didn't take advantage of all the resources in this course so I can't speak to merits of much of it.",
                "The virtual review session was extremely helpful, but waiting until Sunday afternoon to address key aspects of the course made completing the problem sets very difficult.",
                "The asynchronous lectures were very helpful.  I needed to spread out my screen time to avoid burnout, so it was nice to be able to watch lectures on my own schedule.  I also appreciated that discussion sections and weekly study halls provided opportunities to connect with classmates and the professors.",
                "Discussion sections on Zoom were great, also recorded lectures really work well with the virtual format and should be considered for future years even without the pandemic, especially for this intro sequence.",
                "The review sections could have been held during a week day.",
                "I think almost all of the virtual components were done well.",
                "The Sunday review session and the Enrichment class were instrumental for my ability to understand the material. The discussion sessions, tutoring sessions, and collaborative sessions were also extremely helpful.",
                "Having the lectures pre-recorded and available to watch during my leisure was very helpful and allowed me to manage my time a lot better. However, I think that having at least a portion of the discussion section dedicated to the information covered in the lectures and the students questions regarding the content may be beneficial to learning, as opposed to solely reviewing the scientific paper of that particular week during the discussion section.",
                "The virtual lectures worked fine, given the ability to put them on double speed. The captions were also very helpful.",
                "See above",
                "The lectures were very dense. In a normal class setting, questions might break up the lecture and give the professor to clarify things, but the online version did not account for that. I would have liked the opportunity to attend lecture live.",
                "Lack of ability to form in-person study groups was difficult. P-SET office hours with Professor Hartman were poorly orchestrated (instructor wasn't available to help students and everyone seemed to struggle with certain questions).",
                "The pre-recorded lectures worked well, and I liked how the interface used had the slides at the bottom, so you could skip to whatever slide you wanted. The Sunday review session should definitely be moved to an earlier day, at least Friday. The discussion sections were also well done.",
                "I thought that it would have been more helpful if the first peer tutoring session was held a little later in the week or that the videos were released earlier. This is the case because after finishing the videos on wednesday any given week, I felt it was hard to turn around and be ready to ask questions for peer tutoring on thursday night.",

I also never touched the textbook lol because everything was based on psets",
                "I thought that it was a good intro bio course. It did not necessarily cover anything that got me super excited about biology but I think that this is one of the better pre-med classes.",

                "Do not take this class unless you need it for your major. If you need it, be prepared to struggle, especially after BIOL101.",
                "If you are hoping to learn about experimental techniques and cell biology, yes. However, this course is pretty hardcore STEM, so if you are looking for a more relaxing class, I would probably look somewhere else.",
                "I would because it's a prerequisite to many majors in the STEM field, and it is good to know about basic biology. I wouldn't recommend if you don't see yourself ever doing research or lab work (which I don't really enjoy that much, although I did enjoy learning the basics of what we learned in this course)",
                "Unless it's required for you, I wouldn't recommend this course. I took it because it was recommended for an advanced elective in my major, and I left the course with serious doubts as to whether the vast majority of the content and skills we learned would be useful to me at all. A lot of the topics this course covers (especially in the early portion) would definitely be more fitting for a cell biology lab course, not a lecture.",
                "I would only recommend this course to someone who needs it for their major. I took this for a science credit and because I was interested in public health, and it was not worth it. Only take it if you have to.",
                "Yes I would.",
                "Not unless required",
                "Yes, while BIOL 101 was much more engaging and fun to take online, this class still provided some necessary skills such as reading and analyzing scientific papers \/ data.",
                "I would not recommend this class to other students simply because it seems from every perspective an unenjoyable class to take and to teach. Of course, its required, but this class was lifeless.",
                "I would recommend this course, as in addition to being the pre-requisite to many MCDB courses, I enjoyed learning the content of the course and I found the course intellectually stimulating. But I would warn them of the dry nature of the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, hands down. The material is intriguing, Professor Mooseker is both passionate and brimming with knowledge, the teaching fellows are excellent, and the problem setswhile challengingpromote a deep understanding of the material. With all of these components combined, BIOL 102 is a wonderful course for anyone interested in exploring biology and cultivating his\/her\/their critical thinking skills.",
                "Yes, I'd absolutely recommend the course to any student interested in biology. It helped me build a good foundation for the classes I hope to take in the future.",
                "Yes, it is a good foundations course in cell biology\/important for any of the bio majors",
                "Yes, very interesting if you love Bio and a good foundation course.",
                "Yes. It's necessary for bio, but it was also beneficial for me to get into the swing of college level academics as far as study habits and resource utilization without feeling overwhelmed.",
                "Yes I would. This course approaches Cell Biology that is unlike any other biology class, and it was so incredible to not only learn about the functions of organelles in the cells, but how biological research techniques were used to discover them. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about these concepts in this class, and anyone who has an interest in the science of life will gain a deep appreciation for it by taking this class.",

                "yes, great for intro to bio",
                "Though this is a cell bio course, I really feel like i learned less cell bio than research and experimental methods. For everything new learned, the lectures spent more time focused on going through the experimental design and evidence, and psets were more geared towards designing\/analyzing experiments.",

                "Yes I would. I imagine that most students taking this course will be bio majors\/pre-meds. However, I would still recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in biology. This course changed my perception of biology, and I found taking this course very engaging and fulfilling.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course because it allows to improve critical thinking skills greatly while applying concepts to different scenarios.",
                "Yes, I would! This course is a great overview of cellular processes and Professor Mooseker is super passionate about it, so it's always awesome to learn from a professor that is enthusiastic about the content. I left the class with a greater understanding of cellular processes and experimental methods. The teaching staff is also so eager to help students, so it's hard to not do well in this course.",
                "Yes it is a great course in the great biology sequence.",
                "I would recommend this course. Compared to other intro courses, Biol 102 seemed like it was less work. The things that required the most work was just making sure you were prepared for the discussion section: watching the lectures and reading the papers. There were no tests or quizzes: granted this was during COVID. The peer tutors and professors are very helpful.",
                "Yes",
                "If you have to do, then of course. If it's not a req, I guess it'd depend on how much you already know, how much work you want to do, and whether you just like bio. I'm assuming if it's not a req you really like bio, so I'd say go for it there's lots of support and you can always credit\/D if you were just interested but didn't do as well as you hoped and don't want it affecting your GPA.",
                "Yes, i enjoyed learning about biology and the way Covid works as a virus.",
                "Yes, I would. You learn many of the fundamentals of biology research and experimental design, as well as general reasoning skills.",
                "If you are interested in taking more advanced biology classes or need it as a prerequisite, then take the class.",
                "Yes! This was a really well taught course, especially considering all the challenges of the semester. The teaching staff were really great and always available to help. The material was interesting and the pset questions were really fun to think through.",
                "Yes, even if it is not a requirement.",
                "I would only really recommend this course to other pre-med students, or students who need to take this course as a prerequisite. Even then, I would recommend the course to people who aren't taking chemistry during the same semester, so that they might give ample attention to the course material. That said, for any students interested in learning biology in general, I would softly recommend the course, so long as they have taken BIOL 101 first. If they are entirely new to biology, I would also recommend Dr. Hartman's Enrichment sessions as well.",
                "Yes, because the course builds foundational cell biology knowledge",
                "Yes, its difficult but worth it. I learned a lot and felt proud when I finished.",
                "yes. it was a very interesting course and i learned a lot",
                "I would definitely recommend this course for most STEM majors and probably all pre-meds if it is a required class, as it frequently seems to be. However, for someone just looking to get a general overview of cell biology, this might not be the best choice as it seemed to be noticeably more detailed than what I would expect from an intro biology class (just based on my experience in my high school biology classes).",
                "I would definitely recommend taking this class. It was fun and engaging. The material was new and interesting to learn.",
                "Yes, if they have to take it to fulfill a requirement. Otherwise, I would not recommend as it is not interesting, and the recorded lectures the class centers around are lacking.",
                "Do not take this course under any circumstances unless you absolutely have to and are certain your major will require it. If you are a first year, consider putting it off until sophomore year and exploring other disciplines. This course will kill your love of biology.  Perhaps wait until this course is taught by another professor. I have friends who took BIOL 102 with other professors and found it to be much more enjoyable.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student interested in biology, but not as an introductory science course for someone not interested in science as the material was quite challenging to understand and process.",
                "Yes, great course discussing the foundations of cell biology. Professors are amazing",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in a bio-oriented major. The material is interesting and challenging, and it teaches you how to think about experimental design.",
                "Yes, to anyone with an interest in biology. I really appreciated the emphasis on experimental methods throughout the course.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student if it is in an online format. Though I would guess most people that are taking the course are doing so to fulfill requirements.",
                "Yes, I think it is important for students to learn that biology is really a scientific process rather than just a massive load of facts. This class showed me that the while the complexity of biology can be intimidating, it can be approached with limited knowledge.",
                "Unless you are planning to major in MCDB, I would not take this course. I am surprised that it is a requirement for so many science majors, as it was extremely specific and detailed, rather than an intensive overview of cell biology as described.",
                "Yes, I would.  It lays the groundwork for many interesting areas of study!",
                "It's an intro bio sequence, so yes. However, the PSETs take significant time and almost always require a lot of time for collaboration.",

                "Absolutely! It was very well organized and the support system provided by the professors and teaching fellows were instrumental for my development.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend it. The Psets can be difficult, but you figure them out as the course goes on, and I think the course provides a lot of good insight into a scientific manner of thinking, rather than simply memorizing a list of biological facts.",
                "Yes, because it is required to take higher level biology classes.",
                "No the course is more geared towards grunt work and self taught lessons rather than discussion based understanding and teaching.",
                "I felt like I learned relevant information, but especially after taking BIOL 101, which was so well organized during the pandemic, I felt that the class was not as informative as it could have been.",
                "Only if they need it or want to take upper level bio. Theres easier science credits for non stem ppl.",
                "Only as a prerequisite. There are many other more interesting biology courses offered.",
                "I would say that I wouldn't, but this is an extremely common prerequisite and core class, so I can't really tell anyone who wants a biology-based major not to take it, as that would be ridiculous.",
                "I would, specifically in the online format, because of how well organized the course was and how much support we as students received throughout. Although the material was at times more difficult to understand than in 101, there were many ways in which we could get help in understanding it.",
                "Yes, a pre-req for a lot of courses"
