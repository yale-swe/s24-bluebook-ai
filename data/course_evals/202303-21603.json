            "comments": [
                "Weaknesses: Each day, we wouldn't begin discussing the readings until twenty minutes before class ended, if we ever did. And class always ended twenty or thirty minutes early. When we did talk about the actual works, Professor Williams would read lengthy prewritten monologues as if the class was a lecture and not a seminar. More often than not, they would about the readings assigned one or two weeks before, that had gone unmentioned in those classes. The rest of the time, we'd watch YouTube videos that were tangentially relevant to the course. The syllabus never seemed to connect to itself despite its specificity; if we ever got around to talking about a reading in a class, it was rarely ever mentioned again. \r\n\r\nStrengths: Many of the readings were very interesting. And there was a nice community within the class.",
                "Strengths: interesting readings, good class discussions, fun final paper format\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, it felt like we could've benefited as a class from more structured teaching from time to time (like mini lessons on topics in futurism). discussions seemed to be based largely on students' thoughts of the texts, which was nice, but I didn't always feel like I was building new insights",
                "strengths: the course was very well designed to set students up to write the final paper; the paper proposal and annotated bibliography were explained thoroughly and were super helpful in writing the final paper; class discussions were lively and Prof Williams is a very interesting + passionate professor \r\nweaknesses: class discussions often strayed far from the day's reading (good or bad, depends how you look at it)",
                "Readings are sometimes too extensive to be really doable and aren't spoken about fully in class due to time being spent discussing assignments/on student presentations. I wish presentations had been consolidated to two class meetings rather than bleeding throughout the semester- I felt more time was spent due to switching from task to task.",
                "This course was a nice senior seminar for students who love to have interesting class discussions. I would have loved a little more variation in how the class was run: the whole course built up to the final paper, which was fine, but I only had to write a 12-page paper, so it was a bit anticlimactic."

            "comments": [
                "Absolutely not. Simply a waste of time. If you're interested in literature, you won't find very much of it in this course. Much of the syllabus is a scattered collection of documentaries, futurist essays, and philosophy tracts. These might be enough if you're really interested in the future, but if that's the case I'd advise you to just read the works independently. When the class did actually discuss them, it did little to clarify or supplement my understanding. This is the only English senior seminar I've taken that felt like a first-year seminar, and a messy one.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in futurism! Otherwise, you probably won't enjoy the readings (which are the bulk of the work from week to week).",
                "yes! this seminar with Prof Williams has a very welcoming, friendly atmosphere; makes it easy to contribute to conversation and add your own two cents (whether based on the reading or from personal experience); we had a few very meaningful conversations about mortality which really stuck with me; also quite light on the reading",
                "Depends on what you're looking for! If you want a relatively chill but interesting exploration of literature and time, yes. You can make of it what you put into it- you will be able to get by without doing all of the readings, but the readings are truly fascinating and worth doing.",
                "I definitely recommend this course for students who are interested in the topic.",
                "I would! It's a great syllabus and I love the concept of the final project. It is the best final paper assignment I've had for a class here, in the way that it encourages generative thinking and learning through material that is outside of the syllabus."
