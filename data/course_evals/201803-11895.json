    "You learn a lot about how to write a song that fits an entire musical so you learn how to think about not just the moment the song is set in but also where it occurs, what the characters are going through, what is about to happen etc.",
    "I learned the technical skills to write lyrics in the musical theater tradition. I learned about different song types, song structures, and different ways to go about writing hooks to lyrics.",
    "I learned about various types of songs\/song forms that function well in musical theater. I learned that lyric writing requires constant revision and you can always improve upon your work. Collaboration is difficult but a key element of writing for musical theater."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Korie is the most responsive and helpful music professor ever! You will learn a lot from him.",
    "Strengths; Workload is really manageable, Michael Korie is a lyric-writing legend, the class is super practical, and you get to write lyrics that you really care about. You get real-world feedback from professionals as well as a chance to collaborate with other artists\r\nWeaknesses: Michael Korie is a pretty traditional teacher, and sometimes his comments are too old fashioned. The class requires collaboration, which sometimes goes really well and sometimes it doesn't.",
    "Sometimes I felt my creativity was limited by the course. Many of the assignments were very specific and emphasized technique, but often at the expense of creative liberty."

   "comments": [
    "TAKE IT!",
    "Absolutely! If you're at all interested in theater, this class is a really basic introduction to what it takes to write lyrics. The class assumes very little knowledge of theater (which might be good or bad depending on where you come from). There were many people in class this semester who had never written lyrics, which brought a great dynamic to the class.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who has little to moderate experience in songwriting or lyric writing, as the course is heavily based in improving technique and learning about formatting a song. As both a lyricist and a composer, having to collaborate with a composer and being limited to writing only lyrics for the final project wasnt my favorite experience."
