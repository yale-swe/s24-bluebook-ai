I was never stressed about the work and the papers and discussions were always great. Although it was a 1-hour-and-50-minute session once a week, the time flew by. If you have any thoughts about doing clinical psychiatry research or therapy, take the course. If you are interested in anything regarding clinical neuroscience, take the course.",
