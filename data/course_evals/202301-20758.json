                "Strengths: 1. the course packet that included incredible stories and narratives that did not take long to read but led to fruitful class discussions. 2. the clear delineation of the three assignments throughout the course that made the course feel more manageable and allowed us to compare and contrast different art forms by the end. 3. the videos that were presented when each assignment was given so that we all were inspired and also had a clear idea of what was expected/what a specific art form looked like. 4. the freedom of each assignment, which made the space feel less stressful and more fruitful. \r\nWeaknesses: I would love to see American (or whoever teaches this course in the future) speak more about their practice and give advice throughout the semester. During one class, they shared how they go about funding their projects, and I think more discussions like this (about life in general, beyond the readings and beyond the class assignments), would be quite generative."

                "ABSOLUTELY. This has hands down been my favorite class at Yale, both because I grew so much as an artist while taking it and because, by the end, I really felt like I knew the people in it. Personally, my work is centered around the human body, but even if you've never performed, created video art, or crafted an installation before (I hadn't!), take this course. For our final project, my group of four felt like a family, and we worked for hours outside of class listening to Tiny Desk and learning how to cast the human body in plaster."
