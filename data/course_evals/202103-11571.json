                "The biggest weakness of the course is that there was miscommunication between the course director and the leaders of different sections. We as students did not know what was going on a lot of the time because our professor did not and that made it difficult to learn sometimes. The course could be improved by greater clarity with the assignments, especially the big, long-term ones, such as what they are, when they are due, etc. A big strength of this class was the media we consumed. The movie \"Tambien la lluvia\" and the book we read at the end were great pieces to use for the final projects.",
                "Strengths: exposed students to literature in Spanish \r\nWeaknesses: syllabus that did not align with what was occurring in class, did not cover deeper meaning of text, a mixture of students at various speaking abilities even though we were all placed in level three\r\n\r\nImproved: add a speaking component to the placement exam, make syllabus reliable and rigid so that there is enough planned time to go over meaning of text and all that",
                "The material of the course itself is interesting, but the method of receiving assignments was extremely disorganized. More direct work assignments would have been appreciated.",
                "Strengths: speaking practice, student engagement\r\nWeaknesses: organization, rubrics, clarity of deadlines",
                "Strengths:\r\ninteresting stuff we covered. i'd much rather talk about real-world issues/ideas than study grammar in class. And when we did talk about grammar, it was necessary and helpful.\r\nMy professor (Virginia Santos) was super passionate, quirky, and kind. I loved having her as my teacher."

                "I would recommend this course because Spanish is a great language and I loved the pieces of media we consumed. I also loved my professor and would encourage the person I am recommending to take this ocurse to try to take it with her because she is great. I personally am not the biggest fan of learning languages in an academic setting though, so I would also have to express that to this student. This course was a good course for being mandated to take a language class.",
                "I probably would not only because the enjoyment of being in the class was overshadowed by unexpected assignments that were not on the syllabus or deadlines that did not align with the syllabus. There were also some mixed directions, like being told we would have to memorize an entire poem in Spanish the day before we would have to recite it before the class when in reality we would actually only read it aloud from our computers. It was unnecessary added stress.",
                "I would because it is necessary on the path of reaching fluency, but be prepared to really immerse yourself everyday.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes! And try to get Virginia Santos. She's awesome if you like to learn in a more natural way than through textbook studying."
