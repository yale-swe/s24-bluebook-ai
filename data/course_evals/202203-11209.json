                "It covers science basics so everyones on the same page before getting to the material for the day which helps so much, serving as either review or a quick sum up of what you need to understand whats coming. All the examples were super interesting and helped provide ways to understand material that wasn't just memorizing facts and definitions but just finding out cool things nature does and how.",
                "Lectures were clear, concise, and a joy to participate in.  Discussion sections were also extremely helpful in clarifying any concepts and resolving confusion.  One or two classes might have been a bit rushed, but the class proceeds at a very manageable pace overall.",
                "Strength: Professor Munoz! Her lectures are so engaging and she is probably the best lecturer at Yale. She is also super understanding and friendly",
                "I don't think this class has any weaknesses at all. Content was presented at a perfect rate and the weekly quizzes/written assignments were a great way to apply the knowledge we learned. The two midterms felt very fair and allowed you think about content in new ways. I know some people didn't love the grading scheme (each point on an assignment equates to one point of your final grade) but I thought it made figuring out how I had done very simple.",
                "The entire teaching team was incredible. Prof. Muoz approached this course with so much care, compassion, and enthusiasm which made this course outstanding. I appreciated the format of the course with biweekly quizzes and assignments to keep us up to date on the content.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course is that sometimes the content could have been ordered slightly differently to facilitate learning. It often felt like we weren't learning discrete units, which on the one hand I appreciate since all of the concepts that we were learning are connected in some ways, but it did make it a little harder to study.",
                "I think this course has many strengths. The professor was very passionate, the TA was very helpful, and the course was well-taught. I think that the point system made the grading a bit less representative of a student's knowledge since if you got a few questions wrong on an exam, you would already be in a B range.",
                "Strengths: amazing lectures, manageable workload and good format (quizzes, assignments, two exams), great professor and TF. \r\nWeaknesses: I thought the discussion section was unnecessary and usually not a great use of time (also it was at 8:20am on Monday morning!)",
                "I have no complaints. This class was AMAZING. \r\nStrengths: Dr. Muoz is a force of nature. She is energetic, caring, and lightning quick. She knows how to connect with students and her teaching style lectures with some breakout exercises. The assignments are very fair though the first exam felt too long for the time we had.",
                "Strengths were that all the content was interesting and easy to understand by the professor \r\nWeakness was that the slides were not easy to understand unless you attended the lecture which makes it difficult if you have to miss a class or reviewing slides",
                "The case studies explored in the course were very engaging and memorable ways to engage with the course's topics of focus. Compared to other biology courses, this course also emphasized conceptual knowledge more than memorization, which is a big strength of the course for me."

If nothing else, you have the chance to simply take in all the wonders of the natural world.  The class deepens your appreciation for all the improbable evolutionary twists and turns that makes all the stunningly diverse creatures on our planet what they are.",
                "Yes.",

                "Absolutely! You learn so much about the animal world and come out each time with a sense of awe for how cool our planet is. Dr. Munoz is an absolute gem and simply being in the class to hear her is worth it.",
                "I absolutely would, if the student is interested in E&EB. I took this course only because it was required for my track in the major, but I do think it's very well taught and structured.",
                "I would! It was refreshing to take a course that was taught with such interest and passion.",

There is some overlap with comparative anatomy but Dr. Muoz takes you leaps and bounds beyond into the wonderful world of physiology. Take this class!",
                "Yes if it matches their interests, it's a very informative course",
                "Yes, Professor Muoz is an extremely engaging lecturer and her passion for biology is contagious. This course is a great way to explore the power of evolutionary thinking and the wide range of diversity in organisms."
