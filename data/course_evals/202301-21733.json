                "I practiced core skills in music theory, including chord and rhythm recognition.",
                "Professor Adams Music 218 class teaches students to think critically about music theory in new ways while sharpening their ear training, sightreading, and musicianship skills. It is the perfect course for any musician aspiring to think more intuitively about chords, harmonies, and rhythm; this class helps you develop a natural feel for the harmonies and chords in a passage based on listening alone. I would absolutely recommend this course!",
                "I learned so much about music theory by taking this course and it has really enriched the way I understand music. The most important element of this course, to me, was learning how chords fit together and the traditional relationships between them. This has really supported me as a songwriter. However, I also enjoyed how Professor Adam emphasized how these rules were sometimes broken. The emphasis was on understanding the music and not understanding the systems of analysis. It was like this whole new language and I found the course very worthwhile."

                "This course's main strength is the time it offers to practice the skills we learn about in-class.",
                "I wish class time was focused more on the actual ear training instead of music theory. The music theory part of it was likely helpful for some but I wish that would be kept for MUSI 110 and this class could be more of the dictation and singing exercises, since that is the main reason I took the course.",
                "I liked that the course had a more laid back atmosphere which made me more willing to take time to make mistakes and learn, without the added pressure of getting everything correct. I feel it might be improved with some more take home assignments to get more individual practice that you can take as much time as you need on.",
                "This is, simply put, an extremely pleasant course. I was never super stressed in class, and Prof. Adams was very nice.",
                "The course was well-structured to suit the individual backgrounds and needs of every student, such that each student found their own unique way with regards to gaining new insight from the course instruction.",
                "This class couldve used a little more structure and variation, as the class sort of trailed off and became quite repetitive after the fourth or fifth week.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is the time Professor Adam devotes to helping each of his students hone their skills, devoting class time to dictations and sight reading. The class is a perfect balance of lecture-style and interactive learning that helps us all become the best musicians we can.",
                "The strength of this course is how it focuses on understanding and hearing music in a casual environment, allowing students to get a lot out of the course. A weakness is that some of the things we are tested on feel too skill-based and I think there may be more creative ways of assessing what we got out of the class.",
                "The course pre-assumes knowledge of music theory that is incompatible for students that have only taken MUSI 110. In-class dictations and development of aural skills is not adequate training to succeed in this course, and instead requires years of musical practice."

                "Yes, absolutely! Music 218 is one of my favorite courses Ive taken at Yale. Professor Adam is welcoming and enthusiastic; he does everything he possibly can to help each and every one of his students succeed. Every other student I know in the class loved it as well!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any students looking to improve as a musician, songwriter, or music enthusiast. If it doesn't totally change the way you hear music, it certainly refines it. Having the language to talk about the music you are hearing is so important for anyone who cares about music."
