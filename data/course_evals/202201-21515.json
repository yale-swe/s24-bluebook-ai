                "The films we watched in the class were interesting and I liked the analysis we did of them. What didnt work as well was the connection to our work. It was difficult to put into practice the things that we learned from reading and watching adaptations. It just felt like there were a lot of things that werent being said.",
                "The class is structured very well, but the one thing that could have been nice is if there was a screening component. We were supposed to watch the films on our own, which is fine, but just ends up being on a computer. If there was just a weekly mandatory screening, like other film classes, the course would be even better.",
                "A weakness: the writing workshop aspect was a bit unorganized, sometimes you might only get one comment on your piece whereas discussion of someone elses could go on 15 minutes. \r\n\r\nStrength: getting to present on an adapted film of your own choosing was a great way to apply what Id learned through the semester and think heavily about all the aspects that went into the adaptation.",
                "I loved the way this course was structured. I'm invested in improving my screenwriting abilities because I'm interested in writing as a career, and so I really just wanted more time to spend on this course when I felt pulled away by other courses."

                "If youve taken a screenplay writing course, then I think you would get a lot out of this course, but its definitely not catered towards beginners.",
                "Yes, if you enjoy watching films! Screenwriting is one of those in order to be a good writer you have to read a lot, having familiarity with film and scripts will help you get more out of this course, since we dont go over a lot of specific styles of script language or tropes or scenes."
