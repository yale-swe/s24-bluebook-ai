                "This course was pitched as a reading course and delivered in that respect. There was significant reading on Congress and Congressional history. I think I also improved as a writer and political science thinker.",

                "I much greater appreciation of the rules, both implicit and explicit, that govern Congress and federal legislating in the United States",
                "I learned a ton about the history of congress. The course also covered contemporary political dilemmas like polarization, redistricting, filibustering, etc.",
                "Enormous insights about the nature of the American political system, and the impact of different dynamics and conflicts on how Congress has been shaped as an institution, as well as its relationship with other parts of American government and with the public.",
                "This course gave me a solid understanding of the history of the U.S. Congress and how the institution has changed over time. Aside from the historical aspect of the course, I also learned a lot about the structure of Congress and present-day politics. The comment papers were an opportunity to engage with the text, and I found that my writing improved over the course of the semester.",
                "I learned more about the development of Congress and how certain Presidents were seen in the time they presided as compared to modern day times. I was surprised to see how drastic the difference was in some cases.",
                "Through this course, I learned more about when Congress acts, or doesn't, in regards to enacting U.S. public policy or serving as an institutional check to the other branches of the federal government - particularly the Executive Branch. The class focused on analyzing the historical record, as well as contemporary secondary sources, to view the role of the historians and the media in choosing what is emphasized to the general public.",
                "I read a lot about American congressional history and political history in general. I also became more comfortable discussing my opinions with other students, who are much more knowledgable than myself about American politics.",
                "I learned about the different incentives that motivate the members of congress. How do public opinion, and procedural rules affect the legislation that comes out of congress? Furthermore, I learned techniques to draw conclusions about these trends. Beyond his beautiful writing and wonderful perspectives, my favorite of Mayhew's talents is his ability to answer a question using the simplest method possible. The power of his conclusions come from the simplicity of the methods he uses to consider data as well as his great analysis of the different elements that effect individual data points. Through reading his work and hearing him talk, I learned how to find the simplest way to test a conjecture.",
                "Going into the course I had close to zero knowledge about the history of Congress but I learned a ton in this course. I especially liked our discussions on certain political phenomena like party polarization, filibustering, incumbency advantage, etc."

            "comments": [
                "The class discussions are not really structured. The conversation do not seem to flow and rather jump around often. Because the reading load is heavy, it seems not everyone is an expert on the same material and that makes it hard to follow discussions.",
                "Strengths: The readings were interesting, and discussion was generally interesting and informative.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the discussion was a bit stale, and it felt like the class went on for too long.",
                "The comment papers were an excellent way to drive class discussions, and created a suitable workload for this seminar.",
                "Professor Mayhew is a national treasure. Any chance to take a course with him is a chance worth taking. Would I have preferred a few more narrative histories and fewer dense political science articles? Absolutely. But ultimately, the draw of this course is less about what you read and more about who you discuss it with.",
                "No weaknesses. Professor Mayhew has an encyclopedic and near inhuman knowledge of congress. His thoughts on each week's readings are super interesting and valuable.",
                "Strengths: Professor Mayhew. An inspirationally knowledgeable scholar and passionate lecture. Excellently curated readings with a broad base. \r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "Professor Mayhew is obviously incredibly knowledgeable about the subject, and I found that his insights were valuable, as well as his clear passion for Congress. That was a big strength of the course, as was the assignment structure, which I really enjoyed-- it allowed me to write about topics that I was particularly interested in. I think a weakness of the course is that in-class discussion is not very structured; at times, I found discussion to be incredibly productive and engaging (such as the final class, when we talked about Watergate), but at other times, it was just the professor lecturing to us. While Mayhew's knowledge is valuable, that can be tedious in a 2-hour seminar.",
                "Some strengths of this course include the pace and the Professor. Professor Mayhew is really knowledgeable in this field so it made discussions with him all the more rewarding and insightful.",
                "The greatest strength about this course, by far, is the instructor - Professor David Mayhew. Professor Mayhew's contributions to the course, and the field of political science in general, cannot be understated. The professor provides insightful feedback on coursework, and makes excellent contributions during the seminar - allowing students to the lead the conversation, while facilitating it to ensure students have all the necessary context. Additionally, the reading selections were excellent and all very interesting in their own right. As for improvements, the only two are that the reading load can be a bit much, especially towards the end of the semester. Professor Mayhew warns students about this, so it's no surprise, however, there is quite a bit of reading to do. Also, since it is a seminar setting, the class should be held in a space more conducive for seminars. This semester, the classroom did not have enough tables or space to accommodate all students, which made it difficult at times to achieve full participation. This, however, is more of an operational or administrative suggestion, not necessarily reflective of the content of the course itself.",
                "I appreciated that the workload for this class was customizable for each student. All you need to do is complete weekly readings (on average it was 150 pages per week), participate in seminar discussion, and choose 5 weeks to write a 3-5 page comment essay on the assigned readings. I rarely felt overwhelmed by this class because I could plan to work on these essays during my less busy weeks. It would take me around 4-6 hours per week to complete the reading, and another 3-5 to write an essay. Professor Mayhew always provides feedback on essays within 2-3 days of submission.",
                "Mayhew is the strength of this course. He knows every fact there is to know about Congress, but more importantly he has wonderful insights about all the facts he knows. He leads wonderful discussions every week and assigns great readings. The two narrative readings at the end of the semester, although very long, are very fun and teach a lot about the forces at work in Congress.\r\n\r\nThe only downside of the class is that as the semester ramps up, many students do not do all the readings. Furthermore, as the semester went on, students started to pay less attention to the conversation and instead did other work on their laptops or merely played games. I think Mayhew should ban all screens in his seminar. This cannot force students to do the reading but it does force them to pay attention.",
                "Strengths: amazing professor, interesting content, reasonable workload, flexibility in when we wanted to write our papers.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes class discussion would feel a bit all over the place. More structure would've been good."

                "It depends. If a student is willing to read a lot and wants to learn through scholarship, Professor Mayhew has a long list to interesting articles and books. His knowledge is also invaluable as one of the country's leading experts on Congressional history.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in american history and congress. Professor Mayhew is incredibly knowledgeable, so definitely take the class if you get the chance to!",
                "Absolutely - the opportunity to learn from Professor Mayhew is one that is hard to pass up. Additionally, the course provides a lot of insights and perspectives into Congress that one may not acquire from other courses or general reading.",
                "If you are interested in a book club for the Congressional news of the day filled to the brim with politicos who listen to The Daily every morning and the NPR Politics podcast every night, then yes! If you want a class that turns your understanding of federal politics completely upside down, maybe look elsewhere.",
                "Absolutely. You probably won't find someone that knows more about Congress in the entire country. Professor Mayhew is a legend and you should take his course while he still teaches.",
                "Yes, you get a lot of freedom in how you want the course to look for you and what you want to get out of it.",
                "100% yes! If you're even vaguely interested in Congress or American political history, take this course.  And make sure to go to Prof. Mayhew's office hours, even if just to chat.\r\nAnother excellent feature of this course is how customisable it is. The paper assignments are extremely open ended: you can write more or less any kind of response to any combination of the readings. That means you can tailor your exploration to the themes, individuals,  time-periods or details that particularly interest you.",
                "I think that if you are a political science student or a history student interested in U.S. government, this is an incredibly valuable course because you are poised to take advantage of Professor Mayhew's knowledge and experience. As someone who is neither of those things (I am a history major, but not specializing in U.S. government-related themes), I felt that I was not quite as equipped to do so; although I learned a lot about Congress over the course of the semester, a lot of the readings are very granular and not necessarily productive to my understanding. This is less of an introduction/summary of Congressional history and more of a granular exploration of specific case studies and change over time, which I think a student more well-versed in Congress would be better prepared to take advantage of.",
                "Yes; it is well taught and provides great oportunities to improve your writing and speaking skills.",
                "Yes, I would strongly recommend this course to any student interested in the role of Congress on American life throughout U.S. history. This course is particularly excellent for political science, history, or American studies students. I would especially encourage students to take this course when taught by Professor David Mayhew, as the professor brings invaluable insight to the course. The seminar setting allows students to delve into conversations and topics they feel are important as they relate to the course. Overall, this is one of the greatest political science courses offered at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Mayhew is brilliant. I think I learned more in this course than any other, and hes so darn charming!",
                "Professor Mayhew is a legend. Course texts are engaging and not overwhelming. Feedback is thorough and helpful. Would recommend!",
                "Yes. Any class with Mayhew, I am sure, would be wonderful. There is no better class for studying congress.",
                "Yes, Professor Mayhew is one of the giants in the field and it was absolutely fantastic to have the opportunity to take a class with him. I didn't think I'd like congressional history but the material was fascinating, especially the more theory-oriented parts."
