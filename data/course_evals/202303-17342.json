                "Ability to think critically about English and people's perception of its history, evolution, and usage. Ability to write about these observations in a variety of formal and informal styles and for a variety of audiences."

                "Strengths: not too much work, taught interesting concepts, was very useful for thinking about the social implications of language. Very seminar-based (so lots of discussion on readings and debate about concepts\/ideas introduced by readings). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the readings were a little bit long and didn't really illustrate the points Prof. Grund was trying to get across. Definitely follow assignments\/rubrics to a T unless you want points deducted. Also be really specific in your writing.",
                "Weakness : a little too much writing for a course not for writing credit, and sometimes has unexpected grading. \r\nStrength: very considerable and profound topics talked in class, very well organized unitsdefinitely learned a lot.",
                "Professor Grund worked hard to make this class very conducive to learning, from asking us to recall five things covered in the previous class each time we met, to making time to meet us outside of office hours whenever we needed to. The feedback I received on all my work was very detailed, and class discussions were very engaging.",
                "It is a great seminar with a lot of interesting discussions, that is the most fun part of the class and the way you learn the most. \r\nI would say it could be improved by maybe helping us make better overviews and better understand the readings.\r\nI think the best part of the course in terms of work and assignments was the research project, one that I wish we could have maybe had more time for one on one meetings or maybe had the option to meet during reading week or so.",
                "I  think nearly everything was a strength; professor, class size, course structure, style of instruction, work schedule, the only thing I didnt like was the 9 am meeting time.",
                "Structured excellently, and builds intensity appropriately, especially for a first-year seminar. I wish class discussion was slightly more structured but it works well enough and certainly builds relationships."

                "I would, but definitely try to follow Professor Grund's advice and rubrics pretty closely... I feel like sometimes I may have interpreted things differently or done something a little bit differently than he had imagined\/had wanted and that resulted in a deduction of points (where the assignment\/rubric may have just been subjective and up to interpretation). If you are interested in the history and development of English and sociolinguistics, I would definitely recommend it. Aside from what was mentioned above, Professor Grund was very understanding and accepting about extensions, help, etc.",
                "I would, but only if the student is enjoying writing.",

                "YES! It was an incredible, fun, rewarding course. Its a great introduction to courses at Yale, being a First Year Seminar, and one of the major highlights of my first semester at college!",
                "Yes. I think it was a great way of socially approaching linguistics and the English language. If one is not super set on linguistics as a major but is a topic theyre interested in, its a good choice for exploration.",
                "yes",
                "Absolutely. The course was engaging and fun without being punishingly difficult. Great intro course to ENGL and LING.",
                "Yes: encourages you to consider the very real-world implications of speech and language, especially in such an accessible topic. Makes for a much more informed participant in conversations about \"proper\" English. Also introduces the level of intellectual rigor expected of a Yale student and introduces you to a group of peers with whom you will bond."
