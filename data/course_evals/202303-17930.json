                "Stregths: GREAT QR! Interesting, applied... You work with real-world Data in HWs and use statistical software to do the math. The focus is on applied data, not tedious things like numbers. Again, TAKE THIS AS YOUR QR if you're humanities! Dr. Gee releases the midterm/exam questions 24 hours in advance so you can process it (great for people with test anxiety) and chooses engaging assignments.",
                "Strengths: very(!) well-organized, homework, lectures, exams, and final projects all fit well together. A perfectly taught course. Amazing.",
                "The only weakness of this course is that it teaches SPSS, and this only applies if you need to take a course in the future that will need R.",
                "Professor Gee was a huge asset to this course. She was an incredibly engaging and kind professor, always open to any questions. The TFs were a weakness. They were not very knowledgable in the course material and would at times give conflicting information.",
                "The class was comprehensive and focused a lot on real-world applications. However, the concepts we learned in the final few weeks of class seemed a bit rushed.",
                "The strengths of this course are the weekly assignments and labs that always closely followed what we learned in class and taught us how to apply the information.",
                "Strengths of the course include interesting course material, straightforward lecture style, and accessible material that was easy to practice. Weaknesses of the course include tedious lab sections and overly-accessible lectures (to the point where lecture attendance no longer became compulsory).",
                "Strengths included the organization of the class and structure of the course.",
                "The class was great! The lecture was well-paced, Prof. Gee explained all the concepts and tests so as to make learning easy, and the homeworks and sections truly reflected what we were expected to learn.",
                "Very manageable course load, opportunities to improve and receive feedback, varied homework assignments that expose students to research in psych field. Could be confusing without the use of the lab guides.",
                "I liked that it wasn't just your typical stats class. Prof. Gee makes sure to include real-life applications of all of our statistical analysis> There is help available through EdThreads and so much support from the TFs.",
                "Weekly psets and sections did a good job recapping the topics taught in class.",
                "I thought it was great",
                "The course was exceptionally structured and organized. Communication between Professor Gee and the TFs was very clear and timely, and the lab section materials were especially helpful. Homeworks were posted promptly and feedback was very clear. Also, we were very well prepared for the final project and grading was also very quick.",
                "This is a wonderful course -- you are provided with a broad overview of stats and great steps are taken to ensure student comprehension. Take this as a QR!!",
                "Very engaging and well organized.",
                "this course was well organized, each grading and canvas posting submission was on time. the TFs grading comments were very helpful on homework assignments. the lectures were easy to follow, and the labs were extremely helpful in reviewing what we learned in class. i wish this class did not have both a final in class exam and a final project. i believe assigning two large items at the end of the semester was very stressful for students. i would have preferred one midterm exam and then either one final exam or one final project. the structure of these assignments were very similar so it felt repetitive.",
                "Strengths: the instructor! Dr. Gee is super engaging one-on-one. Well-organized course. Slides were clear. Receptive to student feedback. Instructions were super clear, and when they weren't, were changed. Awesome!! Lectures were recorded as well, which was lovely. While I only used them for when I was sick/had an overlapping interview, overall was good.\r\nWeaknesses: No office hours on the weekends (I was unable to go to any office hours during the semester because they always coincided with a class. I think if I went to office hours, I would not have gotten nearly as many unnecessary points off on homework as I did this semester)",
                "The lectures were relatively engaging. I enjoyed seeing the psychological applications of statistics. I also felt like I knew my TA well and grew closer to her throughout the course of the semester.",
                "The labs were the most helpful",
                "One strength of this course was how lab sections helped me better understand what we went over in lectureI felt that after lab I was more confident in running tests and being able to explain what they mean. The availability of materials on Canvas (lab keys, lecture slides, etc.) was also super helpful! One thing that could be improved is the speed at which lectures were conductedalthough I eventually felt like I had a stronger grasp on the material, sometimes I felt that lecture went too fast.",
                "Loved this class! Prof Gee is a really good instructor and made the class really engaging",
                "Strengths:\r\n-The exams really built on the homeworks and labs so were straightforward to study for\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Prof Gee spent a lot of time on course announcements and such which was a complete waste of lecture time and could have been in an email. This sometimes took up 10 minutes or more. \r\n- The first few lectures could have been compressed into one prerequisite - material like the mean, mode and median should not be being taught at college - it was necessary so could have been required previewing",
                "This class was so well organized and provided so many opportunities for practice and for you to understand the material. The labs were incredibly helpful for filling in any gaps or confusion in the lecture and was very hands-on. The structure of the exams was perfect and allowed me to focus on conducting the tests and interpreting the data rather than frantically writing. Love Professor Gee!",
                "Strength: Professor Gee, class organization, everything was perfect and tailored to help us succeed",
                "Prof. Gee cares deeply about her students and is so patient and kind. I enjoyed the format of the course, especially the final project at the end. The lab sections sometimes felt a bit dry (this is where we learn how to use SPSS), but as the course went on they began to feel more related to what we were learning about in lecture, which made them more enjoyable.",
                "Strength: very good pace; labs add on to lecture material.",
                "The course lectures are well-structured. Each lecture centers around a specific statistical concept and each concept logically builds upon the previous one. The teacher's approach to presenting topics is highly effective. Her practice of defining the concept followed by providing examples helps solidify and enhance my understanding of the concept. The lab sections with their practical application and hands-on experience working with SPSS have been particularly helpful for me to learn how to execute what we have learned in class.",
                "No weaknesses! This course is great for anyone studying social science or who wants to see a practical relevant application of statistics.",
                "I think the lectures were a good pace and it was easy to follow.",
                "The lectures at the beginning were very simple compared to the rest of the year. Things like mean and mode were explained in the beginning which are things taught back in elementary and middle school.",
                "I really liked the format of having weekly homework assignments and sections. Having consistent practice running statistical tests absolutely facilitated my learning and understanding. I wish sections were more collaborative though.",
                "good slideshows, more time spent learning correct APA formatting",
                "The lecture slides were detailed and had helpful examples for different statistical tests. The feedback on the homework assignments could have been a bit more detailed.",
                "A strength of the course is that Prof. Gee implemented feedback and listened to the students. A weakness of the course is that it can be fast pace but overall It was a good class.",
                "great intro and overview of stats, great responsive prof, and good working environment",
                "As someone who is interested in the major Psychology, this course was a great way to understand the less conceptual and more real-life aspects of the subject. However, as someone who has never taken a statistics class before, it was a bit fast-paced.",
                "The course is taught well, but there's very little support outside of class.",
                "Strength: We had weekly computer labs as section to learn SPSS.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The lab was very rushed, and there was not good retention. I found myself resorting to YouTube tutorials to reteach me how to use SPSS a few times. \r\n\r\nAnother Weakness: On the problem set, there were many times when Hakan would count me off for points, and I had no idea why. The other TFs would leave feedback so that I at least knew what I was doing wrong and what I could improve on. But many times, I would get a good chunk counted off- like a whole 5 points off or something like that- always from Hakan, with no feedback whatsoever. Other people in the class mentioned it too, so this was not just my problem either lol."

Genuienly, Dr. Gee is the fairest QR professor ever (midterm/final exam completely open note, questions released 24 hrs before, she'll change your midterm grade to your final grade if you do better on the final) and INTERESTING!",

If you need to know the practical application of statistics, particularly, though not exclusively, in the field of psychology, this class is excellent. It also was not so challenging that I felt restrained in my learning ability for the sake of the grade. I genuinely felt like I learned things in this course that were built over time with muscle memory.

                "Every student at Yale should take Statistics. It is duly curated to maximize student performance in understanding. Professor Gee has put the utmost time in care into making this course and so have the TFs. The office hours are very accessible, you get tons of feedback on the Psets, and the midterm and final are basically open note and you can prepare for them beforehand. The final project is literally up to you and you can choose to be in a group or work solo. Any pitfall that happened in this course would be up to the student and I wouldn't call it a gut, but it is very attainable and you will not feel stressed in this course at all. As I said before every Yale student should take this course.",
                "YES!!! I learned so much from Prof Gee and the TFs. I now feel like I have a strong base level understanding of how to run statistical tests, which to us and how to analyze the results in a well formatted report. The workload is manageable and the teaching was clear and helpful. I appreciated that every week the answers to the homework and lab assignments were posted a week after students submitted them. This was very helpful for exam reviews.",
                "Definitely. Super engaging way to start out your journey in Statistics. Please take this before senior year if you can, so you can have the statistical grounding to do your senior essay (if you are hoping to get a B.S.!)",
                "Yes. This class was very manageable and is an interesting intro to statistics.",
                "Yes, if you are a psych major this was really good",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is interested in doing research in psychology or any other type of science. It is super important to be able to make sense of different data and to learn how to design experiments effectively and ethically.",
                "Yes! good foundation to statistics, specifically in the world of psychology. The application of statistics in psychology studies was extremely interesting.",
                "The examples used in fun ; if stats isn't your thing, this class is at least engaging and Prof Gee makes an effort to make sure that the examples and practice problems are all neuro/psych related.",
                "Yes, even if it is not for your major!",
                "Yes! An amazing course especially for students who do not have much background in statistics. As a humanities major I did not think I would be able to be engaged in s course like this, but it was extremely applicable to real-world issues, policy, and advocacy. I especially enjoyed the freedom of the final project.",
                "FOR SURE PLEASE TAKE IT ESPECIALLY IF U LOVE STATS OR PSYCH",
                "If you're interested in gaining a basic understanding of statistics, I would recommend the course! I found it relatively low-stress and I learned a lot.",
                "Yes. This course can introduce students who have completely no knowledge of statistics to learn about it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The course has taught me invaluable knowledge about statistical skills that will definitely be helpful for me in the future especially in the research field. This course is excellent for anyone seeking a solid foundation in statistics.",
                "Absolutely recommend! The course expectations and requirements were made perfectly clear and the way that the exams were arranged was definitely intended to facilitate student success.",
                "Definitely! Especially if you need a statistics course.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students to learn statistics. It was a great introduction to doing research as well.",
                "Yes!",
                "I absolutely would! This course is a great introduction to statistics, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
                "Yes, great teaching staff and clear feedback",
                "Yes because this course isn't very stressful, if you miss a lab or a lecture you can still catch up, and the midterm and final are open note.",
                "I would because Prof. Gee teaches this course very well. I think it is also a good introduction to APA format.",
                "yes, especially if they have not taken stats before in highschool. teaches u good practical skills",
                "Yes, I think it is a fairly doable course that incorporates both aspects of statistical learning and psychological material.",
                "If it's required for your major, yes.  otherwise, take a different stats class.",
                "No. I wish I took a different Statistics (or Data Science) Class to fulfill the stats requirement/prerequisite for the Neuroscience Major. I think I would have preferred learning R instead of learning SPSS, which I found out is a little bit outdated in the neuro field. I would maybe say that this would be a good class to fulfill the Quantitative Reasoning distributional though."
