                "I learned an immense amount of knowledge surrounding the profound change in our climate and the reasons for such drastic changes. Not only that, I think the most valuable thing I took from this class is that there is always something we can do to combat climate change and that the basis of climate change lies in biochemistry. Climate biochemistry is truly an exciting field that will only continue to grow.",
                "How to read a research paper!! As well as numerous different ways that biochemistry can make an impact on climate change, even if the research starts with something as small as tardigrades!",
                "In this class, we discussed various ways to mitigate climate change using biochemistry--from engineering rubisco in plants to creating fake meat. From this, I was able to obtain a wider perspective on how biochemistry can be used in real life and gain interest in climate change work being done.",
                "Knowledge about the biochemical aspects of climate change and how we might be able to employ biochemical methods to address these issues",
                "This course, through the final grant proposal project and the discussion section papers, has taught me systematic scientific thinking stemming from a thorough literature review that not only appreciates the advancements but identifies gaps. Once these gaps have been identified, the course also encourages innovative thinking to create novel research strategies."

                "I thought that digesting each paper was a bit tedious- I think it would be better to maintain a larger view rather than going through each paper though. I thought the lectures were creative and fun- I just think the seminar component shouldnt just be going over papers.",
                "More clear biochemical applications",
                "Strengths: EVERYTHING! Karla is absolutely awesome--she brings so much joy and enthusiasm to the class that anyone in the same space would become passionate about climate change biochemistry. Morgan was an amazing TA. The class was very well-organized with Tuesday journal club and Thursday lectures. The assignments--though I wish I had started earlier--were scientifically intriguing as the class challenges you to write a review paper and a research proposal. Because it's such a small class, I also made so many friends (and Karla fostered an environment to do so).",
                "The strength of this course is found in the layout of the course that introduces topics through a lecture on one day of the week and then follows it up with an article that is read and discussed in discussion section the next day the class meets. With this format, we are kept from looking at topics strictly holistically or strictly detailed, and the course never gets old."

                "I would absolutely take this course again! It helped push me to understand biochemistry through a different lens and think about applications more. The professor and TA were wonderful and went about biochemistry in a very passionate way.",
                "Yes! I think this is a precious course for biochemistry majors to take. You learn so much about the basis of global warming and you get to apply the biochemistry you have learned to the solutions for fighting climate change.",
                "Definitely! You'll gain a new appreciation for our environment and learn about the connections between biochemistry and climate change.",
                "Yes!!! Amazing class, Prof. Neugebauer is absolutely wonderful and very passionate about climate change, so the lectures are very entertaining!",
                "YES YES YES 200 times YES. More people need to take this class because climate change conversation can often go to the abyss, and this class will truly clear out your mind. You'll be able to see how the biochemistry knowledge you learned in previous courses can be applied in real life to better the world--and I mean the WORLD, not just one organism.",
                "Yes, absolutely! It's a very relevant and important topic, and Professor Neugebauer is great lecturer!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. This course has taught me to look beyond the politics of climate change to the science and research that can one day save us from it. Through analyzing research articles in discussion section and brainstorming ideas in lecture, this course has given me the confidence that my ideas can make a difference. Also, the field trips to the Marsh Botanical Garden and East Rock are definitely a highlight of my semester :)"
