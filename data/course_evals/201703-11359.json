   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Because a vast time period is addressed, the lectures tended to be jam-packed.",
    "The class had great potential but it is a little concerning that the lessons have not been updated in years. I felt that the professor was really knowledgeable but it was hard to distinguish what was filler knowledge and what was key to knowing the topic really well. Like one lecturer was spent on talking about the shape of boats, but was that really needed for the core knowledge of the course? probably not.",
    "Strengths: interesting materials, knowledgeable professor, useful framing of themes and historical ideas relevant to many other courses and historical frameworks found here at Yale. Weaknesses: disorganized, dry lectures, not a lot of guidance on writing assignments and quizzes.",
    "This class is really interesting. At first, I thought the readings were a little dry, but as the semester went on I really began to enjoy them. Professor Schwartz is great!",
    "The course was structured like a typical Yale lecturenot great. Being in the course felt like I was just being talked to and not really absorbing a lot of information. I ended up not going to lecture and cramming the night before the final. The course really could have benefitted from some more active learning activities like turn and talks and other such activities to engage students more. In general, professors should really learn how to teach.",
    "Strengths - important material, very interesting readings, great section leaders\r\n\r\nWeakness - very high workload that was too close together, could easily remove one assignment or make it such that the exams\/essays weren't so close to each other. Also, the lecture didn't have a very good structural backbone which made it hard to follow. Also wasn't particularly engaging.",
    "Strengths: Bringing in complexity to one's understanding of a complex time period and geographic region, as well as its implications\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved with more guidance on the second essay (8-10 pages), e.g. regarding expected use of primary vs. secondary sources. More specificity in general about what to expect would be appreciated-- the ID's on the final were substantially more difficult than what I expected based on the midterm and section.",
    "I think the first half of the course is stronger than the second. The study of encounter was great but as the geography in question became broader everything got more generalized and repetitive. Would have liked to do some more case studies of specific cities perhaps and more on the independence movement. \r\nLectures are generally good and section is effective most of the time but discontinuities between lecture, reading, and section sometimes hurt the course.",
    "The reading selection was amazing and all of the books were so cool and had a lot of perspectives I hadn't seen before.  Sometime the timing between readings and lectures was mismatched, and section and lecture felt like 2 separate classes.",
    "Strengths: really engaging lectures, several great readings, and an okay section. \r\nImprovements: more clarity of structure and syllabus (which readings go with which week, full citations for the readings, etc). More synthesis work in section\/lecture to contextualize specific stories would also be great.",
    "Needs better syllabus\r\nNeeds realistically sized readings (200 pages per week is not manageable for students)\r\nNeeds longer lecture time"

   "comments": [
    "This is one of the best history classes youll take. It is a lot of reading, but the class is extremely interesting and rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the history of colonial Latin America",
    "No. This class was really hard to follow. However, if you are looking for a preindustrial class that is not about entirely about Europe this is the class for you.",
    "I took this course to satisfy the History Preindustrial requirement and because I thought it would be more interesting than other pre-1800 courses (i.e. \"Roman Republic\" or \"Early Modern England.\" I went into the course expecting it to be good-but-not-greatand it was just that. In other words, it met my expectations but did not exceed them. On the one hand, the material is fantastic and Professor Schwartz is a fountain of knowledge. I wish I spent more time getting to know him because he is so well informed. On the other hand, the lectures tended to be disorganized, there was a lot of pretty dry reading, and tests were somewhat unpredictable. This is to say that there are certainly better classes out there, but \"Colonial Latin America\" offers a useful and solid overview of Latin American history.",
    "Yes -- fun class that isn't too difficult. Professor Schwartz is really sweet and an interesting lecturer.",
    "Yes, if you're interested (but perhaps not already super-knowledgable) in Spanish\/Spanish-American history. I think I have a pretty solid understanding of pre-Columbian society, the colonial era, and the early independence movements now.",
    "Yes, but would qualify that with the critique from question 3. \r\nI think its an important region and period more people should focus on and would generally encourage others to take this",
    "Yes, I loved this course!  The lectures were so interesting and engaging, and the readings were all incredible.  The workload was not to bad at all and you could pick any topic for the research paper which was super cool.",
    "Yes, definitely! I learned a lot about various different issues in colonial Latin America, including the role of race, class, and gender, as well as the effects of trade and natural resources. Prof. Schwartz is a lively and engaging lecturer, and section was somewhat fun. The midterm and final were very straightforward, typical history lecture tests. The 1st paper was an easy primary source paper, though the 2nd one was a bit longer and more involved (felt almost like the expectation was for a full seminar paper in 8 pages). There were a ton of assigned readings, but you really didn't have to do all or even most of them. However, the readings that I did do were, for the most part, super interesting! Overall, a very solid history lecture--nothing mind blowing, but interesting, fairly graded and pleasant!",
