                "Strengths: small class size enabled us to bond and get to know each other's film style. Also enabled deep critique of each assignment. I really liked the two-week structure where the first draft was not graded, because the feedback was really valuable for improving the project.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not the fault of this class but film equipment was really hard to get ahold of since they were mostly limited at the CCAM. You really don't realize how many resources a film needs until you try to make one. Also, I had a lot of anxiety about getting actors for my films because it is a lot of time to ask of someone when I didn't have that much to give myself...",
                "This is one of only a few production film courses offered at yale, so it's already got that going for it. The problem is with the class organization: class time is dominated by critiquing each others film. We typically spend the entire 4 hour class time critiquing each other's films, which comes out to roughly half an hour per film, which becomes tedious, and not rarely pointless. Class time would be much better spent focused on the craft, and discussing choices that can make us become better directors, instead of just critiquing our already finished films. The textbook, also, is pointless - every other film course at Yale has a philosophical textbook about film theory, I would have wished that the textbook for this class be more practical instead of theoretical."

                "If you enjoy making films, take this class. Unfortunately, the class time isn't highest quality, but the responsibility of making a film basically every week is daunting yet exciting for a dedicated film major. If the chance to make a film sounds fun and unfatiguing, take the class, if only for  the weekly film assignments. Don't expect an easy class - between story, writing, storyboarding, casting, scouting, directing, shooting, acting, editing, color-grading, etc expect to spend 10-12 hours per week minimum doing physically and mentally exhausting work."
