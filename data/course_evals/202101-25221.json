For the theoretical side, we studied early theories of sovereignty (Machiavelli, Bodin, Hobbes), and then moved into German theory of modern iterations of sovereignty and the exception (Schmitt, Weber, Agamben) and literary form (Jolles, Benjamin).  All this came together in class discussions where we applied the theories and discussed broader themes of the book.",

                "This class was awesome. The A Song of Ice and Fire were amazing, and our discussions on them were always interesting and thought provoking. The theoretical readings could be tough at times, but they were a valuable component of the class and really lent valuable context to the story and lenses through which we could view it. My one suggestion would be that the introductions/introductory presentations could be a bit long or dry at times, but they were usually helpful and class always picked up once we moved into discussion.",
                "I think the discussion based format of the course was extremely engaging, and led to  really interesting ideas being shared throughout class. However, I felt that the course had too many readings, and would have from more theoretical readings and also maybe even a watching of video essays or the Game of Thrones HBO series.",
                "This course was fantastic! The professor, TF, and other students were all very engaging and the subject material was so much fun to discuss! The readings may seem overwhelming at first, but they are achievable and the pace at which the class clipped along felt just right.",

Professor Wetters is incredibly helpful, interesting and does not dominate the conversation (very interactive). The only issue may have been the quantity of reading, however that was a bit of an unavoidable problem considering the books we had to get through."

Since this was a seminar the format was already better for zoom than a lecture but smaller discussions are always better for conversation I have found on zoom.

I came into this class having only read the first book and seeing exactly none of the TV show, some students had read all the books and seen the whole show, and some came in completely blind, but everyone brought valuable perspectives and insights to the class. Second, the weekly homework was a theoretical reading and ~200 pages of the series. The theory reading were sometimes tough but usually interesting, and the books were literally pleasure reading that we got super into. The larger assignments were a couple papers and a presentation, and the feedback on all of them was some of the best I've ever gotten. Third, class itself was interesting and lively despite being a 9 a.m., and the group of people we had was an awesome mix  Fourth, Professor Wetters and Benjamin were great--super knowledgeable, but also considerate and kind. All in all, amazing class. If you get the chance, take it.",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to any and all students interested in reading A Song of Ice and Fire. It's kind of crazy realizing how many themes of power exist within the A Song of Ice and Fire Universe, and discussing this piece of fiction in this academic context is eye-opening and mind-blowing. Plus, Professor Wetters is extremely caring and knowledgable",
                "Yes! This course is a great opportunity to read Game of Thrones and have fun analyzing it with other students. If you are interested in political theory and philosohy (as well as fantasy books), then this course is definitely for you!",
                "Yes! Very interesting course and class discussions were very engaging. Kirk is a phenomenal prof",
                "Yes!! The course was very interesting and a great way to learn about a variety of topics through the lens of Game of Thrones.",

                "It's a lot of reading but a really cool course.",
                "Yes, opportunities to close-read a popular, modern fiction series are rare, and you will also learn German political philosophy as well. This is an incredibly unique course!",
                "Yes, I would recommend it. Even though it is quite a bit of work the material is interesting and Professor Wetters is amazing",
                "Yes",
                "YES this was an amazing course. It was fun and interesting and allowed students to nerd out a little bit about game of thrones while learning the political intricacies of (mostly) German political philosophy. It was the perfect course to take as a Senior and really capped off my Yale experience. I am so glad that I took this and cannot recommend it enough. Professor Wetters is interesting and helpful. The feedback was always incredible, and both professor and TA were always available to help and give feedback. The course was very accommodating and really made the reading and discussion experience enjoyable for all of the students. PLEASE TAKE THIS IF YOU CAN."
