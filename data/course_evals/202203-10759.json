I just feel like a more generally educated person, which I guess is what the liberal arts system is trying to achieve with its distributional requirements.",

                "I think the course could be approved by making more explicit links between The Republic and supplementary readings at education.",
                "90% of the course readings/content are seemingly unrelated to college education or perhaps distantly related - when you enter the course expecting more relevant material, it makes the lectures and readings a bit of a drag",
                "it was a good class",
                "The strengths of the class could also be seen as the weaknesses of the class depending on what you want to get out of it and the reason you are taking it. The course has a very very manageable workload, which in turn means that unless you are putting in a very conscious effort, you will not feel super engaged with the materials and course itself. Nevertheless, the lectures are interesting and you will definitely learn things and become just generally better educated as a human being by taking this class, so it does not feel like a waste of a credit.",
                "The course is great if you are interested in philosophy. The professor asked a lot of interesting questions that really got me thinking.",

The course had an interesting main theme, but students did not seem very engaged during the majority of lectures. There were opportunities to participate, which helped engagement, but overall engagement was low.",
                "This course was extremely succesful in keeping students engaged and active in discussion. There were no notable weaknesses.",
                "An amazing professor and TA and very interesting material and discussion questions.",
                "My discussion section was probably my favorite part of the course, it cleared up things that I missed during lectures. Weakness might be that its sometimes easy to miss things during lecture.",
                "Great engaging lecture and exciting sectioon conversations. \r\n\r\nBoth Dean Lewis and Rachel were great could not recommend more",
                "Strengths: Very inclusive and interactive lecture style. The course being taught by the dean also makes the student feel more seen and included in the college environment especially considering the course is about the purpose of college.\r\n\r\nWould probably flow better for students if the readings that were assignment were looked at more longterm and in depth (instead of a new article or text per lecture).",
                "This course was amazing and I can think of no improvements.",
                "It can be a little hard to improve your papers/assignments due to a lack of clear feedback, so youre kind of stuck with whatever grade you first get. Even in meeting with a TF theyre not super helpful in giving you ways to improve your paper",
                "The course gets more and more engaging as time goes on. However, in the beginning, it's a little difficult to follow Greek philosophical readings and analyze them in the context of college education and its purposes. The lectures near the end were more contemporary and engaging. This course could be improved by mixing in old and new readings together rather than having one half being older readings and other half being newer readings.",
                "I really enjoyed how interactive the lectures were. It made a big space feel small and engaging. I loved the class and I would barely change anything!! The only thing I would chance is the amount of information on the slides. There were some slides for which I couldnt write down all the information in time and some where I felt like there was not enough info!",
                "I like the syllabus, content, and professorall were strengths.",

                "no weaknesses, great class",
                "Strengths: Covered an interesting and broad variety of material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture often seemed disconnected from assignments.",
                "The strengths are the opportunities do discuss with classmates, and the opportunity to talk and get to know Dean Lewis himself.",
                "This course could be a bit more interactive. The readings dont feel extremely helpful to understand lecture.",

                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course. Although the class is primarily filled with upperclassmen, as a first year I think it was a lot more valuable to me in my first semester than it would have been in my last. It allowed me to step into the college classroom and learn about myself while following along with the course lesson.",

                "Yes! As a Yale student, it's very important to understand Yale as an institution, including its history, pedagogy, and intended purposes. This course was fundamental in grounding me as a student here and made me introspect what I came to Yale for more than what my high school self intended.",
                "Yes. I think the information taught is very important for freshman embarking on their college experience. I would highly recommend.",
                "Yes, absolutely, if they need another class or if they want to take a good introductory philosophy course.",
                "yes, its applicable to every student and more about learning and deep thinking than grades or memorizing",
                "Yes, if youre interested in a light course that introduces you to numerous philosophical theories throughout history.",
                "Yes, It is a good class with interesting readings and discussions and not too much work.",
                "I would recommend this course. I think it can get you to think about your college experience more actively and I believe is a good introduction or look into philosophy in an accessible way.",
