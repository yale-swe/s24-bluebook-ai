I learned so much more in this semester than I did in a year of Spanish in high school. I also learned a lot about culture which was interesting and presented in exciting ways.",
                "How to speak spanish.",

I was able to test knowledge through online activities on the VHL website. Additionally, I strengthened my skills in note-taking."

                "This course provided many opportunities to reinforce learning inside the classroom and with homework. It was well run and I learned a lot while having fun.",
                "I think Professor Reymundi is a great teacher. She was really understanding and helped us to learn in a way that was accessible. The first day when the class was entirely in Spanish for the first time it was really intimidating but we got used to it and it made us better. I think a weakness was that some of the activities seemed more like busy work and didnt really help that much. It felt like checking a box. Linguameeting was great though. I think that really helped. I also liked reading the play and watching the movie. The movie was a highlight of the course. I think sometimes important information about submitting homework was sometimes confusing because it would be told to us in Spanish. As long as the professor sends out a canvas announcement or email later repeating the important info it would be fine, but sometimes that wouldnt happen and we would be confused.",
                "I really enjoyed the all-spanish immersive experience in class every single day. It really did force me out of my comfort zone and practice a language that couldn't otherwise be mastered in any other way. \r\nHowever, there were many assignments in this class that had to be completed every single day. While I commend the program's attempt to get students to practice a little Spanish every single day, I do think the frequency of such assignments reduced its effectiveness as I sought to get them do in an efficient manner, without critically thinking about the quality of my assignments.",
                "Good structure and format, but it could be improved by going deeper into certain confusing concepts. Conducting some parts of the class in english would help with understanding especially when explaining new forms.",
                "It was a well organized course. It could have been improved with some more clear announcements of when assignments are due and it would have been much better if assignments could have been unlocked on canvas earlier so that you aren't forced to complete things sometimes in a very strict one day period regardless of other work you may have to complete that day.",
                "The course was well-organized, and by the end I felt like I had learned a lot. One of my weaker spots at the end of the semester was speaking, and I think this is reflected in a weakness of the class. We spent a lot of time working with lectures and doing examples in pairs, but there wasn't a strict policy that all conversation in the class needed to take place in Spanish. A lot of times people would work in English, which I think was a weakness.",
                "One strength of this course was the ability to practice Spanish frequently. I loved that the class was every day. I feel my ability to speak, listen, read, and write in Spanish was definitely strengthened. Another strength of this course was the ability to correct writing exams. One weakness of this course was the due date time for VHL Activities. I wished the assignments were due before class instead of at 7 AM EST. Overall, the strengths outweighed the one weakness regarding due dates."
