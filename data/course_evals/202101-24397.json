                "This was a difficult course to do virtually because we were not able to do any labs in person. It would be nice to have an in-person element. However, the lectures provided a lot of interesting information that supported the key material we had to know for the quizzes.",
                "Course was well organized for learning and review sessions were helpful.",
                "Strengths: simplicity, Sargis and the TA's are kind and helpful\r\nWeaknesses: wish there could be a little more interaction virtually. There probably is more in person.",
                "It was a really well-taught course, despite being virtual.",
                "Strengths: Really great online resources, and very informational slides. It's really easy to go into the slides and online study guides and know exactly what you need to know for the quizzes. \r\nWeaknesses: Over Zoom, it was sometimes difficult to focus during the lectures because most of the info you need to know for quizzes is stuff you just have to memorize.",
