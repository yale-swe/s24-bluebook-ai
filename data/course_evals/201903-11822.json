    "I learned an impressive amount of new grammar structures, conjugations, useful daily vocabulary, and bits and pieces about different hispanic cultures around the world, all of which have helped me build a toolbox for beginning to talk about a wide variety of things. I've learned a lot about how different people learn languages differently, and what specific strategies can be helpful for me.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The workload was manageable and not significantly harder than other Yale classes. If you track your own progress and check off all the tasks on the syllabus as soon as possible every day, you'll be fine. The cultural aspect of the course was very inspiring and helped us learn a lot about the diversity within the hispanic world. The small class-sizes were amazing and it was fun meeting an array of highly diverse peers. I appreciate how we took some of the more difficult grammar structures slow and compared similar ones.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The textbook was a bit expensive and the price has definitely discouraged some students from taking it. The reading materials were sometimes too difficult and featured obscure\/obsolete vocabulary; I do, however, greatly appreciate that the instructors have chosen famous pieces of literature (it's very encouraging when we find ourselves being able to understand most of Don Quijote). I was personally worried about speaking, because most of the speaking done in class was very material-specific, whereas it's usually more helpful to start talking about more random and personal things; I was wondering if there could be a mandatory one-on-one tutoring session where we must speak with native speakers, etc.. Finally, I think there could've been more resources shared with students for self-improvement outside of class (like podcasts, radio shows, TV shows, etc.) so we could continue to explore the culture on our own.",
    "Strengths: very engagaging, highly education, very wholistic\r\nWeaknesses: It's a lot of work",
    "Although I understand the value of immersion that justifies the daily assignments, I felt like a significant portion of them was busy work that ultimately did not contribute meaningfully to achieving the course objectives. Strengths include a well-developed and clearly defined syllabus and fantastic teaching.",
    "A strength of this course is its small size. Students are constantly able to interact with everyone in the class, including the instructor. The class was structured in a way that kept the class engaging and challenging.",
    "Strengths was that my professor was incredible! No weaknesses!",
    "It takes up a ton of time",
    "The environment of the class is good it gets students to talk to and interact with classmates"

    "Yes. The day-to-day workflow was surprisingly manageable (anywhere between 20-45 minutes per day), and the online exercises were well-rounded and helpful for absorbing the information discussed in class. I did not, however, learn to prepare for class until much later in the semester. It's very helpful to summarize the conjugations and vocabulary in your notebook, find\/make Quizlet sets to study daily leading up to exams (or even throughout the week you're learning a certain lesson), and actively make yourself memorize things long before you'll actually be tested on it. I also found that not attending language tables and not actively speaking in Spanish outside of class is detrimental to your speaking skills--you truly need to take initiative outside of class in every way possible to improve your language skills. All in all, I enjoyed it very much!",
    "I would! It's very fun and small class size encourages learning. Learned so much more about Spanish culture.",
    "Yes. This class is a wonderful way to learn and practice basic Spanish.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would",
    "Yes, I would recommend. It was very effective in improving my speaking skills, grammatical skills, and cultural knowledge.",
    "I would recommend"
