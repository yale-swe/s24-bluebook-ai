                "I would recommend this course to another student. The class is full of short, engaging, and interesting pieces of creative writing. This is not your typical writing class where you need to have an intro, 3 body paragraphs, and a conclusion. You don't have to make a structure and most of the sources you use are from your personal experiences. Along with this, you get to explore yourself as a writer which I personally enjoyed."
