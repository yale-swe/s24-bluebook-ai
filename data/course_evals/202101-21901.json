                "Strength: interesting material, a nice mix of speaking and writing\r\nWeakness: it sometimes feels like there is a lot of material to cover, and we do not have enough time to cover everything in class. So lots of self studying.",
                "I really enjoyed many of the readings/films selected for this course. The professor was very kind in encouraging participation, and her assessments were all very fair. The weekly workload is very high, as each homework assignment has multiple parts, and there are many major assessments. However, I felt these helped me maintain a high level of engagement, so I appreciated them.",
                "The strengths of the course is the material. The books and movies are very enjoyable and are engaging. The weakness of the course is the difficulty of it. I started off taking French at Yale, and the jump from L4 to L5 is just too difficult. The experience of my other classmates in comparison to me made it very hard to enjoy and learn at my pace.",
                "The course should be built around a theme. There was no theme to the course, so the readings and media felt disconnected, and I wasnt sure why we were reading or watching those materials.",
                "The balance of reading assignments and grammar assignments made a nice compromise between the technical and cultural aspects of the French language. I thought the course was very well-organized, and the progression of texts went in a logical order. The end, however, did feel a little rushed; I would have liked a little more time to discuss our final text that we read. Other than that, perfect class!",
                "the professor is really good and the books that you'll read are amazing and super engaging!",
                "Strengths: engagement with various kinds of media, great professors!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: may not be the most useful for everyday living/conversation in French\r\n\r\nImprovements: incorporating a few more contemporary / casual french conversation opportunities!"
