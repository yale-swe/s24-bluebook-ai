This class met five days a week, and save for the weekly quiz, every day involved new concepts, reading material, and activities. Furthermore, the feedback I received on these assignments was prompt and thorough, and I was able to apply the corrections immediately in my speech and on the weekly quiz. The class was well-rounded in focusing on speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills. My only critique of the course work is that I think we would have benefited from more long-term assignments, such as stories or videos which took multiple days, although I know avoiding this may have been a determination to bolster the engagement of students."
