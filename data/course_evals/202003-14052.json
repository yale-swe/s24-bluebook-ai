                "Learned all the basic principles of the American Presidency, from the unitary executive theory and the deep state, to descriptive representation.

                "I learned about very interesting concepts related to the American presidency that were new to me. My writing also improved thanks to feedback from my professor. The way readings were synthesized in lecture helped me change the way I approached the readings for the better.",
                "This class teaches its students about how the American presidency has evolved over time. In addition, the course offers much information on what both the literal and implied roles of the current American president include.",
                "I learned so much in this course! Considering how central the presidency has become in the news and politics, this course is so relevant to current events and it gives you the tools to think critically about the presidency and its powers.",
                "This course really helped me think deeply about the presidency and how that affects politics today. I really loved taking this course during an election year and getting to have so much insight on the election.",
                "I learned how the presidency has changed over political history in great detail",
                "My writing and particularly my use of evidence in an argumentative essay improved tremendously. Professor Dearborn is an expert on archival methods and encouraged me to dive into primary source evidence to substantiate my opinions on the presidency. He also has an insane amount of knowledge about the development of the presidency and key ideas that drove that development. Splendid course.",
                "Deeper ideas of the Presidency through primary source readings & classroom discussion.",
                "Learned about the theoretical basis of the powers of the president and how those powers have been contested over time.",
                "I developed greater insight into the historical foundation of many of the norms and practices in the office of the presidency today. I would say this is a really good foundational course too if you don't know a lot about how government works.",
                "I learned key ideas influencing the development of the American presidency and how to think critically about change over time.",
                "One of the best courses that I've taken at Yale. I learned about the various constitutional, historical, and ideational origins of the institution of the modern presidency. Especially during the fall of the 2020 election season, this course was quite well-designed to fit the themes of the campaign and the broader questions that political observers have been asking for years. It covered both historical and normative ideas that have influenced how we should view the presidency and presidents today, and the focus on the legal\/constitutional origins was particularly helpful for contextualizing the powers of the presidency in a world where constitutional law becomes a hot topic every time the president does something, which, as I learned from this course, happens often. The course covered a great deal of material, from executive prerogative to the Unitary Executive Theory, and it kept all the content fun and interesting by linking every concept to something that actually happened in U.S. politics recently. Also, scattered pop culture references and the occasional meme kept class interesting, a much needed change from the humdrum routine of Zoom classes."

                "Strengths: John is an amazing lecturer who knows his discipline in-and-out, the readings are very engaging and appropriate and well-selected, the format\/structure of the class (with 45mins~ lecture, then discussion) works very well, available for office hours, etc. Weakness: I am having a hard time finding a weakness for this class. All in all, amazing!",
                "The content is fascinating, highly relevant, and incredibly well taught by Professor Dearborn. However, class discussions often strayed away from the most interesting readings and towards a more inane discussion of current events (often only tangentially linked to that week's content).",
                "Strengths: interesting course material that the prof was passionate about which made the lecture and seminar very engaging. most readings were actually straightforward and not clouded in ambiguity with a lot of flowery academic language. the class did a great job at balancing our discussion of the general course material and current events which could have easily overshadowed our discussion of the actual class material given that it was an election year.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "This class was excellent! Professor Dearborn would start the class with a lecture to explain the main themes of all the readings before beginning the discussion portion of the class. He also gave us space to ask questions and discuss current events as it related to presidential politics, including the 2020 election and the aftermath. It was so clear that Professor Dearborn cares about our learning and wanted us to use the course material to apply it to current events. He would also bring up any internship or volunteer opportunities he thought we would find interesting and always made clear that he would be happy to speak with us outside of class about career aspirations, class material, or anything else. This course honestly doesn't need any improvement.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. Professor Dearborn is great and I really liked the assignments.",
                "The course was excellently taught, and the student engagement was extremely high. I learned a ton from both the professor and the students with informative lectures and great class discussions.",
                "This is the best seminar I've had at Yale by a pretty significant margin, and I've been in some other stellar seminars. Strengths were how much Professor Dearborn genuinely seemed to value students' opinions, to the point of slightly changing or expanding his own in response to them. He's also a master of navigating silences upon an unanswered question that could become awkward in less skillfully run seminars.",
                "Perfect course. The reading was manageable & the classroom discussions developed the nuances of the topics at hand.",
                "The course is well organized so that the material in the readings is covered and explained in the first half of each seminar (the lecture portion), but we are still able to discuss the bigger ideas of the reading and their connection to current affairs in the discussion portion. I do think the reading workload of the seminar is a bit uneven. Some weeks you will have much more to read than others and evening that out might improve the course.",
                "I liked the format of this course and I felt like I learned a lot. At times the reading load felt a little overwhelming. Because there are so many readings, I feel one change could be for the professor to tell us which pieces to focus on specifically for that week or maybe which works to give more attention to. So some direction or guidance in terms of reading through the material could be helpful.",
                "This is an incredibly interesting course, designed well and with clear takeaways. Dearborn is brilliant and a truly engaging and passionate professor.",
                "I thought this was a great course, and I would recommend it highly to any Yalie who's interested in the powers of the president, where they came from, and why they exist. The best part of this course was just interacting with Professor Dearborn and getting his insights on not only the concepts we discussed abstractly in the readings but also how they applied in the real world, right here right now. I never found myself asking why I was studying these questions, unlike many of my other courses, and I think that this course was one of the best classes that I could have taken to get a better practical understanding of what drives American politics today. I also really appreciated how thorough Professor Dearborn was with everything, from returning our papers within the week to posting the slides for each week without fail. One thing that I think could be improved is weaving discussion in and out of the lecture. Segmenting the two made it easy to record lectures and watch them after the fact, but I also found it a bit harder to reference concepts we discussed earlier in class in our discussion in the latter half of the class."

Readings, lectures, and seminar were very interesting and engaging and Professor Dearborn was an excellent facilitator of the course material, especially because he is so engaged with the material he teaches.",

John Dearborn is a phenomenal professor and teaches in a way to both engage the class with the material as well as facilitate student engagement.",

Plus, Professor Dearborn is so dedicated to your learning and so clearly wants to help in any capacity he can, from internship opportunities that he brings up in class to events related to our course material.",

                "Yes 100%. I think that this was by far one of the best courses I have taken in the Political Science department at Yale, because it gave me a rigorous, empirical look at nearly every aspect of presidential power without getting stuck in the statistical weeds. Professor Dearborn is also one of the kindest and most approachable professors that I have ever had, and he is always plugging opportunities for students to get more involved in politically-relevant events on campus and learn more about the actual academic study of political science, if you are interested in that kind of stuff. Also, expectations for the class are EXTREMELY clear, and I always knew when my papers were due and what was expected of me in those assessments."
