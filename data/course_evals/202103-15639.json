                "I learned basic, foundational elements of the Italian language, vocabulary, grammar, speech, and culture.",
                "I think this course was really helpful to begin my journey in learning Italian. I think that the interactive activities, conversations, and projects allowed me to understand the basics of the language and improve my understanding, pronunciation, and conversational skills.",
                "This course allowed me to further my understanding of the Italian language to the point of mild proficiency. I have gained the ability to conversate confidently and use correct verb patterns and tenses when necessary.",
                "Before, I did not know much Italian at all. Perhaps some words like \"prego\" and \"grazie.\" Now, I can fully understand everything in Italian, and I can speak all the basic phrases and words. I could very much go to Italy and manage myself perfectly without having to speak in English or any other language I know!"

                "This course is a great introduction to Italian. Although it can move pretty quickly, it never feels overwhelming. The classroom environment was also fantastic, with a good group of students and a great professor.",
                "I think the strength of this course is that it is held in a small group. This way, our instructor was able to teach us and give feedback individually. I also think that it was very helpful that conversations and practice were prioritized as I believe this is essential while learning a language.",
                "The course is amazing. If taken seriously, and especially if you know any other latin language such as Portuguese and\/or Spanish, you can leave the course basically already speaking Italian. I would say the only weakness is that the hours are very early, but that is just for me!"

                "If you are looking to begin a language, I would highly recommend Italian, especially with Professor Lorenzini! While tests were given frequently (as is true with all L1 Italian classes), and there was a lot of content to keep track of, each day in class felt manageable. It was a lot of fun to work with Professor Lorenzini as well as in small groups\/pairs. Overall, the class offered a supportive and collaborative environment that made the learning feel natural and exciting!",
                "Totally! The Italian department is by far the very best department at Yale! Aside from the fact that Simona is the best teacher in the department, she organizes most of the events after class, which include food and coffee, and thus introduces you to many other people! She is also one of the kindest people I have met at Yale!"
