Additionally, we got practice doing basic examples of real political data science using python, specifically the pandas and matplotlib libraries. We also discussed the ethics of some kinds of political data science, and talked to real-world practitioners who both informed us and taught us a bit about the controversies within the field at the moment.",

                "I honestly really enjoyed this course. Lecture was quite easy to follow and interesting, the P-Sets were challenging but not unbelievably so, and the final project is a great way to do some data science of your own and investigate a question you find interesting. Professor Kalla is also a really good lecturer, and is genuinely engaged with students and interested in their learning. My only caveat is that I don't feel like I have a great understanding of python or pandas once finishing the course (although the course has helped a lot). If you want to learn about python, then I would recommend taking additional courses (before or after).",
                "strengths: Professor Kalla is really accomodating and cares about your well being, psets are quite easy and very little time consuming if you've taken other data science courses that are coding heavy before, you get to start the lab in class so you have less homework, class is very practical and one can easily see how you can apply these skills in an entry level political data job/internship, not a time intensive class at all, workload is not bad at all and exams are okay if you study decently\r\n\r\nweaknesses: i wasnt too engaged in the lecture/discussion parts of the class sometimes",
                "Not rigorous enough, not enough direction on coding",
                "Strengths: lectures, homeworks were helpful to learning, Kalla is great. \r\nWeaknesses: we never spent class time on learning python. We were using a different package than the original YData course so it felt almost new, but we had to learn via google and stack overflow and self-teach the coding aspects of the course.",
                "Manageable psets, challenging but doable tests, good lectures. Wish the difficulty of psets had ramped up more towards the end of the semester, and that material was presented in more interesting way.",

Even if you never code again, it is just very useful and interesting to understand what campaigns are actually doing with data science, if anything so you can parse out which media stories and popular beliefs about campaigns are probably false. It's a great class because it's both a nice intro to some basic python coding and a really good way to learn about campaign data. Professor Kalla is also a great lecturer and a really nice guy, and the workload is quite manageable. If you're interested in the material, then no reason not to take it.",
                "Yes if you want to learn some applicable python skills in a low to medium work setting depending on your experience coding. the goal of the class is to land you an internship in some entry level job at a data science political firm so if that sounds like you, and you want a lot of practical skills in a class that is not too hard then definitely take it.",
                "Yes! Kalla is a great prof and the course is really interesting.",
                "Yes! In this data-driven age, it's interesting - and also scary - to see how political campaigns have adapted to this new climate. Additionally, learning how to code and analyze data are practical skills that can easily be applied to a variety of industries.",
