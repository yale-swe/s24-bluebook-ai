    "From this course I gained a better understanding of how to actually write an African American Studies paper. I also learned how to filter feedback I received from my peers.",
    "This course has been instrumental to designing and taking concrete steps towards completing my thesis. We focused on texts and methodologies of African American Studies to help us discern which would be the best to use for our own projects, and we just had time to get into the work, as Professor Cox would say. I further developed my ability to skim texts and find the information that is relevant to my project, and worked on my public speaking skills as I got more comfortable presenting my research to the class.",
    "A thesis class for Afam seniors, more of a fantastic workshop with a group of giving interlocutors."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved this course. Obviously it is required for the major, but the structure of the course was fantastic. The deadlines throughout the semester meant we were on track for the final deadline for the thesis. I loved the conversations I had with my cohort and Professor Cox. There is no work separate from progress on our senior essays. I wouldn't change a thing.",
    "Strengths: This course requires you to actually start writing your thesis. Even if you don't use the drafts you submit for this course, it still requires you to get words on paper, and that was immensely helpful for me. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: From the feedback other students gave, it was usually pretty clear who had done their work in advance and who was doing it on the spot. Some other students read drafts and assignments in class, which resulted in feedback that could have been much better.",
    "Strengths: Professor Cox is one of the most caring and dedicated professors at Yale, and she has utilized Professor Feimster's model of giving us meaningful and thought-provoking assignments instead of just busywork. Since the class is just AfAm majors, it felt like a great community to explore and help support and provide feedback to one another. Professor Cox also provides in-depth and meaningful feedback, and can help revolutionize how you think about a part of, or even your entire thesis.  It's an amazing colloquium class, and the diversity of projects and perspectives made the class an amazing success.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Cox is at the top of her field so she is understandably busy, but she made herself frequently available even outside of office hours.",
    "Fantastic course, built off of the Junior year seminar in the best way, while still giving you the freedom to improve your work."

    "For seniors in the Af Am major, it is an absolute privilege and honor to work with Professor Cox. Lean into one another and support each other through this process, and it'll be an amazing class.",
    "If you're in Afam you don't have a choice, but that's a good thing. Its a lovely course."
