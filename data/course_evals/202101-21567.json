One of the strong suits is the dissection of examples, and how Alice talks through her thought process when assessing how successful or not the piece is. I think the course struggled from the online format due to the length of the workshop (which drives home zoom-fatigue), and due to the fact that with 10 people, getting a thorough critique of all students work is hard. If the class size were reduced to 6-8 I think the class would benefit greatly.",

The chapbook assignment was quite hard to do virtually because we never got to look at the physical books in person.",

There is a lot of material which is very important but not very flashy, and if you don't have a strong interest in type and typesetting beforehand, these discussions can feel a little bit dry. This is not the class to take to discover your passion; this is the class to take to purse it, and to take it to the next level.",
