I appreciated his wisdom and his insight, and I think that the warmth that he brings to the class is probably its greatest strength. The selection of fiction is impressive and interesting, although I think it was more than students could handle in a semester. I think that, in general, the workload is the main weakness of the course. It seemed to me a disproportionately large amount of work compared to my other classes.",

                "Su Wei is an absolute legend, and the class is mostly a lecture style from him, but nonetheless very interesting. The work can pile up pretty quickly though!",
                "I was really excited by the readings we had and the essays that we wrote for this class. They were personal essays, and I loved the writing process. However, it was puzzling when I would get my essays back with only a single word or sentence as a comment, and the rest of the feedback of the essay would be given in front of the entire class in a manner that was sometimes insensitive to the personal nature of peoples essays. Su Laoshi is incredibly insightful and has a fascinating life story, but, I believe the literature focused seminar could benefit from more discussion rather than lecture format, we rarely delved into student interpretations beyond the one offered by the professor. Also, the Tingxie workload was borderline unmanageable for some weeks.",
                "Very engaging course, and Professor Su is extremely patient and knowledgeable. He makes all the students in class very comfortable and is encouraging to every student regardless of their level."

                "I would recommend it to someone who feels like they have a really strong (basically native) grasp on Chinese, are more interested in learning about Chinese literature than just the language, and are willing to put in a lot of work. If none of these things are true, the class will be very difficult.",
                "Yes 100% - there is a lot of vocabulary but the reading is fabulous. Su Wei is really what makes the class: if you want to read through the Chinese tradition through a Chinese perspective (as opposed to distilled in English translation), this is the perfect class for you. Such a joy to come to class every day.",
                "Su Wei is an absolute legend and I recommend experiencing him as a professor at least once before you graduate!",
                "Yes!! Its such a nice refreshing course to take. I felt like I was learning because the prof was so passionate."
