                "McKay's system for homework (quizzes and allowing students to turn in a draft of their pset for feedback) was super helpful!",
                "I think a big strength of the course is that there are opportunities to learn and receive a lot of help through office hours. I think that the structure of the course is fair, but somehow the point scale and format of the midterms is really tough and could be improved. One or two wrong answers could lose you a lot of points in a way that seriously affects your grade, even if that is not representative of your understanding of the content. I think that is not good, and could be improved greatly.",
                "Strengths: teaches concepts in discrete math that are directly applicable to computer science, lectures are helpful, the way this course is designed allows students to learn from their mistakes, TFs were very approachable.\r\nWeaknesses: N\/A",
                "Very customized to the student experience; many office hours and opportunities for students to excel, more than any other class I have taken at Yale. I wish that all classes at Yale are as helpful and accommodating as this course.",
                "strengths: extremely organized class\r\nweaknesses: i could only get psets done with office hours due to their difficulty, and i know a lot of other people felt the same way.",
                "Strength: clear teaching, clear feedback, a lot of support from course staff, good homework system, reasonable grading system \/ weakness: lectures can be slightly ill-paced (easy things are explained too slowly and hard things are skipped)",
                "This overall is a very good course and Dylan is a very understanding and caring professor.",
                "The homework is really helpful. Both the written homework and the quiz helps me to practice a lot on the course materials. Also, the recording is really great to have for reviewing.",
                "A major strength of the course was the ULA team. They held an abundance of office hours at all times of the day, nearly every day of the week! The ULAs really went above and beyond to ensure students understood the material and the homework questions. I'm so grateful - especially for Amy and Andrei!\r\n\r\nA major weakness of the course was the inefficiency of the assignment grading. We would not receive our homework grades until 3 - 4 weeks after, which proved to be a hindrance near the time of an exam, when we would not know if we did well on a homework with material that would be covered on the exam. Also, midterm grades were released over a month after the exam took place, with our second score coming out less than two weeks before the final.",
                "Strengths: good lecture, really interesting concepts. Weaknesses: I feel like, especially towards the end, the homework went beyond the scope of lecture, which isn't always a bad thing, it just made me feel very stressed about my understanding about what I was learning .",
                "I liked how Dylan structured his assignments, as it gave us plenty of opportunities to receive feedback on our work and learn. There were a lot of ULAs and Office Hours as well, so it was pretty easy to get help on most days of the week. That being said, it was a little hard for me to find the office hours schedule, as I never found the Google Calendar link for the office hours anywhere on the canvas page.",
                "Strengths: built-in accommodations and incentives to learn. Weaknesses: psets are much more difficult and tiring than what the lectures prepare you for.",
                "I think that the topics were very well structured and built of each other. Professor McKays slides were incredibly comprehensive and pretty engaging. I think the course did a good of also highlighting the relevance to Computer Science. Another strength is the quizzes as I think those forced us to think outside the box and be creative.\r\n\r\nA weakness I would note is that in the latter half of the term we went through a lot of topics pretty quickly and this led to me feeling a bit frazzled. Moreover, there was quite a large jump in the difficulty of the homework and the homework then required us to use methods that werent very intuitive or that we hadnt explicitly discussed in class. While I am now better equipped with these new methods, it was kind of discouraging trying to do the homework assignments and feeling like there was so much that I didnt know.",
                "Strength: The course effectively establishes a strong foundation in key discrete mathematical concepts, providing a comprehensive overview.\r\nWeakness: Some students may find the course pacing challenging, especially if certain complex topics are covered too quickly.",
                "The course was very well structured and the assignments were effective in helping to teach the concepts and allowing people to make mistakes and learn.",
                "There is a strong emphasis on HW, as the assignments are quite long and have a strict policy. I don't really agree with it.",
                "I think the policies about coursework are incredibly forgiving and well thought out. Dylan is a really huge strength of this course because he clearly really knows what he's talking about and his presentations are really easy to follow. The TAs are also really good at explaining concepts and very patient and there were a lot of office hours, very well scheduled and they hold a lot of review sessions for the midterm.",
                "Strenghts: Prof Dylan has designed the course to facilitate learning to its fullest. For pset submissions, there are two rounds: a first draft and a final draft. Students will be given feedback based on the first draft submission, which allows them to really try out the problems without worrying of their mistakes ruining their grades.\r\nWeaknesses: The organisation of the slides for the lectures can be a bit disorganised for revising. I understand that the slides are designed in a way to facilitate the lectures, with a sequence of questions and answer slides, but I feel that it's hard to see how the conceps are tied together in this format. A slide with an exhaustive list of definitions\/theorems at the end will be great so that we don't need to scour through the slides for them during revision.",
                "The course was mostly very well organized and put together; slides were posted pretty quickly before\/after class and lectures consistently recorded, review sessions and practice problem sets for the exams were quite robust, and the problem sets were posted promptly and clear in their objectives. I can't really think of much that could be improved upon here.",
                "Lectures were a bit long and content heavy but all well.",
                "One of the strengths was definitely the two-draft homework system because we actually got to see if we had the right approach when writing explanations. The quizzes were very helpful for the written homework and the lectures were extremely engaging. The review sessions before exams were very useful, especially the ones that were divided on different topics.",
                "Strengths: Homework Policies, Exam Grading Structure, etc. \r\n\r\nI genuinely can't think of a way this course could be improved!",
                "The two submission system is very helpful, especially when things can get really busy during the semester, but this also means there's no lenience when it comes to late submissions.",
                "I think the psets should reflect the lecture a bit more. Or maybe the lecture should cover more difficult material.",
                "I thought that Professor McKay and the teaching staff did a great job of emphasizing learning as the main goal of this course. We received timely feedback on every problem set within a few days, which was extremely helpful to understanding areas for improvement. The teaching assistants and Professor McKay hosted consistent office hours, and the ample assistance along with the leeway built into the problem sets made sure that I was never scrambling to understanding new concepts. Before the midterms and final, the teaching staff hosted review sessions with additional practice problems. I was extremely satisfied with the course, and I didn't feel that there were large changes to be made.",
                "The plus side of this course is that it's not particularly difficult. Of course, that means that it covers less depth than 244, but I think it also covers more breadth, so this is more of a personal preference selection.",
                "The course allowed a lot of grace that handled different unexpected circumstances with the implementation with an early deadline. I thought the lectures could be a bit verbose and wished it got to main points quicker.",
                "Great TA help depending on the TA. Office hour help varies, but many sessions were very good, recorded lectures are great and mckay does a good job with explaining material and communicating standards.",
                "Dylan was an absolutely wonderful professor. Though his lectures were sometimes slow paced, they were thorough. He was very understanding yet clear about course deadlines and expectations. There is a pset weekly that is split into an online quiz and written portion, which makes it easy to get a high score and good practice. The ULAs were also so amazing!!"

                "I would recommend this course, but it would come with the caution that the course is deceptively difficult at times and the content cannot be learned easily. You do have to dedicate a lot of time to the course, and it is often times very stressful.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student.",
                "Weekly PSETs made this class miserable. If you get behind (sick, etc) on one pset you're screwed for the rest of the semester unless you can catch up, again due to the nature of the psets. This class was advertised as an intro-friendly proof's course but honestly the topics were extremely random and excessively difficult - but that could just be Dylan trying to challenge us. Some weeks we were talking about proof by induction, then the next some confusing, muddy RSA encryption possibility stuff that wasn't even on the exam. Honestly, I think Dylan is being too ambitious with topics especially for an intro class. Focus on 4-5 topics of the most important topics instead of 13 different ones with weekly psets, otherwise this class becomes like a stressful hell! PSETs were advertised as \"fair\" and reasonable in time, but honestly they were long and difficult, especially towards the end with Dylan's favorite topics. Dylan sometimes likes challenging you so expect tricky topics, just because he's passionate about the hard stuff",
                "Yes gives very strong foundational knowledge on everything in discrete math and beyond; most notably it teaches proof-writing, and has a feedback submission per problem set so you receive almost IMMEDIATE feedback on your work. Very nicely taught from basic principles as well, as well as a emphasis on application after theory.",
                "only if u need it for a major",
                "Yes. Dylan has become very accommodating. Relative to other CS classes, there is clear feedback (thank you to my TFs), and your grades are released in a reasonable timeframe. I learned a lot and in an efficient way.",

                "Yes! I'm assuming you are taking this course for a major\/certificate requirement. I recommend taking it with Professor McKay because of the homework system - we submit drafts of the homework on Thursday, receive comments from the ULAs, and then resubmit the final draft on Monday!",
                "Yes, especially if you need this or discrete for your major, it was really fun at times.",
                "CS Majors have to take this obviously, but I would also recommend this course to people who want to learn how to write math proofs, as it starts from very basic logic proofs and builds up to more serious proofs about graphs and linear algebra.",
                "I would. If you have the energy and time to invest into the psets (given the gap between the lectures and the psets + they want you to explore and self-learn in psets which is just exhausting sometimes), then the course is structured well and has lots of built-in accommodations and incentives for you to learn. This is not a gut. The material gets increasingly more difficult as the semester goes, so don't let the first few weeks trick you into thinking it's a low commitment course.",
                "I would less so recommend the course and more so recommend Professor McKay. I think if the course information is relevant to a student then theyre going to take the class regardless but I would encourage them to take it with Professor McKay if they could because his passion for teaching is just so extremely clear and I think makes such a big difference.",

                "Yes, it was a great way to learn the concepts.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course for CS majors, especially if they haven't had proof-writing experience before. It is a required course so there's not many options, but I still think it's a good experience.",
                "yes the topics are interesting but if you are already familiar with the them then discrete math might be more engaging",
                "If you're a CS major and need to take either this or MATH 244, the latter is almost certainly more rigorous, more intensive, and goes in more depth on the actual math; but if you want the CS applications (i.e. RSA, asymptotic analysis) and\/or have an otherwise difficult schedule and don't care too much about the marginal amount of math you'll be missing, buy all means take 202.",
