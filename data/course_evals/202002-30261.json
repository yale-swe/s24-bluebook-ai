   "comments": [
    "As expected, this class moved very fast during the summer session.\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n1) Engaging lectures (even if online)\r\n2) CS50 shorts: great way to get more info on a specific concept I was struggling with\r\n3) Enthusiastic staff: They made the class worth it. TA's checked in on students regularly, were always available to talk, and provided a lot of guidance!!\r\n\r\n\r\nI do have a lot of gripes with how the summer course that need to be fixed regardless of when it is taught:\r\n1) Office Hours: they are a complete mess. I logged in at 9:03 AM and wasn't helped until 2:15 pm. This is absurd. There needed to be far more TA's for the class. Especially during the summer, when the material is moving so fast, students are going to need access to a lot of help and this wasn't even close to possible during the summer session. Also, using a Google Sheet to sign up for times gives students no idea of when they might be seen. Like when I waited for 5 hours, I just had to sit by my computer because I had no idea when it would magically be my turn. Also, despite being told to not sign up for a spot in the \"line\" before the official start of office hours, TA's still helped the people who signed up, sometimes an hour before the start time. Furthermore, there was no protocol for what to do if students weren't helped by the end of a TA's office hours. They would have to sign back up and go to the back of the line for the next TA's office hours, which is incredibly unfair.\r\n2) Starting in C. I feel like this made no sense. Python is a much simpler program to grasp, and would have led to a much smoother transition from Scratch.  Also, by starting with C and then going to Scratch, a lot of students felt like they were over thinking things and inserting brackets and notation we no longer needed. Instead of building our base of knowledge, we had to completely forget most of what we did for C in order to successfully use Python.",
    "strength: lecture content\/how it was explained, office hours\r\n\r\nweakness: section was a little long and sometimes hard to follow\r\n\r\nimprovement: make more sections of less length and cover one or two activities per section instead of 3-5.  Or make a break during section.",
    "I think the TA's were all great and super helpful. However, the office hours structure was sometimes frustrating because I ended up waiting on the zoom call for up to two hours to be helped. Additionally, I understand that some material has to be taken out of the course because it is shortened, but this material seemed very important for the rest of the course. It would definitely be helpful at least teaching a shortened version of this material.",
    "Very fast paced and a lot of work per week. I definitely was forced to learn each language though. Maybe focus on fewer languages",
    "The only weakness is the course's grading scheme. It's based on improvement, and even though you see your scores on problem sets you still don't really know what grade you have in the class. Other than that, it is absolutely fantastic!!",
    "I thought that the course was very well-organized. I liked watching the lectures and found sections very helpful. I also really liked going to office hours and found the TAs to be very helpful. However, I think that it would be more productive for people to schedule times at office hours in advance instead of just signing up for the queue. Each person could have a specific amount of time to be helped for, and that would be much fairer. But overall, i thought that the course was designed very well.",
    "The sections can be used more efficiently or reduced. I was able to learn pretty much everything after watching the lectures and attending office hours with TAs.",
    "The course was well-organized for online learning and I appreciated the accessibility of the CS50 website. I would have appreciated even more office hours at times accessible to students across the country\/globe.",
    "I could watch the online lectures at my own pace and take notes without worrying on missing out on anything, which is a plus. The TAs were also super accommodating and understanding despite my limited CS knowledge, and I overall enjoyed the course a whole lot more because of then. The only weakness is CS50 over the summer is only 5 weeks long making some things feel rushed, but I believe the instructors of the course handled a difficult online summer session really well.",
    "Fantastic and engaging lectures, fantastic and engaging sections, fantastic and engaging psets",
    "Strengths: The strengths are that the class is very interesting and fun and you learn so much. In addition, you get to implement your own final project, which was very rewarding.\r\nWeaknesses: There is a heavy workload and for people just starting out with CS, it can be very overwhelming at first.",
    "Over the summer this course went very fast, and I feel like I didn't learn enough. I think this course needs to be longer than 5 weeks because of the amount of work that needed to be completed. I feel like we were just given problems to work on and if we didn't understand something it was hard to go back and figure out what wasn't understood.",
    "This course, especially during the summer session, moves incredibly fast. I felt that it was very difficult to absorb all of the information being thrown at me. That being said, the class material is interesting and I am happy with the new set of problem-solving skills that I gained through the class.",
    "Very dense, but well taught and the problem sets were very fair.",
    "The strengths were the attentiveness of the staff--they were accessible, helpful, and supportive. The weaknesses were inherent in the online, pandemic-constricted mode: recorded lectures, zoom sections, and zoom office hours presented technical challenges and lessened engagement.",
    "Video lectures were great. Sections didnt really help advance my knowledge of lecture material however - often felt like busy work. I didnt feel like you could get a lot out of office hours.",
    "Advantages:\r\n- The psets were tough but doable and I learned a lot from them. They also had real-world applications.\r\n- The sections were good for clarifying lecture material.\r\n- There was a good mix of both breadth and depth of material.",
    "The staff is amazing, always willing to help. The problem sets are intense and thus office hours were vital",
    "The TAs were amazing and helpful and had a lot of office hours available. I liked how the problem sets were graded automatically and how we could view our scores and resubmit as many times as we liked in order to improve out understanding. However, I took this online during Summer 2020 and can imagine that the course would be more engaging in person.",
    "Very strong course!",
    "It's an amazing class, with little room for improvement. Perfect for remote learning.",
    "This course is phenomenal in every way",
    "Because the summer session is so compressed, going through and actually learning the material so quickly (especially for someone who's new to the field) can be a little daunting, but I found the class rewarding since there were so many resources available to help us work through the PSETs. Because of this time crunch we didn't get to go through all of the material possible compared to CS50 in the Fall, but the TAs were still very thoughtful in pointing us toward said material if we wanted to continue doing CS at Yale.\r\n\r\nThe real strength of the course, however, would be how quick you learn (if willing to put in the work) and also how much practice we'd get by doing our weekly homework. The course heads also, noticeably, put a lot of effort in preparing slides and were very helpful in office hours, making sure students' essential questions were answered. In general I got the sense that I was cared for, but by no means pampered, since they really wanted us to struggle with the material a little (as that's where the most learning occurs).",
    "I think section is pointless.",
    "Strengths: you learn so much in such a short amount of time! All of the information covered is super useful and none of the assignments feel like \"busy work\" at all. The problem sets are all really cool and practical. The format of the class is very conducive to learning.\r\nWeaknesses: There really aren't enough office hours because when you go you go to get help, you only get about 5-10 minutes of help before the next person is taken.",
    "Longer time and maybe an exam",
    "The strengths of the course include the amount of assitance they try to build throughout the week to help with Psets. Also, the video lectures and quizzes make sure that students are entering class prepared. However, I had a lot of issues with the way the course was organized in the summer. They skipped lessons which would be taught in the school year, and yet still assigned them on P-sets. While concepts were explained well in the first 2 weeks, by the end of the class there were many concepts I didn't understand (due to poor organization and skipping around). Additionally, office hours were very poorly organized just due to sheer demand of students who needed to go. I went to office hours frequently yet rarely did I ever walk away with my questions answered. This made the course much more stressful and intense than it needed to be.",
    "The lectures are fantastic and very engaging, and the problem sets are interesting and have a good level of challenge. Section sometimes dragged, but I think a lot of this was due to the online format.",
    "The p-sets were very difficult because a lot of the subject material was not covered!"

   "comments": [
    "YES! Especially in person. If they can sort the office hours queue issue out, this class is well worth taking. But with how fast summer session moves, students need a lot more help and the office hours were woefully unprepared to help so many people. You will learn how to think like a programmer and you'll be ready for the next level.",
    "yes, would definitely recommend if a student wants to \"learn how to code\" but would not recommend if a student wants to get good at a single coding language.",
    "Yes, it is a really great introduction to computer science as it gives you a broad idea of the field and shows you a lot of its applications in the real world.",
    "If you can really devote your time to computer science (if you have no experience). You cannot glide by",
    "Definitely. I came in with no knowledge of computer science, and am now able to create websites and code in multiple languages. It is definitely a challenge and be prepared to put in lots and lots of work, but the entire class as a whole is very manageable and there are so many resources available to you.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in learning about computer science, especially if they don't have a background in it. However, they should definitely be prepared to take on a lot of work and commit a lot of time to understanding the material, which is why I thought it was great to take by itself over the summer.",
    "Yes--you can learn CS very fast and very efficiently. The learning curve can be steep but the difficulty of the content is definitely manageable.",
    "Yes! CS50 provided an engaging intro to coding. Overall I found the course to be challenging and fun.",
    "Yes; CS50 is a great introductory for everyone! I had no programming experience or CS knowledge heading into this course, but now I feel comfortable working various languages and having a multifaceted approach towards targeting problems. Although the workload can be high at times, I feel like I learned more from CS50 than any other course I have taken before.",
    "Yes! If you for any reason have an intro programming requirement to do, take this course! I also especially recommend it during the summer, if you just want to focus on learning the course material and the hype of CS50 \"culture\" isn't all that important to you.",
    "Yes, absolutely. I think even people who don't know anything about CS (like me) can survive this course (despite everyone often saying it is super difficult).",
    "Yes, I think learning how to code is a great skill to use in the world and it opens up a lot of doors, but it's hard to say how much you actually learn that could be used in a job.",
    "Yes! It will challenge you to think in a very methodical, detail-oriented way.",
    "Yes! You learn so much about programming even in such a short amount of time.",
    "Yes - definitely a great class to take if you are looking for an intro programming course.",
    "It's a good, relatively stress-free intro to coding.",
    "Be prepared to receive a ton of information. Rewarding when you can understand a topic but frustrating when you do not.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students who want a good introduction to computer science both due to the breadth and depth of material. It is a great deal of work but the knowledge and skills gained is worth the work.",
    "Yes, it is a fulfilling intellectual challenge",
    "I would recommend this course to any student regardless of major. This course prepares you with basic programming and web design skills which are useful in our modern world.",
    "Yes, it's fun",
    "Yes, wholeheartedly recommend it! One of the most useful 'extra' classes one can take at Yale.",
    "Definitely. You learn to code really quick and it does not feel like to much effort because the problem sets are fun.",
    "100%. I was always so scared of learning to code, and this course showed me how fun and intellectually-stimulating coding could be.",
    "I would very much recommend this course to another student if they'd like an introduction to computer science or if they're seeking to be challenged. However I would not necessarily take this course to merely fulfill a QR, since the PSETs require a good amount of commitment.",
    "yes it is a great way to learn how to code",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. As someone who has never seen code before, this was the perfect introduction fro a true beginner that brought me to a place at the end of feeling really confident in my coding abilities and like I learned so much. The instructor and TAs were amazing.",
    "I would reccomend this course in the school year when there is more support and lessons aren't being cut out of the course to speed things up.",
    "Absolutely -- if you have no programming experience, this class lays a great foundation for computer science, and I found the class very accessible despite not having any experience.",
    "No! I would recommend students take it during the school year.",
    "100% take this class. I learned so much about computer science as well as its applications in the world"
