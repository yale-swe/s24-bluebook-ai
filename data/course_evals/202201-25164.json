Overall, I learned how to view and understand Middle Eastern countries interests and interactions with other countries in the region and beyond."

                "I think it's a wonderful course and the professor adapted it to our small class by allowing us to take more personal responsibility for the material we were learning and present/defend it to each other. The readings were excellent and the discussions were a good balance of student thoughts/questions and the professor's knowledge. It's a shame that it will not be taught next year because I think the main thing that would improve the course would just be to have a few more students in it.",
                "It was the ideal class I would have wanted: focused on student learning rather on doing useless work for the sake of work. The readings were succinct and made sense why we had to read them. Class discussions were a perfect balance between the Professor framing the readings and the students discussing."

The course had the perfect balance between class discussions and professor lectures. I felt fully engaged the entire time, learned a lot, and had fun as a student enrolled in it.",
                "Absolutely yes, I think the material is very interesting, very important, and very little understood even among students who study (for example) polisci or IR at Yale. The professor is wonderful (very knowledgeable, easy to talk to, kind and accommodating). At first I was intimidated by the length of the readings but they're all very interesting so it was not a burden.",
