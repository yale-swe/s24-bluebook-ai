I had no prior experience with these techniques, but I now feel that I could competently execute them in a research lab setting.

                "I think this was an amazing laboratory - the best lab at Yale!! The instruction was very clear and all questions were answered, making sure that we did not feel unclear about how to perform any of the experiments. All of the experiments clearly followed from one another and taught us how to test hypotheses in different ways to get different information.",
                "Strengths: interesting content, useful techniques to learn, each lab was completed within 1-2 class periods which was great for learning the method and analyzing the results; having different professors was fun to learn different perspectives and learn from those who use those techniques in their work often\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes there was a bit of wasted time during the lab period while waiting for incubations etc (sometimes this time was filled with lectures but not always); essentially the entire grade was based on HW assignments, and the assignments were generally fair but sometimes questions were a little confusingly worded and losing points on one question per assignment impacted the overall grade quite a bit",
                "Strengths: Repro bio lab was by far the most relaxed and welcoming teaching lab setting I have been in at Yale. There is no pressure to complete experiments perfectly--if results are off, we just had to provide a brief explanation in homework. Professors Guller and Kliman worked to make the lab fun. Professor Kliman, for example, would allow us to ask our \"most burning reproductive health questions\" while experiments were running. Similarly, the homeworks are not ridiculously time consuming. They would never take me more than 4 hours to complete, and they were only given every other week.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the homeworks could be improved by increasing the sentence count allotted. Sometimes it would take me as much time to write an answer as it would to edit it down to two sentences. Another weakness of the course is perhaps how rushed the teaching of a statistical technique was by one professor. A lot of students struggled to replicate the results shown in class in the homework.",
                "Great class. Really applicable skills learned to working in a lab post grad. Seth is an awesome instructor. Great to learn from other profs at the med school too.",
                "I really liked how the labs were conducted in this course. There was a lot of guidance, and I liked how we all went through the steps of the lab together. I feel like I gained a lot from each session."

                "Absolutely. I found the learning environment relaxed, and I did not dread going to lab each week. I felt that I learned tangible skills, and I enjoyed being around professors so evidently passionate about the topic.",
                "Definitely. A really fun lab where you learn a lot of applicable skills. Great instructors and fun environment."
