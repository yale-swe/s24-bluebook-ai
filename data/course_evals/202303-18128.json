I wouldn't have been able to take it without the remote option, and this allowed me to focus on the subject matter whenever I was available, and could incorporate it into my schedule how I saw fit. I think that the exams were often more difficult than the quizzes and homework, but I think that it evens out.",
                "It was helpful that the course was asynchronous, because it provided a lot of flexibility. That did mean, however, that it was difficult to remain constantly engaged. Another strength of the course was that there was a lot of support for students!! There were essentially constant office hours...",
                "This course was well taught and it was nice how you had the option to take it synchronously or asynchronously.",
                "Although all the lectures are recorded and you don't have to attend lecture in person, the lack of structure makes it very easy to fall behind.",
                "There are not many weaknesses in this course. You can tell that JDRS sets up Stats 101 in a way that benefits every student taking it. Students can choose to come learn with Prof Reuning-Scherer synchronously or later via lecture recordings asynchronously which is the BEST thing to ever exist. The flexibility of when to learn was something I thanked the heavens for every week. In terms of P-Sets, the assignments always have clear instructions and always pertain to the information learned. Not only that, the quizzes beforehand always made sure that I was following the content taught correctly and understood it effectively. If there's ever a need for assistance, there are TONS of ways to get help via office hours from not just JDRS but a multitude of TAs that are ready to help, from early in the morning to late at night.",
                "Very little support. The student aides were unhelpful and actually gave you wrong answers.",
                "There are so many office hours offered and all of the lectures are recorded. There is so much material on the Canvas page to study with/learn from, which is very useful. The lectures can move very fast at times, making it difficult to pick up the material.",
                "Strengths: JDRS is a great lecturer, office hours are plentiful, and open-note exams help relieve stress from keeping so many individual rules and processes memorized. The PSETs are engaging and helpful, and the portion on life sciences was valuable in unpacking relationships between more variables. The content in intro stats is applicable in so many fields and will make anyone a better analyst of more complex data.\r\nWeaknesses: the asynchronous format is challenging in several ways, including a lack of engagement from students, which I hope the course addresses in the future.",
                "Organized perfectly, great for learning, professor clearly wants us to learn the topic. Great TA organization. Great set up for information. Could receive feedback from Psets faster to learn from mistakes.",
                "The strengths are the hybrid method where students are able to attend either in person or virtually and the numerous amounts of office hours to attend if you need help. I think a con about the class is that it moves at a very quick pace and if you are a bit behind it can lead to a cascade where you are behind on a lot of assignments.",
                "So much content covered way too fast. The grading by the TAs on the problem sets was actually so annoying, unnecessary, and unfair. I would sometimes show up to office hours and just ask the TAs exactly what I needed to say and then still lose points.",
                "Weakness- exams did not correlate to problem sets. There was not enough practice for the types of questions we were seeing on the exams.",
                "Strengths: very organized, it's easy to understand what you need to do to succeed. Weaknesses: I feel like I relied very heavily on office hours and would be stressed out if they got cancelled/if I was unable to go to one",
                "Pros: Prof was excellent, engaging. Lots of energy. The stats presentations/homeworks were straightforward and hands on, which in my opinion is the best way to learn something.\r\nCons: The ability to fall behind is suprisingly easy if you stop going to lectures and stop watching recorded lectures. The ability to have recorded lectures is great, don't get me wrong, but students need to keep themselves in check.",
                "I can honestly say this was the worst course I have taken at Yale. TF's regulary did not show up to their office hours and the material was poorly taught. JDRS was not available over email and did not respond to his emails without several follow ups. If you're looking for a reasonable statistics class where you will learn and be able to the understand the material, this is not the class. It is very clear that the professor does not care about his students and is very checked out from teaching. Further, many of the TF's had never taken the class, meaning they did not know how to use minitab to aid students with questions they might have with PSETS. This class was overall very disorganized.",
                "Strengths: office hours availability, humor, and the number of resources students can use to study.\r\nWeaknesses: fast pace lecturing, lack of clarity related to expectations for exam studying.",

It's fast-paced like most other courses here, however, the foundations of stats are given to you and there are many opportunities to get help and collaborate. Best of all, the choice of learning asynchronously or synchronously allows for extreme flexibility and ease.",

                "I would recommend this course -- the content is incredibly valuable, JDRS is great, and the exams are pretty approachable. If you want to get the most out of it, treat it like you would any other course by going to lectures in-person, keeping up with homeworks, and organizing notes effectively before exams.",

                "Yes, although if you want to learn R, maybe just take 230. I taught R to myself/used it for the homework and it definitely took a lot longer.",
                "Yes, I had no love for stats. Then I took this class. Turns out I really like stats and will be taking more of these classes in the future. JDRS is also awesome for learning, he makes (what I assume to be) a very boring subject legitamately interesting. Please, please, please go in person, you will learn so much more I feel.",
                "No, this course was about plugging in formulas, rather than actually learning, which actually made it more difficult to learn the material for the exams. JDRS is not available to his students and is not willing to help.",
