    "I learned a lot about Brazilian culture and other countries that have Portuguese language. I also had more of a foundation from last semester which encouraged me to be more disciplined in my learning and focus more than I did before. I was able to take these and apply them to all of the new language concepts we learned.",
    "By taking this course, I have been able to develop my reading, writing and speaking skills in Portuguese. My professor was absolutely wonderful and I have learned so much from her. Beyond learning the language, I have come to learn so much about Brazil in all regards.",
    "I learned how to talk, read, and write with confidence in Portuguese.",
    "I expanded my Portuguese knowledge beyond what I thought was possible.",
    "Enrolling in this course truly sophisticated and augmented my Portuguese language skill and increased my self-confidence in using Portuguese in a communicative and interactive manner. All of the components-especially those of analyzing Portuguese songs and discussing various themes with native speakers of Portuguese-immensely enriched my academic experience as a whole.",
    "This course dramatically improved my understanding of Portuguese verb conjugation and sentence structures, as well as complex use of tenses and vocabulary for a variety of professional and social contexts."

   "comments": [
    "The course was a lot of fun and not super hard and I didnt mind getting up early in the morning and walking far to attend class most days. However the class lacked structure and sometimes the assignments we were given were not relevant to what we were doing at the moment or did not follow a logical pattern. Sometimes the assignments were also inappropriate for the skill level we had or for the skill they were supposed to be evaluating. Because there was little structure, it was hard to understand what we were being graded on and people in class were less willing to work diligently on every single assignment we had because in the end most of us still got pretty good grades.",
    "This course provided a very intimate and engaging setting to learn Portuguese. Everyday had new and interesting activities and I really enjoyed it.",
    "It was structured in a way that everyone was included, honestly, have no complaints.",
    "This course enables students to acquire Portuguese through various and enjoyable manners, especially with respect to learning Brazilian culture. The classes always have some component of direct and diverse contact with it, whether in terms of reading about Brazilian history and current issues.",
    "The strengths of this course are that by meeting every day, the student remains engaged in the language. Students are encouraged to imagine themselves using Portuguese in a variety of contexts and to practice their skills unrestrainedly. \r\n\r\nIt is a significant commitment to read, speak, and listen in another language every day while completing daily assignments, but the growth over one term is palpable."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! A good and fun way to get 1.5 credits and learn something new that is a lot less stressful than other language departments! But depending on who teaches it you might have to do a lot of work on your own to fully have an understanding of portuguese language.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Learning Portuguese at Yale has been an incredible experience and I would take this course again if I were to do the semester over.",
    "Definitely. This was a fantastic course and I learned a lot about the language and myself.",
    "Yes, you are engaged in the class if you want to be.",
    "Indeed, I would most definitely recommend this course to all, because of the multifaceted and active manners with which students are able to engage with Lusophone languages and cultures.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone serious about acquiring fluency in another language."
