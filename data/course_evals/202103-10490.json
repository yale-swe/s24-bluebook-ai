You will learn how to find a topic you care about, design a methodology, and construct a powerful literature review. For me, this was the first time I created an independent project in the social sciences  the instructions and your mentor are so helpful along the way in helping build your capacity to do this work.",
                "I learned how to budget my time and plan out a timeline for a major project. I learned how to develop appropriate expectations for a thesis project, and how to incorporate feedback from peers and instructors in meaningful and helpful ways",

                "The highlight of EDST 400 is the teaching staff!  TZB and Erica are deeply invested in us and our growth.  I'm very grateful to have the opportunity to pursue the capstone under their care; they have each helped make this challenging project immensely rewarding.",

                "YAY numerous opportunities for (and helpful guidance on how to provide) peer feedback!!! YAY supportive community!! YAY helpful week-by-week guidance on our capstone projects!! Ed Studies does such a great job of giving students the support we need to complete quality capstones. I loved this course!",
                "It's hard to evaluate this course along strengths and weaknesses because most of the work is you doing your independent reading, thinking, and writing. Perhaps for an area of improvement, as an alternate for submitting written idea modules, students can meet in pairs to present their idea module for that week (requiring the same organization of thought) but directly to another student so that they can complicate/deepen their thinking on the spot.",
                "strengths: the peer editing is awesome- definitely helped me tremendously and opened my eyes to the strengths and weaknesses of my own capstone! and the capstone 'pitches' were super helpful too!\r\n\r\nweaknesses: sometimes it felt like class time could have been used in more efficient ways- I would have liked to have had open class sessions where people just come to work on their projects for a set, focused amount of time, as opposed to discussing stuff not entirely relevant to our individual projects",
                "The strengths are that the expectations are clearly delineated and explained during lecture and strong examples are shared via canvas. \r\n\r\nWe also work in small groups a lot, which helps because feedback is from diverse perspectives.",
                "This course provided a great basis for conducting a capstone. However, there were myriad unnecessary assignments that contributed more to cumulative stress and busy work than actual progression of our capstones.",
                "Peer review sessions weren't always super helpful and felt a bit dragged out (I really liked the commenting ones toward the end, but gained less from the in-class workshopping  it's hard to fully understand someone's problem in 30 minutes, so most of the time is spent either saying things I'm not at all sure about or trying to understand what's going on)",
                "strengths: very responsive to student feedback and built to help us do what we want with our projects. great level of honesty regarding where we were all at with our projects, highly appreciated!\r\n\r\nweaknesses: it would have been great if idea modules had been due on fridays",
                "This class made the capstone feel a bit less independent than I had expected it to be. I found myself kind of feeling like it was just another class with assignments due every week, which meant I didn't spend much time thinking/working on it in my own way, but rather was kind of pulling stuff together each week so I could submit something. I also think it might've been helpful to receive feedback from both TZB and Erica, rather than only one through the whole semester, though I understand this might just be too much work on their part.",
                "It's great to have a dedicated class for working on the capstone to provide structure to a really big project. A strength was the pacing of the assignments throughout the semester that broke the work down into more manageable pieces. A weakness was it oftentimes felt like there were too many cooks in the kitchen when we did multiple rounds of peer feedback."

                "For me, this course was so challenging because I didn't have a clear idea of what I wanted to do at the beginning. I had an idea that I thought might be good that (it turns out, after actually reading the literature) wasn't turning out how I had originally envisioned. After about a month and a half, after talking to friends and experts in that area, I settled on a project idea. Because I got started so late, I felt like I was playing catchup pretty much all semester. It was really challenging work. It is also super rewarding. I would recommend this to other students, but I would strongly suggest that you really figure out a solid project idea before you walk into class on the first day (something that  after reading some literature  is both doable and feasible). With that said, you need to be willing to put in the work for this class.",
                "yes, if you're an ed studies scholar, you should def take this course- it sets you up to plan out and actually work on your capstone for a full year- especially helpful if you have a second thesis to complete in the fall, because this capstone process is so structured with tzb's help, that it is possible to apply the same approach to your thesis, making everything that much more manageable",
                "Absolutely. Working on the Ed Studies Capstone alongside peers and under the guidance of Professor Zemach-Bersin is helping me gain confidence as a researcher.",

                "It is a required course.",
                "I would recommend only to students in the Education Studies program who have chosen a topic they are interested in exploring further in depth. They must be committed to this topic and motivated to research and read about it. It can seem like a lot of work that does not directly relate to your capstone at times, but can be helpful depending on your project."
