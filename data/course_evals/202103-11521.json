                "I truly learned so much about climate change, the status and feasibility of different climate solutions and geo engineering as a whole",
                "This class covers basically all of climate change, plus a big focus on geoengineering techniques. The first few weeks were mostly review for me as someone who had taken climate classes before, but the last half of the course on carbon capture technology and stratospheric aerosol injection were completely new. I learned to think more critically about stratospheric aerosol injection, the state of current research, and the key controversies and questions that remain. \r\n\r\nA note for briefs: make sure to lead each answer with a short, clear takeaway. It wasn't immediately clear what Wake wanted out of briefs, but it soon became clear that the short, snappy takeaways were a big positive.",
                "I learned so much- from covering the basic science of climate change all the way to discussing current climate policy and solutions. We then spent a majority of the semester investigating future solutions such as SAI, BECCS, and DACCS. It was a great way to get familiar with the future of climate engineering from one of the foremost experts in this field.",
                "This class was very impactful for me! I developed a strong foundational knowledge surrounding geo-engineering solutions, including both carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management. Not only did we focus on the science behind geo-engineering, but also on its ethics, optics, economics, and governance. We went through each solution with an objective vantage point to contextualize and categorize its impact within broader climate strategies and in comparison to mitigation and adaptation. The class was discussion-based, and so I also had the opportunity to engage with my peers and their opinions, to formulate my own opinions, and to contribute to a thoughtful and constructive conversation about geo-engineering.",
                "Insights into the status of the climate change problem, tools we have to address it, and the issues with \/ possible necessity of climate engineering.",
                "Examined the topic of geoengineering from a scientific, technological, economic, governmental, ethical, moral, and public perception lens.  Learned about the science behind climate and climate change, economics of climate change (discount rate, social cost of carbon), carbon dioxide removal methods such as afforestation\/reforestation\/improved land management, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, soil carbon, enhanced mineral weathering, geologic storage, direct air capture, flue gas capture.  Solar radiation management (marine cloud brightening, cirrus cloud thinning) and in-depth on Stratospheric Aerosol Injection.  Ways to govern SAI, ethical deployment, and public perception of geoengineering.",
                "Learned about a plethora of solutions to climate change, both those that are often talked about and more abstract\/newer ones. Talked about the drawbacks and advantages to each. Talked about these solutions in a political, economic, and scientific context.",
                "I learned about the current climate situation and the potential approaches to dealing with this massive issue. I think that I obtained a good foundation in understanding the potential climate intervention techniques. I think it has shaped my outlook on how to address climate change.",
                "Although the focus is ultimately on geoengineering, I gained a great overview of the climate crisis and potential solutions on the table. Not an \"engineering\" course but I would definitely consider it a science course. We started with a few weeks on net-zero pathways and climate science before zoning in on carbon removal and solar geoengineering, as well as the strengths\/consequences\/governance issues\/ethics associated with solar radiation management and stratospheric aerosol injection.",
                "This course gave me a very good insight into the state of climate change today. I now understand the challenges that need to be overcome in order to reverse climate change. By writing weekly briefs, I learnt to synthesize information into a nuanced account of a particular issue.",
                "This course made it clear just how unprepared we are for climate change. It therefore made a case for at least beginning to research more geoengineering techniques, in case we need those technologies to make our future environmental conditions tolerable."

                "Amazing class! Loved everything about it. Wake is an amazing guy and makes the class fun, engaging and makes you forget about other stressful classes.",
                "strengths: great prof, engaging, love the roundtable discussion\r\n\r\nweakness: no clarity on grading expectation for briefs. often just given a grade with no explanation or trends between the weeks. some weeks I would spend extra time and get a bad grade, and others I would slack and get a better grade; minimal feedback and no examples",
                "This class is amazing!! Strengths: I ACTUALLY learned about the status of climate change and HOW bad the problem is versus just having the knowledge that climate change is happening and it's bad. Professor Smith is lovely and cares so much about his students. Truly no weaknesses",
                "Strengths: \r\nThis class covers so much in just one semester. I'm convinced that this must be the only class of its kind in the world -- where else can you learn about geoengineering and climate solutions at such depth, plus with the opportunity to discuss deep ethical issues with SAI? The structure of the class is incredibly low-stress -- an open-book final, weekly briefs, but no midterms, papers, or other assessments. It's truly a nicely paced jog to the finish, and you learn a lot along the way. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nNot a whole lot -- this class was great. I think that it could be cool to have more guest speakers who oppose SAI research altogether, such as Jennie Stephens. I'm not sure how pleased Prof. Stephens would be to get an invite to this class, but it would be really rewarding to talk with her.",
                "Great class; professor did a great job of making everyone feel heard and valued. I thought that participation throughout was high from everyone. The weekly reading briefs were not too stressful and the consistency of the assignments was a nice change from classes that have little work for weeks and then massive projects or exams.",
                "The class had a lot of strengths! It was a discussion-based seminar -- with some short lectures, as well as guest speakers -- which allowed for healthy dialogue and learning. The biggest strength is that Professor Smith empowered us to develop our own opinions through weekly briefs. He challenged us to think critically about each geo-engineering topic, and to use our own insight and experiences to inform class discussions. \r\n\r\nOne, very small weakness: it was not immediately apparent in the beginning of the semester that briefs were supposed to be opinionated. I would have loved a bit more clarity on grading structure. However, these are very very small pieces of feedback for an otherwise outstanding course.",
                "Strengths: good discussions, good reading material, reasonable workload with even pacing. Weaknesses: would be nice if grading was more transparent.",
                "Strengths: professor, classmates who were incredibly engaged in the topic, breadth and depth of topics, approaching the issue from many angles, discussion-based structure of the class in which we could hear classmates' unique thoughts and insights. It was good that we did weekly briefs before class in order to consolidate our thoughts.  Interesting readings. \r\nWeaknesses: Very few.  Maybe would have spent a little more time on carbon dioxide removal methods such as enhanced mineral weathering and geologic storage, but not sure what should be taken out to give room for that.  Sometimes it was stressful trying to participate enough in class just because everyone had such engaging thoughts that I wanted to fully listen to.",
                "strengths: we talked about a wide breadth of climate change topics over the semester. I gained a better understanding of a lot of tools that I didn't know about before.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the reading responses were ridiculous. every week, due the night before class. The questions were all easy, but they were graded so harshly. There was no technical knowledge tested in them, so they felt like easy A grades, but they were really graded quite harshly, on like writing quality. Very strange for a course with no distributional credits. Also the prof is a bit biased towards one climate change mitigation technique over others, but who isn't.",
                "The content of the course is very interesting, and Wake knows a lot about it. I think the fact that he wrote the book for the class is very useful and makes the subject more coherent. Overall, the course is great with some of the most engaging conversations I have had at Yale. This is probably due to everyone doing most of the reading because of the weekly briefs. The briefs can be a little annoying, but I think they are helpful (sometimes I think the questions could have been better asking for more synthesis of the reading\/opinions as opposed to pointed questions that correspond to one page out of 100 pages of reading). The one weakness is the grading of the weekly briefs without real feedback. Everyone I know ended up credit\/d-ing the class as the grading was somewhat harsh and out of 3 points so it was very easy to get below a 'B.' Everyone was very engaged, so I think that this grading scheme could be improved.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting\/relevant topic; balanced (though somewhat heavy) workload with weekly brief structure; occasional guest speakers via Zoom; writing weekly briefs (500-700 words each) helped me to digest readings and think about my reactions to them. Writing one every week forced you to stay very engaged with the class, and I appreciated that weekly routine to the class, even though they got tiring at the end. In my opinion, smaller assessments on consistent schedules help you learn better and are a lot less stressful than large, one-off exams; course schedule is very well organized with a build up to the main SRM\/SAI discussion during the first half and an unraveling of it during the second half. Weaknesses: Grading on briefs sometimes felt arbitrary, and I was never always clear on why I might receive a 2.75\/3 one week and then a 2.5\/3 and then a 3\/3 the next, etc. with no changes to my approach or effort. Grading of class participation also felt arbitrary and strangely harsh: the entire class was engaged, bought in, and speaking up during each meeting, but participation was graded in such a way that otherwise really great discussions could feel a little cutthroat and (unnecessarily) stressful, with eight or nine students raising their hands at once to fit a point in.",
                "The organization of the course timeline and materials are a huge strength. By starting off with two weeks of climate science, students are all put on the same page in terms of where we're at and where we're going when it comes to climate change. Follow that with topics like climate negotiations and the essentially certain underperformance of mitigation techniques, and students who begin the course completely unwilling to consider technology like stratospheric aerosol injection are suddenly willing to have deep discussions. The focus on technology, followed by ethics and public perception of geoengineering technology also allows for very meaningful and intriguing discussions. \r\n\r\nAnother strength relates to the weekly briefs. Although I would say the briefs result in more work than a course with just a couple of papers or exams, these assignments really prepare students to engage in discussion each week. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses with the course relate to a significant lack of emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion in geoengineering spaces. I would have liked to see more discussion on the implications such an imbalanced sector in terms of how the geoengineering technology is perceived globally. Perhaps that would make an argument for a push for broader representation in the field."

                "YES!!! Take this class. I am now so much more educated on climate change, carbon capture, and geo engineering and can articulate my thoughts on them so much better now. This is a class that can shape the way you view the world and your own academic\/career interests",
                "Yes. If you get in, you should absolutely take it. This class changed my perspective -- as someone headed for climate policy one day -- and taught me so much about climate science, geoengineering strategies, and the massive bundle of questions that is stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI). We are super lucky to have a class like this one at Yale.",
                "I would highly recommend this class. Very thought provoking and manageable workload, especially considering how much I took away from this class. The topic is very interesting and relevant and is taught by a professor that wants students to speak their own perspective and ask questions.",
                "Absolutely! If you are interested in climate change -- both for those with and without a strong background in environmental science -- this class will be worth your while. It will challenge your opinions and assumptions, and require you to think deeply about the complex and intersectional impact of different climate solutions. More than that -- this class is very fun! It is one of the best classes that I have taken at Yale, and fostered an incredible community of climate enthusiasts from diverse backgrounds.",

                "yeah sure. Take it Credit\/D though. A lot of people did that. The info is definitely important and informative, but the grading structure is just weird. You don't need this course for anything, so just take it for the intellectual challenge and be done with it.",
                "Absolutely. If you are interested in Climate Change and how we will approach solving the issue in the future, this is the course for you!",
                "Yes, though be prepared to Credit\/D the course if you find yourself a little thrown off by Professor Smith's grading. But just make a decision one way or another and don't let that disrupt your enjoyment of the course material, which is really so interesting. Not enough people know about geoengineering (or an overview of the climate problem in general)! Some solar radiation management tools can be controversial, but I was very glad to take this class and deepen my understanding of them. I think several may make mainstream appearances in climate discourse in the next decade or so, and this class also doubled as a great climate survey seminar.",
                "To anybody interested in climate change, who is looking for a nuanced, realistic and multi-faceted view of the issue, I would definitely recommend this course. The readings are well selected and we got to speak to many interesting people working within the field."
