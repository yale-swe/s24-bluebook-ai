                "I learned a significant amount of German grammar and improved spoken and written skills. The course gave me a good insight into German-speaking countries' cultures by researching and presenting about politics, architecture, famous people etc.",
                "Taking German 140 improved my ability to speak, listen, and write in German. As prospective German 140 students are likely already aware, the German language has a magnificently complex grammar that differs in surprising ways and to an unexpectedly large extent from English grammar. This class provided ample opportunity to incorporate these more complicated grammatical elements into our spoken and written German. Our instructor, Theresa Kauder, was a terrific help: she gently corrected our mistakes, suggested strategies to practice our German inside and outside of the classroom, and provided deeper insights into German grammar that went beyond the mere implementation of grammatical rules into the ways that Germans (contrasting with English-speakers) understand certain kinds of clauses. Being an upper-level course, German 140 emphasized speaking freely; in addition to classroom discussions, we were assigned weekly spoken journals to encourage speaking practice at-home. These journals recorded the impressive progress that we made from the first week of the semester to the very end. German 140 also had a lot of 'Landeskunde'--cultural information about Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. I enjoyed learning about the rich culture and history of these countries, and our instructor, who is originally from Germany, provided very interesting extra insights!"

            "comments": [
                "The course requires you to do some activities in the language every day, which significantly increases engagement. Using a book for asynchronous work, spoken journals, and a test on each chapter was also a valuable experience. Using the Mindtap software to practice grammar was not helpful; it significantly added to the workload and was mostly passive learning, which was not very valuable. I also believe we should have had more in-class presentations. We did one over the semester, which was a great experience that could be expanded. Feedback on oral and written assignments, as well as presentations, was helpful. We watched a couple of movies in class, one of which was in Swiss German, which did not help at all because we could not understand almost anything. The Mindtap system also does not send notifications and had assignments due during Thanksgiving week. This made it hard to keep track of the due dates, and consequently, students forgot to do it on multiple occasions. On the other hand, assignments on Canvas were very well organized and easy to follow.",
                "I enjoyed every aspect of this course. The course content was superb; I enjoyed practicing my German through discussion of such interesting topics as Wagner's music and Nietzsche's criticism of it; the works of Heinrich Bll, Erich Kstner, and Max Frisch; the art of Schiele, Klimt, and members of Die Brcke; and traditions in German-speaking countries. Our instructor, Theresa Kauder, allowed us to explore in our papers, projects, and other assignments what we found most interesting. Theresa provided thoughtful and thorough feedback to every assignment I turned in and my German improved greatly through her guidance. The course was perfect!"

                "Yes, but I wish they can have a different teacher. Granted, our prof just started teaching so thats okay?\r\n\r\nThis course is intensive, so very good for learning language. The assignment structure is decent enough so that its always kicking your ass but not too much.",
                "Leaning to a yes. The class is interesting and provides good insight into many different topics, but has a very high workload relative to the perceived learning benefits; a lot of work was more busy work than actual intellectual challenge. I believe there are better methods of learning a language. The course itself was somewhat well structured, except Mindtap. Overall, the course could be better, but was a valuable experience.",
                "Absolutely! The course content is fantastic and German is so much fun to learn. Your German will improve greatly. In addition, the Yale German Department is wonderful. Theresa Schenker, the German Language Program Director, goes out of her way to help students and is so nice."
