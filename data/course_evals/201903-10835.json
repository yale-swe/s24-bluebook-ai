    "Basic of microeconomics",
    "I learned how to quantitatively model different types of markets as well as decision-making using indifference curves.",
    "I learned how to approach problems and life from the standpoint of an economist.",
    "This course was a good introduction to microeconomic theory. It laid a solid ground work for economic theory.",
    "- How to think like an economist :)\r\n- How to use outside resources to learn material\r\n- How to think of the economy in terms of the market and the firm\r\n- How to draw highly generalized and often very ambiguous and confusing graphs",
    "Microeconomics",
    "I learned more concepts of microeconomics. I also learned how important it is to have an engaging professor (really, really crucial--always check the professor's rating before deciding to take the class).",
    "I learned basic introductory economics.",
    "I see life more strategically now. So, for example, asking myself if the cost of a certain action outweighs the benefits.",
    "I learned about the fundamentals of economics.",
    "We studied consumer choice theory, some behavioral economics, production, costs, market structures, labor and capital markets, and externalities\/public goods",
    "I learned a lot about what goes into the decision of firms in the market. In terms of knowledge, a lot of the information was new; I had never taken microeconomics prior. I got into the habit of going to office hours through this course.",
    "I feel I learned a good fundamental base knowledge in microeconomics.",
    "Nothing. Its funny how little I learned in the class despite spending 2.5 hours a week sitting in WLH listening to her drone on. A lot of the time Id go into class sprite and excited and within 5 minutes I found myself dozing off, wanting to be anywhere but WLH and wondering why Id made such a mistake taking this class. I entered the year excited thinking Id be an Econ major, but left wanting to do anything but. Its sad that this class especially is so bad given the ok ness of the lecture or seminar. Truly an embarrassment of a course",
    "The units in this Microeconomics course have supplied me with a good foundational knowledge of economics (topics include the basic mechanics of supply and demand, individual choices and preferences, game theory, a model for capital and labor markets, etc.). The class also provided me with a comprehensive theory-based understanding of today's economic situation.",
    "Micro economics skills",
    "I developed an understanding of the basics of economics, especially as they pertain to individual decision makers. I now know much more about the systems and factors that influence both consumers and producers"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - lectures are understandable, Psets and exams are also fairly straightforward and always match exactly what we have learned in class\r\nWeaknesses - just a bit dull sometimes, plus competitive atmosphere sometimes because the class is curved",
    "I found the material towards the end of the course about financial and capital markets the most interesting, and I wish we could have spent more time on this material and less on the very basics that were rather boring.",
    "Very boring for someone who already knows basic econ.",
    "There could be more real world examples.",
    "Strengths - clear instruction, easy to understand lessons, resources online and good TA help\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - not that exciting, a bit too abstract, very repetitive, very similar to the textbook, not that engaging in class",
    "Strengths:\r\n- Light work load\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Lecture was often unclear, confusing, irrelevant, or not thorough enough--I never felt like I understood any of the concepts or that it was being taught effectively in an introductory way\r\n- Office hours were useful but the TF did not know the content very well, which made it difficult to understand anything besides the answers to problems\r\n- Lecture notes were not satisfactory enough to study\r\n- Problem sets were useful but hard to complete given lack of resources for the class\r\n- Lack of extra resources for the class",
    "Slower pace in lecture",
    "The \"seminar\" style of this introduction to microeconomics allows students to gauge their performance through two midterm exams and eight problem sets.  The examinations not only required the ability to recall concepts but also understand how concepts learned in class are applied to different scenarios.",
    "Strengths: I personally just like economics, so I could bear all of the weaknesses.\r\nWeaknesses: Classes are very monotonous and not engaging at all. Professor Simons was not a good lecturer, in my opinion. She speaks kind of softly so it can be difficult at times to hear what she's saying. She was also just very terse throughout the semester--whenever I tried to ask her questions, she'd try to explain it once, and if I still didn't understand, instead of trying to explain the concept in a different way, she would simply shrug her shoulders and say, \"well, I don't know what to tell you then.\" This is really, really frustrating.\r\n\r\nI would recommend Econ 110 over Econ 115, though, as it seemed liked people in the big lecture were suffering more than we were in 110.",
    "Strengths: It is an organized class and a good introduction to microeconomics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures are quite dry and not very engaging (unless you're really into economics).",
    "A slower pace would be helpful",
    "Strengths: You learn a lot\r\nWeakness: the class' grading system is very harsh. After my first midterm, an A- was starting from a 96%!",
    "It was good. the curriculum was different from Econ 115 which i found strange because they are supposed to be the same class.",
    "Strengths- wide breadth of material learned.\r\nProblem sets helped for exams, lectures were posted for review. Weaknesses- some content was covered too quickly. Exam questions were heavily weighted to mean that a simple mistake can cost you a letter grade",
    "In terms of strengths, I think the course is very well-structured. Having two midterms and a final, along with a problem set due each week, ensured that I was keeping up with the material. I enjoyed the seminar-esque setting, as it motivated me to do my best. I think the course could be improved by integrating applying microeconomic principles to today's economy.",
    "The lectures could have been more engaging, but the fact that the lectures were posted was super helpful",
    "Strengths: good intro to microeconomics, the best of the three teachers, Professor Simon's dry humor\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes too fast-paced, curve can be tough first semester",
    "The strength of the course was the moment I got to hand in my final and walk away. Everything could be improved but I will try my best to offer as much criticism as possible. First thing that needs to be improved is the professor herself. Utterly terrible, doesnt know how to teach and relies completely on the lecture slides which themselves are poor. Not only does she not know how to teach, she yells at you if you ask a question that may seem meaningful. By the end of the class everyone would shut up and just pretend to know what was going on. Next weakness is the course material itself. probably linked back to the professor herself again who doesnt know how to teach.",
    "The class provided many external resources for students who wished to delve further into the subject (ex. research papers were included after each lecture that further elaborated on the subject of the class). A weakness of the class was the failure to directly mention policy decisions today that corresponded with the lectures.",
    "A lot of the teaching was unrelated to test and problem sets. Lots of concepts were discussed, could have focussed more on testing material",
    "A strength of this course is that the professor is a clear lecturer and is very willing and available to help students outside of class. The scope and level of the material is appropriate for an introductory class, covering a range of topics that keep the class interesting without becoming incomprehensible to a beginner like myself. One weakness is the size of the class; although the class was described as a much smaller version of the Econ 115 lecture, my section was still big enough that it felt more like a lecture than a seminar and it was difficult for the professor to give attention to individual students in class. I also took issue with the curved grading system because I do not prefer having my grade depend more on my peers' performance than my own, although I understand curves are very standard and common in this type of course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It's a really good way to figure out if you like econ, plus it's not too difficult. Definitely take it with Katerina if you can -- she really knows her stuff, and unlike people in the 110 classes with other instructors, I always knew that what we learned in class would match perfectly with the exam.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students with no background in economics because you will gain a better idea of how markets actually work.",
    "Not really. I was very bored most of the time.",
    "It is definitely good to learn economic theory. It is a bit slow and repetitive. The content of the course is really abstract and the specific, applicable parts were really engaging.",
    "If you are interested in getting exposed to the social sciences and think the economy and business are interesting, try out the course. If you've taken an economics class before and didn't like it, you will not like this course because it is very similar. If you are interested in business, you may not enjoy this class, as it is much more focused on the ideas of scarcity and supply and demand and much less about management and other business-esque concepts. This is an intro course but is not taught to facilitate introductory learning, at least from my experience. I came out with a better understanding of economics, but an overall negative opinion of the discipline. I was interested in business and thought I would like economics, but I did not, and I think that this course is a good way to check out a discipline you may be thinking about but unsure of.",
    "If youre interested in economics, but take the lecture not the seminar. The curve is worse in the seminar.",
    "This course is a prerequisite for many majors, so you really have no choice if you want to major in something that has this requirement. But try and see if you can get a more engaging and helpful professor.",
    "It's not an amazing course, but a good start if you're interested in economics or want a QR.",
    "If you enjoy economics then yes, I would recommend.",
    "Yes! Problem sets are simple.",
    "Yes, important skills to learn for life. No matter your major or career goals.",
    "Totally! It really opened my view on decision-making, and even if you're not interested in the major, it's a good course to take nonetheless. It's not too bad in terms of time commitment either.",
    "If you want to take intro econ, this is definitely the class to take. Intro Econ is tough and Professor Simons is the best of the teachers to take it with.",
    "Lol no. When I got sorted into this class it felt like I had just been sorted in hufflepuff but my whole family was gryffindor. The fomo of not getting into Tolgas class was like not getting into a zeta party during spring fling. I know this is a class requirement for Econ major but if theres any way you can avoid taking this class, thats what I would recommend. Even if you need to promise tolga your first child or sell your soul to go into lecture, anything is better",
    "No, lecture seems better",
    "I would, I felt that the seminar style class allowed for closer communication with the professor and her TA."
