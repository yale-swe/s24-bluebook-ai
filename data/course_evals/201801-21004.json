   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed how the deadlines helped keep me on track with my thesis without feeling suffocating.",
    "Teach students how to use Zotero or another citation management tool at the beginning of the year. The library offers these courses for free and are very helpful.",
    "I think meeting in a large group is detrimental to getting revisions done, and meeting in small groups worked much better.",
    "The second semester of the EVST colloquium is much less structured. While my experience was overall very positive, I think it differs depending upon people's personal thesis advisers. The departmental dinners were fun and engaging, and I enjoyed getting to work with smaller groups of students in peer-editing.",
    "My one comment on the BS side was that it would be extremely helpful to meet with students at the end of junior year and pick a topic then.  Having the extra time during summer would be nice, but more importantly I think this would allow us to have a plan to complete data analysis during the fall semester, which was the most stressful\/complicated\/problematic part of the project."
