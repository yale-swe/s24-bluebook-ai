                "This course provided a solid survey into anthropology in contemporary Japan, as well as major historical events which led up to the changes currently being seen within the country's social and economic structures. I highly valued the way this course let me explore many different ideas within human behavior, interpersonal dynamics, the way people respond to shifts in the economy, life course and purpose, etc. Just as well, since this course situated its view in Japan, it was plain to see how the content each week built upon ideas from weeks prior. That feature helped to enhance my understanding of the new material without becoming repetitive. I leave this class feeling more secure in my ability to analyze ethnographic data, more informed about social issues in Japan, and more questioning into how the topics discussed in class may apply to how I view my own life. Topics we delved into include, but are not limited to: amae, ikigai, hikikomori, the aging population (and robots in elder care), shifting economic structures, multiethnicity, marriage postponement, and rural areas.",
                "I learned a lot about modern Japanese society and anthropological understandings of Japanese contemporary history and changes. I gained more vocabulary and expressions to explain anthropological aspects of society.",
                "Learned about the overview of Japanese society for the past century and understood the different inflection points and their effect on society and culture. Also got to read the seminal works in the topics covered ranging from youth and education to religion and technology.",
                "I gained an insurmountable amount of knowledge on Japanese society, culture, history, thought, and identity. This class was spectacular and everything was clear from the get-go. Readings were thoroughly discussed, presentations by Prof. Aronsson were lengthy yet detailed, and if you had any questions, she could talk to you for hours after class, over Zoom, or in person. I also learned how to extrapolate the key details worth discussing and then on the spot come up with an answer, but that's more on me than it is on Prof. Aronsson."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths are that this course is great for how it structures itself in independent reading, lecture on relevant information, and in-class discussion. As this class is primarily aimed at allowing students to explore ideas within anthropology in Japan, there is clearly a lot of freedom to think, discuss, and learn. This is good as the course never felt bogged down by excessive papers or other assessments. The major papers are relevant and present, but in between them, there is a lot of room to spend time thinking. Thus, while there is a lot of reading and you are expected to think quite a bit, it never felt that stressful.\r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses of the course, I will say that while most of the readings were fine, and there were a few gems that were extremely interesting, there were also a few readings that left me wanting. It is understandable that in a course like this, there must be some older readings with a lot of background, and not every text is going to be the best, but some were certainly a slog. Such ones could likely be summed up in much shorter pieces or ought to be skimmed, but the material was always relevant so I cannot knock too many points off for the pieces being boring, long-winded, and repetitive. Specifically, a Week 2 reading on the Mazda Turnaround was very hard to get through, but perhaps that is only because of my disinterest with manufacturing. Once again, most readings were fine.",
                "The course was amazing. The readings were interesting and well organized. I LOVED how professor Aronsson used the questions students posed in discussion posts in our class discussions of texts. This method allowed for the discussion post homework to actually feel worthwhile and matter. We had good discussion and covered a lot of ground.",
                "Strengths are the professor, the readings, and the extra discussion and reading material provided by the professor. The professor did a great job of curating the discussion but sometimes it was a bit disorganized - could just have been a matter of time but an improvement of the discussion would make the class more brilliant.",
                "Strengths: breadth of readings, the sheer dedication of Prof. Aronsson is absolutely unmatched, her knowledge knows no bounds, and she gives the most detailed feedback and incredibly quickly. Class discussion was surprisingly dominated by two or three students for some reason, and the grad students literally never said a thing which made no sense to me whatsoever. WEAK: so so so many of the readings were from 2003 and before, many from the 90s, and even in the 80s, so I felt like a lot of the knowledge was outdated. I felt this when I was writing my midterm paper (which was very easy and Prof. Aronsson was available for help and assistance at every step of the way), as ijime and school attitudes are bound to have changed in the past 21, now 22 years, and that didn't feel reflected in my work. I think student presentations should be scrapped. Presentation givers literally only read the papers in-depth for the week that they were presenting, presentations were unengaging, and because there were so few guidelines, they ended up being massive summaries of the readings. Not to mention they wasted an absurd amount of time and left no time for discussion, and questions from the presentations seldom went answered or discussed. It was just sad. We also didn't get formal feedback on the presentations, which given her track record, was a little bit of a let down. I also wish there was less of a focus on economic anthropology and more what we discussed after the midterm paper was due - mental health, social isolationism, cultural clashes, religion, anime, new identities, maid cafes, food and obento box preparations, hyperaging, robots, and more. Perhaps something on Japanese theater, or something on queerness, or even something on Japanese art would have made some of the more depressing topics less depressing. More videos and pictures and less words on the slides please too!"

                "I would recommend this course to another student! If it will help in their major or if it will provide a needed Social Science credit, it is certainly a good choice. Just as well, the material is very interesting and there are only a few large assignments with deadlines to stress about (midterm and final paper + final proposal outside of weekly discussion posts), so that is definitely a perk. I will say, to those who are only doing it out of pure interest or for the Social Science credit, it should be considered that workload is a bit large if you are really trying to do the course as it should be done. Properly engaging with the ideas in the readings means doing the readings, and there is approx 125 pages of reading per week. Some of them will fly by but others will not (though I suppose it is not necessary to deeply connect with every piece), but if the student does not mind doing readings and spending time thinking about the concepts presented each week, it is certainly worth it.",
                "Definitely recommend this to anyone. You dont need to know about Japan or anthropology and the course can serve as an introduction to other of these disciplines.",
                "YES! Take it. This is one of the best, if not the best, intro Japan course you can take at Yale. It has both depth and breadth and lets you come out of it feeling confident in the knowledge you are covering.",
                "Absolutely 100%. Seemed odd at first, but it was immediately engaging. No bait and switch with using a PPT on the first day and never again - we were always welcomed with a wonderfully constructed, by 90 slide PPT that we never got through. Papers are very leniently graded and if you learn something, that's what Prof. Aronsson is looking for really. If she gets rid of the stupid student presentations or makes them less robotic, then it would've been a better class; or if she cold called on some students who literally never participated, then I think that would've made conversation more free-flowing. Perfect amount of instructor input and student reception. I loved this class. One of the highlights of my semester. Especially how dedicated Aronsson is. Truly unbelievable."
