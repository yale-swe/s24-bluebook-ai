The size of  course was also one of it's greatest strengths and made me feel like the mini-projects were approachable and the learning was collaborative. I thought that by having a different mini project every 10 days I was able to gain skills for doing stat projects across so many different fields.",
                "Strength: the class environment and vibe is great thanks to Prof. Macdonald and the small class size; the project assignments are interesting; the final individual capstone project takes up some time but the overall workload is very reasonable",
                "Strengths: Very understanding and reasonable professor who made class fun; taught like a senior capstone class. Weekly/Bi-weekly projects were fantastic because we were doing something different every week. The breadth of data science done in the class was also very helpful for graduating seniors\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Knowing the specific skills/data techniques we would encounter in the class at the beginning of the semester"

                "Yes, absolutely! Not even considering that this is a required course if you're not completing a stats thesis, this is still one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Prof. Macdonald is so easy to approach and helpful, and the projects we've worked on in the class are actually interesting and good to learn from. I feel like I filled in the holes for the things I thought I'd learn from stats major but didn't before.",
                "Yes. Keep in mind, the class was very small this semester so professor help was more personal and the class became very close. If you are choosing to do a thesis or this class, this class would be a great capstone and summarization of S&DS at Yale. It might be less of an intellectual challenge than a thesis though."
