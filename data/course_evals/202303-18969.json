                "I gained introductory knowledge into specifically US politics and political science. This was achieved by learning about the structure of the government and its satellite institutions and how they relate to the American population. I also learned how to write a political science paper, which was helpful because they are different from other disciplines.",
                "I developed the ability to make arguments based on political readings.",

                "Coming into this class, I expected to learn the basics about American Politics, but I did not expect to learn much about theories. This class is content based and theory based.",
                "I learned more about the US government structure, the history behind the Constitution, and how the various branches of government interact to hold each other accountable. I also learned about the ideal structure vs what is actually happening today.",
                "I developed insight into American politics through a lens that I have never used before. Kinane uses political science research pertinent to the field in a powerful and effective way that aligns with course material but also keeps us up to date on political issues.",
                "Gained more knowledge of the american political system as an international student. Good, easy intro class for first-years to get used to content heavy reading. However, unless a personal interest or required for your major, there are more classes like this where the content is more engaging.",

                "I thought more critically about how government is productive despite partisan divide.",
                "This was the first ever political science class that I took and it taught me the basics of American politics.",

                "I became better at analytically reading and taking notes on primary and secondary sources. I also became more educated on different lenses of viewing American Politics.",
                "This course taught me how to interpret, analyze, and discuss a wide range of political science writings. The readings started simpler, as they explained the founding and the U.S. government's structure. However, as the course continued, Professor Kinane incorporated political science research, giving us specific guidance on how to best absorb the information there. Some of these readings were pretty dense, so Professor Kinane's guidance was very useful. I also developed writing skills through our reading responses and final essay, which were designed to help us understand, explain, and analyze our readings.",
                "This course was a good introduction into basic political theory and studies. At times, section discussions were helpful and made me think differently about the readings.",
                "I learned a lot about the US government by taking this course. I learned to think critically about generalizations that are made about the government and politics in general.",
                "I obtained a thorough understanding of American Politics and learned a variety of theories that accompany the study of political science.",

                "the volume of readings was much greater than what I was used to in high school, so taking this class made me better at reading and annotating faster. it was also a good introduction to the basics of American politics and history",
                "Comprehensive look at the American Political System. Excellent course for grounding the basics, however if you already have a thorough understanding of American Politics some of the lectures might feel slow or boring to you. That being said this course integrates a lot of interesting political science that makes the content all the more interesting.  You have to cover a lot of ground in one semester, but Professor Kinane does an excellent job of doing so.",
                "I learned a lot about political science theories and how the American government functions. I also became more adept at analyzing political science research.",
                "Very good introduction to basics of American Political system in many facets.",
                "I was able to learn more about American politics.",
                "Learned about the basic structure of the American government. As an introductory course, we overviewed the parts of the government that keeps the machine running. Reading and writing skills were developed.",
                "I enjoyed the thorough introduction into American Politics Research that I received from Professor Kinane. The course was well laid-out from the very first day of class, and I always knew exactly what was expected of me. I felt encouraged by Professor Kinane throughout the semester, and was encouraged to always strive for my personal best in the various assignments I undertook. I would--- without any hesitation--- recommend this course to any student even remotely interested in the world of American Politics and American Political Science Research.",
                "I learned about many political science theories namely around American Politics. A lot of what is taught in this class is similar to what you may have learned in AP Gov but with more depth and you explore the research behind political theories.",
                "I learned about American government and politics and analyzed theories about the workings of our government.",
                "learned about the way that government functions and different political theories",
                "While I took U.S. government in high school, Intro to American Politics provided me with a breadth of new ideas and fascinating concepts that were new to me. The course was a great introduction to the world of political science research as it helped me develop strategies in argumentation, analysis, and reading academic writing. Regarding content, I learned a lot about the intricacies of U.S. government and political dynamics in America. The information was detailed, but clear and well-delivered.",

                "I feel like the overall coursework was good and prompted my learning. The  way the course is set up I learned a lot and the work did not seem overbearing.",
                "Sometimes the lectures felt really repetitive from the homework.",
                "I was incentivized to pay attention in class before the midterm because the midterm was a test. After that there were no more tests, only papers, which made it easier to be checked out during lecture.",
                "Some strengths are that the professor is a great teacher and her lectures are very good. Some weaknesses are that some of the readings can be too long, especially excerpts from political journals.",
                "Strengths are focus on getting comfortable with reading political science journals; assignments are definitely doable and usually helpful for understanding content.",
                "This course is structured very nicely; the lectures were always very good at reviewing the reading material.",
                "Strengths are Professor Kinane, she was super engaging and made the content slightly more exciting. Weaknesses are the amount of readings and content is quite boring. Apart from the midterm the content learnt in class didn't apply to any of quizzes or final paper. Also after the final reading response and quiz, there was no incentive to go to class as the only grades assignment left was the final paper.",
                "The course was low workload and super informative. Most of the knowledge comes from the instructor's summaries of the readings. There is not much of an incentive to go to class unless you truly want to know more about the topic.",
                "The course provides a good survey overall. However, I feel as though this class was perhaps too easy. Whilst I appreciate that it is an introductory course, and although there was a good level of academic rigour in the course material, the grading was incredibly generous and disproportionate to the amount of work that you actually had to put in.",
                "The course itself was very well organized and TF's were available for questions and provided useful feedback. There was also a high level of engagement in discussion sections.",
                "The strengths of this course are the quizzes were fair and the course felt paced correctly. The growth for this course is to have better TFs. I loved my TF as a person, but, at times, it felt like she never knew what was going on especially when it came to the mid-term and the final.",
                "This course was very reading-based which I personally did not love. I would have preferred to examine some real-world scenarios in relation to what we were being taught so that it would have been cleared to understand. Some readings were, however, interesting.",
                "I think the reading of the articles of different political scientists was good, but I did not like that there was reading from the Logic of American Politics. Together it made the reading before class 100+ pages, yet the textbook readings never came up. I definitely feel like I wasted my time doing the readings for that reason. I don't think the textbook is even necessary. I think Professor Kinane is a great lecturer and I really appreciate her lecture style and kindnes.",
                "The Midterm couldve been a little shorter given the amount of time we had",
                "It was a really interesting course that I enjoyed taking! Not too much work besides readings but those were pretty interesting.",
                "Stregnths: very easy course, straight-forward, easy workload. Weaknesses: lectures are easy to space out and not pay attention",
                "The professor was amazing. Professor Kinane is very knowledgeable and passionate about Political Science, and it was always enjoyable to witness her teaching and discussing the topics we covered in class.",
                "Lectures are engaging but surface level. Dr. Kinane is smart, organized, and engaging. For students with exposure to American politics, not a lot of new information is covered. Some of the research papers are interesting, but many share information that seem relatively straightforward. It was hard to find motivation to do readings because it felt like I already knew a lot of the content.",
                "Strength: Although people say that this course is basically AP American Government, for someone like me who had never taken AP classes before, this was a perfect course. Professor Kinane made lectures entertaining by bringing up current on going topics and news into the lecture. I also enjoyed that there were readings in the class because the lectures taught me the content of a typical American politics class and the readings gave me insight into how the field of political science works and how political scientists conduct their research. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I can't come up with one off the top of my head except for the textbook readings. They were a lot to do and on many days, I couldn't finish them (I also didn't find them as useful for midterm studying or for my own knowledge).",
                "I think that the course readings were relevant to both the course lectures and provided us with additional context with the various subject we converted over the semester. I also believe that the amount of readings was sufficient in that it never felt unmanageable. \r\n\r\nI believe that an improvement could be made on the midterm. Overall I do not believe the exam was particularly difficult assuming you kept up with the lectures and course material. However, I do not believe we were provided with sufficient time to complete all questions in the amount of detail that was expected. The short answer questions in my humble opinion were not short answers as there were often multiple aspects to each question that required more time than the five minutes that was provided. The questions again were not particularly difficult but perhaps a simplification of what is being asked or additional time on the exam would be beneficial to future students.",
                "Professor Kinane is such a great strength to this course!",
                "I found it difficult to engage with the texts and prompts in an extended manner. In reading responses, papers, or short answer tests, my work was a regurgitation of lectures. The assignments left little room for creativity. Though, this may be expected in an introductory course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kinane is a dawg and so was my TA\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None really",
                "This course was pretty digestible and accessible to those without a background in poli sci. It could however focus in on topics and not skim over everything.",
                "Strengths: \r\n1. Very well organized\r\n2. Fair grading\r\n3. Prof Kinane incorporates current events into the class - for example, we had an extra credit assignment where we could react to the House Speakership Ousting, applying what we learned in class to the situation.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n1. Based off of speaking to other peers in the course, there seemed to be some inconsistencies between the different TA's (grading, engagement, resources provided, etc.). \r\n2. Inconsistent reading load - some weeks it was very difficult to manage all the readings, especially as we incorporated more dense material.",
                "The strength of this course is that it is taught in a way that is very accessible. All of the assignments were very easy to understand and complete. This is an intro course that accomplishes its goal of providing a baseline understanding of political science. I liked how the readings interacted and even explicitly mentioned one another, most of the readings felt necessary rather than just busy work. \r\nOn the other hand, sections for this course were very disengaging. It felt like another lecture at times and I think that made students less interactive. I wish the lectures would have drawn more on content from the readings rather than basic facts about government.",
                "I found the lectures very engaging. I think the exam could be improved. It seemed like the midterm only covered the readings instead of lecture content, and this made the midterm just a regurgitation of the homework readings which I don't think was an effective way to test our learning.",
                "Some of the quizzes were too simple in my opinion. It felt as though they did not require anything beyond a surface level understanding of the content.",
                "This is a great course! The professor and TFs are so helpful and genuinely want you to learn a lot.",
                "I liked the class overall, including how work was given.",
                "Great readings! I think discussion sections could have benefitted from turn-and-talk or different forms of participating.",
                "professor kinane is a really great lecturer and her office hours are really helpful. the sections weren't very deep but were great for people who were confused on readings and wanted clarification. i think it was a good amount of material and depth for an intro course, but isn't the class to take if you want deeper and more complex readings.",
                "strengths- Professor Kinane is an exceptionally talented lecturer I could listen to her all day long and she teaches in such a way that prepares you to actually learn and not just hear information. Quizzes are easy and work as functional commitment mechanisms. Section was very useful in understanding the material especially challenging journals. Great balance of political science with chapter readings about the contents.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: - midterm was way to long for the time given, and I felt like I could have performed a lot better had I had adequate time. - reading response questions were at times difficult to respond to in 2 pages",
                "Strengths: Professor Kinane is super engaging and is really enthusiastic about political science. You also learn so much about how different institutions in the American government function and interact with each other. Weaknesses: The sections weren't as engaging as I hoped they would be.",
                "Many strengths very few weaknesses. Very well taught and organized class.",
                "I don't think there were weaknesses, I think the professor was amazing.",
                "Good introductory course .",
                "I thought that the course was very well laid out in the syllabus, and I always knew exactly what was expected of me. Lectures were extremely engaging, and section was a fantastic opportunity to interact with the course content in a more intimate setting.",
                "Strengths: Kinane is a very engaging professor and comes into every lecture excited to teach. The content of the class is very interesting. I found the workload to be very manageable. Kinane was a very fair and generous instructor. She would give a couple minutes of extra time on an exam, she would give a class extension if a large chunk of the class was having travel issues after a break, and she even gave extra credit when multiple students were not able to complete the midterm.\r\nWeaknesses: There are quite a few readings every week that seemed excessive, but this may have been because it was only my first semester and I did not know how manage my workload better. While all the TFs seemed fair with their grading, I know there was some variation in how some of them graded papers--some were a bit harsher than others. But generally, all the TFs seemed fair.",
                "Lectures were well organized and consisted of interesting content. I cannot think of a significant weakness.",
                "well organized slides and lectures. easy quizzes that encouraged reading.",
                "The course is incredibly well-structured, the readings are fascinating, and Professor Kinane is a wonderful instructor! The lectures are engaging and section always has very interesting discussions on a wide range of topics. I would like to see the course tie a lot of concepts to the current happenings in politics not only to build on the material's everyday relevance, but also to make the learning more engaging than it already is.",

                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Kinane is a great lecturer and organizes such an engaging course.",
                "Yes, It is a very easy course and great if you are looking for an easy social science.",
                "Yes",
                "YES!!! Prof Kinane is really enthusiastic, and this class is super easy and actually fun. I found myself slightly enjoying the final paper, and the TA's were AMAZING",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student interested in American politics.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! Professor Kinane is great!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in majoring in political science. This class is a good starting point and introduction for political science, and much of the material is easy to understand.",
                "YES!",
                "Yes, it's a solid intro plsc lecture! I thought it would just be a repeat of AP Gov, but I think the course is structured in a nice way to go beyond just that.",
                "Yes! It is a great introduction to American Politics, but is also a great introduction to the courses at Yale. The workload is not heavy, but there is a lot of content to digest and learn from.",
                "Yes! It's a nice introduction to US government structure and how the branches interact.",
                "Yes. Especially if you are wondering if political science (emphasis on the science) is what you hope to pursue.",
                "I would recommend as an international student that wanted to broaden my knowledge of the American political system, and for an stress-free class. Not necessarily a gut but an easy class to gain a credit.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student only if they had (like myself) a limited working knowledge of American government, albeit with an interest to learn more.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students to meet their major requirements for political science (as it is an introductory lecture).",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student. While I am a political science major, I felt like this class was engaging and fair. As long as you put in the work, the class is awesome!",
                "I would not recommend this course because I did not personally enjoy it that much. There were a few times over the semester that I was very engaged in the content, but, overall, it was not a course for me.",
                "I would. It's a great introduction into politics and it is not hard to get an A. Professor Kinane is clear on what is needed to get the grade.",
                "Yes, I feel it is a perfect introductory political science course",
                "Yeah",
                "Yes! Great intro to polysci class. Easy 5th class and very manageable and enjoyable. Like AP gov.",
                "Of course, if you're interested in majoring in Political Science, you have to take some intro class, and I think this is an enjoyable and manageable way to complete one of them. I wouldn't say the course goes intensely into detail about most topics; it more broadly examines a lot of topics, but I'm pretty sure that's the point of intro classes, so it should be expected anyways.",
                "Yes, shes the sweetest! So considerate of her students and definitely wants everyone to succeed",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to someone who doesn't understand American politics. You will leave with a both a broad and deep understanding how political structures operate. It is not a challenging workload, but by paying attention in lecture, you will understand the political system well. For students who are interested in politics and exposed to American politics, I would only recommend this class if you need a gut. There are definitely classes geared more towards people looking for a more specific\/nuanced evaluation of the political system.",
                "If you are curious to see if you will enjoy learning not only about American politics, but in general the field of political science, this is the course to take! I learned so much about how political science research is conducted as well as the type of discussions people have.",
                "This class is a must for anyone wanting to gain a foundational knowledge of the inner workings of the American political system ranging from the constitution to congressional power and everything in between.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who has little knowledge of the American political system.",
                "Yes, this is an easy but most importantly an enjoyable class as long as you do your work and pay attention (somewhat)",
                "I definitely would. Professor Kinane was energetic and contributed a lot of different studies to the lectures.",
                "I would recommend this course only if the student has not taken a civics class before or if it is necessary for their major. I don't feel like I learned anything new from the class that I hadn't learned in AP Government in high school, and a lot of the course felt a little shallow and repetitive. That being said, it is a good introduction to American politics, and if the student is generally interested and doesn't have much experience, then this course would be a good fit.",
                "I would recommend this course because it was a really good introduction to politics that was not too rigorous. I took AP Gov and APUSH before this class, and I still feel like I learned a lot because we were assigned academic readings and we went deeper than I had gone in those AP courses.",
                "I would recommend this course, especially for students looking for a straightforward introduction to the American Government, how it works, and what political science research has to say about it. The workload is manageable and assignments are graded fairly.",
                "I would recognize this course to any student at Yale. This is a very basic intro course. Don't expect a deep dive into any particular topic or theory. Nonetheless, the readings were interesting and the workload is relatively low. This is a good course but don't expect anything beyond an introduction.",
                "I would recommend this course because it is a survey course that covers lots of general information about the US government.",
                "I think this is a great introductory class to American Politics and it definitely fed my desire to dive deeper into the field.",
                "Yes! I loved this class!",
                "yes!!",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, it gives you a review on the basic of American politics along with helping you develop further thoughts on it.",
                "Yes, it was a great introduction to American politics.",
                "i would recommend this course because it helps you develop faster and more efficient ways of reading and understanding long readings. the readings can get kind of boring, and some studies are really self-explanatory\/not groundbreaking, but I thought it was good to brush up on the foundations of American politics.",
                "Absolutely!!! Professor Kinane is incredible and she works to facilitate learning in and outside of the classroom. The course expectations and content are clear and the work is generally consistent. A great introductory course to American politics.",
                "Yes, I learned a lot about American politics and political science research. The content was really interesting and Professor Kinane is an amazing lecturer.",
                "Very much recommend. The class is very insightful and Prof. Kinane is very high energy and engaging. Extremely manageable workload, TF sections very helpful.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student.",
                "I would recommend this course for political science majors Or for international students who are interested in the structure and works of the American government.",
                "I would--- without hesitation--- recommend this course to any student even remotely interested in the field of American Politics.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in American politics. Kinane is a great instructor and you will love the high energy that she brings to every lecture. If you need an intro poli sci class for your major, I would recommend PLSC 113.",
                "Yes, it is a great introduction to political science.",
                "Yea, I would recommend this course to people on the Political Science track, or those who are interested in pursuing this field",
                "yes, good intro to the topic. not too challenging but interesting for anyone relatively interested in the field.",
                "Intro to American Politics is a wonderful course! While I took U.S. government in high school, taking this course exposed me to a lot of new, interesting, and fascinating concepts and ideas. Moreover, it offers one with the ability to better understand the current political landscape. The workload was manageable and the teaching fellows were amazing. I definitely recommend this course for political science majors or those who are curious about politics.",
                "Yes highly!"
