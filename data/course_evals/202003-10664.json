Some insights I made from this course is that the Russian language is actually very easy to use to its many connections with my native tongue, Spanish.",

                "I was worried that the online format would make it difficult for me to start learning a new language, but Professor Titus and Chloe encouraged active participation by asking each of us to speak in Russian at the beginning of class, calling on people to answer questions from exercises, and splitting us into breakout rooms. Overall, I think this course did an excellent job of teaching fundamental Russian grammar. At the same time, the introduction to the Russian alphabet at the beginning of the course felt a bit chaotic. Professor Titus showed us how to write a few letters in cursive, but I would have appreciated it if we had gone through the entire alphabet in order (for both the printed and cursive alphabets). Even if we had to memorize the alphabets on our own, it would have been helpful to have at least some sort of systematic introduction to the language."

If the group could only be divided into two then that would probably be better."

If you stick with it, you'll gain access to an incredible body of literature and a rich culture, one that many Americans don't care about or fully understand."
