I got the macro perspective of American education, getting to read and discuss primary sources from some of the most prominent thinkers. I also learned a lot about who American education has left behind and the different experiences of different people throughout the educational system.",

                "I loved this course! The class discussions were always really interesting and prof Rosenberg was very receptive to feedback so it felt like we all collaborated in conducting the class. Each week someone brought in a primary source from the time period we were studying which added interesting things for us to talk about beyond what we learned from the reading. The only weakness was that some of the readings were a bit outdated, and I would have liked to read more contemporary discussions of education history if they exist.",
                "Strengths: I thought the topics of the course were excellent, and I really liked going through primary sources to write about a specific source for the topic of my choice. I liked how we signed up for what theme we'd like to present our primary source on on the first day of class. Professor Rosenberg was excellent, and the discussions were always very engaging. The primary source reader (The School in the United States) was really helpful for me throughout the course, and I appreciate the novels we read that gave us so many more perspectives than what's traditionally taught.\r\nWeaknesses: Though the course was structured really well in the themes of what we were discussing, sometimes the discussions could be a bit scattered.",
                "I think this is a great class. The readings were really well planned and were actually doable week to week, so it felt like I was really able to meet expectations for the class.\r\n\r\nIt was a bit long - I think even 20 minutes less would have helped a lot for us to be more focused and for the whole class to participate. Usually people were distracted toward the end. I also think we would have benefited from less of a question based class - sometimes it felt like the whole class was just coming up with more and more specific questions about history and I did want to have some form of conclusion about the general themes in the periods we studied. This may have just been driven by the members of the class, however.",
                "I loved the readings, and Professor Rosenberg is unbelievably well-informed about American educational history. The weakness of the course, stilted class discussions, was resolved halfway through the semester when Professor Rosenberg stopped calling on students to give commentary.",

                "I would! I definitely think having a background in education is helpful, however. This was a great course, though, to approach from a history perspective and I definitely learned a ton about the educational landscape.",
                "I definitely would. The amount of reading is actually doable and not over the top, so you feel like you can meet the class expectations and participate in discussion. The workload in general is just right - the small presentations and large paper are enough work that you're engaged but you aren't drowning.",
                "I definitely would. I feel like a lot of EDST courses include similar content and themes, but this class takes another perspective by emphasizing historical development over contemporary themes.",
