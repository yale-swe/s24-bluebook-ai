                "I learned about sports protest that pertain to other issues besides black issues. Being African American I tend to focus on issues that revolve around people who look like me. This class helped me understand the other issues other races face, specifically in sports.",
                "I gained a lot of knowledge on how sports and politics go hand and hand as well as racial issues in sports compared almost identically to that of society.",
                "I learned a lot about activism as it came to sports historically and in the modern-day.  We talked about all the different nuances of social change in and related to athletics.",

                "In this course we learned about sport as simultaneously a site of resistance and activism and a space where hierarchies and the status quo are maintained. This course taught me so much about how to think critically about sport in ways that can be applied to other aspects of popular culture and media. As someone who isn't an avid sports fan, this course made me take another look at sports, and I hope in the future I will be able to think of sport as a kind of cultural and political touchstone.",

We did a lot of close reading, and detailed analysis, and although things weren't very quantitative, we examined a great number of viewpoints and really broke things down tangibly."

                "The online version was definitely hard to engage in since the class was 3 hours and 25 mins long.",

                "I loved this course and its format, but I would have enjoyed more small-group discussions to allow for more voices to be heard.",
                "It was online, so it was very difficult to have proper discussion, but for what it was, the class was great",
                "I really enjoyed having topics that ranged from skateboarding in urban areas to protest on Yale's campus in the 1970s. The diverse set of readings and speakers really made the class enjoyable for me. One thing that wasn't good was how long the class was. 1:00-4:15 is a very long time for a class. Although it was long, the Professor made it very enjoyable.",
                "I absolutely loved this course. The guest speakers are very interesting and the course keeps you engaged well as well as interesting and real life topics that we can think about in our everyday life.",
                "Strengths: I liked the way that the course was led with different group facilitation weekly. The readings were generally interesting and relevant. The weekly assignments were helpful but not overwhelming.",
                "Strengths - Amazing content, guest speakers, TAs and passionate and knowledgable professor\r\nWeaknesses- None",
                "The material of the class was incredibly interesting and engaging; I loved how many different speakers we had and how many topics we covered. However, the course material did feel a bit repetitive at times. I think I would've been much more engaged had I taken this during the year, but the 3 hour long lectures twice a week were pretty brutal. After a while most people would just check out, meaning breakout groups were like pulling teeth.",
                "Strengths: the news articles posted by classmates, class wiki pages with topical events that tied into themes of the class. It was so awesome to see what we were discussing in our class in action, especially with the Summer Olympic Games happening at the same time! Another strength was the awesome guest speakers! I really enjoyed each of their talks, and I was glad that students got to answer questions. The interaction between students and the guest speakers, many of whom had written some of our course readings, made the readings almost come alive. Our TAs were also really awesome and brought in new things to think about. Discussion groups were also awesome, because students got to give their input on the class topics, and bring in outside perspectives  this was also a strength of the writing assignments and final project.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Online format, of course, is a bother. The class sessions were quite long (3hrs) and so it was a little hard to keep attention for the entire time, but with a 5 week course, there is a lot of material to cover, so that time block was kinda necessary.",
                "I enjoy the opportunity to speak with guests from outside; they bring an outside perspective that is fresh and engaging. I would encourage more class collaboration in the form of discussion, and I'd also appreciate a summary review at the end of each class just about some key concepts we've learned for the day.",
                "I think that the strength is the setup, it's great, and each TA did a great job of making the time go by fast.",
                "I found the course very engaging.  The topics were interesting and relevant. An actual activist or athlete who has been involved in issues discussed interacting with the class would be great in a non-COVID year.",
                "I really liked this course. I think engagement could've been incentivized a little bit more. If i was at a more difficult place in my life I definitely would've skated a little bit more, but I felt engaged and focused the full way through. I loved the format of having the guests that we did with the opportunity to engage consistently with them on a personal level."

                "Yes, if you're interested in the intersection of sports, politics, and activism, this is the class to take.",
                "Yes, I would. Even if you do not participate or watch sports, this class allows for completely new insight into how race, gender, and cultural topics can be expanded and influence future change in the United States. If you are an athlete, this class is perfect for you.",
                "Yes, very enjoyable summer class. Grading is easy and the topic is interesting.",
                "I would. Professor Hosang is amazing. He is super understanding of his students and changes his lessons/structures to best facilitate everyone's learning. He's responsive, receptive, and extremely knowledgable.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course. But only if you enjoy sports and understand them. Do not take this class if you do not like student athletes at Yale or general because it is geared towards events, issues, and facts that revolve around sports and how they relate to the world of academia.",
                "Yes, especially if you're interested in sports and race relations. You get to listen to amazing guest speakers that give you great perspective as well as apply the knowledge in the work you are given. You are also not overloaded with busy work, but work that really applies to the class and to life.",
                "Yes, I would. The class was interesting and gives the chance to talk/think about social activism from a different perspective of sports. I also liked that we could choose our own topics for the larger projects. This is a good class to take if you are interested in race, sports, or social change, and if you want to see what the intersection of the three could be.",
                "Absolutely, not only is it interesting but you gain so many wonderful insights from guest speakers and your peers that facilitate wonderful conversations",
                "Yes! If you love sports (watching, playing, anything) and/or are interested in racial/social justice and social movements, this is the course for you. Even if you aren't actively interested in either of those things, the course is still incredibly interesting and engaging",
                "Absolutely! This class was so awesome, and I had so much fun in class even though I wasn't super jazzed about the topic beforehand. It was perfect concurrent with the summer Olympic games because there was sports news coming in every day! I really enjoyed the discussion about mythologies, and it's something that can be applied outside the course.",
                "Yes. Good perspective to learn about social problems through something we love [sports]. The most important lesson you'll learn is that there are things out there you have to accept are flawed and need to actively advocate for change, but still love them at the same time.",
                "I would because if you like sports and are aware of anything going on in the world you'll love it. Just gives you such a deeper understanding of things that you love.",
                "Absolutely.  This was a very interesting subject matter.",
                "I would, especially if one's interests align with ERM or with the implications of sport/entertainment. The lessons learned apply to many arenas beyond the subject matter of the class, and as such it's a great way to engage. Additionally, if this is what the ERM dept is like i'm strongly considering a major, and to that end this served as a great introduction into the department"
