Goods and Goodness is all about the interdisciplinary factors that influence how people make decisions in consumption (anthropology, behavioral economics, Logics of Affordability, cultural\/social capital, etc). There is something for everyone in this seminar."

                "strength: diversity of content\r\nweakness: more succint explanations\/collaboration with other students",
                "A strength of the class would be that it challenges students to look at consumption through a variety of new angles and perspectives and forces you to be more aware of your own practices and habits, what they mean, and how they can have a larger impact. A weakness would just be that we dont get to go into as much detail about specific concepts and key points we discuss in class because there was so much material to be covered (especially if you dont have prior knowledge in the subject).",
                "Strength : small group discussion, good PowerPoints, reading guides were helpful, really interesting and engaging topics \r\nWeakness: ran out of time during class to finish lecture, sometimes discussions felt unstructured",
                "I loved the instructor's teaching style. Professor Lynch was always prepared. Most classes started with a mini-lecture to briefly review major themes from the reading and our reactions from discussions. This was incredibly helpful if it had been a little while since I had done the reading or if I had been confused. Then we had discussions. Professor Lynch was great at directing the discussions to be focused and intentional, and gave us room to explore the topic but also protected us from going way too far off topic. The workload was very reasonable, and the professor even provided optional reading guides to guide our attention and help us prepare for upcoming assignments. It was one of the most thoughtful courses I have been a part of, and this was reflected in my engagement with the course.",
                "The course content and class discussions are very well-organized. Professor Lynch is amazing at facilitating engaging discussions that connect to our everyday lives. The essays were also very interesting and enjoyable to write. The only weakness is that it was difficult to keep track of all the readings, definitions, and authors throughout the semester."

                "Yes, very interesting.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. Ethical consumerism is a buzzword thrown around more and more these days, and so many people are trying to engage in it. This course helps students develop the tools to better understand the project, where its roots lie, and where it might go in the future. The assignments are structured well to help students articulate their learning and are honestly very fun. Professor Lynch is a fabulous teacher and has great leadership in the classroom, without being dominating.",
                "Yes, I highly recommend this course! This is great for anyone interested in anthropology, economics, psychology, philosophy, and ethics. There are so many elements of the class that you are bound to be interested in at least a few of the topics. Each class offers a new insight and the professor is sympathetic and engaging!"
