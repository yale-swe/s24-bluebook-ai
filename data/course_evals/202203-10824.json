                "I actually liked the redundancy between the pre-class videos and the lectures themselves; having the opportunity to see the same content taught in slightly different ways two times often made it easier to understand tricky concepts. There were some discrepancies in the style of teaching and methods taught between the different sections that could create confusion or difficulty on the problem sets, however.",
                "Strengths: very clear grading policies & assignments, good layout of course, Pablo is a great lecturer and gives very clear explanations\r\nWeaknesses: the peer tutors often do not know how to solve your psets (go directly to your prof instead)",
                "I think this course is very informative, but I don't love the fact that it is very computational. Formulas and facts are often thrown at you with little explanation. Therefore, it isn't easy to remember the concept because you don't know where it came from. Furthermore, although I appreciated having a cheat sheet during the exam, I don't feel like I learned the content of the course as well because I wasn't forced to memorise its content.",
                "It was good at teaching the content to know, but I wish there were more practice problems in addition to Ximera. Sometimes, Ximera doesn't give you the step-by-step solutions, so if you're stuck on a topic, it's hard to get more practice.",
                "some parts taught really quickly for students who had no prior experience in multi variable calculus and physics",
                "The course is organised so that you learn the content before going to class, which is both a strength and weakness depending on the student",
                "I enjoyed the speed of lecture and appreciated the example problems we did in class.",
                "One significant strength was the format of the lectures, including derivations, pictures/physical explanations, and plenty of in-class practice problems. The variety of instruction methods bolstered my understanding of the math principles. Additionally, the psets and practice exams were very representative of the exam difficulty and were immensely helpful in preparing for both midterms and the final; I also took advantage of the Ximera site for practice problems - in short, there was no shortage of practice.",
                "Strengths: pre-class videos to introduce new materials before lecture, problem sets applied what we learned, problems during class/interactive lectures\r\nWeaknesses: test difficulty did not always match difficulty of practice tests",
                "Strengths: excellent structure, a lot of resources, grading method varies to play in your favour, cheat sheet allowed on exams. Weaknesses: high weekly workload despite the exams weighing 85% of your final grade.",
                "Strengths: very thorough, lots of supplemental practice, sufficient preparation for course exams. Weaknesses: highly dependent on pre-class videos, unreasonably quick pace, frequent PSETs (sometimes 2 in a week)",
                "This course is great at building a foundational understanding of 3-D mathematics. At times, however, the course feels too intensive.",
                "I think its a very well organized course.",
                "I thought it was a very good course. I think the psets often felt more time-consuming than learning provoking. Long integrals comprised most of my time rather than actual material knowledge.",
                "Before tests problem sets would be given with only 4 days to complete them. That often was very stressful because they normally were during peak mid term times.",
                "I feel that this course was fairly good overall. I have no complaints.",
                "The tests difficulty completely unmatched the practice exams - which were very easy",

It is also very satisfying upon the course wrap-up to look back on all the formulas we have learned and see how they connect. The professors are also always there to help and provide amazing practice resources, including full review sessions for the exams.",
