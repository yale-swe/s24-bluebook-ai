   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: especially towards the latter half of the semester, assignments were more open-ended and allowed students to tailor their work to things they were most interested in. Having small, weekly one-hour \"lab\" sections with the TA's was also really helpful, especially since finding and solving issues with each program can be pretty tricky for those new to Max.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At some points, class tended to get a little dry since a lot of the time was spent just learning how to use the software.",
    "Should be two shorter lectures a week, not one lecture",
    "Konrad did a great job organizing this course and making it accessible to people with a diversity of experience working with programming languages like Max. The curriculum was well-planned and reasonably cumulative. Additionally, using the first part of the class as a seminar to bounce off ideas for the final project was a great idea as well in terms of engaging the rest of the class in applications of certain functions and the like in Max.\r\n\r\nI feel like if the class were taught less like a lecture where Konrad demonstrates module after module in succession, the class would be a lot more engaging for hands-on learners like myself. Sure, workshop time is dedicated for this end, but I feel like spreading out the content a bit more and engaging everyone in using Max would have made for a better learning environment.",
    "Sometimes the information load is overwhelming and a lot goes by very fast, but the professor is very responsive and will make time to make sure that students are comfortable.",
    "Strengths-- Konrad is super cool and fun, easy to talk to, and knows so much about audio \/ interactive art. The class content is super cool, interesting, and relevant, and it's a humanities credit!\r\nAnother huge strength is that the assignments are just so much fun to do. You really don't feel like you're doing school work. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses-- I think this is overall a great class, so don't read this as a reason not to take it:\r\nI think the 2 hour lecture style is not the best suited to learning MaxMSP. While it is a lot of fun to watch Konrad put together \/ demo Max patches, when it comes time to create our own patches, it can be hard to remember the strategies he used. This would be mitigated by the following:\r\n1) if the examples were released earlier and labelled better\r\n2) if the class met twice a week for a shorter period\r\n3) if during the Max lecture, there were a few 5 minute breaks to let people try things on their own computers. You can only really learn Max by doing, and since there are so many \"gotchas\" that eat up time to figure out, these 5 minute breaks could save a lot of time and help learning."

    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially as a lighter credit. Max is an incredibly powerful tool, especially for musicians\/artists\/anyone involved with performance art. Class sometimes got a bit dry (much of the time in class was only focused on learning how to use the software), and I do wish that there were more class discussions about the history or works of multimedia art that Max often seems to be involved in. However, Konrad is a delight to work with and the assignments can be pretty fun (and not too much work!)",
    "Yes, students will learn a cool and robust new skill!",
    "Yes, I recommend this class to anyone, especially those studying Computing and the Arts, wanting to study the intersection between technology and music, graphics, and hardware.",
    "Yes. It is a very innovative course of music exploration. As a designer, the course help me to explore and build the relationship between music and other creative fields.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The professor was very versed in the programming language and was able to realize the student's questions clearly. The professor was also very accommodating with office hours. All of these qualities created a great environment to learn Max.",
    "Yes, although if you have no background in Max, it will be difficult!",
    "Copy pasting from strengths and weaknesses:\r\n\r\nYes, I recommend it. Konrad is super cool and fun, easy to talk to, and knows so much about audio \/ interactive art. The class content is super cool, interesting, and relevant, and it's a humanities credit!\r\nAnother huge strength is that the assignments are just so much fun to do. You really don't feel like you're doing school work. \r\n\r\nI will add, though, that some of the lectures can just be a little long. Max is like the coolest language ever, but it's hard to remember so much after a 2 hour lecture."
