                "strengths: covered interesting topics\r\nweakness: lots of work that often felt unnecessary or nothing could be gained from it",
                "Liang Laoshi structured the class very well, with engaging class activities and a great choose-your-own-adventure approach to learning vocabulary. The pacing for the class was a little bit uneven, however, and I wish there was a little more focus on modern issues rather than the heavy focus on traditional culture and history this semester.",
                "Strengths: you get a lot of practice with Chinese -- reading, writing, listening, etc.",
                "There is simply too much work for this class to be a reasonable one-credit course compared to other classes. This is not necessarily a weakness of this class but rather an issue with foreign language classes in general, but the workload should regardless be cut down (or the number of credits offered raised to match the appropriate time commitment)."

                "I would!! I think it's an incredible L5 course, particularly for students working to improve their everyday Chinese and cultural understanding of China.",
                "Yes! It's a great course to improve all aspects of your Chinese skills while engaging with real-life materials. There's a lot of flexibility to choose where you want to go with the course, and a lot of support along the way. Definitely one of the best, if not the best Chinese elective you can take.",
                "Yes! It's a great Chinese class. There is a fair bit of work, but it's not difficult, mainly just time consuming -- I think this is to be expected in language classes because you need to practice to learn it.",
                "Yes, this class is an amazing and fun way to fulfill the language requirement (if you're a heritage speaker like me who wants to focus on my other studies) as well as a rich, meaningful experience in the complex interchanges of Chinese and Western cultures (if you are someone actually studying the Chinese language). This class felt so much more valuable than practicing set situations and conversations, as the topics and discussions we delved into in this class often diverged heavily from the expected lesson, and I found myself being pushed constantly to pull words that I didn't even know I remembered from my primary school days in China. No doubt, this course requires you to have a strong foundation in Chinese and challenges you to apply it to social, historical, and philosophical contexts, but if you feel confident in your abilities (or can put in the work to compensate), this class is in my (limited) opinion one of the best that Yale Chinese has to offer.",
                "Yes, Professor Liang is really receptive to student feedback and works hard to make sure everyone enjoys and understands the material.",
                "This class is a great concept! Learning chinese through watching movies means you get a good sense of Chinese culture that can be hard to convey through textbooks. Additionally, it's typing only, which makes learning new vocab and writing much more manageable. However, be aware that this class is going to be a lot of work. Expect a few hours of homework after each class, which can be difficult during the Tuesday to Thursday stretch. Also, on weekends when you're watching movies, you'll likely have to spend around 4-5 hours on homework since there are questions you need to answer while watching the movie, vocab tables you need to fill out, and writeups you have to complete after."
