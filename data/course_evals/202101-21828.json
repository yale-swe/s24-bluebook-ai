I found it quite cool to learn about the intricacies of medicine and public health that Dr. Christakis was familiar with.

            "comments": [
                "Strength - loved the engagement, his class was so interesting and there were many things that I learned about, he enjoyed student input and was well versed in technology compared to other professors\r\nWeakness - the way he talked about race felt very problematic, many assumptions being made that black = poor, hispanic = uneducated, did not like the vibe that gave off, hated the readings, very uninteresting when the whole concept could be explained in a minute without reading the article",
                "Professor Christakis was a very engaging lecturer. One weakness is that the readings sometimes don't align too closely with what is discussed in class\/it is hard to know how carefully to read them",
                "Strengths: Fair exams, incredible lectures. God, I wish I could take this class in person. Prof Christakis was riveting every week and kept even material that I thought would be dry riveting (e.g. I was thinking about social networks for weeks after the lectures on them). I also kinda liked how he bullied people to keep cameras on lol. It was so depressing staring at a screen of random names in other classes. Also not particularly hard, despite the fact that its def not a gut. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Pacing of readings could be a bit better - some days it was basically nothing, other days we were supposed to read like half a book (i.e. the book never ended up being read). Not a gut, if that's what you're looking for. Would've preferred traditional final to take-home.",
                "This is a great course. After four years at Yale I can definitely say this is one of the better courses I have taken, as it really changed my perspective on public health. If anything, I'd say the sections could be better structured to be more consistent, and some of the later lectures felt a little disconnected\/less relevant. Still an amazing course that is thoughtfully organized and impactful.",
                "teacher mean",
                "I thought that the content of the course was interesting, but many of the readings were outdated. Professor Christakis also had strong opinions and would sometimes become very defensive when questioned by students.",
                "I found no weaknesses in this course, rather I can only speak to its strengths. The lectures were extremely engaging and allowed for students to both learn and reflect on previous knowledge of the medical system to fully absorb the material being taught. That is just one example of the many strengths this course had.",
                "It was a very good course with powerpoint slides, a great professor, and helpful TAs.",
                "Strength: Very passionate professor, especially Dr. Christakis's lectures were fantastic. It would have been even better if the lectures were in person. The head TA (Maggie) is nice and approachable.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The review sessions for the 2 midterms are not so helpful. TAs did not prepare any guiding questions, and the sessions were basically students asking random questions that are tangentially related to the class. The final exam (which was two 6 page papers) were a bit overwhelming. Especially if you have other final exams or papers due during the reading week, it is stressful. Not only the final exam required synthesis of a lot of materials covered throughout the semester (which is reasonable) the prompts required a bit of creativity and analytical skills.",
                "Strengths: the readings and lectures were very interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the content we covered was very heavy and sometimes would be talked about in class without proper warning. Such warning could help Yale students feel more welcome and more engaged. Though the readings were very interesting, there were a lot. I think shortening the list to key papers in each of the categories would aid in the workload.",
                "Strengths: incredible course contents - super relevant with COVID, but beyond that just as a citizen. Professor Christakis knows so much and it was awesome to hear about just a little of the cool ideas in sociology\/public health. Weaknesses: more engaging lectures\/opportunity to interact with other classmates. While the lecture was really interesting, it was hard to sit and just listen for 75 minutes. Maybe a little break in the middle of the lecture or a \"turn and talk\" breakout room type thing to at least meet others in the class would've been nice.",
                "Strength: Professor is more than qualified for teaching the course. Great lecturer, and you can tell he's passionate and knowledgeable about what he's doing",
                "Grading was very arbitrary for the midterms. Lectures were generally pretty interesting and I learned a good deal from them, but I wish section was more interactive\/interesting since we never really got into the heart of the critical readings for the class.",
                "Prof. Christakis is not very engaged with the class outside of lecture, and did not have open office hours. Some of the teaching assistant staff did not know much about the class or material and therefore section was not very beneficial. Grading was highly subjective and clear feedback was not given.",
                "The professor is a strong teacher or lecturer and reinforces concepts in the reading well. The course material is complex and interconnected yet easy to digest, due to the way the professor lays out each lecture. Professor is very reasonable and curious, making for a hospitable learning environment. There were not any highly apparent weaknesses with the course. The course could be improved by adding more assignments to gauge student understanding prior to exams, since the only method of evaluation of course material comes from these exams, which may be a hit or miss.",
                "Strengths: Professor Christakis's lectures are well organized and filled with interesting material; almost never did I feel bored by what we were learning. The reading list was equally as interesting. The strengths of this course lie mainly with the course material and the professor's lecturing ability.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While I understood the good intentions of the new midterm format (read a news article and respond to questions while drawing upon course material), for some questions I found the format confusing. Some questions, in my view, were formulated to cover course topics but did not directly relate to the news article (i.e. the connection between the course material and main ideas in the article seemed forced). Thus, I found myself guessing \"what did the teaching staff mean when they asked this question\/on what topic are they trying to test us\" during the test instead of directly engaging with the course material and article.",
                "Readings and lecture were great and overall a very interesting course! Lots of topics covered in each class and many research studies referenced that helps enforce what we are learning! Very thorough and thought-provoking lectures.",
                "I thought the lectures were well organized and cohesive, but more connections between the lectures could have been made.",
                "The class content is fascinating, and professor Christakis's teaching is clear and engaging.\r\nThe reading assignment workload was very heavy.",
                "I think Professor Christakis did a wonderful job in creating this course.  The readings were very interesting and Professor Christakis's energy and interest in the topic shined brightly even through the zoom screen.  Even the tests helped in furthering my understanding of the materials we were engaging with.",
                "The course content would be relatively ok if it was taught by anyone else but Christakis. The professor was arrogant, self-centered, and insensitive. He caused a friend in the class to be triggered so badly she had to receive mental health services and drop the class. On top of that, he was incredibly rigid and not understanding or empathizing at all with students' realities of life this semester. Bottom line: this course needs a new teacher.",
                "Strengths: Maggie, the head TF and Dr. Christakis. Both were absolutely wonderful and so insightful. The class is very interesting because Christakis tied together so many different fields  all within his expertise. I really loved all the interesting examples, and learned a ton! Great great class to learn about healthcare and public health.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Section. This was one of those classic courses where section was not a party at all. This is not necessarily a reason not to take this class  section is just once a week and we did get the opportunity to discuss things, but UGHGH so boring and so silent. Another weakness is that a lot of the examples are from the 2000s and early 2010s. It would be lovely to refresh some of those examples.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting material, I like Prof Christakis' lecture style, thought the course was well designed, very fair exams\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings are very outdated, final was extremely long",
                "Strengths: lectures were very interesting\r\nWeaknesses: sections didnt add much to course",
                "I thought the class was very interesting and interactive",
                "strengths: very engaging and interesting class\r\nweakness: discussion sections were sometime unproductive",
                "Even though the research was very thorough I wish there was more recent studies added to the class to see how the concepts look like today.",
                "weakness - midterms only covered a small portion of the semesters work, rather than the broad scope of topics we learned",
                "This class is wonderfully designed and lectured. The only weakness I would say would be that the expectations for essays could be slightly more explicit.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- engaging lecture\r\n- well-organized syllabus and Canvas page\r\n- options for the final\r\n- fair workload\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- could have thrown a weekly discussion post or something in the grade breakdown to take some emphasis off of exams\r\n- occasional lack of sensitivity\/cultural awareness",
                "I enjoyed the course, but did not appreciate the level of data\/statistics involved. With a course like health of the public, I think there should have been a greater emphasis on qualtitative studies.",
                "Excellent and appropriate readings, also superb lectures. Better exam feedback would be helpful.",
                "The course was very well taught, and is a great class to take, especially when pre-med. However there was limited to no feedback after exams, and it quickly became clear that the standard exam style would not work given the switch to open-note exams. This then made the exams harder than I believe they otherwise would have been had it been a regular semester, and I felt like I was getting lower grades than I deserved\/earned in order to create a more significant grade distribution. At the very least, providing more feedback would help improve this, but I also think this issue could go away with the return to the normal exam style."

                "I'm not sure what was done differently in this course during the pandemic compared to an in-person semester. If the final exam was not previously a take-home exam, that was a very helpful change that helped to actually learn the information rather than cram among other exams. I mentioned previously that the addition of a low-stakes assignment (like a weekly discussion board post or some other small assignment) could have taken some of the weight off the exams and been more accessible for students facing anxiety\/extenuating circumstances during the pandemic.",
                "The course was virtually engaging.",
                "The switch to open-note exams, while usually beneficial to students, felt detrimental to me. I studied using all the previous exams, and this worked for the first exam, which was most similar to the style of past exams. But after the first midterm, it became apparent that allowing exams to be open-note also warranted a change in the kind of question being asked. Between this and not getting much feedback on exams, I felt like the course actually became harder than it would have been during a normal semester, and I would have preferred exams that were more similar to those of the past and closed-notes, rather than the second midterm we had where the questions became harder. I was left feeling like I understood the material very well, and I studied a lot, but because of the new exam style, this was not being reflected in my grade, which was incredibly frustrating."

                "No, I would never recommend this course to another student. The course readings are okay, but Christakis' lectures do not do much to add upon the readings, rather he usually just goes over them.\r\n\r\nChristakis himself is also unapproachable and not open to new ideas. He is extremely stuck in his own opinions. In a course that is meant to evaluate and discuss the impact of the role of structures like race and gender on public health, it is disappointing that Christakis fails to realize that as a white male he might have privileges and biases that he simply does not bother to question. \r\n\r\nThis course has also much more busywork than it is worth, with two six-page papers as the final exam, which are assigned and released only a week before they are due. Some of the readings throughout the semester are interesting, but it is a lot of scientific studies that are difficult to comb through. This work might be worth it if the course was more well taught, but unfortunately this is not the case.",
                "Yes - engagement was high, interesting things I learned, workload was not terrible, only had papers to do which were midterms and finals \r\nPretty great of a class to take",
                "Yes, if you want to learn about US health trends",
                "If you're premed, take this class. If you're doing anything tangential to medicine, take this class. If you're looking for an interesting 5th credit that's not a gut, but not super challenging either, take this class. You will learn a ton - I certainly did. The lectures will keep you thoroughly engaged.",
                "Yes, I definitely would. It's a great class. It's not terribly challenging or demanding workload-wise, so you can actually focus on enjoying what you're learning. The class also has applications to lots of different fields - you don't need to be interested in studying public health to benefit from it.",
                "Yes! This course is extremely interesting and engaging and can allow anyone to learn about the previous\/current health system that affects the United States today. This course is not geared towards a specific major, and I strongly suggest anyone and everyone to take this course.",
                "Yes! It is a great intro course and really made me want to take more public health courses.",
                "Yes! I think this class is approachable for any major, and the course teach you content that anyone should be knowledgeable if they live in US. Especially with Covid pandemic, the class content was super relevant!",
                "I would recommend this course for people interested in gaining an understanding and appreciation for public health. The readings are interesting and you learn to think differently.",
                "Yes! Fantastic intro to public health\/sociology, especially with Prof. Christakis.",
                "Yes! This is one of those classes that you only get at Yale. Compared with all my monotonous science requirements for pre-med, this class was a breath of fresh air. It was interesting and really insightful, especially if you're going into a medical career.",
                "Would recommend it senior year, or as a credit\/d. I thought a lot of the material was biased though and not as scientific as it seemed. Sometimes it felt like prof. Christakis was asserting his own opinion and claiming it as fact, like about how healthcare doesnt change health outcomes.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The course material is extremely interesting, the class is fascinating, and the professor is engaging. There is a reasonable workload, and any student who reads the material and pays attention in class can expect to do well in the class.",
                "Yes. If you want to be a more informed citizen, you ought to take this course. Public health and healthcare are important topics in society and politics, and it would be a great addition to one's undergraduate career at Yale to critically examine these topics.",
                "Yes! Super interesting and thought-provoking material, especially for any pre-meds or people with a public health interest!",
                "Yes, its very interesting.",
                "Yes Professor Christakis and the other TFs are very passionate about what they teach and you'll learn to appreciate public health from new perspectives.",
                "Yes!  For the first time, I feel my eyes were opened to a lot of the underlying factors which affect health.  I think everyone should take this class as it provides an eye-opening glance at U.S. public health.  The mix of sociology and public health was extremely interesting.  The readings were also very interesting and Professor Christakis' interest in the subject is palpable in every class making for interesting lectures.",
                "Not unless it was taught by another teacher.",
                "Yes, for sure! Christakis is a fantastic professor who has an absolute wealth of knowledge. His perspective is unique because of his previous work. The course is very interesting, so are the readings, although I never really had time to read them... The stories and slides were so compelling and I learned a ton. I would recommend this to anyone interested in health, healthy policy, medicine, future-doctors (although I am not one), or just anyone who wants a not-too-hard interesting class.",
                "Yes, it was super interesting!",
                "Yes, if interested in public health its a must take",
                "Yes! Very interesting to learn about Public health",
                "Yes, it's a very interesting class especially if you are interested in medicine or the healthcare system",
                "yes",
                "No, I would not recommend this course. It was, by far, the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. And the reason for this is 100% the professor. He made every class a living hell. The hours felt like months, and it felt like he personally attacked every student he called on. To make matters worse, as if that was even possible, he wrapped up by advocating for eugenics. Maybe he should reflect inwardly about his place on this planet, and take himself off campus. Or take a year off- to reflect and come back with better work habits. Last point: I hate you, Chirstakis.",
                "Absolutely not. This was not the sociology class I was anticipating it to be. Some of the arguments that the professor made were very biased in his opinions.  If anyone bothered to look up the sources of his information on the slides, especially those to convince us that medical advancements have not really improved our health, some of those graphs were from sketchy sources (or were just so pooy cited). Maybe it'll help with the MCAT, but is rather just study for it.",
                "Highly, highly recommend this course. Christakis is so smart and nuanced in his thinking  really important course to take for perspective and with an open mind. Whole new way of viewing health now.",
                "There is an ungodly number of readings assigned for this class but the material is fascinating.",
                "Definitely! Dr. Christakis is an excellent lecturer who presents his students with fresh perspectives on health and social issues.",
                "I think there are other courses related to public health that would be just as good if not better, but if a student were interested in this class I'd tell them to take it.",
                "I did not enjoy the professor, so I would not recommend this course. The work is interesting though.",
                "Yes a fascinating course on something that we all deal with, health. Great professor.",
                "Overall, yes, I would. Christakis is an amazing lecturer, and the material is very useful to pre-meds. However, I do have some issues with the course, although I think these will probably go away with the return to normal classes and exams. The switch to open-note exams, while usually beneficial to students, felt detrimental to me. I studied using all the previous exams, and this worked for the first exam, which was most similar to the style of past exams. But after the first midterm, it became apparent that allowing exams to be open-note also warranted a change in the kind of question being asked. Between this and not getting much feedback on exams, I felt like the course actually became harder than it would have been during a normal semester, and I would have preferred exams that were more similar to those of the past and closed-notes, rather than the second midterm we had where the questions became harder. I was left feeling like I understood the material very well, and I studied a lot, but because of the new exam style, I was getting lower grades than I deserved\/earned in order to create a more significant grade distribution; my studying and understanding did not feel like it was not being reflected in my grade, which was incredibly frustrating. At the very least, providing more feedback would help improve this, but, as previously mentioned, I also think this issue could go away with the return to the normal exam style.",
                "I feel like most of the material we covered was fairly obvious, but maybe that's just a consequence of living through a major public health event. With that being said, it was nice to go through the material structured manner, and I found the course's emphasis on guiding concepts such as structure vs. agency helpful in framing what we learned. Take this class if you want to read some interesting papers and learn about public health in a classroom setting, but don't expect to have your mind blown every lecture."
