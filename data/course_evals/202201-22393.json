                "I learned a lot about conjugations and vocabulary for different scenarios.",

                "There were a lot of different types of media content that we could learn from, whether that be books, movies, poems, or art. I think this allowed students to engage with Spanish in their own unique ways. I think the course could be improved by having more one-on-one engagement with other students.",
                "More clear expectations of what assignments are practice vs what should be handed in.",
                "One weakness of this course was I felt it could be disorganized at times. I think it could be improved by making due dates clearer and always ensuring the due date on Canvas is correct.",
                "The supersite homework could have been spread out more. We finished all the homework activities for the semester a little after halfway through.",
                "Strengths: let's you learn another language\r\nWeaknesses: is graded, syllabus was a little unclear at times",
                "Strengths: The texts we analysed all had a social message and important relevance to Latin American history. The experiential learning assignments and reflections also all really helped with writing and immersion practice. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that some of the activities were very repetitive - we did about 3 role plays after Spring Break which I feel could have had more variety instead. I'm not sure of the value of these in practising oral skills given student  practice a lot at home.",
                "My Spanish greatly improved throughout the course of the semester thanks to the structure of this class - rather than focusing entirely on vocabulary and grammar, we learned the language through short stories, short films, movies, and other works of art from Spanish-speaking countries. We were given ample opportunities to engage during class time and practice our speaking. Expectations and assignments were unclear in the class, especially towards the end of the semester. Things deviated from the syllabus and communication was disorganized because it was a mix of hard copy assignments and assignments listed on Canvas. Many in the class were confused about what the assigned homework was each night."

The content of the class keeps it  engaging, and I was excited to be able to talk about complex topics and themes while practicing my Spanish. The course load is reasonable, and I never felt swamped with work; however, at times, the day-to-day tasks were unclear and I wasn't sure what the work was. By communicating with my peers and classmates, I was able to manage this perfectly fine, but I do think this was the only confusing  part of the class, as it sometimes felt unstructured.",
