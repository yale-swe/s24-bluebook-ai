                "I developed a novel means of thinking about culture and evolution",

                "I learned quite a few things in this course.  Starting with the topic of Darwin, this course extended into vast theories and evidence for human evolution, specifically with communication and how that evolved into the formation of a unique human culture that sets us apart from other organisms.",

                "I thought the reading materials were very varied and interesting, each building upon the other. As someone who has not had a lot of exposure to the sciences, this course was fantastic in being able to engage students in a wide variety of disciplines. However, sometimes I found myself struggling to put some of the various concepts together. Professor Tomlinson did a fantastic job of explaining ideas in class and in his book however, sometimes I wished there were some more materials/outlines that I could turn to in order to remind myself of certain concepts and how they flowed from one another.",
                "I really liked this class for its content and the character of the professor. I was feeling like I wanted to get my hands on things more, though. It felt sort of one-sided or uni-directional flow of content. I wanted to play around with the ideas more ourselves there were good and consistent readings, but no  learning styles engaged besides listening to in-class lecture/discussion and writing papers. I appreciated very much that the expectations were clear and simple: write three papers. But considering how much I liked the content I wondered why we wouldn't do some kind of group-project (even just have conversations with each other), go to the Peabody museum up the street, pick a topic and tell each other about it, do a paper-swap even. It's kind of shocking that I'm saying this because sometimes those assignments are such a drag. But somehow I actually missed them. Really I think: the class should meet twice a week (or have a section) and the first day should be as-is, while the second day should be quite a lot more interactive, or just plain active.",
                "it is interesting at the beginning but gets boring towards the end and the material is hard to work through for papers",
                "This course should be a lecture course. I also think that it would be helpful if we had guiding questions for the readings each week as they were really difficult to follow. Dr. Tomlinson is a super engaged, energetic, and thoughtful professor. He is really passionate about the subject matter, but I often felt lost and a bit overwhelmed in the class because Evo Bio is not my strong suit (I'm a humanities major).",
                "The readings and discussions were generally interesting, though I didn't feel like I had a clear understanding of how the topics related to each other/progressed from week to week.",
                "I appreciated the structure of the course.  Basing the class in Darwin helped me immensely, as someone that thinks very black and white.  I did find myself getting confused by the jargon and theories towards the end of the course, so my only suggestion would be to carefully explain those terms to someone that might be inexperienced in the field.",
                "Professor Tomlinson is a really funny professor and I really enjoyed his commentary on all the articles we read. I thought the class really helped me critique scientific writing and overgeneralizations in archaeology. I do think the pace of the class was both pretty slow and pretty fast which was weird? But I liked what we learned about!",
                "While some individual readings were quite interesting, such as Professor Tomlinson's book and Darwin's, the arch of the course was never clear to me. Some of the readings seemed to be so specific in scope that they lost the bigger picture of the seminar."

If you are a humanities major looking for a science credit but are not at all interested in the topic no!!! its hard! the readings are hard the assignments are hard (even though they're short) and you will be very bored in class if you did not do the readings and dont actually care about the topic. oh also its basically a lecture disguised as a seminar",
                "I would recommend this if you genuinely enjoy the subject matter. I took it as a science gut credit and it was a lot harder than expected. the readings are difficult to understand and really frustrating. the essays are super easy though and he grades them really easily. expect long classes where dr. t rambles for a while, but is really engaged in the subject matter. he also cold calls a lot so be ready for that",
                "Yes, Professor Tomlinson is extremely engaging and I loved all the readings",
                "Yes, especially if you are looking for a science credit. The workload is very manageable and the readings and discussions are interesting.",
                "I'd recommend this course to anyone interested in the origination of human behavior and what makes us unique.  While difficult, I'd recommend it to people that aren't well-versed in the subject like I was.  This course really brought me out of my comfort zone and I enjoyed the challenge.",
                "I would recommend it to people who want a science credit definitely. It's a good balance of humanities and science so it felt approachable and Professor Tomlinson does a good job breaking down all of our readings in a lot of detail."
