                "The strength of this class was that it set ambitious goals to cover a lot of material that is very interesting. I wish more attention were given to the second half of this material, because half of the class had already learned the first half of the material in math 305. Everything before product measures was mostly review although math 305 does not teach it in as much generality. I struggled to follow everything in the second half of the course so I wish that the whole entire course focused on the material covered in the second half. I guess the difficulty is that this class is also meant for graduate students as an introduction to measure theory, but this creates some redundancy for undergrads who are well prepared by Minsky's great teaching of 305.",
                "lectures are crystal clear, well orgnized",
                "The course falls in a weird spot between 305 and 325. In 305 with Minsky we had done around 2\/5ths of the material covered in 320. Lectures were very dry and the textbook was even dryer.",
                "Strength: Prof Wang is great at teaching. Her proofs are always clear and direct, and she always carefully explains any questions raised by students in class.\r\nWeakness: Every time the grader just selects and grades part of the assignment. I know it has to do with a shortage of graders, but I hope we can get feedback on every homework questions.",
                "Most lectures were usually just proving 4-5 new theorems or results without a pause, which was sometimes hard to keep up with. Luckily, though, you didnt really have to remember these proofs. The professor was also really open to questions and would explain anything confusingit was just quite fast if you wanted to keep up with every line.\r\n\r\nThe homework was challenging at times but manageable, and tests had some difficult problems, but the grading was really fair.",
                "I think it is good overall, but one potential area of improvement is the originality of the content. Maybe I would like to see more insights than just the textbook definitions in lectures.",
                "The lectures felt a bit imbalanced. Some had little material and others much more.",
                "Strengths: Professor Wang's teaching style is clear and concise and the homeworks are helpful for understanding the material but aren't too much work. Weakness: measure theory just isn't that interesting.",
                "One of the best mathematics courses I have ever taken. The problem sets were really interesting and really promoted a deeper understanding of the material; quite honestly the problem sets were really enjoyable. Exams were really tough, maybe that was just me."

I liked Professor Wang and the the workload isn't bad at all, but overall the course content just wasn't interesting enough for me to enthusiastically recommend this course.",
