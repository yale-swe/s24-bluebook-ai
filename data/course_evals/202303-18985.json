I have come to learn and observe the tactics that social movements utilize and why in particular nonviolent movements are successful.",
                "This is definitely an interesting class when it comes to learning tactics for social movements. I learned some useful information when it comes to mobilizing people, which feels particularly important now with the Palestinian genocide happening.",
                "I learned a lot from this class. It taught me how to write persuasive yet concise papers. Additionally, I learned how social movements emerge, sustain themselves, and the legacies they leave behind. Understanding this process has provided me with a deeper insight into the complexities of societal change and historical impact, broadening my perspective of the world around me.",
                "You will learn more about the theoretical structures of social movements rather than the ethnographic people-centered aspect of a social movement. There are a lot of readings.",
                "I learned about the theory behind social movements, as well as examples of social movements across the world. I took this class for writing, and doing our papers helped me to become a more thoughtful writer and deepen my analysis skills.",
                "This course deepened my understanding of collective action problems and the ways in which people can use various tools in order to achieve their goals. My essay writing and argumentative skills were developed.",
                "I learned basic political science concepts as well as about social movements. I gained lots of new information and knowledge.",
                "This course helped me improve my skills when reading academic texts and journals. Additionally, I'm walking away with a good amount of the course material that will stick with me not just in the context of learning it because I am a student, but knowing it as a citizen and activist."

                "The workload was difficult to manage. The class time did not make use of efficient time.",
                "For WR students, the workload was a lot, and it made the class very stressful. The lectures were also high content and went by very quickly.",
                "This course could be improved through fewer, more intentional assignments. Having two readings responses, two exams, and two significant papers was a lot to manage on top of 100-300 pages of reading a week. I think the reading responses were great, as they made me engage with the texts more thorough and learn to critique the existing literature, and I believe the papers to be the most foundational component of the class, but I feel that the exams were more memorization-based. I did not take anything of great utility away from the exams, and I feel the course would benefit if one or both of them were removed.",
                "The strengths of the course is the engaging course material that fosters intellectually enriching discussions both in lecture and discussion sections. The weakness would be the use of both a final exam and a final project.",
                "Strengths: the lectures and slides were very structured, making it easier to study for exams. Prof Wood is great and truly exceptional in her field. Weakness: Perhaps a bit high on workload, but I did mention this to prof Wood and I believe the workload might change for next year. Regardless of the workload, a very interesting and useful class that I would recommend!",
                "I think this course is well-designed and the TFs are great. However, I wish lectures were more engaging. It was easy to lose focus, especially since the class was on the later side (between 4:30 and 5:20 p.m.). I also wish the location of the class was closer to campus. Lastly, I think the workload was heavy. I think a sit-down final in addition to a final project worth 30% of the grade is overkill.",
                "Strengths: The guest/TF lectures are a change in pace, the group activities (making a mural)\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of readings assigned, the timing of the class being late, having a final project/essay/2 major essays and two in-class exams feels like overwhelming, the readings are not well incorporated in lecture (making them more so busy work).",
                "One strength of this course is that the first half is more traditional (where we learn about theories, etc.) and the second half features mostly guest speakers who themselves are usually involved in social movements. My section for this class was also very small, and I enjoyed the opportunities to build connections with my peers and TA while having engaging discussions.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course is that there may be lots of reading assigned for a certain week. I also didn't like how drafts of my papers / final papers were due days before or after exams for this class. This was stressful as I had to split my time between studying and writing my papers.",
                "The course is very engaging and interesting. The professor and TF were also very enthusiastic which helped.",
                "One strength of this course was its relevancy. Much of what we learned was very timely, or could be applied to current events. An aspect of the course that I struggled with was that our lectures didn't overlap much with our readings, which made it harder to learn course concepts.",
                "Strengths: Many of the assignments, such as the reading responses and the non-WR final project, allowed students to engage on a much deeper level with course concepts. The lectures were very interactive, and there were plenty of opportunities for student participation.  \r\nWeaknesses: The workload was rather high, especially towards the end of the semester. I also felt that the readings were a bit dry and difficult to keep up with."

This course does have a high workload, thus, I took it to fulfill a writing requirement and a major requirement. If you are not doing this class for a writing/major credit and you are just taking it for fun, there may be other classes with a lower-workload. But, if you choose to take this class, you do learn alot.",
