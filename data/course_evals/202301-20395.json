                "Professor Kim is an amazing professor.",
                "I wish the lectures better aligned with the readings. I felt like there was a big disconnect from class and the hw. I definitely learned a lot but it didnt feel organized.",
                "Strength: great professor, a wide range of materials, and small group discussions\r\nWeaknesses: some of the course materials could be improved (e.g. the videos on reincarnation were poor quality and did not add much insight) and lacked sufficient structure in some areas (e.g. not much guidance on student presentations, so the presentations sometimes ended up being very long or unrelated to the course)",
                "Strengths: great reading and video materials in the syllabus, professor is wonderful, small-group discussion based\r\nweaknesses: speakers were so fun and interesting -- I wish we had maybe 1-2 more of them!",
                "A strength of this course was the overall lesson plan structure. It was nice to know what to expect for each week. I think I would have enjoyed doing the readings summaries before group discussion so that people who didn't get around to reading that week could still participate in the group discussions.",
                "Strengths: I enjoyed the structure of the class. I appreciated how we began each class with a mini lecture led by Professor Kim, followed by a student-led discussion based on the weekly readings. \r\n\r\nNo notable weaknesses.",
                "The large person seminar wjth a combination of lecture and discussion section worked great, especially for the almost 2 hour time period. The break midway was helpful. My favorite part about the class was the mix of upper and lower class-men which created very interesting and complex conversations.",
                "Professor Kims enthusiasm and care for this class is the greatest strength. He genuinely cared about what we could take from the course for life. He always made an effort to invite speakers and converse with us.",
                "A great overview of Buddhism that takes into account many views and takes on past and present day Buddhism",
                "I think if there were less reading I would have done more-just felt impossible to read a book in a read so didnt try very hard",
                "This class should not have had 50 people in it. I went into the class so excited but I was pretty disappointed when I found out I'd be listening to undergrads talk for like 20 minutes every class about their experience with psychedelics or mindfulness. I think this class had a lot of potential (and actually did actualize its potential in previous years, according to the course reviews) but the class was way too big.",
                "This course was fascinating and a breath of fresh air from other courses. The professor and the positive attitude of the students is a strength. That amount of reason, however, is infeasible.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kim is amazing. Diversity of topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "Strength: Professor Kim is so kind",
                "Readings were very interesting and the guest speaker lectures were also fascinating.",
                "Group discussion was very engaging.",
                "This course was so amazing. I loved the discussion-based aspect of the class, all of the readings were very thoughtfully chosen, and Professor Kim did such an amazing job keeping everyone engaged and making everyone feel welcome. There is not one thing I would change about this course.",
                "The leminar format allowed many more people to benefit from the class than a traditional seminar would have, but as a result discussions didnt progress as smoothly. My favorite parts of the class were the lecture components.",
                "strengths are Hwansoo, could be improved through organization",
                "I thought this course was wonderfully structured. The seminars were engaging and thought-provoking, and the readings were very intriguing.",
                "The lectures could be a bit more logically organized with key takeaways and points and more connections explicitly made about how the content relates to the overall religion and where it fits in. I really liked the readings though!",
                "None",
                "Strengths: Hwansoo is an amazing Professor. He really cares about all of his students and is very knowledgable about Buddhism. The weekly topics were really interesting and made me reflect on my own beliefs. Weaknesses: Sometimes the topics felt repetitive. I felt like we were reading similar readings over and over again. I would have like to explore certain topics in greater depth.",
                "I loved this course! I really like how it incorporated both lectures, discussions, and speakers. No improvements necessary!",
                "I very much enjoyed the course readings and class discussions. Hearing different perspectives and personal experiences of my peers was a joy."

                "Nice class. At times could feel too theoretical and I didnt know how it applied to my life, but most of the content was really relevant. I was going through a rough week because of something else while I was writing my final paper, and my topic allowed me to see my own clinging and attachment in the situation and actually made me feel better.\r\n\r\nReally loved the guest speakers (Sumi and the psychedelic guest lecture)",
