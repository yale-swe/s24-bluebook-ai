This class helped me to practice planning a long-term project that involves iterative thinking. It gave me practice in editing my own work and in giving quality feedback to my peers. It helped connect me to the AMST department and to my fellow AMST majors, which are beautiful connections to have.",

                "The course is designed for students writing a year-long thesis. AMST majors who chose to do a senior project must adapt to the course structure. In future years, there should be a separate syllabus for those doing a senior project. Sometimes the assignments in the second semester felt unhelpful for those who only wrote 20 pages.",
                "I felt like I really formed a community amongst the other seniors in the major, which was an amazing experience! This class became a really encouraging space to share ideas about our theses and update others on our progress.",
                "It was super helpful to have a place to check in with classmates and be held accountable. The annotated bibliography exercise was very helpful. The course is very focused on people doing 60-page essays and could be altered to better fit people doing creative projects.",
                "The strengths were the community of classmates sharing our projects and struggles, and Kelsey as our advisor. Weakness-wise, I think it's difficult to make one course for such a large variety of essays and projects.",

                "I appreciated having the whole year to work on my thesis. Even though I didn't use most of that time very well, it was a valuable experience to go through that iterative process of thinking about the same topic over and over again, finding new sources for an old topic, planning out the long-term project, and having peers to support each other along the way. Of course, there was a rush to finish at the end of the process, but it took some of the pressure off to have the whole year. So yes, I'd recommend this class if you're looking to have a flexible and personalized thesis experience.",
                "If you are writing a year-long thesis or doing a senior project in AMST, take this course! Kelsey was incredibly helpful and provided so much individual feedback. It was really nice having a supportive group of seniors to talk through writing challenges and general feelings about senior year.",
                "Yes, you have to take it for the yearlong major, but I would definitely recommend. It helped a lot and made the process much more enjoyable and feasible.",
                "If you need guidance and supervision for your thesis, I highly recommend this class. The community of other seniors and the extra support overall are really helpful.",
                "Yes. Better than the semester thesis. You really get to build a community and become proud of your work."
