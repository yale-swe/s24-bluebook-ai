                "Strengths: super cool readings and screenings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: prof is infuriatingly ignorant",
                "strengths: great class discussions \r\nweaknesses: curricular readings",
                "Strengths: materials in the syllabus are all pretty great and introduced me to some cool new stuff. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n\r\n(1) Professor Deming's technique for guiding class discussion did not leave room for the conversation to organically follow the insights of the students, and he would often derail a promising conversation topic with some other point he wanted us to reach, but in doing so, neutered the discussion. It led to conversations that went in circles and we spent several days mostly hearing from the professor and not each other. This also led to an unfortunate situation where only students who felt compelled to and able to connect with what the professor was saying exactly to speak up and many more students stayed quiet because they felt that their insights were not necessarily what he wanted to hear, which was made clear when he would utterly dismiss students who did try to engage with his new point. The professor should take a step back in the conversation and really only jump in if he wants to ask a follow-up question. \r\n\r\n(2) The syllabi content is highly variable on a week-to-week basis. One week you may only have to watch a single 2 hour-long movie. Then another week you are expected to read an entire novel (300+ pages) of emotionally exhausting and potentially triggering content. More thought should be put into the organization of the syllabus; if the material itself cannot be compromised, the professor should consider recommending excerpts of pieces for the students to read and engage with before the class (perhaps students could be told to read Parts II and III of a novel which is closer to a standard weekly number of pages for assigned readings). \r\n\r\n(3) The professor's random selection of students to present on syllabus material is really a bad idea and created stress. Students had to reach out to him individually if they really had to change their presentation schedule, but it was given to us in a very non-negotiable way. Majority opinions I heard were that some students had pieces they wish they could have presented on, or at the very least, could have presented during a different week when they had less work going on. This was also disruptive when 3 or 4 weeks into the semester, the professor changed the syllabus order and content, disrupting students' expectations of their presenting schedule and materials. The professor should just let students sign up for their own weeks and time slots.\r\n\r\n (4) Conversations about subjects such as racism and sexual assault are not given the gravitas that they deserve nor the intellectual challenge they deserve. I can't offer a concrete suggestion for this but for this class in the future to not draw such a harsh line between \"horror\" and \"social allusion\" and to consider more seriously the social impact these materials have on their audiences and society as a whole. It seemed like conversations on these topics---when led by the professor---MORE often than NOT, tried to un-politicize them/be apolitical , which seems terribly ignorant AND ill-informed for a class self-titled AMERICAN horror stories when many of these horror stories are formed by. and in result of, very uniquely American horrors of colonization.",
                "My favorite class.",
                "Professor Deming is a really incredible instructor and offers really great feedback! One weakness was that the seminar size was a little bit large, and so it was easier for the quieter personalities to get lost beneath the more vocal contributors."
