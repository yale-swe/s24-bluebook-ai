                "My overall understanding of the French language improved dramatically through this course. I gained a better understanding of various grammatical and syntactical rules, and on the whole became much more comfortable with speaking French. I took this class right out of high school AP French, and it was a great refresher on a lot of what I had learned in an altered AP covid year. I also made some wonderful friends through the class; Madame Burton does an excellent job of facilitating a welcoming and supportive classroom environment. I can say with certainty that this class was one of the few this semester I genuinely looked forward to, despite the high workload.",
                "Developed French speaking, writing, and reading comprehension skills and gained cultural understanding of French literature, and World War 2 France.",
                "My French grammar and my speaking skills improved greatly in this course.",
                "I gained enormous amounts of confidence in speaking French aloud, as well as more written practice than I've had in probably the last two years of my French education combined. My French is much sharper, more nuanced, and more accurate.",
                "I learned a lot of new grammar structures, refined the ones I knew before, learned a lot about French/Francophone cultures and histories, and regularly used my speaking/writing/listening skills on a daily basis.",
                "I learned new grammar structures, added a ton of useful words to my French vocabulary, improved my oral and listening abilities, and got to read an arrangement of French texts from varying global Francophone cultural contexts.",
                "I became more confident in my French-speaking abilities, and learned the grammar my previous French courses in high school skipped over. I engaged with texts from all over the globe and learned about the francophone world, which was also very interesting. I also learned a lot about French cinema. Finally, I learned about the situation in France during World War 2, which was also incredibly fascinating.",
                "I learned a lot more French grammatical constructions (e.g., faire causatif, geographical prepositions, temps litteraire, expansion of pronouns, etc.) and more about French history, particularly about the country during World War II. I further developed my French reading skills by delving into difficult texts (La Symphonie Pastorale, Un Sac De Billes) and improved my speaking skills, as there was a very large emphasis on oral production."

            "comments": [
                "PROS: Your French improves a ton, Madame Burton is a WONDERFUL person who genuinely cares about her students and takes the time to check in with their overall well-being and is ALSO an EXCELLENT teacher who knows how to teach her content; the classroom environment is great and some of the books and stories we read (Diversit, un sac de billes) are very interesting to read from a historical perspective \r\nCONS: High workload (sometimes not justified): this course is VERY work-heavy, and I sometimes felt as though the audio activities we were assigned to do weren't necessarily helpful or relevant to our learning and/or dated. The audio activities specifically were highly time consuming; average work per night ranged from 45 mins to 2 hours which really does add up over the course of the week",
                "I think given the goals of L4 language, the course is very well structured. The audio exercises we were required to do were probably the least helpful aspect  of the course as many of them were extremely long and not particularly helpful. Otherwise, I think the assignments are well tailored to the course, though the workload is fairly intense.",
                "This course was really helpful in improving my French skills!",
                "This course is extremely rigorous. There are multiple assignments a night, usually 3-5. It can be overwhelming keeping track of all the different things you're expected to do for the next day. The course with Dr. Burton does a fantastic job of encouraging students to practice their spoken communication in a fun and engaging way, as well as practice grammar and vocab in such engaging ways during class that when the tests roll around you realize you've retained a huge amount of information!",
                "It helps you learn quite a bit in a short amount of time due to its intensity and frequency. I think the curriculum could be updated to be a little bit more useful/less niche with some gramma/skills things.",
                "It's a lot of work, but all the content was extremely interesting. I really appreciated the focus on France during WW2, reading Un sac de billes, and how we got to choose our own topic for the final presentation. There are a lot of opportunities to delve into the specific subject matters you're most passionate about.",
                "This course was very interactive and I greatly enjoyed the small classroom setting. The grammar was also well-taught and understandable, as were the units of study. My only suggestion for this course would be to provide more writing practice, as the few rdactions we wrote did not feel sufficient compared to other French courses I have taken in the past.",
                "The regularity with which the course meets ensures maximum retention. Madame Burton is also a very engaging teacher--very knowledgeable and passionate about French, and really makes sure students understand the material while still leading a dynamic class."

                "Without hesitation, take this class. I wanted to drop the class after my first exam grade but things ended up rebalancing and Madame really reminded me of why I love French. It's super engaging and fun and Madame makes all the work worth it. No sugarcoating; this is a very difficult class, but it is possible to succeed if you put in the work.",
                "If you're dedicated to advancing your French skills then yes, but you have to be self-motivated to succeed.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it helps solidify your French skills through reading a variety of stories and books, and through oral practice such as debates and presentations.",
                "If you want to improve your french, ABSOLUTELY. 140 bridges the gap between your current French level and a much more proficient academic and conversational capability.",
                "I would say yes, if they are ready for a difficult/rigorous course. They will learn quite a bit, but it will also likely be a challenge just because of the workload.",
                "I highly recommend taking this course if you have time in your schedule for the daily class commitment and homework load! It was one of my favorite courses to take at Yale, and I left the course with a noticeably improved skillset, particularly with my writing abilities.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student wishing to master the French language and learn about the francophone world. Students are able to engage in the French language through various types of media, and get speaking, writing, listening, and reading opportunities which all add up to make a great experience.",
                "Only if they are serious about improving their Frenche.g., if they wish to go to a French-speaking country and get around speaking French. The class meets everyday of the week and there is a lot of work, but there is no better way to learn if you really want to."
