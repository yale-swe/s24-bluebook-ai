                "I developed my knowledge about the medical profession and the uncertainty that lies within it. I also became more familiar with philosophical works and how their underlying principles relate to the medical field as well. Additionally, the midterm and final papers allowed me to build my skills as a writer.",
                "I learned about the human side of medicine. This class really opened my eyes to the humanity of doctors--they're not just robots who never make mistakes. I learned a lot about how important it is for doctors to have empathy and how important it is for doctors to embrace uncertainty. I had never really read texts written from the perspective of doctors, so it was really insightful to be able to see how they think and also the cognitive biases they may fall prey to.",
                "I learned more about the role of uncertainty in medicine, empathy, patient care, ethics, and philosophy.",
                "This class teaches you more how to think about medicine as a whole rather than about any specific topic. Its readings cover everything from Aristotle's writings on ethics to 1900s Russian authors to articles documenting clinical errors in medicine, but each lesson proves relevant to the field of healthcare. Moreover, nearly every contemporary author we read came to guest lecture, Henry Marsh and Lisa Sanders probably most notable among these. \r\nAn absolute must-take class for anyone considering going into premed! This class gave me confidence that medicine was right for me, even while I struggled in STEM pre-reqs. Dr. Morrison is a wonderful, kind, uplifting human being, and I am extremely grateful for his lessons on how to be a better physician (or even just a better person).",
                "I learned a lot about how nebulous medicine (and science in general) is, and how that's not necessarily a bad thing. I definitely view medicine in a different light, and it's really encouraging to know a bit more about where I'm going."

                "It was extremely eye-opening in connecting unexpected aspects of literature\/philosophy with STEM and medicine. It was very engaging and Dr. Morrison one of the best\/most understanding professors I've had so far.",
                "It's discussion based which was great, but I wish we had more opportunities for assignments.",
                "Strengths: discussion format, the workload was very reasonable, definitely a breath of fresh air in comparison to my other courses.\r\nWeaknesses: There is a lot of reading (but definitely manageable and rewarding). Oftentimes the philosophical readings are hard to understand, but thats why the discussions are there to help you understand and ask questions! I don't really consider this a weakness, but if you are not fond of reading and do not see yourself dedicating time to do so, I would not recommend this course for you.",
                "The course contains a lot of interesting readings and topics that will change how you think about what it means to be a doctor. The lectures\/seminars were always very interesting and engaging. Numerous authors, professors, and other experts in their respective fields were invited to speak. Even if you're not a pre-med, the course covers broadly applicable ideas that can be of use to anyone.",
                "This class was extremely engaging; the literature that Dr. Morrison selected for us to read was extremely interesting and made for thought-provoking class discussions. I also really enjoyed getting to meet the authors of many of the works we had read, from Dr. Lisa Sanders to Dr. Henry Marsh. \r\nI think the one weakness of the class was the length of lectures; though Dr. Morrison's lectures were extremely informative and stimulating, my one comment was that they ran a little long sometimes. There were a few days where the entire class period was taken up by lectures and the students didn't really have a chance to engage with the material. Perhaps those lectures could be shortened a little bit so as to leave some more room for discussions during class.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Morrison. I have never seen someone who is so passionate about what they're doing. He started off his emails with \"hello dears,\" which always warmed my heart. He was always so excited about class and to see us and to share his thoughts. It was a much needed break from the stresses of all my other classes. He also brought in special guests and it was so cool to have the authors of the books we read come visit us and answer our questions. The workload was VERY fair, and his grading was also VERY fair. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lectures at the beginning class were a bit long, so they cut into discussion time.",
                "StrengthsDr. Morrison is a gem. He's such a caring professor and puts a lot of effort into making each class memorable. The readings were also super interesting and Dr. Morrison invited some incredible guest lecturers, like the legendary neurosurgeon Dr. Henry Marsh and Dr. Lisa Sanders, the creator the NY Times Diagnosis column. \r\n\r\nWeaknessessometimes the discussions felt slightly circular (although this may be exacerbated by the zoom format)",
                "The course's strengths lie in its engaging readings, Dr. Morrison's lectures (you can clearly tell he has put many hours of effort into researching and organizing the topics he presents), and the wonderful discussions in class each week. I learned so much from the perspectives of other students, and Dr. Morrison always guided discussions masterfully. \r\nIts weaknesses are few and far between. The only thing that comes to mind are the weeks that had a heavier reading load, but the readings were always so interesting that even higher page counts never seemed like a burden. This class was wonderful in so many ways it is hard to quantify them all - I just wish I could take it again next semester!",
                "There was a lot of reading! Nevertheless, it was definitely engaging. I started reading everything 1 month before the term started, and taking the time to think things through for myself was really valuable. I will say sometimes we didn't have much of an opportunity to talk about what we had read because there was so much other stuff to say\/talk about."

                "Dr. Morrison definitely succeeded in creating a small, seminar-style dynamic over Zoom. Having different authors to class really allowed the students to get involved with the course material. Like I said previously, I think the only area of improvement was the lectures, which could perhaps be shortened to allow for a little bit more class engagement.",
                "The interactive sessions with the special guests were very helpful. \r\nI wish Dr. Morrison's lectures would have been shorter so that we could have longer discussions.",
                "Dr. Morrison's lectures were wonderful, but he went above and beyond to try and make the course as normal as possible even amidst COVID restrictions.\r\nHe organized a virtual tour of the medical library, a zoom lecture on using art and music to better diagnose patients' conditions, and esteemed guest lecturers from academia, medicine, and his personal life. The course's material would make it a memorable class in any case, but Dr. Morrison's clear love for teaching and his students brought Medicine and the Humanities above and beyond. I will always remember this class, and I hope to stay in touch with Dr. Morrison for years to come.",

Even non pre-meds will find that their view of doctors change drastically and view science in a different light.",

Whether you are a STEM student or not, the class provides a phenomenal lens into the medical profession from all sorts of different angles. There is a perfect balance of science readings and humanities readings in the class. And, Dr. Morrison's passion for the material he teaches creates a wonderful class dynamic. I highly recommend the course!",

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially someone considering medicine. But even if you aren't considering medicine, the life lessons from this course reach far beyond medicine. This course brought me a completely new perspective. I had been so discouraged about medicine, but this class made me more confident because I learned that doctors are humans too.",
                "Yes! Dr. Morrison is amazing, and you get to read and discuss ethics, philosophy, and art in a medical context.",
                "I would recommend this course with all my heart. For premed students, I would tell them that you will never take another class like this. Medicine and the Humanities made me more certain about my passion for medicine than hundreds of hours volunteering in the hospital ever did. Even if you're not premed, this class can teach you so much about medicine, clinical biases, or even just how to think. If Dr. Morrison is teaching this class again, RANK. THIS. SEMINAR. He was one of the best teachers I have ever had. He clearly loves this topic, his work, and his students. He is what makes an already fantastic class into one of the best you'll ever take. I'm just sad I can only take this class once.",
