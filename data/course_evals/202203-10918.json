In lessons, I also learned about idiomatic part writing for the specific instruments in my composition. For the smaller portfolio submissions, I learned new techniques of writing for mallet percussion, practiced incorporating modal mixture and non-diatonic pitch collections into compositions, and gained familiarity with Ableton user interface and drum rack.",

                "Strengths: weekly lessons, semester-long project, portfolio submissions\r\nWeaknesses: I would have preferred fewer guest presentations during weekly seminars. The guest presentations might have been more helpful for the more experienced composers in Comp III, but I would have liked to have spent more time discussing the compositional techniques we used in our portfolio submissions, possibly going over more examples or diving deeper into the topics. Also the first Ableton workshop moved a little fast.",
                "This course is above all, great motivation to work on music composition, which is something I really wanted. The guest speakers are really enjoyable and the private classes are fantastic opportunities for growth. Occasionally I think would have appreciated more direct instruction in lectures rather than almost exclusively guest speakers and presentations, since I think the lectures we did have were very well done, and in addition I would have preferred some more intermediate feedback from the instructor on my ongoing projects."
