                "I wish we got to engage more with our peers: given that wgss is such a personal major, it would've been useful to see applications of the theories to reality through our each backgrounds. I enjoyed hearing my classmates, who were particularly engaging. Craig left a lot of positive space for student thoughts, living up to the seminar style.",
                "This course has great content but what could be improved is the way class itself is run. The texts are great and I think we could have had better conversations. More historical context provided by the instructor and better guiding questions perhaps. Maybe even more activities during class to get us thinking and talking.",
                "I really liked the course. The workload was expected and relevant. I found no weaknesses.",
                "strengths: incredible syllabus. loved basically all of the readings. woolf, vuong, butler, warner, so many hits and lots of outside the box sources as well. I craig came prepared with good discussion questions and has really strong command of the texts. I like the presentations to give context on the readings and point out key themes. Sometimes the discussion questions were good, but sometimes i felt we should have dedicated maybe 20-30 mins max to the presentation discussion questions and then moved on to questions craig had which were generally more academically rigorous and pushed the discussion to be a yale-level writing seminar. \r\ni also really loved the assignments in this course. really manageable workload but interesting. loved the oral history and final research paper.",
                "I thought this course was a good intro to feminist and queer theory, but it was an upper-level class and it did not necessarily feel like one. The discussions were often centered around what \"feminism\" means, but I don't think that was a productive thing to focus on. Rather than trying to come up with a definition for that word, I would've been more interested in exploring how it cannot be defined and how it means different things for different people\/groups of people. I wish that we delved deeper into feminist theory by foundational writers\/thinkers, analyzing it and comparing and contrasting between different theorists. I did really enjoy the readings in this course, I just wish the class was a little bit more thought provoking."

                "I would recommend this course to another student, strongly. Craig is a strength of this class, and I sincerely appreciate his efforts to create an inclusive environment. He took the class to Yorkside on his own dime, which demonstrates how kind he is. I loved this class and urge people, particularly those outside of the humanities major, to take this class as it is a class that is a gentle introduction into the humanities and wgss major. I really enjoyed this class and hope many more can take it.",
                "I would recommend the content but again, the classes themselves were lacking in good conversation or lesson plans.",
                "Yes. The workload was light but the learning was high. Great environment, it fostered great discussions.",
                "Definitely. Great syllabus, caring professor, and great assignments. Manageable workload and really interesting readings and assignments that stretched you. Craig is really understanding about extensions which is great."
