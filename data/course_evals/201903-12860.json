    "I learned to better base my arguments in textual evidence and to close-read the texts we read in class. We also had a lot of engaging discussions in class that often changed the way I perceive the world and society.",

   "comments": [
    "This course is really engaging and stimulating in terms of the discussions we do in class. However, the class doesn't really focus a lot on how to form better arguments and write better papers. I understand this course is more literature-based and learning writing techniques is more of a skill learned in ENGL 114. But I would have liked more practice with structuring my analysis and using text to support my claims.",
    "The readings are all right but the discussions were unenthusiastic.",
    "The four papers don't really build on each other and it's kinda up to your professor. It should really be standardized more appropriately or not standardized altogether. I was impressed by the students and their contributions to the course, but not particularly the instructor and his contributions. We could have had class without him in the room and reached the same conclusions."

   "comments": [
    "I would. The papers are a lot, and it's a little frustrating to not get much feedback from the final drafts of your essays. But the professor puts in a lot of work to make the class discussions as interesting as possible, and he asks questions that make you really think about the text. If you want to at least improve your skills in close-reading text, then you should take this class.",
    "No, there are not enough assignments or feedback to improve writing skill, and the topic Failures and Disappointments gets depressing.",
    "If you haven't read any of the syllabus material and would prefer to write 4 papers instead of 3 for ENGL 114, then sure, take this course. The papers are shorter in length. But if Lukas is your professor, you won't get any feedback which is beyond infuriating given that this is a seminar and an English class where feedback is fundamental.",
    "This course definitely makes sure you leave the semester feeling confident in your ability to express yourself through the written word, not just in the essay format. Like a writing bootcamp!"
