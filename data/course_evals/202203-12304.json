The environment was safe to express my opinion and I never felt my views were inadequate because I'm not a dancer. We also got to see Yvonne Rainer's show \"What About the Bees?\" in NYC for free!  I think sometimes the readings were a bit much and sometimes we would not get to all of them which was a tad annoying but when we told Prof. Reid, some of them got reduced."
