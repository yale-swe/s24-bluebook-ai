                "Hanwhen was incredible. However it was hard to get replies via email from James",
                "The pacing of this course felt slightly uneven. Many lectures on the basics of vector-matrix and matrix-matrix multiplication could be condensed to leave more time for the more abstract\/ conceptually challenging chapters on eigenvalues\/vectors and spaces. The current distribution makes the course feel end-heavy, with the core concepts of subspaces and spanning covered at unnecessary speed.",
                "Overall, this is a great course. I liked the project in lieu of a second midterm. I wish Canvas quizzes were assigned ahead of lectures (in addition to psets) to introduce topics and check understanding.",
                "A huge weakness is that this course is too math-oriented and not applications-based. One way that the course could be improved is by focusing on least squares and other applications like finite element analysis. I understand that the course is for all backgrounds but perhaps there can be a push for a course in linear algebra that is exclusively for stats majors or for engineering majors.",

                "Sure, if you like math. I would definitely take it over 225 (unless you are a literal pure math major); it's so much easier and you actually end up learning more linear algebra concepts cause you don't have to spend all semester proving the existence of the cartesian plane. I honestly really liked this class and thought the workload was super manageable. Really wasn't too hard. I liked it much much better than 120.",
                "Yes, everyone interested in pursuing either engineering or statistics and data science will find this course very useful.",
                "Only take this if you need it as a prerequisite. This course is not really helpful and the material covered can be compressed easily into 5 weeks."
