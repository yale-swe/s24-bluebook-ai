                "A strength of this course is the organized structure of it with quizzes throughout the semester to keep students engaged with material that replaces a midterm, with just a final at the end being a summation of the quizzes and class material. A weakness could be the lecture format of the class which could become disengaging and more practice problems or discussion of the material in class could fix.",
                "Honestly an all around good course, no complaints! Material is interesting, psets, exams, and workloads felt fair, and lectures are interesting.",
                "This course is an excellent mix of understanding challenging concepts while also seeing results that actual astronomers have found.",
                "Strengths: this class is well-paced and organized. All material needed is covered in lectures, and lecture slides are posted to Canvas. As someone who previously took a physics course, I found the class approachable but regardless of your background there are ample opportunities to ask questions and receive help.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures can be quite dry, but this is likely a result of needing to cover a broad range of material at an introductory level. Because of the limited math and physics prerequisites, this course does not go into many derivations of results, so there always remain some mystery around why certain formulas work."

                "Yes! it is very easy to follow what is taught in class, the content is interesting and the TA's help a lot during office hours if you are struggling. It is generally not as fast-paced as most other science courses.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are at all interested in astronomy and primarily stars. This course is not a math-heavy course at all with very simple algebra being used the whole time, it is mainly learning concepts and definitions that explain most of what we know about stars.",
                "Yes! This is a fun, chill course - you will learn a lot. So long as you're comfortable with basic physics and geometry, you will do well.",
                "I would. This course is taught by a passionate professor and shares a great insight into stars.",
                "I would recommend this class to students who have an interest in astronomy, major or non-major. There is no significant physics or math background for this class, and the lectures, assignments, and exams are clear and straightforward. It is also important to highlight that this class opts for quizzes every two weeks in lieu of a midterm. We also had a night-time observatory trip, which was cold but fun!"
