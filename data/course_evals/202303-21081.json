However, I think the asynchronous day that was piloted this semester made it more difficult to learn with less time to practice speaking with the class and receive feedback from the professor. More assignments due spaced throughout the week could also ensure that students dont get behind. Also, attendance was not good, so I think a stricter attendance policy (making it affect grades more) might be needed to ensure some students adequate participation."
