    "I learned so much about the history of film and why the film industry looks the way it does today. I have found it hard to simply watch TV or streaming services anymore without thinking about everything I learned in the class.",
    "I learned about the history of Hollywood and the business tactics that studios employ",
    "A comprehensive understanding of the history of Hollywood as well as of how the movie business operates today. This was equally a history course and a business course, which I loved. I feel more prepared to read about the state of the film business and know exactly what is being discussed. This course gave me a whole new framework with which to look at the business of Hollywood as well as a vocabulary to discuss it. I feel a new relationship to the movies I love and I'm now asking new questionsabout the production and marketing of films that watchwhich never would have occurred to me if I never took this course",
    "I learned about the history and the basic structure of the entertainment business. While we particularly focused on the medium of film, I think this course did a great job of recognizing the trends of the business into other media.",
    "the history of hollywood, how the business developed and changed through time, the emergence of streaming and how this has changed hollywood, and the real-time effects of the COVID pandemic on Hollywood and the streaming business",
    "The course thoroughly explored the business structuring of Hollywood from the creation of the industry to present day. Instruction also distilled the ability to assess market strategies of production, distribution, and exhibition.",
    "Learned more about the process surrounding how movies are released.",
    "I learned about the history of the filmmaking industry, and modern aspects of the business.",
    "I developed insights on the history of Hollywood, how COVID has and will influence the industry, and how the digital age has and will reshape the future of the industry.",
    "I learned about the history of Hollywood, as well as the business structures that defined it at the beginning and define it today. I also learned about the emerging streaming war and the possible future directions it can take. I developed business analysis skills and learned how to research and compile market statistics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths : very interesting content, good recorded lectures, great adaptation to reflect current themes \r\nWeaknesses : class ran over at least 15 minutes every week, was not discussion based although advertised as such, lectures were mainly repeats of readings and recorded lectures so hard to interact with material",
    "The course squeezes a lot of history into a few classes which was very stressful and a lot to remember at once. However after the first few classes it feels like the lectures are a little redundant and  there was no time for discussion like I had hoped when I signed up for a seminar. The course is very engaging though because the information it presents is highly relatable to pretty much anyone and you do comprehend a lot.",
    "Strengths: structured course\r\nWeakness: I wished there was a portal to ask clarifying questions outside of class",
    "Strengths include the assigned reading and watching assignments, the canned lectures, and the general arc of the curriculum. Every unit complemented the one that followed. And the topics we discussed were all interconnected.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness is that the seminars were almost identical to the canned lectures we were assigned to watch. It sometimes felt as if I was having deja vu because we were learning the same thingwith the same slidestwice. Don't get me wrong: those lectures were fascinating! It would just be nice if Professor Johnson made the seminars build on the foundation of knowledge provided in the lectures for future iterations of this course.",
    "I think the course could be improved by not meeting so late into the evening.",
    "Strengths: pre-recorded lectures were an appropriate length that made it enjoyable and digestible\r\nWeaknesses: professor went over the allotted time every single live zoom session",
    "The sheer scale\/depth of information was excellent. The only concern was the duration of the summer session course being five weeks. Spreading out the final two projects would allow a greater degree of concentration\/focus on each of the assignments.",
    "The content was sometimes repetitive.",
    "It gave a lot of information and depth about some of the information, but it went way too fast and there was too much to cover in a short time. It could also be improved by not having a group project in an online class.",
    "Since it is online, it can be a bit hard to focus at times. More interactions between professor and student, student and student are encouraged. The strength of the course is the content and the depth.",
    "The strengths of this course are that the material is very interesting, informative, and relevant. It also is effective at teaching students about one of the most prevalent and important markets in the United States and around the world. This course could be improved by allowing for more discussion time. There were video lectures that we had to watch before class which were helpful. However, the instructor basically repeated those same lectures during our class. The class would have been much more informative if it was seminar-style instead."

   "comments": [
    "it depends. if you want a seminar style course then no, because the course does not provide many opportunities for discussion. if you are interested in film and do not mind lectures then yes",
    "Yes, it is great. Although the lectures can seem redundant at times, the information is really interesting and I find myself thinking about it all the time now while I watch TV. It is a lot of reading, but a manageable workload as long as you are disciplined!",
    "Yes! This will completely change your relationship to the movies you love and all movies going forward (in the best way). Knowledge of the film business is crucial to understand why the films we see today are getting produced and exhibited.",
    "Yes. I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in film. This course covers the essential must-know information baotu the film business that is completely left out of Yale's normal film and media major and semester course offerings.",
    "Yes, for someone who is not majoring in film this class is very informative, engaging and enjoyable. The subject matter is easily digestible and something everyone can relate to, especially considering how COVID has changed people's streaming habits.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone interested in the realities of the entertainment business. Taken in the shorter summer session, I would advise prospective students stay consistent with the completion of reading materials each week. The five-week time scale is a real test of will and perseverance.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in movies, absolutely.",
    "Yes, totally, it's fun!",
    "Probably not. It was interesting, but not well organized.",
    "Yes, it was very enlightening.",
    "Yes, because I learned a lot, but it would be better in person.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Particularly nowadays, when streaming is so prevalent and the pastime of almost everyone, it is very interesting to learn about the underlying business factors of this emerging field. It also provides students with vital context to how movie studios got to be the way they are now, and what legal battles they have faced throughout the decades."
