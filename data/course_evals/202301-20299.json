                "Strengths - Workshop format, diversity of texts was very helpful for learning about different modes of translation.\r\nWeaknesses - Workshops might've been a little too free and left up to students' discretion. Maybe some guidelines as to what kind of feedback would be helpful/looked for (for instance, more overarching translation practices as opposed to simple grammar/wording choices) would have been good.",
                "This was a fantastic course. It does a really good job trying to combine both a literature seminar-style syllabus and a creative writing sort of final project. One of the biggest strengths of the course is Professor Creswell and Maru, who are so helpful, very rigorous in their comments, and super available to meet with students. I learned so much just from office hours for this class. The only suggestion I would have would be to add more short translation assignments from the target language before you start working on your final translation. I like to get a chance to \"practice\" a little bit more.",
                "I think that this course was incredibly engaging, and I appreciated the balance that was struck between seminar discussions and workshops. The readings (at times a little heavy) would be very interesting to the point where we would rarely be able to go through all of them in the course of one class period. There would never be an instance where the discussion would stagnate.\r\n\r\nI would always receive very detailed, helpful feedback on nearly all of my assignments. In fact, I would have appreciated if some of the later assignments had gotten similar levels of feedback (although I understand that this is difficult when the assignments are to be posted on a class-wide discussion forum).",
                "This was a great course! I really enjoyed the readings and the structure of the class time. I think one thing that could improve the experience of the workshops would be a time cap on individual comments-- sometimes those would take almost the entire class and there wasn't much time for broader discussion. I also think it would be interesting (if it were possible) to pair people up who are working from the same language and maybe have those people give more in-depth feedback to each other during the workshops? Just an idea. Overall, though, I really enjoyed this course.",
                "The strength of this course is that you read a wide variety of texts from differents languages and cultures on translation that enrich your understanding of the tradition."

However, I got so much out of this class and I would recommend that anyone who speaks another language (and has any interest in literature and storytelling) should take this class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think that it is a class that even non-Humanities students would enjoy and would be able to get a lot out of. Although there is the caveat of being fluent in at least one language other than English, I think that the experience of taking this class is very rewarding, and it is very exciting to see ones translations of a text develop, as well as those of ones peers in the class.",
