We covered a lot of ground in the course, but every topic was treated with a lot of nuance and there was a lot of emphasis on a mode of critical historical thinking. This was the best introduction to Japanese History I could've asked for. We also discussed various throughlines between pre and postwar Japan, ones that would definitely surprise you and help to cast light on the state of affairs in Japan and Asia today."

                "I thought the readings for this course were incredible: very well-curated and engaging. They were not overwhelming but I also feel like every week we were able to reach the crux of the topics of discussion through critically analyzing the readings. The lectures were also very well designed and paced. We covered a lot of ground but it never felt rushed or too shallow. The class was also the perfect size at around 20 students, so it felt like the perfect mix of a smaller, more engaging lecture where we could ask and answer questions freely, and delve more deeply into our own understandings of the topics in section."

                "Absolutely. It was the best history and lecture course I've taken here at Yale. It doesn't feel too overwhelming in terms of workload but I think you get a lot out of the class. Especially for someone who hadn't really studied non-western history before, this was an excellent course that didn't assume too much prior knowledge but was also very intellectually stimulating as it introduced us to 20th century Japan."
