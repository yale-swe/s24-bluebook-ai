                "Strengths: the lecturers are extremely knowledgeable. They are also very approachable and supportive. The class size was also small, making it easier to request more individual help on modules. I like that there were multiple lecturers rather than one to provide a well-crafted learning plan. TA also allowed flexibility in hw submissions rather than rushing to submit an assignment that is not well understood but meets the deadline.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The last set of learning modules felt disorganized. There needs to be more structure to the class assignments. If we start something in class, maybe have it be submitted as is in hw. Instead hw was a questionnaire that did not confirm whether or not the student understood the learning module.",
                "Strengths: The course exposes students to a wide variety of quantitative approaches. The course content emphasizes practical information rather than focusing too heavily on theory. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The final project was assigned late in the semester, leaving only 1.5-2 weeks to complete it. I think it would be more beneficial for the final projects to be assigned a week or two earlier to give students the opportunity to start working on it sooner. The amount of work required for the final projects was manageable, but it could be difficult given the amount of work expected for other courses at the end of the semester.",
