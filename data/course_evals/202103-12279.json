Finally, I gained a better understanding of elements of Chinese culture including living habits, Chinese architecture, Chinese parks, and more.",
                "Better usage of chinese vocabulary and grammar, in both reading, speaking, and writing.",
                "Pretty much what you would expect from a Chinese language course. We learned pinyin, Chinese characters, reading, writing (essays), speaking (oral presentations), and grammar, as well as different aspects of Chinese culture.",
                "I learned how to read and write in Chinese, and have learned many grammar points to better my writing skills. I learned over 300 chinese characters, and have also learned how to give an oral presentation in Chinese, and write essays in Chinese at a higher level."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: lots of content covered in just one semester.\r\nWeaknesses: class was somewhat monotonous and predictable. Incorporating cultural activities could make it more engaging.",
                "Strengths: the expectations of the course are made very clear from the start. Homework is very straightforward, and students who put in lots of effort generally see that reflected in their grade.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no significant ones, except for the fact that sometimes we have to learn a lot of characters in a short span of time and it can get a little overwhelming.",
                "Strengths: Highly interactive course, instruction was fast paced but covered a lot of material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Confusion throughout course about grading and assignment due dates. Would have helped a lot to integrate assignments and grading more closely with canvas or gradescope.",
                "Weaknesses: felt like there was too much rote memorization of characters, would like more conversational practice, need more review of past weeks' characters (it's easy to forget them week to week, felt like we were cramming too many new characters in my brain that we would forget)",
                "I felt like the course was very well structured, and the professors did a great job of supporting all students and ensuring everybody was able to learn. If I had to state a weakness, I would say the course maybe followed a bit too closely to the textbook, although the professors also did a good job of preventing pure \"textbook learning\" by showing us other aspects of Chinese culture and having us read other stories that they found online.",
                "The strengths are that I felt this course helped me learn to read and write extremely well, and very fast too, and the way the course is structured, with quizzes every day, helps me stay on track. The google slides are very well formatted, and the engagement of the course is very high as well, giving every student a chance to participate. Overall, I didn't feel that there were any specific weakness for the course, besides it feeling a bit too fast paced sometimes."

                "For sure! Great course for heritage students to make great progress in their Chinese language abilities.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. The course is very organized and it's very clear what a student needs to do outside of class in order to succeed. The stories we read are all very interesting, and the vocabulary we study is all relevant to daily life. Overall, this course is great for anyone looking to improve their Chinese ability.",
                "Yes, but it is definitely a high intensity course so factor that in when making a decision.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anybody trying to strengthen their Chinese language skills. It was very well taught, and no matter if you had a lot of experience speaking Chinese at home, or if you had gone to a few years of Chinese weekend school, you definitely had plenty of opportunities to learn and improve on Chinese, regardless of previous experience.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student because the ways in which it has taught me reading and writing skills, especially starting from zero is astounding, and at such a fast speed as well. As long as you stay on top of your work, the course is very rewarding, and because of a small class size, everyone is there to help each other."
