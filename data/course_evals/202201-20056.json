It enables you to talk about nuanced and taboo topics in a language other than English which not only helps improve your Spanish, but also allows you to learn about so many things you've never thought of much before.",
                "I learned SO much: about my body, about gender-inclusive language in Spanish, different cultural practices, etc.",
                "I learned so much about female anatomy, gender, sex, sex in the reproductive sense, social issues in women's reproductive lives and also how to express myself in spanish to a much greater degree.",
                "I gained a lot of skills during my time in Claudias classroom such as valuable discussion, critical thinking skills, and most especially, inclusivity. It was one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale, especially because i learned to be critical with what I learn from specific sources on the internet as well as how I can speak Spanish inclusively while not excluding the spectrum of genders within society.",
                "I learned a lot about the biology and anthropology of the female body and the societal context in which it exists. The Spanish component of the course also meant that my ability to write essays and have academic conversation in Spanish increased greatly.",
                "This class was absolutely fabulous! I not only learned how to improve my Spanish writing and speaking skills but also learned an extensive amount about the female body.",

                "I learned so much science about female bodies. So, much. Much more than I know about my own body, being a male. So many topics are talked about in class, and it's just seeped into my conversations with others and my understanding of the world sometimes in very practical ways.",
                "Understanding feminine bodies, needs, social demands and perspectives, and our roles in promoting diversity, respect, and raising awareness with regards to the topics discussed. Also effective communication en espaol!!!"

                "Strengths: Good balance of lecture and discussion, great professor and TA, great environment for learning and really fascinating material.",
                "Strengths: Prof. V is a gem and you would be lucky to have her. From the meditation sessions at the beginning of class to the phenomenal lectures, I am so grateful to have gotten the chance to take this class. It challenges you without stressing you out (your grade is more related to effort than performance) and it gives you the opportunity to dive deep. The aspect of the class being in Spanish was such a huge strength. It's the best Spanish class I have ever taken.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No weaknesses!",
                "The biggest strength was that it was SO engaging. We were taught through different manners such as discussion, lecture, videos, small talks, projects, presentations, etc. This made it really easy to learn and most especially, interesting. One of the weaknesses was that the readings could sometime be very long, but I managed to get by and it was amazing nonetheless.",
                "A major strength is the understanding and empathy with which Professor Valeggia and her teaching team approach pedagogy.",
                "I did not find any weakness in this class. If you have the opportunity to study with Claudia, please take it! She is an amazing professor who is always conscious of the challenges everyone faces in juggling academics and extracurriculars.",
                "Pedagogical teaching that promotes learning and self-reflection. As a graduate student who has taken many many courses, I believe this a course that everyone should take. It truly is a journey and has been the most rewarding course I have taken.",
                "There is little room for improvement for the course. However, I wasn't the biggest fan of how one day a week was relegated to students leading the class. I think that would work better for a 3 days a week course. But I found other student's leading un-engaging at times and simple reading-off notes. A big difference from how Profe Valeggia does the class. She's definitely one of the course's biggest strengths.",
                "Strengths: Claudia Valeggia y la comunidad son la MAJOR parte de la clase!!!! Claudia Valeggia and the community are the BEST part of the class!!! Claudia is patient, passionate, has marvelous stories, lectures with ease, and prioritises students well-being and progress. She is a gem at Yale and encourages a pedagogy of collective growth and understanding. The class is organized well with Monday lectures and Wednesday discussions (miercoles >>>>). Student-led discussions were fantastic to continue the conversation and learn more about each other. That, and the type of student who will take this course.... the most ideal, supportive, and compassionate community. The added element of Spanish is really special: Claudia does focus a bit more on Spanish-speaking communities, but one also learns more technical terminology with time and share a special, predominantly Latine community. \r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps just a liiiitle more rigidity with deadlines... but not really! Claudia is super flexible and flex deadlines have come in so clutch... I couldn't recommend this course enough. Even if someone is not a native speaker (like me), this class is more than doable. You will thrive if you join with enthusiasm, an open mind and heart, and the desire to grow and contribute."

                "I loved this course so much. I feel empowered by the knowledge that I learned about the female reproductive system.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to everyone. I wanted to tell friends to take it, but those who don't speak Spanish couldn't. The course reviews topics everyone should know about but rarely does. I also noticed many people with initial interest in the class identify as female, but this class is truly amazing for everyone and you'll learn a lot regardless.",

                "I would most definitely recommend this class to other students at Yale. I am glad she also teaches this course in English so that it could appeal to a wider range of students but it was overall so amazing. I learned so much about myself and the concept of female bodily function both through the lens of biology as well as culture and society.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Valeggia greatly prioritized building a community and a safe environment in the classroom, and this class was easily one of my favorites I've taken at Yale.",
                "Yes yes yes! The class was so fun (we started every class with a meditation) and it never felt high-pressure or intense. Definitely one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
                "Yes. It is an opportunity to step out of your comfort zone and learn about material that is often stigmatized in society. If you are up for a personal challenge take this class. I enjoyed every assignment and I am grateful to have been in a space that promotes creativity.",
                "Yes. This is a must take course. It's excellent in every way. Hardly a dull moment. A fun way to get your L5 spanish.",
                "Undeniably - take Cuerpos Femeninos, or any of Claudia's other courses, if you can!!! Even if you're unsure if anthropology or social sciences is \"your thing\", the discussion themes and manner with which they are approached are so ideal for those with a passion for learning and growing with a community of like minded, compassionate classmates. The community in this class is unparalleled to what one will find in most other Yale courses: students listen to each other, share countless personal stories, laugh, are vulnerable, challenge each other's depth of thinking, and inspire each other to be better members of the community. You learn a significant amount academically, but in many ways, also grow personally and reflect a lot on your progress. Claudia is with you every step of the way. I couldn't recommend this course enough."
