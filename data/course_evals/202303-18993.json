Intro to technical tools for examine artworks, including X-ray, UV, IR, XRF. Ways of connecting technical examination results with the artistic, cultural, and historical significance of the works."

                "No weakness - I've learnt so much in this class and the opportunities to look at objects up-close and touch them with my own hands are quite mind-blowing.",
                "This class was awesome! You learn a bunch and it is super fun",
                "Strength: Lots of time in front of YUAG objects, intimate class size allows for lots of one on one conversations with the professors \r\nWeakness: I would have appreciated a little more background information on construction and conservation before we jumped into case studies... often felt like I was trying to apply concepts or techniques that I didn't fully understand.",
                "The course was very engaging and succeeded in teaching me to look at objects in a new way. I also really enjoyed our discussions about the purpose and ethics of conservation. I recognize that it is an (impossible) challenge to fit a whole field into one undergraduate course-- that being said, there were times when I felt like we moved through more material in a week that I was able to absorb (one example that comes to mind is the reading on the history of the development of oil paint alternatives, which went into a lot of detail that we weren't able to get to in class. In future, I think it would be helpful practice identifying the different kinds of paint in class (or at least to see in-person examples)). I also think that we could have received a more thorough overview of the different kinds of tests that one can conduct on objects. We were given handouts, but I don't think it was ever completely clear to me what tests would be appropriate in which kinds of situations or how to interpret those results. The session at west campus was fascinating, but it offered individual case studies, rather than an overview, which could have been helpful. I thought the final project was well-designed and gave us an opportunity to apply our learning to a real-life example.",
                "This course is very well-organized with amazing instructors who love their work and care a lot about the class. I learned a lot in the class and felt extremely supported in every step of my final project in the second half of the semester. The unique perspective offered in this class is different from all my previous art history classes and serves as a great compliment to my previous knowledge."

                "Yes, definitely! The class is both content-rich (I gained new skills and knowledge that I had not gotten from other art history courses) and lots of fun. The professors are great, and through their positions at the YUAG are able to connect the class with Yale's vast collections-based resources.",
                "I would absolutely recommend! This course was my favorite this semester. Irma and Anne are really passionate about what they do. I love how the course was organized. In the first half of the semester, we had weekly readings and a combination of mini-lectures and seminar discussions. I learned so much from Irma and Anne and my classmates and especially enjoyed the hands-on aspect of the class (you can actually touch and move the artworks!!!) and our special sessions with conservators at the YCBA and on West Campus. Plus, I also really loved the weekly sketching and short writing response assignments, which taught me how to observe, describe, and analyze artworks from a material perspective. In the second half, each of us was assigned an object to examine as a case study using all the tools we learned in the first half of the class, which was a great practice experience that taught me how to bridge what I usually do in art history classes and new perspectives I learned this class."
