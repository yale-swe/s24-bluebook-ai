                "I learned about philosophical and psychological ways we can understand our human nature. The class was very intuitive in terms of the material we learned, however the exams were difficult. It was really cool to be able to understand the psychological studies which backed up or didn't support the philosophical concepts that we read with the texts of philosophers like Spinoza, Marx, Schopenhauer, etc.",
                "I learned a lot about the connections between psychology and philosophy and about topics of controversy in each field. This was a fascinating interdisciplinary course that was outside my usual course selection but I'm glad I decided to take it.",
                "This course was an incredible blend of dominating philosophical views and contemporary experimental research to provide for a nuanced view on the debate within human nature.",

                "I learned how to think through hapiness, morality, and etc through the lens of philosophers. Also expanded my thinking on these and many other topics.",
                "I developed my critical thinking skills and refined my views through looking at various big thinkers over the years and their thoughts on important issues. I also furthered my ability to articulate an objection to another thinkers work in a meaningful way.",
                "Learned a lot about major aspects of human nature such as happiness, altruism, virtue, reasoning, and religious belief from psychological and philosophical perspectives. It is a very interesting survey course.",
                "I learned a lot about the philosophy and psychology of happiness, altruism, virtue and character, morality and motivation, and belief in God.",
                "Learned a lot about human psychology and approaches to the way we think about various life problems.",

                "This course introduces the most influential and famous pieces of literature in modern philosophy, and psychology research that backs/refutes those theories. Although the content introduced is very broad and does not go in depth, it is a great intro for those who are interested in modern/experimental philosophy, or is wondering whether they are interested in thinking about why humans act the way they do.",

This was supplemented with physiology research that developed and challenged these ideas. Ultimately, I was able to think deeply and critically about these themes and how they applied to my own life in a way I never had before. I learned how to read and analyze both philosophy and psychology papers, as well as write my own.",

                "A relatively basic understanding of various psychological and philosophical perspectives. It was interesting that these perspectives would be read through the lens of a certain subject area (happiness, etc.). For more advanced philosophy students, the readings are still interesting, but it is clear that the class is meant for cognitive science/psychology students with little background in philosophy.",

The course is organized such that we first learn about what influential Philosophers have said followed by what empirical Psychology research has shown. The units are: Happiness, Altruism, Virtue, Morality, and Belief in God. I also learned to write Philosophy papers.",
                "We read some foundational philosophical texts that delved into the core themes of the course (Happiness, Existence of God, Morals, Virtue). Beyond engaging critically with these texts and asking questions about the manner in which we could/should imbibe them, we approached them from the perspective of psychology. This entailed reading some psychological literature that dealt with the same questions as philosophers (or opened up new questions) with empirical research. A core part of the class involved writing an argumentative philosophy paper.",
                "We dissected numerous readings and ideas of thought from famous western Philosophers and covered a lot of topic breadth from happiness and suffering to origins of religion to morality and altruism. Great introductory class if you want a lot of exposure to many philosophers in a short semester!",

                "This was my favorite class at Yale so far! If you are interested in Psychology and Philosophy, this is the class for you! I learned how to read philosophy and examine it through a psychology lense. I also learned how to think critically about the Psychological research that is out there and how there is so much room for improvement! Prof. Knobe is a great lecturer, def worth taking!",

                "The class has a midterm paper and a midterm exam, and a final paper and final exam. This is TOO MUCH. There is no need to have both an exam and a paper for these two assessments, one or the other would've sufficed. The addition of both a paper and an exam made it so stressful to prepare for this class at the middle and end of the term, and so bland and lacking work throughout the other parts of the school year. In this sense, the effort required for this class was super unevenly distributed. It felt like I was doing nothing for the day to day but everything at the middle and end of the term.",
                "Strength: interesting perspectives from both the philosophy and psychology\r\nWeakness: often times I feel like I cannot hear Joshua well from the back of the lecture hall. Maybe use a mic or something.",
                "I really liked the set of readings chosen and the way the course was divided into units. I had a very easy time understanding the themes we were focusing on, and the readings did not take too long at all. They'd frequently be 15 pages or less per class. I didn't like that our midterm exam occurred in April, after we had completed 4 of our 5 units, and I felt a little lost on how to write the midterm and final papers, since I was new to philosophy writing. The exams were also pretty difficult (for part of each exam, we had to read excerpts and say which reading it was from).",
                "Discussion sections and student agency in deciding which type of paper to write (either a typical philosophy paper or a more empirically-oriented psych-inspired paper) were incredibly useful in allowing students to deeply learn concepts relative to their skills and interests. The lecture was well set up to bounce off of readings while not simply repeating them.\r\n\r\nThis course was lacking in a clear roadmap at the beginning of each lecture, making key information difficult to keep track of.",
                "The course material was fairly interesting but I thought the lectures (especially the slides) could have been organized a lot better. We spent a long time discussing things that we should be able to take away from the readings. Each class just seemed like a summary of the assigned reading. The course was also very poorly adapted to COVID circumstances. There was nowhere to access recordings or catch up on missed classes, especially because the lecture slides only contained a few images and arrows and very little information.",
                "weakness: grading kinda ambiguos at times",

                "The structure of the course and exams was very conducive to learning and actually remembering concepts from the readings/lectures. The lectures were very helpful in unpacking the readings.\r\n\r\nIt was too much to have both a paper AND exam for midterms and finals. They were difficult enough that one alone would have sufficed.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-  interesting readings\r\n- interesting lecture content\r\n-",
                "Strengths include discussion section and the input of TAs. Weaknesses include the lectures themselves, as they were often summaries of readings accompanied by few explanatory ideas, and the papers.",
                "Hard to follow but interesting content",
                "The quality of the sections are really high, although participation could be better. Classes are interesting and engaging, although if its in WLH 201, Prof Knobe doesn't use the microphone so you should sit in the first few rows to actually hear what he's saying.",
                "Prof Knobe needs to speak more into the microphone.",
                "This course is extremely well structured. The units progress in a very logical and digestible way and the information is very well suited for the lecture format. Professor Knobe is an amazing lecturer and constantly amazed me with how perfectly timed and succinct his lectures were. Additionally, section discussion was a critical part of this course that greatly benefitted my understanding and interaction with the content. I do however think that TF's need a more consistent outline for how to run discussion sections as I feel there was discontinuity between sections and how helpful they were with the course content.",
                "Overall, I think the course accomplished its goals and Professor Knobe did a great job of explaining the material covered. \r\nI was frustrated that  a couple times we were introduced to certain psychological studies as evidence toward some conclusion  only to be told in a later lecture that those studies did not replicate. I agree its worth discussing the replication crisis, but I dont understand why those studies were initially presented to us without recognition that they were debunked. Though this isnt an original argument, I also would have loved to see more non-western philosophical perspectives. \r\nLast, Professor Knobes lectures are very clear, but his lecture slides are very difficult to decode if youre using them for review  tons of unlabeled arrows and photos with not so immediately obvious meanings.",
                "Strength was the material was very interesting. The professor was a strength most of the times. The sections were also very interesting and engaging.",
                "Strengths: organization of course, engaging section, supportive professor. Weaknesses: class wasn't recorded and it was hard to know what was going on just from lecture slides.",
                "The course material is well chosen and interesting. Lecture content is great, but the professor is hard to hear even when sitting close. The class could benefit from the professor using a microphone.",

                "Presentation slides could have had more information on them. Content and readings were carefully chosen and organized.",
                "Strengths: interesting topic\r\nWeakness: lecture can just feel like it is repeating the topics",
                "clearer powerpoint slides - if something didnt make sense you couldnt look back at the slides because they were usually just images with no text",
                "I loved the lectures and sections and felt they were very productive, but I wouldve appreciated more frequent testing of big concepts throughout the semester.",
                "The course is very backloaded so you basically work on 90% of your grade in the final month. Even then, the exams are \"designed to be hard\" and are then curved such that most students get a B or B+. The exams look for very specific answers and so it is easy to miss points and compromise your grade. However, the topics were engaging so I would recommend the class as a credit d class. Don't take it if you want an easy A.",
                "Strengths: a good basic background into philosophy \r\n\r\nWeakness: harsh grading and very little guidance into how to impeove",
                "The readings did not feel connected or operating on the same level- they were very disparate in an unproductive way. The class is fine if you know nothing about the topic, but boring if you do.",
                "It was difficult this semester to excel in my class because we had many changes in our TA throughout the semester. It was difficult not knowing what my current grade was during the semester due to the unforeseen circumstances.",
                "I though the course was really interesting but at times it was difficult to here professor in lecture",
                "The course was very well organized. I just wish that more partial credit would be awarded during exams.",
                "Great content and lecturing, lots of variety between sections though.",
                "Strengths: Prof Knobe is so great! I love how the course is organized such that we first learn about what influential Philosophers have said followed by what empirical Psychology research has shown. This is an excellent introductory course for those completely unfamiliar with Philosophy/Psychology. The exams are very reasonable, so there is no need to rote learn the material. Instead, you can simply focus on understanding the concepts. \r\nWeaknesses: the lectures felt messy sometimes (though I got used to them in the second half of the semester), Prof Knobe speaks softly so it is sometimes hard to hear him, the slides have almost no words so if you didn't understand a part of lecture you can't go back and refer to the slides",
                "The course structure: the way in which the readings and lectures are organized at a macro-level was genius. We approached issues from philosophy, raised questions, and then attempted to answer some of them using psychology  or just asked more interesting questions motivated by research. Likewise, although they could vary depending on who you TF was, the discussion sections produced genuinely interesting debates/questions that helped you understand the material in much better detail. The lecture content itself was likewise exceptionally useful if you are amicable with Professor Knobe's style; he's a genuine genius, both with regards to putting his lectures together and about the field(s). That being said, his lectures could strike some as unengaging, especially because they were occasionally a little difficult to hear and pass out to.",
                "I think a strength of the course was the professor. He really seemed to care about the students and their wellbeing. However, one form of improvement could be the way the exams are structured, particularly the sections that pull paragraphs out of passages and ask us which author it is from. Moreover, spreading out the assignments would be nice because there was nothing inthe first 2 months and then all exams and papers were in the last month or month and a half which was difficult.",
                "The lectures are well organized and posted to Canvas as PPTs. I loved how they were presented with broader questions to invoke deeper reflection and introspective thought rather than merely understanding views of different philosophers. Discussion sections were fun and engaging and a great way to prep for papers and hear other students views and thoughts. Overall, no apparent weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: lectures, discussion sections (!!), loved the format switching between philosophy and psychology, liked the style of the slides and how they guided note-taking, but encouraged summary in our notes\r\nI loved the freedom of our papers!\r\n\r\nweaknesses: I only wish Professor Knobe spoke a bit louder...my only complain",
                "Strengths: a number of interesting topics and readings.\r\nWeaknesses: lectures sometimes glanced over the most interesting parts of the readings (but this is somewhat understandable given how much we read in the space of one semester), and also the exam questions occasionally seemed somewhat contrived.",
                "i really enjoyed the lectures! i thought the readings were concise and informative",
                "Strengths: the lectures were good",
                "The material was very interesting to learn!",
                "Good readings assigned and interesting course material but the exams can be a bit difficult, especially questions that ask you to identify the author of a quoted passage from one of the readings.",
                "Greatly taught course with talented TAs and an engaging professor and enlightening readings. For improvement, I wish the slides could be more detailed for revision purposes. The courseload felt like a lot but in retrospect it was doable.",
                "Strengths: the discussion section I was in was very engaging, and the papers were also fun to write (although long and can take a lot of time). Weaknesses: The exams are VERY hard, so if you take this course you need to be ready to study HARD for these.",
                "lectures were too redundant with readings. josh is great but tends to mumble. it's hard to make out what he says, no mater how engaging.",
                "strengths: topics were very interesting and the readings weren't too long so I felt like I had enough time to really dig deep into the material\r\n\r\nweaknesses: too much cgsc and not enough philosophy",
                "I thought the course topics were very interesting but I thought the concepts could have been looked at with more depth",
                "Strengths: Most readings were very interesting, and I learned and reflected much about these topics. Although it was quiet sometimes, discussion sections were fine and I learned something from my peers.\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Knobe rarely talks into the microphone, so his voice does not get amplified in a lecture hall of 100+ students. I had to sit in the front row to hear him. Feedback was a bit delayed.",
                "I thought the course was structured fairly well. I do wish his slides had more content to follow because even when I was taking notes in class, if I missed something he said or couldn't hear him, it was hard to follow.",
                "Good variety in topics that are summarized well by the professor",
                "I think that there could have been more support set up when it came to studying for the midterm. I had to rely on study guides TFs only sent to their students, and I felt very unprepared for both the midterm and final.",
                "Strengths: Knobe is phenomenal. He lectures so clearly and straight-forwardly, there is no confusion on what he is trying to say. Plus, material is profound and engaging. \r\nWeaknesses: wish the lectures were recorded, it was difficult to hear Knobe most of the time. I wrote a psychology experiment proposal for my second paper, but had little guidance on how to structure it. Discussion sections varied greatly depending on TF.",
                "Good mix of philosophy and psychology \r\nA variety of topics\r\n\r\nToo many recaps from previous classes at the start of the lecture \r\nA bit too easy\r\nSlides werent that helpful",
                "The course utilized very interesting readings and discussion sections were well organized to facilitate better understanding  and further discussion about the readings. The exams of the course were hard to prepare for because they were application based questions and therefore led to slightly poor results.",
                "this class was great! The only weakness was that the philosophy that was taught was very vague and not in depth since the focus of this class is to determine how to apply this type of philosophy to our lives. Overall great course",
                "The lecture slides were a bit confusing when going back through and studying them, so perhaps fewer pictures and more words would be helpful.",
                "Strength - interesting content! good balance of philosophy and psych. manageable readings. manageable exams and papers! all cool info. \r\nWeakenss - prof talks really fast and just kinda jumps around in lecture so things weren't always super clear?",
                "strengths- it was engaging and I liked the setup of the course material (how it was divided into units)\r\nweaknesses- it was difficult to hear the instructor during the lectures, and the slides did not have a lot of information on them so it was difficult to understand the material if you missed class",
                "Very good in general. I hope Professor Knobe can hold the mic more constant to himself so the volume does not fluctuate.",
                "Strengths: very engaging lectures, light workload (while still maintaining a sense of involvement with the class throughout the semester). Weakness: Prof Knobe can be a bit difficult to hear sometimes, but its not really a problem as long as everyone in the lecture hall is staying quiet."

            "comments": [
                "Yes! This was one of my favorite lecture classes with engaging topics and my sections were really enjoyable and interesting.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in psychology. I am interested in philosophy, and I found myself wishing we discussed the philosophy side of things a bit more. Regardless, it was interesting to learn a bit about psychology and psychological experiments/research through the class. Have I gained any perspective on human nature? Maybe; it would be a lie to say that this class didn't get me to think about human nature, particularly my own nature, but I wouldn't say I ever felt like I learned or studied something incredibly profound or inspiring.",
                "The subject matter is incredibly interesting. you will get both the psychological and philosophical perspectives to many important issues. The daily workload for this course is very low, because all you have to do each week is to do weekly reading responses. However, during the middle of the term and end of the term be prepared to be overwhelmed with work because there is both a paper and an exam for both the midterm and the final. This made the class feel oddly overwhelmed with work during these times of the year.",
                "Yes, the work is manageable and the content interesting if you enjoy philosophy and psychology. The lectures do a really good job of explaining the readings and connecting them to each other and to other philosophical/psychological themes.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this, especially to someone looking to get outside of the subjects they typically take classes in. It makes you think about the people in some new ways, and gives you some basic understandings of both psych and philosophy.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student looking to gain insight into the existing research within experimental philosophy, a widely applicable field. Josh Knobe is an incredible pioneer in the field and shares his enthusiasm and intellect perfectly within this course. It's not too much work, provided that you stay on top of the (relatively short) readings, with enough checkpoints for constant understanding and intermittent reinforcement of key concepts.",
                "It is a good introductory class for people outside of the major. The material is interesting but does not go very in-depth, so it really just depends on what you are looking to get out of the course. As a STEM major, this was an easy course that provided an introduction to how philosophy interacts with empirical research.",
                "yeah, its fun",
                "Maybe; classic Yale philosophy class but in the end its just people resynthesizing information without grappling with their positionality",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone as it makes people engage critically with important questions and allows you to see others perspectives on these issues.",
                "Absolutely! This was a super interesting philosophical and psychological survey. I've enjoyed every bit of each lecture, and the topics we talked about were extremely thought-provoking.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this to students who want to get a broad overview of popular topics discussed in philosophy and what psychology says about various philosophical theories. However, as a philosophy major who has already had exposure to most of the texts read in this class, I found it frustrating that we only scratched the surface of most topics. That being said, I think it's a great course to take for someone who has not taken a philosophy class before.",
                "Probably, yes. Lectures were interesting enough but it was sometimes difficult to see the direct connection between the philosophy side and the psychology side.",
                "Yes. It was great to finally learn about the intersection of psychology and philosophy (two fascinating fields that really should be talking to each other more) and Professor Knobe is great.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! Take this course if you are thinking of going into Cog Sci, but feel like you lack the foundations in philosophy, as this course goes over the most famous and basic philosophers. I would say that this course is for those who are interested in phil but are not thinking of majoring in phil (compared to intro courses like ancient/modern phil sequence).",
                "yup fun class",
                "Absolutely. This course combined philosophy and psychology in such a seamless and intellectually exciting way. I feel enriched both academically and in my day to day life after taking this course.",
                "Yes. The material was very interesting. I am pre-med, but thought this class was really cool. It was also my first philosophy/psych class at Yale.",
                "Yes. It tackles many interesting topics in philosophy from the classic philosophical perspective and then examines these ideas under the context of modern psychology. The readings are mostly well chosen and interesting, and you get the chance to develop your own ideas through the two course papers.",
                "Yes. If you are looking for a lighter course that can still intellectually stimulate you, I recommend this course.",
                "Yes. This was a great class to break up a STEM heavy courseload.",
                "Yes but there didnt need to be two exams and two papers",
                "Absolutely, it was fascinating and something that keeps coming up in my dinner conversations.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if you are ready to sit in the front rows every lecture, ask questions, and make contributions in section.",
                "Only if theyre interested in philosophy",
                "Yes, especially if you are a pertinent major this course is a great well taught course.",
                "Yes, take it credit d though.",
                "Yes, but only if they have no prior knowledge of philosophy. Otherwise this course is a waste of time",
                "Yes, on a normal semester with no difficult changes with TA's",
                "Yes I would if you are interested in experimental philosophy",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who's looking to learn more about how philosophical views on human nature hold up when we consider scientific research in the areas of psychology/cognitive science.",
                "Yes I would and have recommended this course to students who are interested in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science.",
                "Yes, very manageable workload and very interesting content.",
                "Yes! Even if you are a beginner to Philosophy/Psychology (as I was). Professor Knobe is excellent, and the course covers a lot of basics in the areas of Happiness, Altruism, Virtue, Morality, and Belief in God. We study the works of many influential philosophers like Aristotle, Plato, Descartes, Marx, etc. We also learn to write Philosophy papers. The weekly reading responses are low stakes (you don't need to spend more than 10 minutes writing them, as per the syllabus). The 2 papers over the semester can be long (6-9 pages) but I found I could do them pretty quickly if I was passionate about my topic. I got away without doing 80% of the readings in the class, but you definitely need to be familiar with what each author is saying (because the exams have questions where you are given a passage and have to identify the author). That being said, I wouldn't avoid the course because of this if you don't like doing readings - it is definitely manageable to do well without doing them.",
                "I would recommend this class to any student interested in both (or either) philosophy or psychology. I came into this class with little to no exposure to college-level philosophy, and this class provided an easy yet not boiled down introduction to some of the world's great thinkers. Do remember that the goal of the course (imo) isn't to read the most of these texts, but to extract their primary argument and examine their validity for us, in real life. I found that project very compelling by the end of the class, particularly because of the emphasis on psychology being applied in equal doses to find answers to the difficult questions we were asking. However, anyone taking this class should consider that there are 2 6-8 page papers of solid philosophy/psychology arguments as well as two tricky-ish exams. The latter are navigable if you know the material well and attend lectures but are definitely on the tougher side (albeit with a curve.)",
                "Yes",
                "Yes",
                "no, I really did not enjoy this class. I wish this course were more engaging, but any excitement I had for this class faded quickly. I thought the lectures were uninspiring, the readings hit or miss and the overall themes of the class uninteresting. However, I also felt like an outlier in this respect as everyone else in the class seemed to enjoy it. Just be warned, if the first couple of lectures don't blow you away in the way you were expecting based on the authors and the readings and the topics covered, it doesn't get better.",
                "Yes! Its a great introductory philosophy course that not only encompasses a lot of diversity and breadth in readings (while still being focused) but also encompasses a lot of takeaways that you can apply to your own life.",
                "Yes yes! Highly recommend. This course was an amazing blend of psychology and philosophy! The lectures were engaging and the texts were wide-ranging.",
                "yes, it was a great intro to philosophy",
                "Yes 100%",
                "Yes! This is the first Phil/PSYC class Ive taken at Yale and I think its a pretty good survey course to see if you like the field.",
                "Would definitely recommend! Specially if you havent taken an intro psychology or philosophy course before, this one goes into depth of certain topics in psychology and the works of well known philosophers. Makes you think a lot about life!",
                "YES! This was my favorite class at Yale so far. If you are interested in Psychology AND Philosophy, this is the class for you. Josh does a great job relating the two and showing us how modern research can answer a thousand year old questions. You really come out with a deep understanding of Human Nature and why we are the way we are/think the way we do.",
                "only if they've never taken philosophy before",
                "Yes, I'd reccomend the course if they want an introduction to differing perspectives of how to live life. If they want something that's more in depth, then this is not the course for them.",
                "Yes I found it very interesting and unique",
                "Yes, if you're interested in thinking about the big topics!",
                "Good introduction to philosophy and psyc but a bit boring/ repetitive if youre already somewhat familiar with the material",
                "I dont think I would. There are better philosophy courses you can take here. The Professor is wonderful, but this class just felt like busy work at times",
                "Yes, relatable and engaging content applicable to anyone, plus Knobe explains things so clearly. Great course, highly recommend.",
                "Yes, for people who know little regarding the discussed topics and want a general overview of them, not really for anyone who already has some knowledge in these areas",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I found what was taught in the course to be very interesting and a valuable way to think about different topics.",
                "yes this class was definitely my most interesting class of the semester. I recommend this course to everyone even if you dont know philosophy",
                "Yes, especially as a beginning psych or philosophy class. I found it was very helpful to have a background in psychology for understanding the philosophy, but I think it is very accessible without it.",
                "Yes! Incredibly well taught class with great TAs, and, most importantly, an incredibly interesting curriculum which puts contemporary cognitive science in conversation with both ancient and modern philosophy. Great class!",
                "Yes if you want a cool class that integrates Philosophy (theory) and Psych (more empirical studies) regarding kindness and altruism and morality and belief in God. It was cool concepts! And also not too much work, as in 2 exams were totally fine, and papers were long 7-9 pages, but cool concepts so not hard to write",
                "Yes, because the workload was manageable and the class was interesting.",
                "Yes, it is very fundamental yet eye-opening for non-philosophy major students. A very important cornerstone to humanity topics.",
                "Yes I would. I bring up topics from this class in many of my day-to-day conversations. This class was great for me as a STEM student, since the philosophical conversations were always taking place along side relevant scientific studies. I took this as an easier, yet interesting, distribution requirement, and it was exactly that."
