This show is the cream and crop of all crime shows on television because it is the most authentic. It doesnt show the olive and investigators solving every single case they get- in fact, its the opposite. It shows corruption. It shows the misuse of authority. It doesnt make the public view the criminal justice and policing systems in a God-complex manor; in fact- its the opposite.",

                "Once again, The Wire is great. I liked my TF and our section\r\n\r\nThe class is terribly organized. We learn almost nothing of substance and there is little or no reason to go to lecture. And, indeed, even if you did want to go to lecture, 10% of the time you couldn't because it was cancelled. I am actually astonished by how many class sessions were cancelled or not held this year. I have never before taken a course where upwards of 5 class sessions were cancelled and the professor did not even attempt to make them up. But truly, it did not affect the class because we learned absolutely nothing. \r\n\r\nThis class being allowed to run makes me question the oversight provided by this university.",
                "Inconsistent grading",
                "I think the concept for this course is incredibly strong, it is wonderful to apply the social science research and reasoning concepts I've learned to this show, and to learn more about Baltimore through this depiction. I do wish we talked about the show itself more, especially in lectures. Lecture content felt a little detached from the content of the show",
                "Very well organized syllabus, concepts are explained thoroughly in class",
                "This course has a great structure through the show The Wire. The approach to analyzing the show was excellent, as was Professor Harris' teaching and knowledge of the course material. The only area for improvement would probably be in the course readings. Given the time commitment from the show, there were weeks that could have perhaps benefited from one less reading that week.",
                "The show is great. Section was great. Assignments were fair and manageable. Lecture was horrible  so obvious that Harris just reads from a reused script and doesnt actively think about the connection of social science to the specific scenes of the show.",
                "The main way I think this course could be improved is changing the lecture content.  It felt like there was a missing link between the lectures and the show. The lectures talked about broad concepts like the War on Drugs, but we never dug into how The Wire depicts the War on Drugs and the ways in which these depictions were accurate or not. It almost felt like The Wire was treated as a documentary demonstrating concepts like the War on Drugs and Mass Incarceration, but of course, the show is a dramatization, so I was always let wondering about how accurately the show reflected real-life dynamics, especially with regards to police department culture. There is so much rich content in The Wire to discuss, so it was disappointing that the lectures did not really engage with the show.",
                "This class has a lot of weaknesses.\r\n\r\nLectures were incredibly weak and we barely learned anything. We covered the same topics multiple times, and we moved so slowly that it was almost impossible to pay attention. There are so many other topics that we could have covered- there was no reason that we had to talk about so few topics throughout the entire class. Talk about the politics of education and the problems with our modern education system! Talk explicitly about police corruption! We could have covered homelessness and legal protections (or lack thereof) there. We could have tied New Haven city politics into it! There are so many topics that could have been considered related to the Wire. The lectures have no citations that aren't the few assigned readings, and so we get no breadth of knowledge. I hardly know what I even learned. There are so many interesting topics in city politics and so few were even covered. \r\n\r\nWe should NOT be watching all five seasons of The Wire. Making other seasons optional? Amazing! Cutting filler episodes and having us read summaries or watch summarized episodes on Youtube? Much better? Watching FIVE SEASONS of The Wire means watching 6+ HOURS of TV a week, on top of readings and podcast episodes. I would have rather had that many readings. \r\n\r\nThe assignments were also poorly designed. The pop quizzes were not enjoyable. I don't even really mind pop quizzes that much! However, they felt POINTLESS. We had one where we had to design a theoretical political science study based on The Wire, which was only difficult because THE WIRE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH GOOD EXAMPLES TO COVER. Any of us could have come up with a million non-Wire related examples. We shouldn't be treated like middle schoolers. This isn't even a complete intro class!! Cover study design in ten minutes and move on- we've understood the scientific method since we were kids. Some other assignments were timed when they really shouldn't have been. They would have been much better when treated like Psets or short essays- give us a due date, but don't rush us to write down whatever we can find in a short period of time. No one enjoys timed essays and few people do good work during them. The final essay was also terrible to write! We had to pick one group of characters from The Wire and explain how two social science topics covered in class would help them achieve a goal. However, we HARDLY COVERED ANY SOCIAL SCIENCE TOPICS IN CLASS THAT WOULD EVEN BE RELEVANT. We even made a list of them in Section and there were VERY, VERY FEW. This made it extremely difficult to create a topic for the essay, and no one I talked to was happy about the essay that they did write. This felt like a high school class in a bad way. \r\n\r\nIn short, this class would need to be entirely restructured to be an enjoyable, useful course for any students to take.",
                "Strengths: Interesting topics, interesting class format (framed by a famous tv show), good selection of readings \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: High workload (too many episodes per week) made it hard to keep the class engaged, lectures were also unorganized at times",
                "The course is generally quite strong. The wire itself is great, and watching the show is made more interesting by thinking about the concepts from class. I thought that lectures were quite good as well, but maybe could have been more engaging. I think that one way this could be improved is if there was a more narrative twist on some of the political science concepts that felt a little bit dry at times.",
                "I would say that one of the weaknesses of this course is that we have so many readings to complete on top of watching 4-5 hour long  episodes while attending lecture and discussion. It would be better if maybe there was 1 reading that was assigned per lesson because we have to write summaries of each episode and lead a discussion. Since watching the show alone is such a time commitment itself, I wish there was a way to even things out more.",
                "Strengths: The Wire is a phenomenal show and the final essay encourages students to think deeply about the themes in the show and relate them to social science concepts. \r\nWeaknesses: The structure of the class and lectures. I found that the lectures often summarized the events from the show and the readings, which took away from time where we could discuss the social science concepts and disincentivized students from doing the work outside of class. With this additional time, the lectures could have talked about a new application of the topics from the readings or show. A few ideas I had would be to discuss events from the Wire that happened in real life in Baltimore or other cities, how national policy intersects with local policy, what factors determine childrens outcomes, the history of drug organizations, media standards and the changing role of the media, and how the War on Drugs has impacted U.S. policy internationally.",
                "Strengths: the show is amazing  Id recommend it regardless of whether you take the class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures are somewhat boring, redundant, and unhelpful",
                "The show is very interesting, and I liked watching TV for my homework. The midterm and the final were very reasonable, and my section really helped clarify concepts. At times, the readings and episodes combined were a little overwhelming. Lectures are easy to follow.",
                "A strength of the course is how academic material is introduced through the show which makes it more engaging. The course could be improved by having the class and sections meet more regularly which would have made me feel more engaged with it. Sometimes, we moved through units quickly and it would have been nice to think about some material more in-depth.",
                "Its a little hard to keep up with the episodes if you fall behind, but Professor Harris is a gem!",
                "Weaknesses: Lots of homework, unannounced quizzes, easy to fall behind, long final essay\r\nStrengths: Easy/straightforward midterm, two unannounced quizzes dropped, you'll likely know a good amount of people taking the course",
                "The course was great there were no weaknesses and everything was reasonable.",
                "I thought that there were too many readings/episodes assigned per class which often lefts students (I talked to many) picking between either watching the show or doing the readings. I think that if the work per day was more feasible, there would have been higher levels of engagement.",

                "Once again, really enjoyed the Wire. \r\n\r\nThis class is an utter gut. The professor knows that  her exact words about the final assignment were \"not to be ambitious with it.\" If you want that, then take this. If you are hoping to learn anything at all, probably avoid.",
                "I think this was a great class to learn new things and watch this show in an interesting context, I will warn that I wasn't prepared for the energy that watching the entire show over the course of the semester took out of me- I thought watching the episodes every week would be easier than it was but 5-6 hours of the show a week just ended up being more time consuming than I thought",
                "yes!",
                "Yes. You just have to be able/willing to watch a lot of tv for homework.",

                "I would but with caveats. I think there are two reasons to take the class. First, The Wire is an incredible show, and it's a great opportunity to watch it and analyze it in detail and second, I think the topics related to the realities of the American city are really interesting and important. That being said, watching the entirety of The Wire in one semester is a crazy time commitment, so you have to be ready for it. Watching TV as homework is obviously nice, but be prepared to watch an average of 5 hours a week and do try to take it with at least one friend you can watch the episodes with. Also, I think the atmosphere in the classroom at times felt dry. I'm not even sure if that's Professor Harris's fault, if it was the lecture space, or if it's the result of the collective attitudes of the students in the class, but it's something to keep in mind.",
                "No",

                "Yes! If youre able to find a good TF and commit to actually watching the show its great.",
                "Probably not. The course is a very interesting concept but engagement was very low.",
                "I would not recommend this course for someone who has taken many political science classes or classes on segregation, the war on drugs, policing, or other issues. As someone who already had background and interest in these topics, I found the lectures quite dull-- they are really introductory, and not aimed at someone wanting a deep dive. Also, if you're interested in dissecting the show and understanding the ways in which its depictions are accurate or not so much, I would prepare to be disappointed. The class content is really just an introduction to social science-- it doesn't engage meaningfully with the show. Overall, I would only recommend this class if you are interested in watching a good show and not really getting much out of the rest of the class.",
                "Unless you enjoy spending 6+ hours a week watching one TV show, on top of mandatory readings and podcast episodes, I would ABSOLUTELY NOT recommend you take this class. The sheer time commitment for this class is ridiculous. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, I will say that I have learned very little. We cover very few actual political science topics. We spend TWO CLASSES covering how we might prove causality. I feel like I spent most of the class completely zoned out- there is very, very little substance in every actual lecture. We only covered the readings in lecture that were assigned, and her statements and slides had no citations, so you just have to take her at her word about the truth of her lessons.\r\n\r\nThe assignments are also often nonsensical or hardly related to the class. The final essay is TERRIBLE, as we did literally did not cover enough topics in class to even consider writing a good essay. We also had to cite her lectures in or essay- even though there was hardly anything to cite, as her powerpoints had very little on them and her lectures did not have much to add to them. There are POP QUIZZES/ASSIGNMENTS that are worth a SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF YOUR GRADE and they BARELY FEEL RELEVANT TO THE CLASS. \r\n\r\nThe exam was also extremely unfair towards some students. There were at least two versions of the exam, and the amount of time and effort that it took to answer the questions on one of the exams was FAR GREATER than the other, after chatting with other students about what questions they had. \r\n\r\nI have taken TV show-related courses before in the past and absolutely loved them. This was not one of them. We should not have watched ALL FIVE SEASONS OF THE WIRE IN ONE SEMESTER. Two seasons or three seasons would have made this a much better, more focused class. We even could have watched summarized seasons on Youtube or had assigned summaries or SOMETHING for what seasons or episodes we would miss. Watching all five seasons made this class incredibly disjointed and made the workload much larger than it needed to be. Was the work hard? No. However, it was SO MUCH WORK. \r\n\r\nUnless you absolutely love The Wire and feel like learning absolutely nothing and doing nonsense assignments sounds fun to you, do not take this class. Don't even take it as a GUT. Not worth it.",
                "Yes! It has a light course load. The material is engaging and it's a good show.",
                "I was excited to take this course due to its description but was somewhat disappointed after taking it. While the class' concept is interesting, learning about the Baltimore drug scene and the politics of an American city by watching The Wire, I felt like lectures were not as engaging and interesting as they could have been. Nonetheless,  it is a good elective course for the PoliSci major (as well as many others), but you may want to choose a smaller seminar if you wish to have more in-class engagement. However, the readings were interesting and it was clear that Professor Harris was very informed and passionate about the subjects discussed.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course. The show is great, and thinking about it in terms of social science ideas is a fun way to get into it.",
                "I have recommended this course to another student already! How many times will I have to take courses where its required to watch a whole tv show? It can get exhausting, but it is still a fun element that contributes to this courses uniqueness.",
                "I would recommend this course because I learned a lot about how The Wire is not only a great show but can be used as a microscope in a scientific sense to study American cities.",
                "Id recommend the show, not the course",
                "Yes but just make sure to keep up with the show and skim readings",
                "Yes!!! The show was very interesting, and the lectures were straight-forward.",
                "I think it's a great chance to learn more about the show and is good if you want an intro to social science that is fun. But if you're serious about the material, it can be frustrating.",
                "Yes, easy social science class if you're naturally good at social science. I'm not sure that I would recommend this course to someone who's not good at social sciences unless they're really interested in the show.",
                "Yes if you want a class that has no work but a few larger assignments.",
                "Yes, interesting and good course",
                "Absolutely, it is fun and challenging and necessary to understand human society.",
                "Watch The Wire before taking the class and see if you like it. If you think it's interesting, go for it. If you don't, then you'll probably want to skip this course, it's not as easy as you might anticipate it to be."
