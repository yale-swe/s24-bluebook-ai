That being said, a discussion section or some sort of recurring office hours would have been really nice.",
                "Professor Hammes-Schiffer makes the content digestible, but less so than the first half of the course. While her lecture slides were helpful and outlined all the derivations, I think it would have been more helpful to have worked through those derivations on the chalkboard in class, rather than jus show them on the screen.",
                "The weakness is the method of delivery of information: using slides. I believe you cannot learn any math-heavy course by passively looking at the final results of the derivations; you have to go through them simultaneously with the instructor, who derives things on a blackboard.",

It goes into a little more depth at the end of the semester on electron spin and the resulting theories than CHEM 333, so you're able to see very clearly how the concepts you learn in pchem II and quantum play out in other realms of chemistry.",
