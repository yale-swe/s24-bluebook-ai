                "This course is extremely well-taught. There is just the right amount of background review for each topic that makes it accessible, but the pace and content are challenging. This has been one of my favorite courses, and Dr. Bennett is the highlight of the course.",
                "This course needs to be modernized. First, it should be offered in Python. Second, WAY too much time is spent doing computational cost calculations on the board and on problem sets. We were not using big-O notation and instead tediously counting every addition, multiplication, or function evaluation; for an \"applied\" course, this was completely useless! Instead, teach us to time-test our code using more or less efficient methods! There should also be 2-fewer problem sets; having 1 due the Tuesday after Thanksgiving as well as the Tuesday of reading week is a little much; even though it's technically within the academic guidelines, it took up time and mental space during Thanksgiving break and is not in the spirit of these rules.\r\n\r\nThe homework is also graded strangely; the problems are rather easy but they knit-pick points for things that are not at the heart of the problem. I'd prefer harder problems with grading that correlates more closely with understanding than going to office hours and learning the tiny details you need to include to get full credit. Also far too much time copy-and-pasting a code's output (give us a required format and make an autograder!!!).\r\n\r\nNone of this is to say Professor Bennett is not amazing; she is, and is one of the reasons I took this course. She cares about her students and their learning. However, I see this as an essential course for modern engineers, and one of the few courses that could make small changes for large value improvements.",
                "Strengths: the instructor and the coding assignments. The content is interesting but can be a little slow towards the end. The exams are hard but fair\r\nWeaknesses: Explores interesting methods but it is not the cutting edge. Would be more interesting going deeper into individual ideas.",
                "Strengths: the professor (Prof. Bennett) and the organization of the course. It is extremely well organized, and the Canvas page is feature complete, with class recordings, assignments, grades, files, etc all on there and easy to access. Pset and exam expectations were clear and the course overall was very well structured. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the psets were a bit tedious and repetitive, and many of the parts had small details within the instructions that were not hard to miss and get a couple points here and there off.",
                "Great course, no notes",
                "The lectures were very organized and even though most of the material was new to us it was not difficult to start to learn because of the way the material was presented."

                "Yes, if taught by Prof. Bennett. It is a really interesting course and very fair, and Prof. Bennett is really so good at teaching it. She is great during lecture and office hours and the small class size really facilitates learning the material well. She is kind and helpful and very knowledgable about the material and knows exactly how to convey it so everyone understands. The psets were tough and sometimes tedious but fair, but beware the the exams are pretty difficult yet the course is graded fairly to accommodate for that.",
