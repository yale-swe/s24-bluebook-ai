                "Strengths: Dr. Gandhi. She is a fountain of knowledge about literally everything! But she is also very kind and understanding, and adjusted the course to fit the moment during the strains of COVID. The course and readings were very interesting. Her mini-lectures on the topics were VERY helpful, especially with the confusing bits at the beginning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The beginning of the class was a bit scary for someone with no background since many of the concepts and words were very new. But it quickly got less intimidating, especially as we moved forward in time. Also the mini-lectures really helped.",

However, I am neither and I loved the class. Really important stuff to learn about, and the professor made it an even stronger class. Dr. Gandhi rocks! This is an important topic and everyone should have a grasp about what's happening to \"The World's Largest Democracy.\" It's scary.",

Dr. Gandhi is so knowledgeable and did a fantastic job of keeping student engagement and participation high, even in a virtual format. All readings and assignments were obviously selected with care to make the most of our time. The midterm and final are very open-ended so you can explore whatever facets of the topic most interest you."
