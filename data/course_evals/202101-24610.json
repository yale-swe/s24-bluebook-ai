                "I developed fantastic presenting skills, responding skills and critical thinking skills in taking this class. It allowed me to be academic about things I never thought would fall under that category. I learnt how to lead a class discussion and how to slowly chip away at big ideas. I thoroughly enjoyed this class, it has been one of the most productive of my time at Yale. If Yale teaches you how think, how to learn and how to apply external concepts to your own personal experiences and perspective; then this is absolutely a Yale course. My favourite class in all 4 years here.",

                "This class explored post-war non-religious spirituality -- \"the hip\" -- as can be found in counterculture movements from the Beats and the Hippies, to the Acid Churchgoers and the Discordians. We learned a how to identify commonalities and distinctions between all these movements. Besides a bunch of knowledge on cultural movements I did not know existed, this class gave me a foundation for studying spirituality, esotericism, fringe reactions, and American identities. Prof. Greer truly cares about helping one grow as a writer, academic, student, etc. This class definitely makes the academic setting inspiring in a way very few classes can."

Professor Greer is doing important work and every students input feels valuable. This is the best class I have taken in my four years here, I wish I could take it again. Truly 17\/10.",

Professor Greer cultivates a culture of inclusivity and growth during class. I am so thankful for this class and the experiences I have gained and information that will stay with me forever.",

Some of the material is niche -- after all, it includes esoteric spiritualities and cults -- but all of its worth learning about, no matter how weird it may seem at first. I know it took this course because I was interested in Beat and Hippy literature as well as a theorization of counterculture. I definitely got this and more."
