    "I developed a deeper sense of confidence in my writing. Through the discussions and workshops, I received invaluable feedback which I can say with certainty, allowed me to improve my skills.",
    "I developed both my skills as a writer and my skills of analysis of the writing of professionals and peers.",
    "I learned a lot about expressing myself and how to craft pieces pf personal writing.",
    "While my critical reading improved in this course, the most obvious impact was my writing. The careful attention the class and the instructor gave to the revision process, through thorough workshops and extensive feedback helped make my reading easier to understand, more concise, and more engaging."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the pacing and the content of this course. My only suggestion would be that some of the writing we read was not a representation of a response to the prompts, especially with the profile of a teacher piece.",
    "Strengths: Great subject--learning how to write essays.\r\nWeaknesses: More diverse reading  (outside of the New Yorker and New York Times) could have been appreciated",
    "The course really allowed me to reflect on myself in a creative and expressive manner. The instruction time did not necessarily help or correlate with the assignments however.",
    "The seminar-style was very conducive to analyzing the texts and facilitating group workshops for writing. Overall, it is hard to identify any major weaknesses. The one thing I might say is that sometimes the readings varied significantly in length and style, and while there was a general theme (i.e. personal essay, opinion pieces), sometimes it was hard to see how the pieces related to each other and the broader lessons we were supposed to take away from the collective reading; this in turn I think occasionally worsened our engagement with these texts. But again, this is a minor thing I noticed."

   "comments": [
    "Honestly, yes. You will spend at least one day a week stressing about submitting either the rough draft or the revision due for the unit. However, the level of discussion and engagement between the teacher and students more than makeup for it. This class was pretty much the only one I fully enjoyed this semester and will continue to sing its praises until the day graduate.",
    "This is an excellent English class both for those who already love writing and those who dont! The readings are all very approachable and applicable to modern life, but also deeply meaningful.",
    "YES if you are interested in the art of writing essays. I did not need this course for my writing credits and enjoyed very much making each essay personal and meaningful to me.",
    "I would, English 120 is an amazing course, especially for STEM majors.",
    "Yes, this course is incredible.",
    "Yes, very much so. I think the writing done in this course has more of a practical benefit, and the readings helped me become a more cultured person. While I think this class is probably more useful for younger students, I would recommend this class."
