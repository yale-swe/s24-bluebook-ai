    "This course allowed me to gain a better understanding of contemporary ballet and the history of American ballet. It also allowed me think more strategically about how the art of ballet must be presented in order to ensure preservation of the past as well as development in the future. It was pretty awesome that we had the opportunity to actually dance in a studio during our meeting times, and we had the opportunity to learn the choreography of many incredible pieces!",
    "I learned a lot of important repertoire, how to write about dance, and practiced choreographing.  There were amazing opportunities to work with professional dancers who have actually danced these roles.",
    "This class provides an overview of the New York City Ballet's repertory from Balanchine and Robbins to Wheeldon and Peck. Through readings, viewings, and live instruction by the best dancers in the industry today, students gain a new understanding of and appreciation for ballet today.",
    "Learned the history behind various ballets and their choreographers. Learned how to translate things we read in our text into tangible improvements in our dancing. We had the opportunity to learn from some of the best professional dancers in the world.",
    "I learned so much about ballet at NYCB both in theory and practice.",
    "Learned repertoire that I previously did not know! Was able to gain insight on what the dance world is really like and how productions are made."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: It is pretty rare that you are able to find such a physically engaging course!! We got to learn from an incredible professor as well as guests from the New York City Ballet, and I think its just a very unique experience overall. The course is well organized and feedback is clear.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Really none that I can think of!",
    "The class was so strong because of the small class size and amazing opportunities to see NYCB and work with professional dancers.  It was also so nice to be able to go to a class that wasn't in a traditional classroom setting and think and move in different ways.  I can't think of any weaknesses!",
    "The course was well organized and the guests were incredible. This opportunity is so rare, and I loved every second of it.",
    "This course has no weaknesses  It is truly the greatest class I have ever taken. Professor Ulbricht creates a supportive environment that is all about learning together. This class is highly engaging and the reading always correlates to exactly what we are learning in the studio. All of the papers stretched us to think about dance through a multidisciplinary lens.",
    "This course was incredible! It was so well designed and Daniel was wonderful!",
    "AMAZING course! Daniel is the best and I learned so much through the experience of actual dancers from the New York City Ballet. We would read about productions and different pieces, but having people who have physically danced and lived the parts made it all different. Plus Daniel was able to secure us tickets to go to NYC and see a live performance at the Lincoln Center."

   "comments": [
    "YES!!! Anyone who has taken a ballet class and is interested in ballet should take this course - it was honestly the highlight of my week every week, and being able to move away from a desk and lecture and just be able to dance was so nice. The atmosphere is very supportive, and the workload is extremely reasonable (one midterm paper and one final paper along with weekly reading responses and some projects in which you get to choreograph a piece yourself!)",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU ARE A DANCER! Amazing",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course!  I loved just being able to dance, and I thought our assignments were really interesting.  I discovered that I really like writing and reading about dance, and I felt like I also learned so much dance history.  I can contextualize famous works.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course. Although it is geared towards students with a dance background, I think anyone can learn a lot from this course. Professor Ulbricht is an excellent instructor. He will completely change your idea of ballet whether it is fully formed or entirely blank. The guests are beautiful dancers and each have their own wisdom to impart. Overall, this class is a dream, and I think everyone who has the opportunity should take it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to any dancers who want to put context behind the ballets they have learned about before. This class will make you think about dance in a very different way and will teach you so much dance history.",
    "Yes!! This was an INCREDIBLE course. It was not too hard work wise and yet I still learned SO much. This is how a class should be! I loved this course so much!",
    "YES! If you can take it seriously take it. This is among the best classes I have taken at Yale."
