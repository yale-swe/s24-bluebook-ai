I assume that how much you get out of the course will depend to some extent on the professor that you work with; I was lucky to take the course with Professor O'Dea, who's incredibly knowledgeable, explains things very clearly, and was committed to making sure I was learning and getting something out of the experience.",
                "Absolutely. If you're interesting in finance, particularly early stage investing, this is a must take course. I've learned so much about the industry and about myself through Professor Schmertzler. It 100% will make me better as I start work.",
