                "The strength of this class was in the lesson structure and teaching delivery. The class was structured extremely well to promote our learning, while class and our sensei incorporated what we learned for practice.",
                "Very fast-paced, too much content in too little time",
                "Strengths - the instructor was very engaging in terms of content and props to keep the class entertained. The content of the course is also structured in a way that we reach a level of adequate fluency. The videos accompanying the books are also very helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - initially it's very fast-paced. There should be more practice of the characters initially so that we don't forget them when we read Japanese.",
                "Strengths are rigidities testing to ensure understanding and constant practice makes the topic easy to learn. No weaknesses",
                "I think this course was wonderful and I am really glad that I took JAPN110 this semester.\r\nProf. Yamaguchi was very nice, professional and friendly. Classmates were nice, kind, caring and interesting. The course was intense but well-designed. \r\nWe learned a lot of new vocabularies, grammer and Kanji. We went back from time to time to review all the things we learned before. Many different methods were used during the course. We watched videos, did presentations and dialogues, took quizs and exams and also had a change to free talk during weekly clinics. I can tell that how many efforts were put into arranging this course.",
                "The strengths of the course include the small class size, easy-to-use textbook, and frequent collaboration with peers. These all help in quickly learning the new grammar and vocabulary. The course, however, moved too quickly for us to really review past material, which I think my hurt long-term aquisition. There was virtually no time between projects\/exams\/oral presentations to actually digest the new information. Additionally, there was very little engagement with Japanese culture and history outside of isolated assignments.",
                "-the pace of the course can be slowed down a bit\r\n-the textbook is a great resource and the videos",
                "strengths: large amount of in-class oral practices; appropriate amount of homework\r\nweakness: not enough practice of listening"

                "I think I would.\r\nThe course was interesting. After one semester, I learned to talk about myself, my family, my favorite city, colors, transportation, schedule, university life and so on. I really feel the sense of accomplishment because I can tell that I made a lot visible progress step by step throughout this course.\r\nMany special arrangements were made to help everyone catch-up. We watched videos, did presentations and dialogues, took quizzes and exams and also had a change to free talk during weekly clinics. \r\nProf. Yamaguchi was very nice, professional and friendly. Classmates were also nice and supportive.\r\nBut on the other hand, this course was intense. We met everyday. We had homework almost everyday. And there were 2 to 3 quizzes weekly. So I would say that people need to think twice whether they really want to put in efforts before choosing this course.",
                "I wouldn't reccomend this course solely on the basis of the workload. This course requires so much in terms of daily assignments and weekly quizes that it is difficult to manage work for other courses, let alone maintain a health work-life balance. I would strongly advise against underclassmen taking this course for this reason.",
                "Yes. It is a really great course that a student can use to start learning Japanese.",
                "Yes."
