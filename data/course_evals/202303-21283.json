A lot of the syllabus is tailored to fit between various themes which change from class to class, but at times the central connecting idea--the importance of tradition--seemed secondary to the overall course flow. This phenomenon perhaps arose because tradition gets interpreted and defined differently depending on the particular scholarly history in question or the particular lens of analysis being employed in class that day, but I felt that a clearer network or linking between the various class sessions may have clarified the class's trajectory.",
