            "comments": [
                "The strength is Sarah Demers. She worries so much about her students, it is so clear that learning is at the center of her goals. She emphasizes this throughout the semester, and is clear in all her practices, continuously asking for student feedback. Her grading policies are awesome, allowing to gain points back and learn by doing corrections in the midterms. The only weakness is that sometimes the psets are not doable with the content we learned in class. I understand that they are an opportunity to take concepts to an extra level, but I think at times, in the psets, we were working on things that had nothing to do with what he had talked about in class. I appreciated the problems that were hard but on concepts we had talked aboutwith enough effort and time you can do it, unlike some other questions that the TAs just had to give you the answer (for example problems requiring Taylor series, which we were not expected to know or understand but still was part of some problems). This is a minor weakness, however. The class is awesome and Sarah is the best professor ever!",
                "more practice not from textbook modules",
                "The course is the same workload each week and is taught in an engaging way. I wish the course moved a little quicker, lecture would get bogged down with student questions quite frequently, which often could have been answered after class individually.",
                "The psets are very difficult but they provide a lot of help in study hall. The practice psets for exams are super helpful.",
                "pretty well organized, sometimes felt like the time spent in class was wasted on things we weren't tested on",
                "Strengths: Professor Demers, amazing TA's (who were also comfortingly and encouragingly diverse in experiences and backgrounds), TRUE definition of a collaborative environment",
                "Strengths: Exams are straightforward if you do the review P-Set beforehand. There are in class quizzes, but they're always easy and there to just make sure that you're coming to class. Psets can be a little more challenging, but there are plenty of TA and prof office hours that provide help with Psets. Prof has a great personality and adds life to the class.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Class is less reliant on math if you're into that. Prof can sometimes make lecture a little confusing, but this wasn't really a major issue.",
                "Prof Demers and the TAs were incredible! Prof Demers has such enthusiasm when she lectures, and is more than happy to make time to help her students out. This was the most manageable, least stressful pre-med class, and was actually enjoyable for someone who previously did not like physics",
                "Strengths are the community feel of the classroom. Since it's not graded on a curve, you feel that you can ask your peers for help and they will help you. The office hours and TAs are also a huge strength.",
                "I found a large disconnect between lectures, problem sets, and exams. I felt like the lectures consisted a lot of proofs of equations, problem sets did not follow lectures or what was covered in the textbook modules, and then exam questions didn't correspond at all to problem set questions.",
                "The course was incredibly well-structured to allow for student learning. Having study halls and weekly quizzes made learning accesible and Prof. Demers was incredibly accommodating. Prof. Demers was a delightful instructor whom was heavily invested in breaking concepts down so as to ensure our learning. She made the class amazing.",
                "Strengths: fair exams, fair grading system (grades determined through raw scores, no competition with other students), a lot of TA office hours\/study halls, which are good for p sets \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Demers is sometimes overly excited about the material and doesn't explain stuff well during lecture. She is good at clarification though, so just ask during office hours or after class",
                "Strength is the Professor, study halls, and constant office hours. Weakness is the length of the psets, but I've heard the 181 psets are even worse.",
                "Strengths: Professor Demers! She is very understanding and caring, and she does an excellent job of explaining the material in an accessible way. The grading system in this class is very fair. Weaknesses: Not too manyI thought psets did not really reflect what we were supposed to know for exams, and while psets were sometimes arduous, I think the fact that they were difficult helped me solidify the material. I really appreciated when Professor Demers cut down on the number of questions assigned per pset halfway through the semester because it gave me the time to fully understand the problems I was doing, rather than sitting passively in office hours and trying to jot down everything without fully comprehending what I was writing.",
                "Strengths: Kind\/helpful instructor. Fun in-class demonstrations. Fair problem sets and exams. Well-written course modules.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Poorly taught. Material was covered at a snail's pace, with elementary concepts (i.e. how to compute a dot product) often taking up entire class periods. There was no value to showing up to class, as everything covered could be learned better & more quickly just by reading the course text\/modules.",
                "I did not enjoy the course modules that were adjacent to this course, as I think they were poorly designed and did not align well with the lectures (which I really enjoyed).",
                "Great structure and opportunities for grade improvement",
                "I really liked the connection of physics concepts to physiology as well as the demonstrations in class. The PSETs however sometimes felt very disconnected from what we learned in class.",
                "Strong course. Content was well taught, textbook was clear, many office hours with helpful TAs.",
                "Awesome",
                "strengths: there are many components to the final grade and therefore many opportunities to learn, the midterm examinations are a fair assessment of our knowledge of the content and we are given corrections, there are many resources such as office hours, study halls, and peer tutors\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the problem sets are quite difficult and time consuming but manageable with office hours and study halls",
                "Great course!",
                "The teacher was incredibly helpful and made the coarse approachable to those not comfortable with physics",
                "The modules could be more clear. Otherwise, I think Prof. Demers was a great teacher and I really enjoyed the course.",
                "I think this class is well structured. The weekly quizzes are fair and hold you accountable for going to lectures which are important for understanding the concepts. The tests were also a very fair representation of what we did in class and truly tested if we understood the material which I appreciate. I also think Professor Demer's is great at lecturing and following the pace of the students. I do not have any complaints.",
                "The strength of this course is the number of office hours and the support that the course provides. From the resources from TAs and other students, I was able to truly dive into the PSETs and work alongside peers and TAs to better and deepen my understanding of physics concepts. I believe that the review material was very helpful and guided me toward being successful on the exams, and the quizzes were also another wonderful tool to keep me on track with the course as well as provide additional study material for the exam. Overall, I believe the resources provided in this class were very helpful in ensuring that students do well. A weakness of the course would sometimes me the disconnect between homework and exams. I thought that the PSETs sometimes were a lot harder than the exam and the questions were also pretty different, but the review PSET was perfect.",
                "I think one big strength was that they had a lot of TA's who were willing to meet outside of their office hours, but one weakness is that problem sets sometimes did not match up with lecture and\/or exams",
                "Strengths: good teaching team and professor. The best premed requirement I took at Yale.",
                "A great amount of work",
                "The strengths of the course were the teaching team and Professor Demers. Although typically larger lecture courses are a bit disorganized and frustrating at times, I felt that Dr. Demers listened to our feedback and adjusted, which is something I appreciated throughout the semester. She offered review sessions that were extremely helpful and facilitated our understanding of the material. Weaknesses would be the timing of certain review sessions, but Dr. Demers did her absolute best to accommodate. Another weakness would be that there is a very large amount of students and it was difficult to get help during study halls, so if possible, maybe adding more TAs would be an improvement, but I know the teaching team tried very hard to adjust.",
                "Strengths  Prof Demers is truly an angel. She is an incredible human being whose dedication to helping us learn was visible in the very supportive class culture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses  at times, it felt like we were doing haphazard module problems and just about scratching the surface of the material we were meant to get into.",
                "The modules used to instruct the course were unclear and poorly organized. One way to improve would be to use an existing textbook.",
                "Strengths are the professor and TAs - very helpful and supportive. Weaknesses are the difficulty of the PSETs and its inability to connect to the material and the class.",
                "Strength: Professor Demers! Shes such an incredible professor and is so understanding! She literally listens to student feedback on the class and makes changes to benefit us! I highly recommend this class to anyone because Professor Demers makes this Physics super fun and interesting in this class!\r\nWeakness: None",
                "Amazing course! So fun and really encourages learning! I feel like I was very invested in the material and learned so much!",
                "Good lectures and tests of knowledge. Psets were fairly difficult.",
                "The Psets take far too long compared to their relevance in the exams",
                "The strengths of this course is that it really facilitates learning! The structure of lecture with the weekly quizzes allowed me to keep up with if I knew the material! I also thought that the psets were well suited for keeping up with learning because we are able to understand the pset material with the TAs and office hours. I thought the exams were also really well structured and very fair which I really appreciated. No improvements, course was good!",
                "Strengths is that it is taught very well and in a great way. Psets are really hard so you will need to work in groups or with a TA. Then tests are more manageable as they test if you have gotten the material that you are actually expected to learn for our math level",
                "This course was well paced and had many resources that allowed for student success. The teaching team was great, and professor Demers was amazing!",
                "The professor needs to respond to emails  its so difficult to communicate with teaching staff",
                "Prof. Demers really cares about her students and does her best to make sure you are understanding the material",
                "Strengths: Professor Demers is incredible!!",
                "Great course, but more difficult examples during class to help as a reference for problem sets would be amazing.",
                "Strengths: The professor is a gem. Very kind and helpful. Works hard to ensure that the class is fairly structured.\r\nWeaknesses: The overlap between the lectures and psets is questionable at times.",
                "The problem sets are not useful for exams at all. The modules are also not useful at all. The questions are not similar and the information from the module is not easily intelligible. Make up problems for psets instead of using the module ones.",
                "STRENGTHS: Sarah Demers is quite possibly a goddess walking the Earth. She is a great instructor who is supremely intelligent but also kind, warm, and down to Earth. You can tell that she loves physics and she is excited to share that knowledge with us. She makes asking questions (even in a huge lecture hall) not scary and explains things at a clear and interesting pace. Exams were very fair, and her class demonstrates that you can learn a lot (you end up with a great conceptual knowledge of physics) without being stressed, overwhelmed, or on the brink of crying every time you try to do a p'set or take an exam (*cough cough phys180*). Weekly quizzes are helpful and she definitely reads the survey questions, so it's easy to give feedback and students feel seen and cared for. WEAKNESSES: none!",
                "This course is amazing!! The strength is Professor Demers. She is the best. I also like how the exams were truly testing the fundamental concepts and if you had a solid understanding you were totally fine. The problem sets were sometimes a bit long and you had to go to office hours or study hall to finish them, but I thought it was actually fun and encouraged a good learning environment.",
                "The course was well set up for your classic pre-requisite intro class. The biggest weakness was the textbook which is a bit confusing, not very well organized and felt difficult to understand. As the material was built on the textbook, it was sometimes difficult to understand the material.",
                "Prof Demers is such an enthusiastic and engaging teacher!! Loved going to class, but didn't always feel like the psets and materials necessarily prepared us for exams or lined up with lecture material.",
                "I thought this course was really great at managing expectations. Each student knew what material to study, and how to do well in the course. This does not mean that there was a lack of material. Problem sets were really tough, but in a way that made growth possible. It's hard to think of a way this course can be improved. Maybe you can host more office hours?",
                "Lectures were very well structured and covered all the materail well. The class just moved very slowly and the modules were riddled with typos and not that helpful to read from."

The class targets things you'll specifically see on the MCAT. If you're a pre-med deciding between physics 180 vs. 170, I highly recommend 170 over 180 if you're looking for a less stressful semester.",
                "yes! it's a pre-med requirement so most students in the class take it for this reason, but prof demers makes it genuinely enjoyable",
                "I would recommend this course for sure. It is easy to follow the lecture, the p-sets are achievable if you work together, and the exams are accessible if you study well.",
                "of course",
                "Yes!!! Especially with Prof. Demers. She made the class my favorite STEM experience at Yale so far and compared to other physics courses made the concepts more approachable and less daunting to understand.",
                "Not unless you are pre-med or need it for your major. However, I would definitely recommend 170\/171 over 180\/181 because the exams are way easier",
                "Requirement, dunno if anyone takes this for fun, but not a bad class.",
                "Yes! Accessible, clear lectures and fair exams. Be warned that you will likely spend some long hours in office hours (but really, it's not that bad).",
                "If you want a science gut that doesn't require attendance, yes. If you want to learn physics, take PHYS 181\/201\/261.",
                "Yes, if they are a pre-med student that doesnt have a strong physics background",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone that needs it.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course, especially for students interested in life science or pre-med. This course fulfills requirements that are necessary for many students.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, if they are interested in physics and want an approachable entrance or are premed",
                "Yes. Great for Pre-Med and MCAT.",
                "Yes I would. If students need to take physics for premed or another requirement this is a great class. It follows a good pace and there is a lot of support for students if they need.",
                "Yes! If you want a conceptual understanding rather than mathematical understanding of Physics, take this class. It was also interesting to hear the biological connections.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student especially if they are more of a conceptual learner and want to know the basics of Physics 2. I don't think this sequence is as math and calculus heavy as the 180 sequence, and I believe the workload was definitely manageable especially if you are a pre-medical student taking other pre-requisites like organic chemistry or biochemistry at the same time. I think the course is very manageable, and if you are looking for additional support and help, they are always available because the times for office hours are all throughout the week, and all of the TAs are extremely helpful.",
                "Yes if you are pre med, I'd choose 171 over 181 because the workload is much less and you are pretty much learning the same things",
                "Yes. If you are deciding between PHYS 181 and 171, take 171 if Sarah is teaching! Excellent course.",
                "Yes its taught well",
                "Yes, if Dr. Demers is teaching the course, I would recommend it to another student. She did her best to take into account our feedback, actively seeking it out, and made a lot of effort to implement it within the course. She adjusted the course from last semester, based on student feedback, and created a very well-balanced course that I enjoyed greatly!",
                "Yes, if you want some respite after the HUGE workload of PHYS 180 with Steinacker\/if you are a pre-med student with a busy workload. It is fun, useful for MCAT, good for mental health class. If you want a class that provides a more rigorous introduction to physics with calculus, take 181. \r\n\r\nI actually loved doing PHYS 180\/171 as a sequence. PHYS 180\/181 would have been too much work but 170\/171 would feel slightly lacking for someone who likes proofs.",
                "Yes. This is a good intro physics class to take, especially if you're premed. Professor Demers is amazing and very kind",
                "Yes! This class is 10\/10 and really makes physics interesting and fun! I would especially recommend this class for pre-meds or people interesting in the biological aspects of physics! For example Professor Demers connects concepts like oscillation to how they ear is able to hear vowels and optics to how corrective lenses work. This class is great and honestly made me love physics! Take itttt :D",
                "Yes! Much easier than other physics courses and it is so fun!",
                "Yes, it was a great physics class.",
                "Yes! class well structured to learn physics !",
                "Yes absolutely!",
                "I would. PHYS 170\/171 has a reputation for being the easier of the 2 introductory physics classes because it is not math-heavy. However, I found that I was able to learn more physics because this class focused on more conceptual material than PHYS 180.",
                "Not unless its a requirement or you are just super duper interested in physics.",
                "Yes. If you are considering 171 to 181, I made the switch and I believe it was a great change. The teaching team for 171 was amazing and the workload made my spring semester much more balanced. I got to enjoy physics with Professor Demers!",
                "Yes, amazing course with a great prof",
                "Yes!!!",
                "Yes, if you need physics that is more conceptual based then this is the class for you.",
                "Yeah if you want a relatively easy E&M course you should take this. I switched from 180 to 171 and it was a game-changer.",
                "Only over PHYS 181 because its easier to get a better grade in this class.",
                "YES! Take this course if it is with Professor Demers. She is a gem. This is wayyyy better than 180 for premeds. The tests are totally fair and you have a lot of help on problem sets. There are \"weekly\" quizzes, but you get a 90% for putting your name down and it can only go up from there. They are also very basic, so you don't have to stress. And you get to drop two of them. Take this class if you are premed, or if you are interested in physics.",
                "Sure. Professor Demers is great and she really puts effort into making the material engaging and for providing support for her students. The material itself isn't the most inspiring stuff. If you don't have to take it as a pre-requisite there are probably more interesting physics classes out there. If you do, do 170 instead of 180 if possible.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, for those that need a physics credit, this course is well taught and walks you through concepts at a pretty slow pace. As someone who doesn't love physics that much, I appreciated the amount of enthusiasm Prof Demers gave and how much support there was from study halls, office hours, and TAs.",
                "I definitely would. I learned a lot, and the course did not make me stress.",
                "It is a very easy physics class. If you do not care about an in depth understanding and just want to get the basics, this is for you. However, if math and physics come more naturally for you, you may get bored with the pace of this class."
