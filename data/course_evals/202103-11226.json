                "Overview of the process for writing our senior thesis. The first part of the course is somewhat structured, going over various things which are useful for students (a) writing a senior essay (so all of you) and (b), in particular, students who are thinking about graduate school. At the beginning of the course, for instance, you'll workshop personal statements, the likes of which are needed for grad school applications. The later part of the course is less structured, and involves updates on the planning of/writing of your senior thesis.",
                "I learned about the format of the linguistics senior thesis, as well as the steps I should be taking to ensure that I complete my thesis on time.",
                "By taking this course, I didn't necessarily gain a lot of new skills on paper, but the progress that I made into my senior project was invaluable. In terms of technical skills, I learned how to use Overleaf and Zotero, which I had zero experience with prior to the course.",
                "You get to really become intimately familiar with what your thesis is going to be, and you learn how to plan that out over a period of time. I'd say most of the helpful feedback I got in this course (which is included in my 'feedback' evaluation score here) was from the other students.\r\n\r\nAlso we had to write a mock grad school application in Week 2 so take from that what you will."

            "comments": [
                "No complaints here, it was well organized and the professor both gave good advice and held us accountable for making regular progress. If anything, a compilation of info/resources about Latex, Zotero, etc. would have been helpful, but addressing questions as they came up worked too.",
                "Strengths: it helps organize and set your thesis on track with spaced out deadlines, you get input from classmates and Professor Zanuttini on how to take the next steps on your thesis, it takes stress off the thesis process, a class that offered once weekly check-ins. It gives you a supportive family and open space to share your thoughts and work developments judgement-free. Weaknesses: some of the assignments didn't necessarily tie into the thesis, some weeks (especially around midterms season) would have benefitted from quiet work time (maybe even have half of the class like that in future renditions of this course). At times, it became tiring to only listen to presentations. I genuinely enjoyed the class, though, and the syllabus/calendar structure really helped staying on track. I know people in other majors who do not have this much support, so I genuinely appreciate that this course exists.",
                "Strengths: It's nice to have a class with all the seniors. Especially as a two-term course sequence, it's a lovely bonding activity, and most of us haven't been in a single class all together, so it's nice to see everyone. There is some useful feedback that's provided, especially at the beginning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Personally, I thought much of the actual \"work\" for the course was more of a distraction than anything else. The bulk of the time spent during class is not time that you could devote to actually working on your senior essay (whether that's writing, researching, running experiments, etc). Instead, you have to be actively participating in whatever the topic de jour is. While this is a nice way to get engagement from the class, I didn't find the work or time to be really all that helpful. Especially since the LING department doesn't offer a \"Research for Credit\" option, I think the most valuable way to use this course time would be a \"two hour work session\" every week (we did this twice and it was wonderful). While the planning was good for the first few weeks (especially, I gather, for people who didn't have a research project fully fleshed out by the start of term) once we get into October I would really have loved to see a \"free work with guidance\" model, and spend less time on the other busy work.",
                "I think it's nice to have time each week to check in with other linguistics majors, but a lot of the work at the start of the semester felt a bit superfluous --- I would have rather started off by brainstorming topics and areas right away. I did find the times when the class became a workspace during the end of the semester to be useful.",
                "This course was great preparation to write the senior essay. According to what I have heard from my peers, relatively few majors provide the same level of guidance as Linguistics, so this course can be really effective for thinking up and launching your individual project. I found that by staying mostly up to date with assignments, I finished the semester with a good start on my thesis and clear plans for the spring.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of the course was the sometimes disproportionate amount of time spent discussing minute details of individual projects. Some students were much more vocal than others, which meant that the class spent hours over the semester listening to presentations on certain projects, when a better use of time for the class as a whole might have been productive work time. When we moved more towards individual writing time near the end of the semester, I think many students found that much more helpful.\r\n\r\nIn terms of individual assignments, everything in the latter half of the course felt helpful. There were a couple in the beginning, like writing a grad school personal statement, that seemed more closely tailored to one specific path. Those assignments could probably have been substituted for later ones, allowing more of the writing to be divided over the whole semester.",
                "Before you read this, a disclaimer: I enjoyed my time in this class because it was a way to sit around a table discussing Linguistics or other things with Linguistics people. You don't get to do that at Yale a lot so that was really nice. Camaraderie got me through it. However, everything I didn't enjoy was how stressed this class made me about something that started as a passion-project. (In ways described below.)\r\n\r\nA strength of the class is that you'll be getting a whole semester ahead on your thesis - which, if you're only focusing on one such project, can be a huge leg up. You'll feel pretty certain about what you're doing and where you're headed with it. If you haven't done longterm projects such as this year-long, it's a great intro and the other students in the class are really who you learn from in this course. I don't know how fitting it is to have one professor teach, grade, oversee, and evaluate everyone's work (especially someone who is as stoic in their approach to teaching/professorship as Raffaella) - which will be discussed in more detail just below.\r\n\r\nThis course was not designed for students with disabilities, or any other basic accommodations they require. Lots of time pressure and lack of genuine support/help, all under the guise of being made to help individuals arrive at their own goals. If it weren't for a great group of students as friends in the whole thing, I'm not sure if there would've been anything beneficial for me in it.\r\n\r\nFeedback/grading is inconsistent and doesn't match what is said in class/office hours. Also very weirdly harshly graded (and not curved, or individualized ???) for a class that's supposed to lead you into your senior thesis slowly and incrementally. I've never met any other undergrad at Yale who's had this experience in a 490 course in their major. Makes me quite worried about how our actual senior projects will be graded -- another thing other undergrads don't experience here.\r\n\r\nAlso there's basically no actual flexibility around how you take on this class (even if it seems like there is, and you get fake reassurances) and if heavens forbid life comes at you (in a covid-semester, too!!) and you don't prioritize 490, well, you'll feel the consequences of that. For such a small sized class you'd think it'd be logical to give individual attention to students' work and progress and modus operandi, but that's not at all how this felt. I felt like I was pitted against 8 of my friends to fight for Raffaella's favorability and praise or whatever. I didn't appreciate the palpable relativeness of one's success to others'; grades and support/comments are not a limited resource you have to portion out among students. I might've been overanalyzing the atmosphere, but that doesn't mean I wasn't made to feel insecure by the approach that was taken to assess our individual progress. Linguistics is far from a cut-throat major and our capstone class suddenly being so oddly interdependent in 'success' - whatever that means in this class - is such a weird move by the department.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the accommodations basis for all I've just said - I seriously recommend that the department move beyond its performativism around such issues and listen to the needs of its students on an individual basis. Especially in a class that is all about independent work that students need to graduate.",
                "The pacing of the class I found a bit jarring. The beginning portion of the course I found to be too slow, while the second half was too fast. The first couple of weeks are spent not really doing any meaningful work at building towards the thesis project. I think eliminating these filler assignments and having students get started on finding an advisor and topic ASAP would put students on a better track to making substantial work on their projects.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I really found the peer-to-peer feedback and input from Prof. Zanuttini during the informal in-class presentations helpful. This sort of approach of discussing students' work also helped build community within the class, I felt."

Get an advisor who is involved, follows through, and will basically override everything Raffaella manages to make so incredibly stressful and not fun. Damn, I majored in Linguistics because I hadn't had a single bad experience in a course and genuinely enjoyed every second of the field and in the department, and this class basically made me hate the whole thing or at the very least be apprehensive toward it.\r\n\r\nHowever, I did still enjoy weekly meetups with the group where we got to talk about Linguistics for 2 hours uninterrupted."
