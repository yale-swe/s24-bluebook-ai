                "I believe that the course provided an ambitious screening schedule that introduced me to a variety of films I had never otherwise had the opportunity to see. However, at times the screenings felt more laborious considering the length of time spent in the theater. Considering that we watched so many films, we rarely had the opportunity to discuss all of them in class. Many remain enigmatic to my understanding because I was not able to address questions in class and get ideas from my fellow classmates.",
                "This class was extremely disorganized and not conducive to fostering an engaged classroom atmosphere. There seemed to be almost no concrete plan at the beginning of each day, and discussions would get derailed by extensive tangents from both students and the professor. The professor also cancelled the Friday class that was supposed to be the first meeting of the class (it was a Monday class, so due to scheduling, it was placed on a Friday since the following Monday of add\/drop was a holiday). This seemed as though it was a tactic to trap students in the class given that we had never gotten the opportunity to shop it during the add\/drop period since we didn't have class until after add\/drop.",
                "I really enjoyed the mixture of theoretical works and cinematic and written texts in the course. I think the movement between different media was important to ground the idea of \"docu-fiction.\""

I would also recommend this course to those interested in the historical nature of filmic experimentation."
