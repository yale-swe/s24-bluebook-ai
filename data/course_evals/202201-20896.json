                "- Starting a lecture by stating that students will not be tested on the explicit material and do not need to know the math really demotivates us from engaging with the material.\r\n- I recognize the intent of going through all of the math at an overview level, but going over it without teaching where it comes from or what it means left me really confused.\r\n- Strengths: the homework assignments were really practical and useful.",
                "The format of a conceptual lecture supplemented by computer labs for homework was the optimal structure for this course in my opinion. As Prof. Hammes-Schiffer said, it's important to not use these computational methods as a black box, but another benefit of conceptual lectures is that we didn't get bogged down in the semantics of using the software. Given the nature of the homework, I think one constructive suggestion for the course would be to have more structured office hours or even an optional discussion section.",
                "Sharon is so clear!!!!! I like her a lot!!!",
                "This course was great and I feel I learned a lot. I felt the exam was a bit more of regurgitating information than I anticipated based on things said in class. I felt that I learned more from the labs than from studying for the exam.",
                "the practical skills learned are very useful, the excess of math in some of the slides made it confusing to understand what material we really had to know.",
                "The lecture slides were thorough and helped explain the theory behind some techniques in computational chemistry, and the weekly computing lab assignments were a nice contrast to the lecture material in that we were actually using the software to \"perform\" the calculations, which didn't require much complicated thinking. Because the labs were pretty easy to complete, it didn't require too much knowledge of the theoretical material (which was nice when I was behind in the class/had other tough assignments at the same time!), but I was just slightly unsure of how in-depth I should understand the lecture material for the final exam. This might be partially due to the fact that I didn't start studying as early as I should have, but maybe it would be useful to have a review session and/or summary sheet at the end of the semester to recap what the most important points are."

SHS doesn't explain what the terms mean when she goes over the quantum mechanics. It's incredibly confusing. Vaccaro taught us what a basis set was the day after the compchem final. Just wait until after you've taken pchem 2.",
                "Absolutely yes. Computational chemistry is only becoming more important and being familiar with not just using the methods but also the fundamental concepts behind them is more crucial now than ever. The entire teaching team did a great job equipping us to do that.",

Sharon is a really thoughtful, knowledgeable professor and our TA, Max, was also really nice and willing to answer homework questions. I think this is a great advanced chemistry elective, especially as more of an application-based course involving some ideas from PChem/intro quantum mechanics (though I don't think these are necessary prerequisites)."
