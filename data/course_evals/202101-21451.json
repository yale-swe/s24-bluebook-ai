I really loved having multiple choice exams, as it allowed me to engage with the content in a more relaxed manner.  \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the lecturers did not have good powerpoints to study off of later",

                "I thought the variation in lecturers made the course even more engaging, since every topic was taught by an expert in the field. Having only 3 exams in the course made the workload very easy to manage with other courses. However, I think it would be nice to have another way of getting extra points, like optional extra credit.",

                "The weakness was the fact that each lecture was taught by a different person. While they are experts in their field, they do not communicate well and often material is repetitive or assumes knowledge. \r\nIn addition, this course is only comprised of 3 multiple choice exams. Online and closed book this did not make too much sense to me. \r\nThe strength was the content. I found it easy to study because I was genuinely interested in the material.",

Having a different professor for every class for a little jarring and unorganized (but we were warned about it at the beginning of the semester), but was obviously necessary to provide this depth."

Some lectures will feel a little too technical for a non-science major, but the concepts and overarching themes in this course are relevant to everybody.",

I will say that it was not an easy course as there was a lot of material to learn and there were different professors for almost every class.",

                "I would recommend this course to other students looking for a good bio class as well as premed students. For the former group, you dont really need a strong background in bio to understand the content. For the latter group, many of the lecturers were clinicians so it was nice hearing about their work.",
                "I think that if you're interested in learning about how reproduction works and niche topics such as what causes puberty, then go for it! However, I also think that if you aren't personally interested in reproductive biology, the course may eventually become like just another course to get out of the way for a major requirement. The course is very biology and STEM-focused and the tests are all multiple choice and memorization based (as a fair warning for those who may not be used to taking intensive biology courses).",

                "Yes! I enjoyed this class.",
                "Definitely, if you want a class where you can learn a lot while not having a lot of assessments. If you're a pre-med, then this is a class that is definitely on the medical school level and can give you a head start on reproductive health.",
