                "While this class focuses on Tocqueville and Mill, you learn how to read works of political theory and write analytically about them. I was also glad to learn about 19th century political theory in general and discuss some of the questions that many philosophers grappled with at the time. Our class was a perfect combination of lecture and discussion. While professor Wilford contextualized readings and provided relevant information about Tocqueville or Mill during her lectures, we were able to also bring up and discuss our own questions."

                "You get an opportunity to focus on a few authors, which I think is rare in the Yale Humanities and Political Science departments. I appreciated having weeks to explore Tocqueviile and Mill's writings, instead of only spending a week on each. We were able to talk about the readings line by line, rather than talking abstractly about vague ideas.  I think this structure of the class actually encouraged us to do all the readings for each class. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can think of is that we sometimes didn't get to discuss all of our readings in class. I know that some professors stick to the syllabus, but I actually appreciated how professor Wilford amended it. Although we didn't get to read Mill's \"Civilizations\" essay, I think I know all the works we did read and discussed very well."

She facilitates not only the expansion of students' knowledge, but also the challenging of their viewpoints through her questions. I learned about seminal theorists and I truly do not think I could have gained a more detailed understanding of them outside of Dr. Wilford.",
