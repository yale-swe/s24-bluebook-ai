            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the opportunity to watch both a play and an opera in New York! I also loved most of the readings, especially the Classical texts and Ferrante. Prof Tylus, Catherine, and Costanza were clearly very passionate about the subject, and it was very easy to go to their office hours and talk with them about the course material. Weaknesses: there was so much reading, to the point where it was nearly impossible to finish it all every week. I wish we had more weeks devoted to Ferrante, as opposed to just two weeks to cover two lengthy novels. Also, guiding questions before every class would be helpful, so that while we were reading, we knew ahead of time what to look out for and could make more focused comments in class. The class was also really big; it was much more like a leminar than a seminar, so if you felt uncomfortable speaking in a larger setting, it was really difficult to share.",
                "It was just amazing!",
                "Strengths: Professor Tylus and Costanza were brilliant professors, and had very interesting things to say.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt this class suffered from many weaknesses. Right off the bat, the class was much too large to produce any meaningful discussion. 20+ people for a seminar cannot work, as everyone wants to have their opinions expressed but there is not enough time to do so. Adding onto this was the presentations that would take large portions of class time, and the long (but very intelligent) orations the two professors would make during the class. This left students feeling like they could not make their voice heard, or that conversation had moved on long before they were called on to speak. The issues with this class went beyond the class structure though. We were assigned so many readings, and that is normal in a class, but what is abnormal is a professor actually believing a student has read everything. I saw the sunrise a couple of times trying to get everything done, and I still did not finish it.  Because so much reading was assigned each class, we could not get into depth with anything, merely skimming the surface for the main ideas and plot points. But more than that, I maintain that anyone who actually did all of the readings would not have gotten much out of the class. The class is called \"dangerous woman\" but I felt as if I never really got a thesis to the class. We went through readings so quickly and brushed them on such a surface level that I had a hard time finding any larger messages. What is a dangerous woman? I have no idea. It seemed to me that a woman was dangerous when she wrote, and that the revelation of the class was meant to be \"women have been oppressed, and some used writing to talk about that.\" Hardly a new concept, and the class certainly left something to be desired.",
                "Too many readings per week, too many professors, too many students",
                "The material was deeply engaging and all three instructors were incredible. I would love to have discussed the theory on the syllabus in class more though because a lot of it was quite difficult and we didn't receive any help with it (focusing on the literary works instead). The instructors possibly overestimated the ability of sophomores and juniors to consume such dense theoretical text and be able to apply it to literature without any hand holding. Still, I loved the class and would strongly reccommend!",
                "Strengths: The syllabus is fascinating, the readings are wonderful and the instructors are very knowledgeable and passionate about the material. \r\nWeaknesses: The volume of reading often felt unmanageably large to the extent that we barely got to most of it in discussions. The weekly class presentations had no time limit and were often excessively long, detracting from time that could have been spent discussing the material. The class didnt really feel like a seminar it was either the instructors speaking or them calling on students who all made very different points, which meant there was very little flow in the conversation. There was an excessive emphasis on theory and very little close reading of the actual texts, partly due to the sheer volume of reading which meant we were always rushing from text to text, and partly because the class prioritized a theoretical lens which often felt forced. The class would greatly benefit from more close reading (this would also help make discussions more structured and grounded) and less theory. Because the class was so theory-oriented, it often felt like we were diverging from the actual content and formal elements of the texts and imposing extraneous ideas onto them, particularly in regards to the ancient and medieval texts where its much harder to apply modern feminist theory persuasively.",
                "I thought the course was good! I think it would've been nice to have the opportunity to spend more time in class on some of the longer works.",
                "This course had such exciting works included, and had a very promising syllabus, but ultimately proved to be overly ambitious. While all the authors and literature were so important, it felt like we were unable to deeply engage with them because the workload was too high. Students struggled to complete all the reading in time for class, and thus weren't able to perform close reading of passages. It felt like many students in the classroom were barely hanging on to the pace. I myself was disappointed to not be allotted more time to analyze readings -- we moved on from each author so quickly. For example, I was very excited to read Ferrante, but struggled to grasp a deeper meaning from the first novel in one short week before moving on to the fourth. This prevented the classroom conversation from being more fruitful or exploratory. Overall, I was glad to be exposed to so many wonderful works, but wish that there was more careful selection of assignments such that students would all be encouraged to engage with them.",
                "In general, I really enjoyed the readings and got a lot out of them, and I really liked all three instructors and the help and insight they provided. I also really enjoyed both written assignments -- both pushed me to think about the readings on a deeper and more connected level, and I think my understanding and appreciation of the material improved. The trip to New York to see La Boheme was so much fun, and especially because of the follow-up discussion in class, the opera related to the themes of the class in interesting ways. \r\n\r\nThere were two main aspects of the course that I thought could be improved. First, I wish the class size had been smaller. While I liked all of the students who were in the course, because it was so large, it was a more intimidating space to speak in, leaving many students silent during all or most class periods while other students spoke a lot. Especially given the emotional and sensitive nature of many of the pieces we read, a smaller, more intimate class where everyone gets to know each other well would have been a more inviting environment for everyone to participate in. Second, sometimes the amount of reading was a bit difficult to manage, meaning I focused on reading the primary texts and often had to skim the supplementary, analytical texts, so I was less familiar with their arguments. A slightly reduced reading load could help students get more out of what they do read. In general, I think a smaller class size and slightly smaller reading load would help students get more out of the course, by allowing more time and space to consider the readings more deeply.",
                "The strength was, for me, listening to Prof Tylus, Costanza, and Catherine talk. I learned so much from what they had to say. Getting to experience these female authors and characters in a serious, academic way was so rewarding, and I loved the elements of the course that allowed us to appreciate how one led to the next. I do think the course would be improved with a lighter reading load -- not because the work itself was too much, but because we rarely had time to get to everything in class, and our discussions sometimes felt surface level due to time constraints. It also would have been helpful to have a little bit more guidance on how I was doing in the course -- the written feedback on response papers was incredibly helpful, but the only grade I had going into the final paper was the midterm.",
                "Strengths: engaging professors, engaging coursework, fantastic class discussions, fun assignments\r\nWeaknesses: way too much reading was assigned, which made it difficult to keep up"

                "I would not recommend this class to another student. There is simply too much reading and work expected for not a lot of actually learning. It sounds like a great title, but there are some serious issues regarding class size and structure, amount of reading, and format. Until these issues are resolved I would warn against taking this class.",
                "Yes, its a well-designed literature class and the instructors really care about the material. If you are looking for an in-depth study of literary texts, though, then this is not the place to go. It is a fast-paced, often rushed survey course and is very heavily theoretical. This can be frustrating if you are more interested in close reading and in looking at the imminent qualities of the texts rather than in reading them through a critical modern lens.",
                "Yes. I thought this course was really interesting and it covers a wide range of works. It's helpful to try to get ahead on the readings if you can since there are a lot of them, especially with the novels.",
                "Perhaps with some edits to the syllabus, yes. All of the students were eager to read these authors, but a better balance of workload needs to be struck. I would say to read the syllabus carefully before determining whether you are ready to commit to this course. The professors/teachers are so wonderful and knowledgeable about these topics, but even they sometimes seemed unable to fully contend with all the ideas in the readings within the allotted time. But it was clear how much they cared about their students and wanted to share these works with the class.",
                "I would recommend this class, with the caveat that it would be better if it had a smaller class size in the future. Also, they should check the syllabus ahead of time, to make sure they have an interest in at least some of the readings. I got the most out of the class through my independent engagement with the readings, so an independent interest in the syllabus is important.",
                "Yes! If you have the time to devote to the reading.",
