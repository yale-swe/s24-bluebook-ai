                "Professor Menon is a huge strength. She is so approachable and knowledgeable, and always makes sure to explain things thoroughly and sufficiently. Additionally, exams in this class were really fair and assessed our understanding of major topics, which was helpful. There aren't many weaknesses at all. I just think this is the type of class that would have been 100x better in person, since the topics were so relevant and interesting.",
                "Strengths: the material was fantastic. Alka Menon is an amazing Professor. \r\nWeakness: oftentimes the amount of reading for the course was too much.",
                "I absolutely loved this course. The subject area was fascinating, and it inspired me to completely change my career path. I had never taken a sociology class, and I thought it was a good introduction to the field.",
                "Asynchronous mini lectures\/modules made it hard for me to feel a strong connection to the class or the material. The flexibility of being able to do the work whenever I wanted was great, however.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Menon and the TAs are very kind and want the students to learn well. I also liked that the course was mostly asynchronous (I took an overlapping course with no problems). The modules and readings were all easily accessible. This is a good course for those who want a broad overview of health from a sociological lens. Weaknesses: I felt that some concepts were not clearly explained in the recorded lectures, and there seems to be some disconnect between the live sessions, sections, and course content.",
                "I really appreciated how organized the course content was. The module layout was straightforward and I found it really helpful for learning. There were no weaknesses!",
                "sometimes hard to stay engaged with the class due to pre-recorded lectures. could consider doing more live lectures.",
                "Weaknesses: There were very few assignments given throughout the course that forced engagement with the material, which meant that it was easy to fall behind on the readings or mini-lectures if you weren't actively setting deadlines for yourself. As such, there are not a whole lot of opportunities to recieve feedback on whether or not you are grasping the material. Some of the readings also seemed extraneous as we would not discuss or address their impacts directly. I also felt as though discussion sections were often not too relevant to the subject materialbreakout sessions would usually focus on one topic and were more than two weeks behind on course content during discussion section, so the actual module we would be studying didn't match what was being focussed on in class. Strengths: I did, however, strongly appreciated the flexibility on assignment deadlines, especially in a remote setting. Prof Menon is very understanding. If you have a genuine interest in the course content, it can be a very fun and important course to take.",
                "There are 11 modules, and I think it would be better if content was divided into weekly units with more clear expectations and evaluations for smaller modules.",
                "really good readings and lectures that were to the point but full of useful information",
                "Strengths: pre-recorded mini lectures were informative and well put together; navigation of assignments and readings in modules made the class logistically very easy to follow which helped in completing work without having to deal with finding everything needed; wide range of topics cover many aspects of medical sociology\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: at the same time, scope of course is very broad so it doesn't allow for much depth into any topic covered as 11 modules were fit into a 13\/14 week semester; mini-lectures informative enough to the point where readings did not help enrich understanding of the topic and at times were time consuming and seemed a monotonous to complete",
                "Strengths: Touch on broad range of healthcare related topics. Open-book quiz format takes the pressure off for exams (the drop quiz was nice). Overall workload is not too difficult to manage. Section was useful for recapping information covered in lectures and prepping us for the essay. Another strength was the multiple benchmarks for the final paperthis made the bigger checkpoints much more digestible. \r\nWeaknesses: Though it is nice to be exposed to a lot of different papers, the readings are more often than not overwhelming or contain a lot of extraneous information\/information that will not be remembered. It is quite possible to do well in the course only having done a few of the key readings. All of the important concepts in readings are covered in lecture. Perhaps consider cutting down the readings so students read only the important paragraphs or pages of a 20-page paper, or making required readings recommended.",

                "I felt like while we did learn a lot of useful information, it was a bit too much. I felt like it was difficult to actually have an in-depth understanding of the material. I also felt like a lot of times questions on quizzes asked you to take a leap of knowledge that was not really apparent from the material that was taught. Like you would think you understood something but then you take the quiz and you do not understand it at all. A strength was definitely professor Menon. She was very kind and accommodating. I especially liked that she offered extra credit. Discussion posts were a weakness. They were graded very harshly for something that didn't increase understanding of the material.",

Professor Menon made sure to always keep the student schedule in mind, accommodating for situations like the presidential election and any holidays off. The TAs were all also extremely willing to help. Live lectures were recorded and also super engaging. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The course is very front heavy so that was a little worrisome at first, but it got so much more manageable later on."

                "I wish there were some more discussions but I think the teaching team did a good job of trying to facilitate that.",
                "The self-paced nature of this course was in my opinion a strength. I believe this course adjusted to virtual learning quite wellmaintaining a synchronous component with weekly sections was good and not overwhelming.",
                "Pre-recording all lectures to have us watch it in our own time diminished the motivation I had for the course",
                "The recorded lectures and modules were helpful as they enabled people to work on their own time while also maintaining structure.",
                "The recorded mini lectures made the course easier to follow along with as well as the general self-pace mode of the class. It made my life a lot easier and learning a lot more fun.",
                "I just think it was a very difficult time and no adjustments were made to the syllabus really to accommodate the difficult situation. I did appreciate that some assignments were pushed back, but there really should have been less big assignments.",
                "the recorded lectures and reduction in reading material",
                "I really enjoyed the mini lectures as they allowed more flexibility for us to watch in tidbits. I also really appreciated having the lectures recorded; that way I could go back to rewatch the lectures if I missed any information, or could pause at anytime.",
                "I think the mixture of live and recorded sessions were really helpful.",
                "The discussion sections allowed students to go over key ideas learned through lectures.",
                "The course made excellent use of really everything. The zoom lectures had polls, break-out rooms, Q&As, and emoji usage. The recorded lectures were in short 25 minute chunks that were easy to process. The canvas page made use of discussions and groupings that didn't make it seem overwhelming. \r\n\r\nImprovements could maybe include making some of the course files linked in the home page instead of having to search for them in the materials section, but really there wasn't any glaring weaknesses."

                "Yes if you are interested in an introduction to the intersection of sociology and health.",
                "You likely need to take this course for pre-med; it is a good option.",
                "Yes. Prof. Menon is amazing and so humble. She is always down to answer questions and just talk to her students.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in public health and existing inequality. This course covers many interesting topics and it is definitely one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. The knowledge is applicable and relative to today and something everyone should know.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in medical sociology, as it provides a really wonderful survey of sociological concepts and culminates in a sociological paper. I really enjoyed taking this course and think pre-medical students would really benefit from a curriculum like this more broadly.",
                "Yes!",
                "YES! Take this course if you are interested in sociology or medicine. Super awesome class, Prof. Menon is wonderful, and the TAs are a solid group.",
                "Yes, some very important information.",
                "Yes! I would absolutely recommend this course, even if you aren't planning on going into a super related field. I think the things you learn in this class are topics everyone should be aware of. It's also not a super difficult class, and is really enjoyable.",
                "Yes, this course made me want to major in (medical) sociology. I went in thinking I wanted to be premed.",
                "Yes! Professor Menon is great, and the course is essential to almost anyone looking into healthcare. I really loved this course, and it sparked a love for sociology in me.",
                "Yes! Whether you're pre-med, interested in public health, sociology, or er&m, this course is super interesting and feels incredibly relevant and important to know going into any of those fields.",
                "YES! Great class, not too much work, and you'll really learn a lot about things that are applicable to our lives more than ever.",
                "I think this is a good course for someone looking for a broad overview of sociological concepts as they relate to public health. I'm a STEM major and had never taken a sociology course, so I did feel like I learned some new concepts and it was nice to learn about a different perspective towards health. It also doesn't hurt that this class is very low workload (a few discussion board posts, 3 open-note quizzes, and 1 paper). For someone more familiar with these topics, though, I think the class would likely be redundant. Discussions seemed to be pretty one-sided, and there didn't seem to be much room for nuance or more rigorous treatment of the studies presented (there seemed to be a lot of steps skipped between presenting a paper\/study and drawing a conclusion from it).",
                "Yes! This course teaches you information that everyone should be aware of, even if you're not going into healthcare.",
                "Yes, if you are engaged you can learn a lot about healthcare systems and public health.",
                "Not in this format. I did genuinely enjoy the course material, but if you are looking to be engaged with it to the fullest extent, a remote class may not be the best way to take it.",
                "Overall yes if you're interested into a deep dive into health and the healthcare system. A little bit not engaging in the online format, but not any fo the teaching teams fault!",
                "definitely! Especially if you're looking into going into health or medicine",
                "Yes I would; it's a great introduction to several aspects of sociology in health and medicine, which is something many pre-medical school requirements do not encompass. However, if you have already taken a class about health\/medicine outside of a STEM focus, I would recommend seeking other courses more focused on your specific area of interest as the scope of the course is incredibly broad and does not allow for deep engagement with any given topic.",
                "Yes. This course is as much as you want to make of it: though there are many readings, you do not have to do all or even most to succeed. You will be exposed to a lot of different practical and relevant healthcare and sociology terms and concepts. For any premeds, this course is a fantastic chance to understand medicine beyond the sciencesomething which needs more focus in the premed curriculum.",
                "Yes!",
                "This course is a great survey of healthcare-related topics that allows you to engage to the extent that you would like to. It's a good mix of material that is somewhat intuitive but also interesting. You will leave this class equipped with the language to talk about a variety of hot topics in healthcare and a better sense of its successes and flaws. Makes a great 5th credit!",
                "I would recommend this course if you're really into public health. I thought that it was not super interesting for me as someone who is not into STEM. There was useful information, but as I said, you have to be really interested in the subject-matter. I thought I did like this kind of stuff, but I suppose I do not.",
                "Yes!!! If you are even thinking about becoming a physician you need to take this course!!!",
                "I really enjoyed this class and recommend it for anyone who is interested in learning more about social manifestations within different realms of public and individual health.",
                "Yes! This is a fantastic introduction to the sociology of medicine. It really helps you see the healthcare field through multiple different perspectives that enrich your understanding of the current state of healthcare and ways it can be improved. Absolutely fantastic course!",
                "I would recommend this course to any individual who would like to gain a general understanding of the flaws of American healthcare and how minorities and low-income communities are the most affected by the faults. No prior knowledge is needed and it is very interesting, even if one's major is not related to medicine.",
                "Yes!!! Extremely interesting and all of the recorded lectures helped with the readings. The professor and my TF were also great at communication and were flexible with COVID.",
                "Yes!!! The humanities or sociology is not really related to my major, but this information is all super relevant to everyday life. I loved this course and I'm extremely grateful I took it."
