   "comments": [
    "A depth of understanding into both reading and writing poetry, truly learning what makes a poem effective at its heart.",
    "I wrote two of the best (if not the best) poems I've written in my entire life in this class. I gained access to an incredible group of peer editors (as well as my professors) and a re-envisioned idea of what it means to write (and what goes into writing) a long poem.",
    "Improved the way I read and write poetry  both of the assignments for this class were incredibly challenging and forced me to change the way I write.",
    "Attention to form, careful reading of others' work, self-critique and workshopping",
    "I started to become more sure of my voice. I began to view poetry as art, thinking about revising as moving around parts in a collage.",
    "This course really pushed me as a poet and a thinker."

   "comments": [
    "It was perfect.",
    "I wish the course had more revisions and more feedback. I loved writing poems and reading everyones poems, but it felt like there could be more times with Claudia or in groups to revise.",
    "Both the writing\/workshop and reading components of this class were great! I also liked the structure of the workshop process (mini-workshop with professors, submission to class, in-class workshop, feedback letters from classmates, redrafting and final submission).",
    "This class was really amazing, and it really helped me come into my own as a poet. I learned to view poetry as more of an art form. I practiced immersing myself in widely-ranging poems, whether they were my classmates works or works from the class syllabus. I especially grew in my worldview through the critical essays that we read in class, and it also helped inform my work. I learned about craft from writing my own poems as well as by examining the poems of my classmates and in the class readings.",
    "I really enjoyed this course but would have preferred if it was split into two classes a week as I found the length of time somewhat stressful."

    "A phenomenal course. The opportunity to have Claudia comment on your work is invaluable  take advantage of it! Don't be shy!",
    "Claudia Rankine is amazing and terrifying in the best possible way. She really pushes you to be a better poet and doesn't let you get away with not trying. You are also pushed to explore areas you might not otherwise. The first unit of the class was race and whiteness and there were a few sessions (but just a few sessions) where it felt more like an African-American Studies class than a poetry class, but I really loved how that pushed me out of my comfort zone and it really expanded my poetry, making sure I didn't just stick to the same old topics I was always comfortable with. I also learned a lot I wasn't expecting to (from that unit and from the class as a whole). Overall, highly recommend.",
    "if you want to grow as a writer and poet, take this class.",
    "Yes, because you read amazing things and engage with poetry differently than you may have before.",
    "I would recommend if you want to receive clear, direct feedback on poetry from very talented students, and of course a talented instructor. In Rankine's section of this course, my personal feeling was that everyone in the class wrote stronger poems the second time around than they had the first (even though we had less time), which to me says that we were actually picking up critical reading\/writing\/listening skills in the first half of the course. Focusing on two pieces alone also helps prevent the burnout, frustration, and half-hearted work that workshop courses that demand 6+ poems often produce.",
    "This course is amazing! Please take it! You will grow into your own as a poet and think about poetry differently. Professor Rankine gives extensive guidance and mentorship for each student, both in workshop and individual conferences. I really loved my group of readers, and will definitely keep in touch with them in the future and look out for their writing.",
    "Yes. This is a great class for those looking to challenge their conceptions of themselves and of poetry."
