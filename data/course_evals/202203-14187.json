                "I learned very interesting knowledge about words that will be useful to me for the rest of my life. This is a very interesting class and is helpful to all! Love how the professor recognizes that the majority of the class is not linguistic majors and manages to make it universally interesting and useful!",
                "English 033 has taught me a different way to look at the words I read every day. I now consider its history and origin, especially when it comes to debated words, giving me a different way to understand the opinions on either side.",
                "I learned a lot about the English language especially the role that it plays in culture around the world. I also developed a lot of skills that helped me improve my writing, critical reading, and informed discussion.",
                "I gained a broad understanding of the evolution, structure, and debated nature of English words. I learned about linguistic analysis tools like Google N-Gram and corpuses. This class gave me a new perspective on the English language.",
                "I learned a general overview about the history, structure, and social nature of the English language.",
                "I learned how to think like a linguist, how to talk about language, and how to think critically about societal attitudes around language.",
                "The main takeaways from this course were from the \"social life\" of words unit, where we learned about slang, jargon, politically correct words, etc. I thought this course material was really interesting, but I will say that this is not a history course or a linguistics-heavy course like the course name suggests.",
                "I learned a lot about words.",
                "I gained a lot of insight into language, how we use it, and the way it affects and is affected by our lives. One takeaway that I think was very important was learning how to deconstruct biases in language, whether those of others or our own. Even if I never take another class about linguistics or the English language, I think the ideas we covered are very applicable to any real-life situation, so these lessons will definitely stay with me. The class was very connected to these applications, as we got many opportunities to explore and apply what we learned to our own lives through the assignments, which definitely made them more interesting."

                "The work assigned is very useful! Prof gives excellent feedback. Course is organized very well. Do not think there is any notable weaknesses, except maybe the 9 am time.",
                "I really enjoyed the discussion based style of the class; it helped me not only better understand the readings but also engage with them further by hearing other people's perspectives. Doing the readings before each class was also a great way to come into class with things to talk about and questions to ask; the discussion questions were especially helpful! I also liked how each major assignment was in a different style.",
                "The class had very interesting assignments, making me often excited to do the homework. I appreciated the \"5 things you remember from last class\" for I found that constant recollection to help me remember class contents overall. While the readings could be somewhat boring and long to read, we would always utilize that information in the discussions, making them always necessary.",
                "Strengths: Engaging and knowledgeable professor, interesting readings and assignments small seminar format allowed for discussion and feedback\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "The course is very good as an introduction to (English-centered) linguistics, especially the sociolinguistics side. However, I wish that our classes were more informative and lesson-based rather than just talking about the readings.",
                "I think the way it was structured starting with learning the vocabulary to talk about language and then going through different subject areas surrounding language was very helpful. But I think we could have spent more time on the social and historical modules at the expense of some of the minutiae of parts of speech.",
                "I can't think of any weaknesses really. The readings were not super time-intensive and they were oftentimes very interesting. The discussions had a mix of lecture and open discussion among the students, which was helpful from a first-year seminar to get used to that kind of learning environment. Professor Grund was also very knowledgeable about this field of linguistics.",
                "It should not be so early in the morning. The content is interesting but not overly engaging, so lots of kids seemed to fall asleep in class.",
                "I think general strengths were the broad amount of ideas that we covered. It was a very good introduction to the fundamentals of linguistics without getting too caught up in the details. I liked how the assignments, readings, and discussions varied in format. I also really enjoyed the final project, where we could choose a topic and format and explore it in whatever way we liked. Professor Grund provided a lot of support in this process too. We had a lot of smaller assignments, which made it feel like I was always working on one, though they were fairly spread out. But it did feel like a lot of writing for a course that wasn't a writing credit, so it might not be the best course to take if you're trying to avoid writing."

                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student. It is an interesting intersection between English and Linguistics that I believe people interested in both topics would appreciate.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student. I personally loved it, but it can be a bit slow at times if you are not super interested in the topic. The prof is a bit of tough grader, so keep that in mind.",
                "Yes! It was a really interesting class that gave me a glimpse into linguistics, which I hadn't ever really engaged with before. I would recommend it for anyone that wants to try something new!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially just for the chance to learn from Professor Grund. The class is engaging and will leave you smarter than when you took it, something that I can't say for all my other classes.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it is very interdisciplinary, and it allows you to develop many skills and learn to apply them using one specific subject.",
                "Yes definitely, this is a great class taught by a great professor. Even if you weren't previously interested in linguistics, this is a great opportunity to learn more about the English language and learn a lot.",
                "Yes, if you are someone with very little linguistics knowledge with an interest in a good, engaging overview.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a great introduction to important concepts in linguistics, and even if you are not interested in majoring in linguistics it gives some very interesting readings and teaches you more about the language we use every day.",
                "Absolutely. Although this course doesn't count toward my major, I think I learned the most from it out of all the courses I took this semester. It helps to explain a lot of the controversies about words that are present in everyday life. I just wish it wasn't offered at 9 am because it's a little hard to discuss the the intricacies of the English language half awake sometimes.",
                "Yes, I found it very interesting and I loved the teaching style.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was, in my opinion, great on nearly every level and was my favorite class of the semester. Professor Grund challenged us to expand the way we thought about language without making it too difficult or over our heads. Our class had a mix of people with a preexisting, genuine interest in language and linguistics and students who were STEM majors who had never interacted with those ideas before, like me. I think on both sides, every student left this class with a new perspective and more enriched views about language and how it affects our lives. Overall, I think anyone could benefit from taking this class."
