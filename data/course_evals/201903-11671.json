    "addiction as a disease (and arguments for choice), wanting vs liking, negative reinforcement, social determinants of addiction, how to prepare for a debate better, a whole host of stuff! We stuck to the syllabus, so that's probably a great place to look. I also learned that Baskin-Sommers is very happy to help and give you feedback.",
    "Biological, genetic, environmental, and sociological factors that impact addiction. The debate surrounding whether addiction is a disease or a choice and different policies that have been enacted to target addictions. Gained debate skills and synthesizing information for the final essay as well as critical thinking skills",
    "I learned about the etiology of addiction and the environmental, biological and genetic components that lead to addiction.",
    "Developed insights into how drug policy should be guided. The skill of developing an argument for a side after evaluating the evidence from multiple perspectives. Knowledge about addiction, from the choice and disease side.",
    "I learned more about how to think about drug use and corresponding behavior.",
    "I learned about the biopsychosocial model of addiction, how to use scientific evidence to back up arguments, and how to integrate psychological studies to inform policy."

   "comments": [
    "Great course!",
    "strengths - professor, content was interesting, debates were thought provoking, gave you a much clearer and more complicated understanding of addiction (drug, gambling, internet, food)\r\nweaknesses - 9:25, debates weren't really actual debates, lectures in the beginning were sometimes hard to get through because they were two hours long, not a strong sense of community in the semester but might have just been the people",
    "Strengths: very interesting information, well organized for student learning the thought questions were great and made you stay on top of the readings which were very well selected, engaging lectures, organized to help us look at addictions from a lot of angles, Dr. Baskin-Sommers is the absolute best. Experience summary is also really cool because it helps you get a little bit of perspective \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None honestly",
    "Strengths: Professor is great, engagement is high from pretty much everyone and the material was very interesting \r\nWeaknesses: A little neuroscience heavy, which is not a bad thing, just not what I was expecting and I wish that had been advertised more.",
    "The course was excellent. I think that the structure of the course was great-- how the first half was simply instruction\/lecture and the second was debate. By the time we had debates I felt well prepared given the background we had because of lectures. The reading responses were great and the readings were super interesting. The behavior change was challenging but really taught us firsthand experience of addiction-like components.",
    "Honestly, other than increased feedback on our performance during the debates, there aren't many points for improvement in this class.",
    "I thought the class facilitated student involvement and encouraged us to think about novel solutions for addiction. I think it may have functioned better as a slightly smaller class, but 25 students didn't make the discussion overly crowded.",
    "This class was very well organized to facilitate student learning: all the assignments helped me think and learn, and I really enjoyed the lecture-debate structure of the class."

    "100%",
    "I would for sure recommend this course!",
    "yes! this topic is really interesting and by the end you feel like you understand the literature on addiction quite well. The whole class leads up to the final paper - is addiction a choice or a disease? This may seem daunting, put one of the main points of the class is to equip you for that essay all semester long. Only once a week, easy to do well if you put the work in. challenged to quit something you're addicted to for the whole semester and journal about it (this was probably my favorite part).",
    "YES. Take it if you are interested in addictions and neuroscience.",
    "Great seminar for psychology! Very interesting material, fun debates and the behavior change is a good exercise as well.",
    "Yes absolutely.",
    "Yes! I learned so much about addictions and it gave me some new perspectives on how complicated it is.",
    "This is a solid course. It was wonderful to intertwine psychology with other fields, such as biology, policy, and sociology. \r\n\r\nI don't fully understand the motivation to structure the second half of the semester as a debate. I think students in a senior seminar are entirely capable of engaging in a thoughtful discussion without needing to water down the structure. \r\n\r\nA challenge of this course--which is a department-level issue--is a lack of clarity about the essence of the senior essay. The department needs to do some soul-searching about the objectives of the senior essay and reevaluate the rigor. As it stands, the senior essay is just a slightly longer final paper. This especially true in this course. Having a prompt, and extremely specific one at that, for what is nominally a thesis is extremely strange. This isn't the case in other senior seminars and, again, waters down the work. To me, this was a major pitfall of the course and I do think ought to be evaluated at both a course-specific and departmental level. \r\n\r\nProfessor Baskin-Sommers is wonderful and clearly cares deeply about the subject matter.",
    "I certainly would recommend this course. You learn a ton each week. All of the readings are pertinent and worth doing. Professor Baskin-Sommers puts so much effort into following up on questions and providing us with the most up to date information and she is extraordinarily knowledgeable. The course does not under deliver in any way and you will leave with a much more profound and critical understanding of the topic of addiction.",
    "This class is a great grab, anyone interested in substance abuse should definitely take it.",
    "Yes! Addictions are such a complex and nuanced topic and this class will definitely challenge your thinking."
