   "comments": [
    "i think having the only 2 assignments for the class be so separate from the course material was a little tricky, and would have enjoyed at least one of them to be slightly more grounded in the material from our readings and\/or class discussions. other than that I really liked how everyone brought different backgrounds to the class and how open it was.",
    "A strength of this class is its subject material - environmental health is an extremely interesting topic and one that merits a solid, regular Yale course. There is so much to learn within this field because of its intersection with so many other field (i.e. public health, social justice, food & agriculture, conservation, etc.). I also think that the students who choose this class are a strength - people came to this class because they genuinely cared about the subject and wanted to dive deeply into it. That's pretty brave, considering how depressing this material can be. \r\n\r\nI wish this course had better structure in terms of materials presented\/info covered. While the syllabus has topical structure, it didn't always feel like that in class. We didn't delve deeply into some things enough, but then other things we spent way too much time on, and I often felt a lack of grounding, common knowledge in class discussions. I also wish our class periods would have been more structured\/constructive. While I appreciated the open discussions, they usually ended feeling inconclusive. It would have been nice to have more organized discussion (i.e. pre-submitted questions, topics that we knew we were going to cover) and some more structure to the class.",
    "The professor created an environment that was engaging",
    "The strength of this course was that it gave us insight to lots of different environmental health issues. A weakness was that we didn't really go in depth into any of the issues as a class. Most class meetings were engaging for the whole time period and Phil made sure to use lots of different sources to help us understand environmental health issues in the United States.",
    "This class was definitely low stress and low pressure, and the kind of free-form discussion style was helpful for engaging with other students and the readings. It was evident that Professor Johnson cared about his students and loves teaching, which was definitely a plus. I also just think the general topics of the class are interesting and extremely important to learn about right now. I do think this class would benefit from a bit more structure, like some more organized lectures and assignments about the various topics we learn about and discuss. Overall, I'm not sure if I really got that much out of this class, and while part of that is because I definitely didn't put as much effort into the class as I could have, I think the other part is that its lack of structure made it difficult to engage with the class if you were someone who was not very familiar with topics of environmental health\/policy\/justice\/etc. but wanted to learn more. (to Professor Johnson's credit, there were several points to give feedback during the course, but I didn't really have time to reflect on my experience in the class until now)",
    "strength: phil is a wonderful and kind professor who loves his work\r\nweaknesses: sometimes didnt seem like the class time had been entirely thought out",
    "Good amount of readings and interesting topics were covered (and the syllabus was very well laid out and consistent), but I think class discussions could have been a bit more organized and stimulating.  I also would have liked more assignments beyond just a prep paper and a final paper (didn't receive much feedback).",
    "The course was all around phenomenal I just wish it met more frequently.",
    "The class was brilliant in that it fostered a collaborative learning environment where students learnt not only from the professor from each other. The class also encouraged independent working, an essential skill that will be valuable to all students regardless of major."

    "yes",
    "A good intro class to environmental health issues. Covers different types of environmental issues (air\/water pollution, food systems issues, etc.) and connects them to human health, with some good overlap into public health and social justice issues. Don't expect this to be an uplifting class - the material is heavy and frankly pretty depressing. Phil is a really nice person and runs a very open discussion-based classroom. Wasn't a hard course at all - weekly readings and a final paper on whatever issue you want, with a midterm prep paper for the final.",
    "I would recommend this course to people that what a broad overview of environmental health issues.",
    "If you are interested in environmental issues (specifically relating to human health, of course), environmental politics, and environmental justice, and you have familiarity with these topics and have taken a class or two about them, then I would definitely recommend this class. It has a low workload, Professor Johnson is a wonderful professor, and it's a really interesting topic. However, if you haven't taken an environmental studies class before, then this might not be the appropriate introduction to the topic. Also keep in mind that although the workload is very light, you get out what you put into the class.",
    "yes!",
    "Absolutely!  I feel I have a much better framework with which to understand environmental and public health.",
    "I would reccomend this class to another student. This class was one of my favorite classes at Yale, it covered highly relevant topics to todays society, fostered a comfortable working environment, and provided insight into professional interactions with the environment."
