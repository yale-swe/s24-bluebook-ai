There was a large focus on different verb tenses and conjugations, as well as knowing when to use which conjugations when given a sentence with a blank for the verb.",

The biggest weakness was that there were simply too many verbs and vocabulary to learn, so in the end, I wasnt really able to learn it all.",

For those who took L3 and are contemplating continuing their studies in Hebrew, Id definitely encourage them to proceed with L4, both because of the richness of the language itself but also because of the great quality of the Hebrew teaching department at Yale. Also, Professor Orit was especially engaging and fun, and that was definitely a perk of this course."
