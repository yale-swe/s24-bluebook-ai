As a student of international relations, many times we are more likely to relate to the different foreign policies of countries and international conflicts, which are more practical content and tend to overlook a lot of the common moral cognition as a human community. My interest lies in the exchange and mutual learning of various civilizations, and most of my research focuses on the similarities and differences between Chinese civilization and other diversified civilizations in the world, hoping that my research can explain something. Of course, in this course, I have gained friends from all over the world, and I have also gained a lot of discussions on moral issues in different cultural backgrounds. I truly feel the power of civilization, but more than anything else, what we have in common as a human community. To be sure, I do not think that the world of the future will be an ideal utopia, nor do I think that our current moral research will be the same ten, fifty, hundred years from now. But I am glad that we have a certain ability to explain our moral actions and thoughts on the road. This is the biggest shock of moral psychology to me.",
