                "I felt like the surrogate project went on longer than was productive. However, I did not feel fully warmed up and ready to tackle the final\/primary project after just the surrogate project. I think the course would have benefitted from having a third assignment sandwiched between the surrogate and the library project. \r\n\r\nAs for the library project, having a clearer brief (and continually re-centering on that brief) would have been helpful. The talk about program and how that merges with form would have been very helpful to have towards the beginning of the project as opposed to after mid-review. I also had trouble wrapping my head around the projectwe focused a lot on the programs provided by a library but then we weren't tasked to alter the library. I also had trouble with the idea of disrupting the entire street in front of the library. \r\n\r\nDespite these points, I still think it was a great studio. Annie always had really inspiring and fruitful content and given the weird virtual studio during COVID times, this was probably the best that a studio could have gone.",
