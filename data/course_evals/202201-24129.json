I learned so much about the most consequential trials in history  the readings, discussions, and assignments help me hone my critical thinking, writing, and reading skills. We got to consider and discuss deep questions that will stay with me for years",

                "This course was amazing! Prof Ford made a 1hr50 seminar feel like 30 mins. Hes a really engaging lecturer and the content we covered was interesting. It wouldve been nice to have more time for student discussions and also to have a better idea of how students are doing grade-wise earlier in the semester",
                "Professor Ford made it comfortable for everyone to share thoughts and was a very engaging speaker.",
                "No weaknesses. Strengths: I absolutely loved this course, and it was my favorite one I've ever taken at Yale. Professor Ford's knowledge and enthusiasm make for a wonderful classroom environment that will be memorable after you graduate.",
                "such an amazing interesting course. Favourite class I have taken at Yale.",
                "No weaknesses. It's an extremely interesting class with a low workload",
                "The class has a lot of great resources and the readings/videos are informative and fun to go through. One issue with the class is it didnt feel as much like a seminar as I would have hoped, so if youre looking for that then maybe this isnt the best option. That said, I did learn a lot and was able to get a better understanding of history through the law."

                "Yes, I think it's important to learn about our legal system and court system and how it has evolved over the years. Also the course felt very low-stakes and not too intense like some seminars I have taken.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone looking to take a class at Yale that feels different from other seminars you've taken. Unlike other classes I've taken, this seminar genuinely felt discussion-based, and I left every class feeling like I learned something new. This class is one where students can guide the conversation however they please, and don't get too bogged down in what the readings specifically say. The readings are super interesting because they are trial summaries, trial transcripts, and documentaries/movies  I found myself watching the latter with my family and friends because it was THAT interesting. Professor Ford is an incredible teacher and mentor, and you will forever be grateful you took this class with him.",
                "Yes!! if you get the chance, take this class.",

                "Yes! Professor Ford is SO COOL and hearing about his life is definitely worth it. He also takes students to lunch which is very fun and is overall a great professor to have.",
                "By far the best course that I have taken at Yale. Professor Ford is not only a great professor but an unbelievably great person--the passion that he has on the submit translates into the classroom and is reflected by the class' regular engagement. I cannot think of a moment when the class was silent, as we were constantly on top of the material. I can say with full honesty that this is the first (and last) class at Yale where I completed all of the assigned readings and work. I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to take this course during my four years."
