                "NOT A GUT!!!!!\r\nThis class is a LOT OF WORK - I spent more time on bio than any other class, and i am not a science major. That said, I learnt a lot and am confident in my grasp over epidemiological and biological concepts",
                "I learned about the inner workings of Malaria, Lyme Disease, Dengue, the immune system, and vaccines. I developed a new insight amidst our current global pandemic. I now have a greater appreciation for our immune system.",
                "I learned so much not just about the three diseases we were studying but also about how the immune system works and different responses the world can have to diseases. Really insightful especially during this pandemic!",
                "I learned a lot about the immune system's response to various vector-borne diseases, as well as the diseases themselves and their transmission and interaction with hosts and vectors.",
                "I learned so much about Malaria, Lyme, Dengue, ect., and I know this is what is supposed to happen, but the sheer amount of knowledge that can be gleaned about these diseases and their vectors is mind boggling. I never knew there was so much to learn about vector born diseases, but there is so much and some of the knowledge that you gain can be applied to your own life to help keep you safer.",
                "This class was a good review of a lot of the microbiology and immunology that was taught in my AP Bio class. It was interesting to get a more focused approach to learning all of these basics of biology. The class fosters a good environment for asking questions, and shows us how to ask more meaningful questions. It also helped me with my more technical writing."

                "strengths - prof belperron is very knowledgeable, the diversity of exam mechanisms was great and the course spread was cool. i enjoyed the essay and panel discussion\r\nweaknesses -  i think sometimes prof belperron's knowledge of the content can be a drawback as it tends to overburden and confuse students and assumes some level of prior knowledge. The midterm and quizzes were way more intense than they had to be. There was a broad mismatch in class ethos between big picture and minor details - we are asked to focus on bog picture issues during prep but penalized and questioned on the most minor details about each disease.",
                "This course was very detailed and interesting, however the material was very heavy and I was not prepared for the fast pace of the class. Professor Belperron did a good job of slowing down when asked to.",
                "Strengths: Professor Belperron went into a lot of detail and was very willing to answer any (and as many) questions as we had. Weaknesses: There was so much material to cover so things do get confusing about halfway through the semester. But you are warned of this at the beginning of the class and as I said, the professor is very understanding of the fact that she is hitting you with a bunch of complicated material and willing to take the time to help you understand if you just ask.",
                "Strengths - many different form of assessment so you has the opportunity to develop skills in exams, presentations and paper writing as well as diversify your grades.",
                "The course was a little too difficult for most non-science majors in my opinion, though the curve helped remedy that.  I just wish we had spent a little more time on more general stuff and not so much on the intricacies of various scientific processes that we were never going to comprehend in one class's time.",
                "Strengths of the course are its depth, its accessibility, and its desire to teach basics without condescension. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses are the format: reliance on slideshows instead of more thought-out explanations (I personally would have loved some writing on a chalk board but that might have just been me) and the reading assignments for homework, instead of work problems to review the material more actively."

                "I am not a science major, but I also wanted to fulfill my science requirements with classes that were actually interesting to me. This class was so good and I learned so much about vector-borne diseases. It was all at a level that I could understand with my limited science background, but the lessons had a lot of depth and this class was definitely a lot of work, too. I would definitely recommend.",
                "IT IS NOT A GUT - if you are interested in malaria and dengue, and have the time and effort to give this class - take it. It is a LOT of work.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student especially in todays health crisis. It is super important and helpful for everybody to understand the basics of human immunology.",
                "Yes! It is definitely not a gut science credit but it is so interesting and you get so much out of it.",
                "I think if you are actually quite interested in the subject matter, you'll learn a lot.  This is not a gut, though, and if you're looking for an easy science credit I'd look elsewhere.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I would caution them that it is very challenging and the sheer amount of content can be a bit overwhelming at times, but it is so interesting and worth learning about.",
                "No. The class is advertised for non-STEM students, but I think that's a bit of a stretch and that the class required some speed\/prior knowledge in biology. I thought the most interesting parts of the course were when there was discussions about the global implications of the diseases we were studying, and would have liked a more balanced approach to learning about the diseases. I didn't understand why the class was so reading-heavy when the material seemed to be more suited towards work that allowed the students to solve problems instead of just memorizing."
