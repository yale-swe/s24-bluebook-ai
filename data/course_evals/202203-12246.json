Materials in class were difficult to follow and impossible to determine what we were actually supposed to be learning. We were often told that the material in class was \"simple\" or \"obvious\" and that poor scores on the problem sets were not due to the problem sets being too hard or poor teaching, but rather due to us not being able to understand the \"very simple\" material being presented. \r\n\r\nThis class has the potential to be very engaging, if it were taught by someone who could actually teach in a way that made sense and organized feedback well.",
                "Weaknesses: Lectures are not engaging. Homeworks are too challenging to do on your own or in groups without the help of the teaching fellow. Homework corrections were simply noted wrong with no hints towards the proper solution."

                "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! I spent way too long each week trying to complete the problem sets only to receive no feedback on what I did wrong. I felt ridiculed when I attended class and was told that the material should be obvious, when I could not determine the objectives of what we were learning. There was little assistance provided when it came to preparing for exams, which then asked the most detailed questions I could not have known to study. While the topics sound interesting on paper, it is not worth the time, energy, and distress that comes with the class.",
                "No. Unless you absolutely have to take it or another professor is teaching it. If you are an undergrad on the OAC track, make sure you've taken fluids and an intro class first."
