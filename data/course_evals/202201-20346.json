                "By taking this course, you learn how to look at Yale in a new light.  Approach parts of its history from better angles.  You learn about parts of Yale you never would have thought to think of before and the people who brought us to where we are today, some 300 years after its founding.  I wish every Yale student could take this class.",

Prof G is a wealth of knowledge and has so many interesting tidbits on Yale's connections to many famous American brands, companies, and other. This class makes you feel much more connected to Yale than any other class."

                "This is an iconic Yale course that I believe every student should aim to take. The syllabus was thoughtfully crafted, the courses were dynamic and engaging, and Professor Gitlin was just excellent. No weaknesses to speak of except the fact that it had to end!",
                "Professor Gitlin and his enthusiasm for history were by far the best part of this course. This kind of class is the reason I love history: It allowed me to ask the question, \"What is this thing I'm part of?\" and find solace in studying that which is bigger than me. Our class' universal love for Gitlin also gave us something to bond overit even lead to us all becoming friends and hanging out outside the classroom. This class is a course, but it is also a community and a tradition, one that I felt especially lucky to be a part of every time Professor Gitlin shared essays written by former \"Yale and America\" students.",
                "This course is amazing-- you leave with an entirely new appreciation for Yale. Professor Gitlin's teaching style is the main strength of the course. It is fun and engaging.",
                "This is the best course at Yale. You want to take it.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gitlin really emphasizes classroom community at the beginning of the semester, so the people you take this course with will become peers as well as friends by the end of the semester. This made going to class a really fun experience full of smiles and laughter. The class material is super interesting and interactivethere are guest speakers, documentaries, and even tours of the Grove Street Cemetery that give this class its charm. \r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "Strength: Prof G is such a wonderful man and he is not afraid to cut against the grain as far as telling it like it is. We also learn how to have some real fellowship and fun, unlike most Yale classes nowadays. Weakness: At times the quality of the historical scholarship is questionable.",
                "Strengths- Everything.  Prof. Gitlin, the guest speakers, the field trips, the camaraderie, the subject matter, the discussion.  It's all perfect.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Wouldn't change a thing.",
                "One strength in this course is the fun activities, such as a performance of a Cole Porter song, a visit to Mory's, or a visit to Grove Street Cemetery. Prof. Gitlin wants to make sure students see all sorts of different sides to Yale. \r\nOne weakness is that the discussion isn't super in-depth; it's more of a professor-led discussion, so its difficult to bridge off of others' points and do deep dives into a specific question."

And the students who take this class are wonderful and truly excited about Yale and its history.  There is a wonderful sense of community in our class that has made the course really special.  And reviving historic Yale traditions is wonderfully fun, too!",
                "Absolutely, 100% yes. The course is low-stress and high reward, and the community the class creates is unmatched among Yale courses. I can promise, you will not regret taking Yale and America!",
                "I'm already recommending it to every Yalie I talk to, history major or not. This was one of the best classes of my Yale career, inspiring questions that I'll carry with me for a long time. Not only would I recommend this course to another student, but it is also the kind of course I would recommend to every (Yale) student.",
                "When I write that this is the best course at Yale, I do not consider it an exaggeration. Gitlin is really the most caring, interesting profesor. He is the best",
                "Take this course if you can get in!!! I cannot recommend it more strongly. Professor Gitlin is amazing and truly cares about his students both inside and outside the classroom. The course is fun and engaging and you leave with a whole new perspective and appreciation for Yale.",
                "If you can get into Prof Gs class, youre golden. Its so enjoyable, exciting and special. Its not just about the class, but about the connection. He cares for his students in a way others simply do not.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! You will remember this class far beyond graduationit is so so special.",
                "Gitlin is great   you must take this course before you graduate!",
                "Yes! You should take the class simply for the sake of meeting and interacting with Prof G. But you will also get to reflect on the Yale experience and ask tough questions without the fear of speaking your mind. This last part is great because in many classes students just say what they think the teacher wants to hear or are afraid of backlash from fellow students for having insensitive views.",
                "Absolutely- this is the ultimate Yale course.  The pinnacle of undergraduate learning at our unique school.  If you are able to get in, take it and you will not regret it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in looking more into understanding Yale's history through both the development of the university and the impact of its alumni. If you're looking for a more chill seminar style course, this is definitely a good fit.",
