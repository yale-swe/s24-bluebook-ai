                "This course will increase your familiarity with Latin poetry in a manageable way. Constantly working and engaging with the Latin went a long way to making me better at reading Latin, even as someone without a Classics or even Humanities major.",
                "This class solidified a lot of my Latin grammar and vocabulary knowledge and also helped me become more comfortable with reading long passages of Latin. The class helped my reading comprehension skills, and also gave me practice talking about passages of Latin in a literary sense, not just in a \"correctly translate the passage\" sense.",
                "This course was geared towards improving Latin grammar, historical understanding, and analytical skills. The epistolary Latin that we read was an interesting way of thinking about perspective and authorship.",
                "As a bridge, this course focused on both improving grammatical knowledge and sentence structure as well as incorporating analysis of the literature itself.",
                "Translating Latin texts, comparing Latin texts to their Ancient Greek counterparts, analyzing the role of women in the ancient world, Latin grammar, scanning elegiac couplets",
                "This course did a very good job at bridging modern and classical texts.I gained insight on how important it is to analyze the intended audience of a letter or text as much as it is to analyze the writer.",
                "This class helped me improve my translation skills. I worked with Professor Peirano and our TF Chris Londa to practice scansion, translation, analysis, and my pronunciation of Latin. By the end of the course, I had a significantly better grasp of case usages, declensions, conjugations, and grammar.",

            "comments": [
                "The course was very well managed, and I dont have much to say about improvement. Maybe a group project where students can work together to interpret the Latin as group discussions were by far the most valuable part of the lecture.",
                "The course was well organized. I really, really loved the variation in weekly assignments. It was great to practice at sight translation, literary translation, grammar quizzes, syntax presentations, analyzing a film in the context of Ovid, and so much more. The variation in weekly assignments was a great strength of the course. The instructor and teaching fellow were also amazing. I don't think I would change anything about how the class was structured broadly. On a more specific level, I wish the class had gone into small breakout room discussions more. The discussions we did were with the whole class, and I feel like sometimes the professor talked to much and the students didn't have enough time to talk. I would have preferred breakout rooms of around 4 students so that we could actually get our ideas out there. I felt like whole-class discussions were just high pressure and stressful and everyone was kind of competing to get a word in. I think breakout rooms would have solved this problem and I would have been able to participate more.",
                "The strengths of this course include the consistent nature of the work, the help and resources available, and the interesting material. This course was challenging due to the material that was assumed to be known before taking it, namely an understanding of other classical texts and their authors.",
                "I think one of the greatest strengths of this class was the division of grammar focus in section with a more general discussion of the readings in class.",
                "Strengths: the content, I enjoyed reading the Heroides, small size of the class was also good, Professor Peirano Garrison was great\r\nWeaknesses: I expected more review of Latin grammar considering this was the bridge course, I was very rusty in Latin coming into this class and I felt like at points it wasn't the smoothest reintroduction into translating",
                "The inclusion of modern text and performance is a strength. I also found the running translation notes to be a helpful way to review and compare my translation techniques to those of fellow classmates",
                "One of the strengths of this course was that everyone was very engaged. In class, you are called on to read Latin and to give your translations for the sections. We always knew what we would be going over in class, and we read interesting supplementary materials that bolstered our understanding of the letters and their context. Also, the course was very organized. However, you have to work to become comfortable with grammar and deconstructing sentences. In the lines, we were prepared to answer any question about parsing and the relationship between the words. It could get stressful. However, many of the quizzes could be taken repeatedly, and we always had at least a week to do the weekly assignments. The lowest scores were dropped, and we could choose which ones we wanted to do; the downside to this was that answer keys weren't released, but there was always the option to meet and go over the assignments.",
                "This was my class with the highest amount of work this semester. At times there was too much work to be able to truly engage with it. Otherwise, the fact that we concentrated on translation was very useful.\r\nI would have liked us to devote a little more attention to scansion. Sometimes the theory felt less useful than the actual engagement with the texts. I also think the experimental tests were rather successful.",
                "Please increase time for in-class translation of material covered for homework",
                "The seminar style of this course is effective for getting personal feedback from the professor as well as your peers. Our professor and TF had a good approach to helping students improve sight-translating. One big strength of the course is that we were allowed a lot of freedom in our papers, and thus we were only limited by creativity - this made analysis extremely fun. Another strength is the multitude of connections we were able to make through Ovid's Heroides, which contains plenty of themes that are still present in modern media today."

The professor and teaching fellow were great, and this is a good class for people who are looking to solidify their knowledge of Latin grammar and also move on to analyzing the text as a work of literature as well as a work written in Latin.",

As a bridge course, this was a great way of taking high level Latin without overwhelming line assignments or a lack of grammatical analysis\/foundational work. The material was interesting and engaging, and the variety of assignments was nice.",

                "Yes, the work isn't bad and the material of the course is interesting. Professor Peirano Garrison was great, but I also know she's leaving after this semester",
