                "KG's class brought to light a whole host of ethical questions regarding the law that I had never considered before. This class taught me to be a better thinker and even a better person by considering not just what the law says about a certain topic, but also considering what it should have said. This is one of the few classes I've had where I have been able to interrogate my personal values, especially about the justice system, and openly explore alternative ways of addressing the many problems with the carceral system.",
                "Even as a PLSC major and someone with experience in criminal law, I learned SO much from this class! Our readings and discussions taught me a great deal about constitutional amendments and the jurisprudence surrounding them, and how they tangibly impact individuals' lives. I also learned to critically think about case law in a way I hadn't before."

                "I honestly cannot think of a way this class could have been improved -- the syllabus was well structured and our readings were fascinating, we were exposed to many different points of view on each issue, and no matter what we always were encouraged to share our personal beliefs and opinions on our topics. The seminar discussion was super engaging and genuinely fun while also covering serious and important topics."

                "Yes if you're interested in the criminal justice system.",
                "Yes, absolutely. My favorite courses at Yale are ones where the instructor is solely dedicated to helping students learn and making the class an enjoyable experience. KG's class is the epitome of that. The material was highly interesting, the conversations and debates were dynamic, and the class was the highlight of my week instead of being a stress.",
