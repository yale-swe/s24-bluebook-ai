   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about epigenetics and how to read scientific literature critically.",
    "I learned a lot about the new and exciting field of Epigenetics and greatly improved my ability to read primary literature.",
    "I learned to read scientific papers, to learn more about the process of epigenetics and how it's different from another biological process. To be honest, i think paper reading is a great skill that I learned from this class. Although it's a little hard, the papers are good to build scientific knowledge.",
    "The course begins with an overview of mechanisms of epigenetic regulation and finishes with an interesting look at those mechanisms in the context of genome defense, cancer, and other diseases, and you leave feeling like you understand so much more about the complexity of development and health beyond DNA.",
    "I learned how to read and understand papers and analyze figures. I honestly felt like even though I am a senior in the major, I havent had the opportunity to learn how to read and understand papers. Professors Jacob and Dmitrova were fantastic discussion facilitators.",
    "I learned about the latest knowledge in the field of epigenetics-- the molecular mechanisms and implications for future research. I learned how to effectively and critically read, discuss and present scientific literature.",
    "I learned a ton about recent advances in epigenetics, which is a field I knew little about before taking the course. We learned many techniques about how to study DNA methylation and nucleosome modifications. We discussed papers weekly and I feel able to tackle any epigenetics paper I come across."

   "comments": [
    "The class was set up wonderfully in which we learned things in lecture on one day and then discussed primary literature that related to that content the next day. It was a really great way to apply what was learned. The exams were a bit tricky. It would have been nice to know whether our exams were getting curved. It seemed like everyone in the class was doing pretty well, so I hope that grading is in our favor.",
    "I thought the three quiz format was a great way to facilitate learning.",
    "Strengths are the student-led discussion, the professors, TA\r\nWeakness: content is challenging but I think it's great to learn. I also like the applied aspect of biology that we had to learn, I think reading several papers is unrealistic because it would take me a lot of time to read through them.",
    "The strength of the course was the alternating lecture and discussion sections on a topical paper on the preceding lectures topic. This solidified what was learned in lecture and provides an opportunity to become competent in reading scientific literature. The three exams were well-placed and manageable, and the video and writing assignments were fun yet an indication of how much had been learned.",
    "A non-tense, supportive yet simultaneously challenging learning environment where I gained confidence in my ability to learn about science and understand experimental approaches and studies. I absolutely loved this class, and the professors were the best I could ask for! No weaknesses!",
    "A strength of the course was the switching back and forth from a lecture format to a discussion format. I loved learning the material during lectures (both were great lecturers), and it was nice to have that background from the lecture to guide the reading of the discussion papers.",
    "I loved the format: one lecture and one discussion per week. It kept me engaged in the course and encouraged critical thinking."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It is a great way to learn about a topic and then contextualize it in light of current research occurring in the field.",
    "Yes, this is an excellent MCDB elective. Not an overwhelming work load but you still definitely get a lot out of it.",
    "yes! just make sure you are ready to take a upper-level MCDB class and put in the work to read scientific papers, overall it's a fun and enjoyable experience. I did feel like people had different levels of knowledge, there was one kid who knew everything and some of us didn't know all of the techniques, but it's doable with extra help from the professors, TA. The papers are great to read and super interesting at times!",
    "I would recommend this course to any biology student as it related to medicine and disease more directly than some of the other MCDB courses and is very fascinating and well-taught.",
    "Absolutely! Take this class. The professors were the best MCDB professors I have ever had, and I felt supported throughout the course.",
    "Yes! Epigenetics is a great upper level MCDB course. I really enjoyed the format of the class. The professors were also super nice and helpful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The teachers are amazing. I did not realize how fascinating epigenetics is before taking this class. No complaints about  this class, every MCDB major should take it",
    "Yes! Amazing professors and really interesting topics",
    "Yes, definitely! The subject was incredibly interesting and the format of the course is well-designed. The lectures were engaging and I enjoyed every minute of the course."
