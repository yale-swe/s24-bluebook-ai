    "I learned what is was like to be part of a professional opera production: an invaluable experience.",
    "Learned a lot about the history of early Italian opera and also performance techniques for this",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of baroque opera. I learned about the history of opera. We also performed a fully staged baroque opera.",
    "The most hands-on work at Yale--learning about historical performance and modern theatrical practice all at the same time. Amazing experience."

   "comments": [
    "This course is a huge time commitment. I don't think that was adequately explained to people. Also, I think some more emphasis on screening for music literacy and overall commitment during auditions would be helpful.",
    "It was an excellent course.",
    "It is a lot of time, but it kind of has to be.",
    "Great performance practice and connection to academic and historical understandings of opera; it would be great if there was a larger focus on Italian diction",
    "The beginning of the course was kind of slow, especially if you had a smaller part in the opera. However, once the rehearsal process started, the class definitely picked up. It is a big time commitment but it was a lot of fun because a lot of my friends were also in the class. It was a great opportunity to work in a professional environment as well.",
    "The course and rehearsal schedule is intensive, but the payoff is definitely worth it"

   "comments": [
    "Yes. If you wanna sing opera, this is the best and most professional way to do it at Yale.",
    "Yes! - dont give up an opportunity to be part of a professional, quality production.",
    "It is a wonderful experience, and the time is worth it if you're into it.",
    "YBOP is so much fun! It's also a very intense production process so be prepared to spend a lot of time on it at the end of the semester -- it's super worth it!!!",
    "YES YES YES! this is hands down one of the best courses at yale. To even call it a course is insulting because it is so much more than just a class. It's unlikely you'll get performance opportunities like this immediately after graduating so take advantage of it! You'll get to be in a fully staged and costumed production with professional directors and crew members working tirelessly to put on these spectacular shows.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in opera or baroque instruments. It is such a niche subject, and there is no other program like this in the country. It is super cool! I feel very lucky to have had this experience.",
    "Yes--all musicians at Yale should want to be involved; there is no course or opportunity like it here."
