It made me question so many assumptions I made about democracy and how we could redefine it for the future. This course renewed some optimism about the world for me.",

This is an issue that strikes at the heart of our countries and democracies and a more critical understanding of the things we take for granted in politics is something that everyone should strive for. This course does precisely that and argues for a bold new shift in the way we think about politics. Whether or not you agree at the end of the day, the readings and assignments will at the very least get you to think deeply about deliberative democracy as an alternative on multiple scales, and hopefully provide at least some direction forward.\r\n\r\nProfessor Landemore is also very established in this field and is more than willing to provide further resources and readings if need be.",
