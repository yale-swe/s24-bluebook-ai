                "Through this course deepened my understanding of the Silk Road, and a deeper understanding of art and history as well.",
                "Some insight into how art historians analyze pieces with historical context.",
                "The class is an extensive overview of the regions, cultures, objects, and visual motifs found throughout the extensive Silk Roads region. It's a lot of interesting material, touching on peoples and cultures typically left out of discussions about the region like the Yuezhi and the Kushan made all the more interesting given their impact on the Eurasion continent as a whole.",
                "Learned a lot about civilizations along the Silk Road ( even ones that aren't mentioned as often in historical records ). Also incredible things to note about the connections between different cultures and motifs that are repeated in art objects across time and space.",
                "Learning about the Silk Road",
                "I honestly did not learn too much aside from writing essays, the classes just contained lots of random objects (almost no texts on the slides) presented without a thesis",
                "Learned great insight into how artistic motifs and information travelled across the silk road, and a variety of case studies of how this happened. It is truly stunning the extent of the cultural & artistic interconnectedness of this region, and professor Yiengpruksawan did a great job of conveying this understanding.",
                "I learned about the different peoples, regions, and visual cultures across the Silk Roads; common motifs and workmanship techniques across a variety of Eurasian civilizations; and I had the opportunity to engage with Silk Roads history from a different perspective than the 10th grade history class version that centered around artisans and the flows of material culture through diplomacy, trade, conflict and migration. I also learned how to craft visual analysis-based arguments of works of art and how to write short analytical papers about a specific object and its historical context.",
                "Various cultures and civilizations along the Silk Road (Scythians, Xiongnu, Xianbei, Sasanians, Sogdians, Sarmatians, Sui-Tang Empire, Kushan Empire), various art forms (sculpture, drinking vessels, tapestries, mosaics)",
                "I learned that art history has a lot more depth and breadth than I initially thought. I also learned about specific cultures and their art forms.",

                "This was a nice overview of artifacts across Eurasia and across millennia. I did not feel like I learned much concrete, as many of the presentations involved somewhat ill-substantiated theories. The assignments were nice and open-ended, so you got to choose what (and if) you learned anything.",
                "I learned how to analyze art in a historical context, understanding cultural and socioeconomic implications, as well.",

                "- I enjoyed exploring the various interesting pieces of art\r\n- It was exciting to have trips to the art gallery, and I particularly enjoyed the session with the ancient coins and the session at Sterling",
                "The course is overall very well structured. I would say that more visits to the YUAG would improve the course, but I understand that covid restrictions made this difficult. In addition, I think the course's digital infrastructure would be improved by including a quick description of each object shown in lecture that is connected back to the museum which holds the object in case students want to explore more how the museum presents the object to viewers. At times, I found it difficult to find the sources for more information for the objects discussed in lecture.",
                "The professor is very knowledgeable and taught me a lot about history and art, I really enjoyed the course",
                "Strengths: Mimi is an amazing professor, the Brief Notes and the final project can be done in a variety of different formats, the material is fascinating, and the lectures are recorded. No major weaknesses.",
                "There are a LOT of readings in order to cover each region and subject in any amount of reasonable depth. As a second semester senior taking 5 credits that workload was simply intractable and I simply was not able to go as in depth as I would have liked. It's not a weakness of the course as much a reality that in order to get the most out of it, you have to put in a lot of time and effort that may be hard to justify. The papers, discussion posts, and final projects (all the graded assignments) are not a huge obstacle, but there is a ton of material to get through.",
                "Strengths: All course materials, from lecture PowerPoints to recordings, are readily available on Canvas. Assignments are not hard and were a way to explore and engage with the material. The final project is super flexible so you can go in any way with the topics discussed in the lecture. Professor Mimi really cares about the topics and is super open to discussion. This class has no weaknesses.",
                "I liked that it was recorded so I was able to go back and review the material",
                "Strengths - lots of independent work through the form of essays, Weaknesses - kind of disorganized and boring and way too much writing (10-12 page final paper + 4 times 4-page paper = 26-28 pages of writing)...",
                "Conveyed the intuitions and understandings of the material without excessive work assignments. Loved the final project and its flexibility of medium.",
                "The strengths of this course were the responsive/available teaching fellows, widespread types of artworks presented in engaging lectures, and Professor Yiengpruksawan who provided great feedback on short writing assignments and was accommodating with deadlines.\r\n\r\nOne thing that might be improved is making the course cap a little smaller so that the students can go to the object study rooms in the YUAG for section. That said, section was really helpful and my teaching fellow always had activities for object analysis or curation exercises which were still productive and helpful despite not being with the actual objects, and we took trips to handle objects in various collections throughout the semester anyway.",
                "Strengths: Mimi is incredibly knowledgeable about the topic, and her passion for the course really shows.\r\nWeaknesses: Each class felt a little disconnected with each other. Coming from a non-art history background, I found it slightly difficult to follow along with all the various cultures and civilization we were learning about. It would have been useful learn about the relevant time period and the history of each of the civilizations we covered.",
                "I think that the class excelled at giving students a detailed understanding of cultures. However, given my not having had previous experience with the time period, I think the class could have been improved with a more basic-level introduction to the subject matter.",
                "The course is very fun and is designed to provide a relaxing learning environment. One problem is that grading for the brief notes varies widely based on which TA you have. Overall, the course is very fun and engaging and I would highly recommend it, especially because you gain wide exposure to arts from all over the continent, such as Iran, India, and China.",
                "I very much enjoyed the chill and relaxing nature of this course.",
                "The strengths include visits to art galleries that engage topics being learned in class.",
                "I think one of the strengths was the breadth of material that we covered. A lot of the topics are not usually taught in other history or art courses. However, there was just way too much material on the canvas page far more than can be read or explored each week which made it very hard to prioritize the most important readings. This course also did not teach any of the context of the societies we talked about, that material had to be learned through readings and on our own.",
                "Really enjoyed this class. My biggest critique was that we jumped into some time periods/cultures that I had quite literally never heard of. Would have appreciated some more background, historical info before diving into material history. I liked that it was asynchronous. Not too much semester work to ever feel overwhelming which meant could just engage in the material without being stressed. Liked the free form writing assignments",
                "I loved the course load and final project structure. Great class",
                "I really didn't have any problems with this course. I thought that it was extremely well organized and the prof was very open to answering questions and being available for students. The assignments made sense and I felt like the workload was appropriate for a 100-leevel art history course.",
                "I liked the open-ended essay prompts where you pick an object to write about. It allowed me to really engage with the material and enjoy the assignment. I wish there was a little more structure to what was expected in our responses though.",
                "Great course.",
                "A lot of reading but amazing content and amazing professor",
                "I loved the Sogdian talk outside of class. I wish there were more access to talks like this outside of lecture. Also I dont remember art history ever being defined in the course. I think I maybe wouldve liked for there to be a class or two covering general art history methods.",
                "Strengths: interesting subject matter \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes hard to keep track of",
                "Professor Yiengpruksawan was awesome. I don't know how the course could be improved.",
                "While the material was interesting, the readings were rather redundant. The course could benefit from more structure so that less students skip lecture.",
                "I think the course's material is very well planned out and can be engaging if you are genuinely interested in the content and self motivated to attend lectures, but otherwise the course could be improved by making lectures more interactive and maybe at a different time of day / not a 9am? As a 100 level art history course I also found the reading and lecture material to be quite dense / made the content less approachable, though the deliverables were very doable outside of the readings."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a fantastic way to cover a wide swathe of history without losing nuance and while gaining an appreciation for the interconnectedness of regions that we are often taught to view as disparate.",

                "Yes! Mimi is a fantastic professor and the course grants you a lot of flexibility when it comes to assignments, so it's a very stress-free environment. You can also express your creativity in your assignments, and it was really fun to make websites and infographics instead of writing essays. The subject is also fascinating, and while this course focuses on breadth more than depth, you will learn a great deal - I personally felt that the course enriched not only my understanding of the Silk Roads, but also engaged my critical thinking and made me more attentive when visiting museums.",
                "Yes! For students looking for a chill class and want to learn more about the history behind the Silk Road through the lens of an art historian! TAKE IT.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, great class to learn about art history",
                "I'm not sure I would  - the total 26-28 pages of writing throughout the course gets a bit annoying really soon... especially having to hand in 4-page brief notes (which are like papers) FOUR times throughout the semester gets so irritating and the final project is really long at 10-12 pages. It feels like you have constant deadlines! Also I have no idea how the blog posts or the discussion sections are graded. This class looks like a gut but is not really, you will still need to put in work to do well and it'll feel like you're ALWAYS doing assignments for this class. Plus it seems like everyone is getting good grades and they can't give everyone As and A-, so how will they differentiate between people? I'm so confused, also the lectures were not great and it seemed disorganized. Honestly take it Credit/D coz you'll definitely pass but maybe not for a grade if you're risk averse.",
                "Yes, it provided a great introduction to art history in a fascinating region that exemplifies some of the key concepts to understand in the field.",
                "I would really recommend this course to another student whether you're an art history major or not. The lectures are interesting, the teaching fellows are really responsive and engaging, and there are trips to Sterling archives, the YUAG, and we went to the numismatic collection to handle coins at the YUAG as well. The course is a great balance between art history, object analysis, and an introduction to curatorial choices with the final project where you can design your own online exhibit, as well as a couple section activities geared toward curation. It got me thinking a lot more about analytical methods in art history, and the lectures incorporate a lot of information that's useful if you're interested in Silk Roads history from an art historical lens, or just Asian art more broadly. A really engaging introductory course and this semester, the recorded lectures didn't need to be attended in person which was so helpful for scheduling. The teaching team is flexible and cares about the well being of the students and de-stressing is really prioritized.",
                "It was a great intro class which wasn't very demanding and was very accommodating. Great entrypoint into art history though a bit broad in scope for my tastes as an art history major",
                "Yes! The professor gave excellent lectures, and my TF was very dedicated as well (eg: email correspondence, meeting outside of class, etc).",
                "Yes, absolutely. As someone who had absolutely no art history background, this class was super super accessible. I learned a lot of new information in a very low stress, and organized manner. I had a lot of fun with the subject matter, and the work load was very manageable. Highly recommend as a fun class to take, or as a humanities credit!!",
                "Absolutely. As a stats major, this was my first humanities course and I must say it was one that I enjoyed quite a bit. I don't have a huge interest in art or history either and I still managed to enjoy the course.",
                "If you want to learn a bit about the Silk Road and have little work, yes! If you want rigorous analyses of artifacts, probably not (but this might apply to all of HSAR).",
                "Yes, it was a super fulfilling intro art history course for someone who wants to try out the subject.",
                "Only if they have good background knowledge on the history of the Silk Road.",
                "Yes, good intro art history class and not a lot of work. Easy to disengage and still do well, which people could read as a pro or a con. Love learning about new cultures. Love going to the YUAG. Really nice teaching staff",

                "YES! If you are interested in art history, history, or anything in between it is a great class to take. I also think it would be very good for someone who isn't an art history or history major because the material is very easy to understand.",
                "This is a good course if you are interested in art in the Silk Road era. It teaches you about history and art. It allows you to work on your writing skills and learn about history.",
