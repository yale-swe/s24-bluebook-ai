This course couldn't be improved--it was wonderful. \r\nThe only thing I would change is that it is hard to get into, and I know many Yale students would enjoy and benefit from this course.",
                "This course's main strength rests in the class discussions we have about the readings (which shed light on best practices in journalism) and our classmates' writings.",
                "Strengths: Classroom dynamic is wonderful, full of people who are passionate about journalism and have interesting things to say about it. The profile assignment is such a lovely way to get to know everyone, and the reporting project is a valuable challenge (even though I found the experience of reporting for a grade to be a little weird, but maybe that is just me). Susan Dominus is the best!\r\nWeaknesses: I would have loved a little bit more discussion of the readings during class time! I also am kind of of the opinion that the reporting project does not need to be longer than the profile -- I almost would have liked them to be equal length, and to have half of the class spent on each. I also think I would have benefitted from having to pitch and turn in sections of the reporting project a bit earlier.",
                "a huge strength of this class is the flexible seminar/workshop format. i felt like our class got along really well and the dialogue was very generative. comments from both prof. dominus and the other students really improved my work!",
                "Timing of the assignments was rough. Final could perhaps be a smaller endeavor",
                "Honestly a great class all around. Readings could be lighter since we dont spend a ton of time discussing them and were working on independent pieces, but discussing them is still super helpful!"

                "YES! I learned so much from this class, and found the experience of closely studying the craft of journalism to be such a valuable experience (and not one that's really available to you at Yale outside of this class). I thought it was a pretty perfect balance of readings, academic work, outside reporting, and classroom discussion. Take it, and take it with Sue!",
                "i would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone interested in journalism! it gives you the really once in a lifetime opportunity to learn with a world class editor/reporter, learning tricks of the trade and details about the industry that are enriching and inspiring. this course will give you a whole different level of understanding of nonfiction and journalism moving forward, even if you only continue as a casual reader.",
