    "Definitely the most procedural (I mean that positively) learning process I've had at Yale. Expanded my French comprehension vastly without me even knowing!!",
    "In FREN 120, we continued to learn how to speak, write, and read French, with a focus on speaking the language. We finished learning most of the basic verb conjugations and their applications. Following this class, I feel significantly more proficient in French than after last semester.",
    "This course has given me a good working knowledge of the French Language.  I have taken french for a long time, and this is the first time that I can say this.",
    "Listening, speaking, reading and speaking in French with a focus of correct grammar."

   "comments": [
    "I was happy with the course on all fronts, but am hoping in the future weekly tests can be integrated within the normal class schedule.",
    "i loved the weekly tests because they forced me to learn the language well without cramming at the end,.",
    "In this class, we used a collection of Yale-produced videos from the 80s called French in Action (FiA). I felt that the FiA videos were very helpful. I think that it would be difficult or at least different to learn French without them. For this reason, I would strongly recommend that FiA is updated so that future generations of French students can still use it. I thought that the weekly tests were a good way to force students to know the material bit by bit.",
    "Strengths:\r\n-French in Action is a really good program. The video-workbook-class combination works very well in my opinion. Also, following a general storyline makes remembering vocabulary and expressions more natural\r\n-Weekly tests help you keep up with the material and progress well\r\n-All the professors are excellent\r\n-The course packet is very helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-It seems like in class some professors cover more\/less material than others or assign more\/less work the others. It's bound to happen but I think there should be more of an effort to equalize as much as possible between sections of different professors\r\n-The French in Action videos themselves are kind of old. Not a huge deal, they're still very helpful, but it's just a little weird sometimes\r\n-Evening tests can be inconvenient, especially if there's one every week",
    "The course is strong, great Professor in Matuku Ngame.  It has a high workload, but if you do the homework and learn the material, you will learn French.",
    "I loved class time but having the tests in the evening was very annoying. I would rather they were in class time once a week."
