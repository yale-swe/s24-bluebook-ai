By crafting an argument-based paper, an OpEd, and an analysis of scholarly works, I feel much more confident in tackling papers for future classes. My style of writing and argumentative skills also improved, as I'm able to better critique my own work and improve my writing.",
                "Developed college-level writing structure (claims + sub-claims, etc.), how to create arguments and back it up with reasons, the idea of warrants",
                "The course provided me with the knowledge I need to write a well-structured and cohesive research paper. I have learned how to conduct proper academic citations, how to come up with a nuanced thesis, and how to engage with counterarguments. This course specifically provided me with a lot of insights on the ethicality of implementing Artificial Intelligence systems in the most important domains of our lives from the schools in our education system to the way we vote and participate in politics.",
                "I developed the ability to identify a warrant in others' claims, defend my own, and debate about claims in real time. I also strengthened my ability in writing  longer academic papers.",
                "Writing well, discussing and presenting topics related to AI research",
                "There were two primary positive skills that I developed in this course. The first was about how to engage in academic conversations. Each week, we had a course blog about an issue that pertained to AI. The students would each lead one course blog discussion and everyone in class would participate. It was a fun and rewarding experience that helped me learn how to speak about my own experiences, and how those experiences pertain to the issue at hand. The next skill that I learned was how to make contributions to research. I learned about gathering sources--getting a feel for the academic conversation--understanding where my idea fits in that conversation, and how to frame my idea to have the greatest impact on my target audience. I learned so much about the importance of and how to advance the academic conversation.",
                "I developed a solid and fundamental approach to writing a research paper that I can apply to other courses that require 8-10 page research-based papers. I think that having this framework is going to be extremely useful to me. I had to write one paper similar to this throughout all of high school, and we weren't really given the proper structure to approach it. I had a significantly better experience doing it this time around in English 114. I also learned (from our course blog discussions) how to be in a classroom setting where the discussion is actually driven by the students and not the teacher.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: lots of opportunities for feedback (professors and peers), writing process was a slow buildup so nothing felt too overwhelming\r\nWeaknesses: lots of small day-to-day assignments - some of which seemed a little bit tedious",
                "Strengths: Good checkpoints between assignments (so it doesn't clump up/feel like too much work at once), in class discussion opportunities, readings not too long but also quite insightful (both for writing and for the topics covered in the course), feedback very applicable, Dr. Klemann is very understanding good at working with students, opportunities to meet with her outside of class if necessary\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing in particular, to be honest",
                "No particular weaknesses.\r\nStrengths in course structure and materials and quality of instruction.",
                "Firstly, the course has multifarious and extensive opportunities for students to succeed. Because we are required to write 2-3 \"drafts\" or \"versions\" of every academic paper that eventually receives a letter grade, we are able to incorporate feedback we receive on every \"draft\" or \"version\" in all pieces of writing that have \"high stakes\" and play a role in our final grade. This is incredible because it removes a lot of stress and prevents us from procrastinatingthe drafts are spaced out pretty well, forcing you to consistently work on your papers. The course isn't fundamentally \"weak\" in any way, but to make the course more exciting, I would suggest inviting more \"guest speakers\" or \"guest lecturers\" who produce work that pertains to the theme of the course.",
                "I particularly enjoyed the course blogs and hands-on experience that this course gives the students. There are few assignments where students do not have some choice on what they would like to explore. My favorite assignment was the P3 since it both connected my interests as well as the course material that we had been working on all semester.",
                "This class was very well organized and a nice mix between learning how to write and learning about the subject about which we were writing. The teaching was engaging and I never felt that we were doing \"busy work\".",
                "One of the strengths of this course is that it's writing intensive, and that alone helped me improve my writing. Another strength of this course is that since it has a small class size, each student receives individual, personalized feedback on their writing assignments. This feedback was extremely helpful to me for improving my writing. I think that having individual, personalized feedback also caters to each student's level of writing when they begin the course, and this makes the course focused first and foremost on each student's improvement. I liked that in my English 114 section, we were required to meet with our professor at least 3 times throughout the semester. If this isn't a requirement across all the English 114 sections, I think that it should be. Similarly, I think that each 114 section should have a course blog if that's not the case. Other than that, I don't really have any other suggestions for how the course could be improved. I personally had a great experience in the course.",
                "This course offers a wide variety of material (from movies to research papers), it teaches many different types of writing, the discussions allow for a deeper understanding, and the assignments are very useful in learning to become a better writer. I received amazing, in-depth feedback from Professor Klemann, and she really helped me think creatively, try new things, and experiment with my writing rather than just write mechanically. Although I loved so many parts of this course, some of the assignments seemed either needlessly long (such as the idea mapping assignment). Therefore, it may be better to do simpler, less intense day-to-day assignments."

                "Yes. A great way to get a writing credit. The course is set up well for one to undertake a large writing project in a manageable way, something that isn't true of many Yale writing courses.",
                "Yes! I'd absolutely recommend this course to another student. By taking a writing class early on in your Yale career, you'll set yourself up for success when it comes to writing assignments in other courses. It won't feel as daunting, and you'll also be better equipped to succeed and perform well on those assignments. As a STEM major myself, it was also a nice change of pace to spend some time doing non-quantitative writing, but still addressing topics of my interest (as this course was about Superintelligence, Entrepreneurship, and Ethics). Overall, it's a win-win and I can't tell you really any downsides of the course. Dr. Klemann is also a fabulous professor, as I'll touch on in my response to the later question...",
                "Yes, if you want to improve your writing abilities.",
                "I believe that two kinds of students will get a lot out of this course. Students who struggle with academic writing, or are unfamiliar with the conventions of research writing, should definitely take this course. This course places a huge emphasis on providing students with the basics they need to know to produce research writing that protects them from plagiarism and bad practices in academic writing. Students who enjoy academic writing, but have little experience in producing long and formal research papers, should also consider taking this course. There is a lot of freedom towards the second half of the class for students to research and write about topics they find interesting and relevant. This course is a great way to practice academic writing in a fun, stress-free way.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student that wants to become a better academic writer or even just someone interested in the topics of artificial intelligence and superintelligence.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to students looking to fulfill their writing credit. Regardless of whether you're specifically interested in artificial intelligence, I think the course is structured such that no prior knowledge or interest is necessary to do well and enjoy the class.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student, whether they just want to get a writing credit or if they really want to improve their writing and gain exposure to writing research papers. The class really does cater to your individual strengths and weaknesses. I want to emphasize that this is also a class that is fair. If you complete all the assignments and genuinely put in your best effort, you will do well in the class. I think that having that kind of environment is great because then you can really focus on improving your writing above all. I would urge students who take this class to take advantage of the small class size, the catered individual feedback, and the one-on-one interactions with an accessible and caring professor. Not all classes have these things -- don't take them for granted.",
                "Yes. The feedback one receives is great, and the course teaches students a lot about AI, which is extremely topical and important to know."
