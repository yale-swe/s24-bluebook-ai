                "Strengths: Liang laoshi is the reason why I was excited to go to class every day. She is was supportive and dedicated to our class, and it was clear that she cared about each of us. The class was really organized, we typically went chapter by chapter learning new vocab, sentence patterns, reading passages, writing, etc. The class was also highly interactive because of the small number of students so everyone had the chance to participate every day. Weaknesses: The class is definitely fast-paced, and near the beginning of the semester I remember spending a lot of time out of class reviewing the material.",
                "Despite the virtual format, the structure was well-maintained, and I felt challenged throughout. The professors were also amazing and incredibly helpful! The only weakness is the reduced emphasis on writing characters - somewhat inevitable in a virtual environment but I felt like I needed more writing practice.",
                "This course was very engaging and structured so as to maximize student practice of learned concepts. I always enjoyed coming to class and felt supported by the teaching team!",
                "This course is very dense and I was constantly stressed about turning in assignments. I didn't really enjoy Mandarin the way I did in high school, it got to a point that I became less and less engaged in the class because the coursework continually stressed me. Every week we either had a major writing assignment, presentation, or assessment.... in addition to normal classwork. Within the last two weeks of the semester, we had an oral test, an oral project, and a final assessment. My parent even noticed that I was always doing Chinese homework; it felt like I didn't take any other classes at Yale. I think the work structure of this class could be organized a bit differently to include more periods focused on learning the material than constantly worrying about the next assessment/major assignment. I also feel as though my handwriting of characters drastically declined. I can recognize and read newly learned characters for the most part, but cannot write anything from memory."

                "I appreciated asynchronous tests on Thursdays and the variety of activities we had for tutorials and 2-on-1 sessions, and overall think the course was fantastically adapted to the virtual environment",
                "Switching to a project on Thursdays rather than the normal class was a welcome break from Zoom and always enjoyable. In addition, they gave me the chance to get to know my classmates better. In general, breakout rooms were also used very effectively for classroom exercises and speaking practice.",
