                "Working with Ted Partin, Lisa Kereszi, and Danna Singer greatly helped me narrow the scope of a very large survey of work I had been working on for the last four years. Ted specifically helped me refine my technical abilities in relation to my work in order to get the most out of my negatives and realize the images I was trying to make. The insights gained in response to my work has laid the foundation for the remainder of my time in the School of Art.",

                "I grew a lot as a potter this term it was very nice to get back in the studio and put out some nice pieces.",
                "I did not realize but I started off the semester with the wrong priorities in mind when approaching creating new projects. Throughout the semester professor berry and I went through multiple rounds of discussion and debate where he gave constructive criticism in my plans for the installation's purpose, impact, technical formations and intention. I also got to be aware of an extremely wide range of new digital media tools\/programs and artists that experiment with interactive media. I also tried new approaches to project planning such as forming mini installations within my room and prototyping various possible designs digitally"

                "Hard to say what the \"strengths\" and \"weaknesses\" are of the course, as the entirety of the responsibility of the course rests on my shoulders (hence \"independent project\"). That being said, the freedom to work through my own work at my own pace helped set a course for the rest of my time at Yale.",
                "Since there are many people in our major this year who are doing the senior thesis, we sat and listened for almost every class, which became a bit repetitive. I liked the hybrid format of zoom in in person so that we could choose the format based on how well we are feeling at accommodate any illness. The guest critics at the end were extremely helpful and their advice was interesting to listen to.",
                "While I appreciate the extensive feedback I wish the course was a bit more structured with set assignments the professor wanted me to accomplish each week. At times I wasn't quite sure what direction I was supposed to be heading in and it felt like too much of the semester was dedicated solely to theoretical planning rather than physical cration."

While I gained a lot from working 1 on 1 with Ted, Lisa, and Danna, it is not why I came to Yale. There is a wide variety more to be gained from active discussion and critique from your peers, and working 1 on 1 with the faculty for an entire semester should serve a specific purpose. I am very grateful to Ted, Lisa, and Danna for working with me this semester and actively looking forward to working within a larger seminar or crit class next semester.",
