   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "critical analysis\/discussion of social science papers, knowledge about the nature of groups and why\/how we behave as group members",
    "I learned a lot about group psychology in the context of ingroup\/outgroup biases, reputation management, and cooperation that brought together a lot of concepts I had come across in lower level psychology courses. I learned how to engage with published literature in a critical but constructive way rather than taking it all as fact, and I learned how to discuss these higher level concepts with other students.",
    "I learned a lot about social psychology. Each week you read a few papers and then discuss them. Dr. Dunham brings in a lot of great points and is very kind.",
    "Learned a lot about research on group dynamics and the development of group behavior!",
    "I didn't learn much that I hadn't already learned in other lower-level psychology courses, which was frustrating.",
    "I learned how to think about human psychology and evolution from the perspective of group action and psychology. I got better at developing and understanding evolutionary arguments, and learned about how the psychology of groups is distinct from that of individuals, and how this affected society in the past and continues to affect it today. I also learned how to engage in a seminar setting.",
    "I learned the Psychology of groups, how people interact and learn from each other, how behavior changes within a group",
    "I learned more about the psychology of in-group and the evolution of groups.",
    "I learned about various topics within the psychology of intergroup relations. I learned how to effectively read and discuss psychological articles.",
    "I learned about psychological phenomena that are associated with or resulting from group life in humans and animals. I developed a basic understanding of the psychology of groups from cognitive, developmental and social psychological perspectives. I also learned how to better review psychological literature and develop research proposals through the assignments for this class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved the structure of the course, the material we covered, and the open-ended way we could complete our assignments. I also liked that the class was small and completely discussion-based. I would've liked to get grades for earlier assignments back within the next few weeks, so I would know how I'm doing in the class before the end of the semester. But other than that, no complaints.",
    "I think the seminar nature of this course was very helpful in our discussions of the concepts in the course. On a meta-level, the course was about group psychology and we often worked in groups and could see the effects of things we talked about. I would always find myself thinking about reputation and cooperation as class occurred and trying to see if what we read about played out in the classroom. I honestly cannot think of any weaknesses of the course.",
    "Dr. Dunham is a wonderful teacher and person. He handles the class with a lot of grace and kindness. He is one of those professors who will nod and smile at everyone's contribution because he wants to create an encouraging collaborative environment.",
    "Strengths: interesting material, good course setup (each class was clearly organized, and discussion was lively because of the pace). I thought the distribution of work was really good for people writing thesis (more in the beginning of the semester then cooling off).\r\n\r\nWeakness: maybe a little more structure for people writing their senior essay in the class earlier in the semester would be good. Felt like getting the proposal in before fall break for those writing a longer paper could be good rather than having them on the same timeline as the rest of the class, if that isn't too complicated.",
    "I enjoyed the class discussions and the rabbit hole assignment. In general, lots of freedom was given to students in this class, which has its strengths but also weaknesses.",
    "Professor Dunham is clearly very intelligent and very prominent in the world of group psychology, so that is a strength of the course. However, the greatest weakness would be the structure of the course: it is very dry, slow, and rather boring at times because we don't really do much besides go over readings. I felt as though there was rarely ever any new insight provided - it was just a summary of each of the readings and hearing students' reactions, which was not very interesting.",
    "The amount of assignments in this course is a definite strength (grades being based on participation, weekly reading responses around 500 words, one 4 page paper, and then the final paper). I think the course could be improved by focusing less on anthropology and sociology in the beginning half of the course and heading more toward the group and social psychology part of the course faster. It felt like we only spent a few classes actually getting into group psychology, which is what I expected the class to focus on.",
    "The course material has a strong mix of comparative cognition and examples of group psychology in the animal kingdom, as well as a developmental aspect that compared young children's thinking to adults' thinking. A weakness could be that some of our group discussions were somewhat awkward, since not all of the prompts sparked discussions people were interested in.",
    "Loved the course. Great discussion and good readings.",
    "I thought this course was very well taught and engaging. I really enjoyed it!",
    "Strengths: Great discussion environment, very open and welcoming and non-intimidating environment to contribute ideas, which for me was really important as I find myself shying away from participating in discussion when it seems too intimidating. The topics were really fascinating and Prof. Dunham did a great job of selecting important papers for each topic to give us a good overview of the topic at hand, and readings were not too heavy so that I could finish them and thoroughly understand them before coming into class, versus struggling to finish the readings.",
    "Professor Dunham is an excellent instructor and the class itself was well-structured. The readings were pulled from a variety of fields within psychology and offered something to interest everybody in the class regardless of their academic backgrounds. I thought the weekly reading responses were a good way of articulating my thoughts before discussing them in class, and I especially enjoyed the 'Down the rabbit hole' literature review assignment because it encouraged independent reading, and because it was very enjoyable to hear what themes others in the class had chosen to read deeper into as well."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely! The material is interesting and Prof. Dunham always encourages everyone to participate.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students who are interested in the topics of cooperation, reputation, group-level biases, and evolutionary origins of these mechanisms.",
    "Yes, I think any class with Dr. Dunham will be a good one! He was very kind and extremely knowledgable. I think he'd make a great mentor.",
    "Would recommend! Interesting and engaging class, really liked Professor Dunham.",
    "Highly recommend - Professor Dunham is so easygoing and encouraging. He always has a way to keep the class discussion going and engage the entire class. In addition, he puts in extra effort to know each individuals' names.",
    "I would not recommend this course. I think there are other psych seminars offered that are probably more interesting and give students a better chance to grow and learn. This course provided us with no feedback: we did not receive grades on the written work we produced before submitting our final paper so we had no way of knowing what our standing in the class was.",
    "I would. This was a pretty solid senior psych seminar. I learned a fair amount to keep me engaged throughout the semester and I was able to write my final paper, which was my thesis for psych, on a topic I was really interested in.",
    "Yes! Professor Dunham is a fantastic professor and the material we cover comes from many different areas of psychology and is really interesting, along with being applicable to daily life and helping to understand various social or political currents and interactions.",
    "Yes. Loved Professor Dunham and loved the discussion. Interesting material and readings, very engaging",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who has an interest in psychology.",
    "Yes! Interesting topic and structured well for learning",
    "Definitely, even if you're not a psychology major -- Professor Dunham is an amazing professor and seminar discussions were always thoughtful and exciting."
