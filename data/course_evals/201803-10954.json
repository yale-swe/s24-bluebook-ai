   "comments": [
    "I learned about modern poetry and how to write poetry. I'm a better analytical thinker and I've fine tuned my poetics.",
    "I learned so much about what makes poetry worth reading, what makes poetry worth writing, and who I am as a poet. I'll put it this way: Before, I couldn't write poetry, and though I obviously have a lot to learn still, I now can. As someone who didn't like poetry classes in high school, this class really showed me what a good poetry class looks likemostly because of the time and attention put into it by David Gorin.",
    "Learned about different styles of poetry and different ways of thinking about poetry",
    "I learned what kind of poet I was and how to enjoy writing poetry.",
    "I learned an immense amount about the art of poetry. We read tons of poetry and wrote a ton in addition. However, I would say this class was definitely focused on improve poetry writingnot as much reading. I loved this, but some may want a bigger focus on reading.",
    "I developed poetry writing skills and learned about poetry writing in a systematic fashion whereas before I only wrote poetry based on my intuition.",
    "First of all, the skill of writing poetry is developed deeply. More importantly, the course makes you more attentive and appreciative of everyday life.",
    "An understanding of trends, breakthroughs, and the strongest voices in modern poetry, and an ability to, by deeply reading so much poetry, really craft the structure of and understand my own work on a new level. Because I was assigned to write a poem every single week, my writing improved greatly and I found a rhythm with it.",
    "Learning how to read poetry to search for devices and ways in which the poets wrote the poems and then carrying that on into our own work and creations"

   "comments": [
    "This course is fantastic. I had a lot of fun in discussions and l got to practice my poetry as well. I wish it didn't have to end.",
    "Strengthsthe professor and our individual meetings with him, the breadth of the material covered, the self-knowledge gained, the material produced in the end\r\n\r\nWeaknessestoo many poems assigned each week to really digest each one, often too many poems written to workshop all of them in depth",
    "Strengths - very diverse reading list with many different styles of poetry, Professor Gorin put in a lot of time and effort to get to know each of us personally though individual conferences, a wonderful class with lots of different backgrounds and perspectives on poetry\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes it would have been nice to have more background on the poetry we were reading, while I enjoyed the workshops, I wish we spent more time analyzing and discussion the poetry we read, maybe more guiding the class on what to look for in the poetry",
    "It is a good reading list and the prompts are interesting and stimulating and push you to understand yourself and your poetic niche. The prose was unnecessary and only tangential to the course.",
    "David is an amazing professor, the readings are very modern and relevant, and the feedback received on drafts of poetry is phenomenal. No real weaknessmaybe a lot of expected reading?",
    "Strengths:\r\nAmazing professor, David is a star.\r\nMost of the reading material is intriguing.\r\nClass size is perfect.\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\nSome reading material was assigned but not discussed in class. Not the poetry but the prose pieces.\r\nAs is typical in a workshop setting, critique in workshop was sometimes overly nice and therefore ineffective.",
    "strength: weekly workshops of classmates work allow you to keep up with what others are doing and, by identifying and discussing strengths and flaws in others work, to hone your own. \r\nstrength: you will read so, so much beautiful poetry in this course! you will also have multiple opportunities to select poets or poems that are meaningful to you and focus in on them specifically in writing assignments. \r\nstrength: professor Gorin gives SO much helpful feedback on your work in office hours meetings!",
    "Strengths were the diversity of our readings, the instructor and his love for poetry and our material, the small class size and tight-knit and inclusive atmosphere. David Gorin would make time to meet at least once every few weeks to go deeply into our work with us individually and discuss whatever we needed to discuss. Weaknesses were very few, as though there was a fair amount of readings sometimes, the poetry was engaging and fun."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. This course is a lot of fun even if you aren't considering being a full-time poet\/English major.",
    "I would recommend this to another student who is truly interested in poetry and willing to put time and effort into improving their craft. Because the ultimate focus is on writing poetry, I'm not sure someone who is only vaguely interested in learning about the art will be captivated throughout the entire semester.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in poetry in the slightest this is a great class to take. It helped me figure out what kind of poetry I enjoyed writing rather than force myself to write pretentious nonsense.",
    "Take this course. Just take it. It is amazingone of the best Ive ever taken.",
    "Yes.\r\nFor those who simply want to engage in this class casually, this is a great eye-opener and introduces a lot of new & exciting forms of poetry.\r\nFor poets, this class helps develop many important skills and trained me how to notices certain aspects of poetry while putting these skills to use.",
    "Absolutely. The exposure to reading great poetry and being inspired by it to write your own can be, well, juicy. Having other people read your work is beyond gratifying, and to be able to study with someone who loves poetry as much as David is fantastic.",
    "YES!! It is transformative, will help you find your voice as a writer and learn how to read poetry in a new way. Your class will likely form a deep bond by the end and be sad to say goodbye to each other!",
    "Yes! Even if you've never written a poem before in your life, you'll come out of this class with a vast improvement in your skills."
