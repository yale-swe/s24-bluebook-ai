                "I learned a surprisingly large amount about the culture, politics, history, demography, but especially the musical and performance traditions of South Asia. It was a great introduction that finally allowed me a measure of informed appreciation for a huge variety of musical and performative arts.",
                "This course gave me a broad insight into the music, theater, and dance traditions of South Asia. In addition to studying a variety of specific traditions, we considered numerous larger topics throughout the course such as caste, nationalism, and gender. I also learned more about the process of ethnomusicological research through projects focusing on ethnography and academic research.",
                "I learned about a diverse set of music forms from the South Asian Musical tradition including aesthetics, the socio-political context, and other writing skills like ethnographic writing.",
                "If you're not interested in music technicalities, don't be deterred by the title of this course. By all means, this is an ethnomusicology course -- the study of caste, gender, religion, migration, sexuality, nationality and its affect on music systems.",

                "I thought this was a wonderful course! It was not only intellectually stimulating but also sensiorally so, through demonstrations, active, physical participation in live performance, and beautiful music and dance. The only weakness of this course would be the relative contingency of its focus on South Asia as a whole. This is not to say that we did adequately cover the incredible diversity of this whole, but rather that the historical moments and traditions that we chose to focus on seemed relatively arbitrary from the perspective of a student who has never really studied these regions at all. I think the course would greatly benefit from a more explicit articulation of why and through what lenses it will focus on the particular topics and traditions it does. Specifically, it would be illuminating to have a session introducing the history of the region and the empires, now states, that contend for its control. This would allow a more critical and sensitive approach as we engage with these topics from our different positionalities within this North American university.",
                "One of the strengths of the course is the variety of traditions we studied. This gave us a great picture of the diversity of performing arts present in South Asia. I also really enjoyed the larger assignments such as the playlist and guided annotations, as I felt they helped synthesize a lot of the broader concepts of the course. Honestly I can't think of any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: extremely organized, great reading chapters, amazing guest speakers\r\nWeaknesses: n/a",
                "I wish that more structure was given on how to write different styles of writing that most of the students had never written in before.",
                "The course was really well constructed -- the only improvement I'd suggest is clearer expectations for the assignment. It feels like Professor Nimjee expects something specific from your assignments, and if you don't provide exactly that, you'll get sucker-punched by grading. Professor Nimjee also does a good job ensuring that those not familiar with South Asian language and culture can feel comfortable.",
                "Strengths: phenomenal professor with firsthand experience to classical Indian dance, very interesting course content\r\nWeaknesses: readings could have been more targeted to class discussion. As a survey class, I wish we'd gone into more depth on some traditions rather than jumping around.",
                "This course has really fascinating classes and topics, and some of the projects are very unique and interesting, but sometimes they can end up a bit difficult and frustrating, especially for someone with more of a music and less of a writing/history background."

                "Absolutely! I can't think of anyone who wouldn't learn something new from this class, unless you've already spent a very long time studying South Asian performance arts and their history.",
                "Absolutely! I learned so much about the various performance traditions of South Asia, which was refreshing given my background in Western classical music. It was also really interesting to see how music, theater, and dance are approached as art forms in a very different part of the world.",
                "Yes! This is a great course if your major concentration is in the arts, or if you're just generally interested in South Asian Music & culture and looking to make a Hu credit.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are looking to explore South Asian music in an interactive environment. No prior experience is required.",
                "Absolutely. It's a phenomenal class with a caring professor and, in my experience, engaged peers. Especially if you have previous exposure to South Asian musical traditions, it's a great insight into the nuances of South Asian musical traditions.",
                "Yes, its fascinating, but be aware that it is not a theory class at all and is entirely a music history and culture class, and the assignments are all writing."
