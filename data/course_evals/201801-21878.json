    "I gained a deeper understanding of familial influences regarding psychopathology, which I found very interesting. The class also requires a final presentation, so I had the opportunity to practice my presenting skills.",
    "I improved my ability to read and analyze journal\/scientific articles, as well as how to do a literature review of several sources. I also learned about how the dynamics of a family can impact, predict, or cause psychopathology in children, adolescents, and adults.",
    "I learned a lot about the role of the family in the etiology and maintenance of psychopathology.",
    "A new understanding of the impact of family on psychopathology",
    "The relationship between family and mental illness",
    "I loved this class, it was a great clinically focused psychology course.",
    "Learned a lot about family backgrounds and development and mental health and more clinical psychology",
    "I learned about psychopathology in the context of the family."

   "comments": [
    "I found the content of the course as well as the weekly writing assignments very interesting. I wish that the lectures themselves could be more engaging and discussion-based.",
    "This class was presented well. We did student presentations of different areas of psychopathology involving the family, and the professor presented scientific research and studies on various concepts. Discussions were also informative and engaging.",
    "The structure of the course makes actually learning things week to week less important than learning a lot about a specific area, which could be a strength - particularly for people who are doing this class for the senior essay.",
    "Great course!",
    "It was awesome! I wish that Professor Lockhart had lectured more than us doing presentations but it was great overall and very interesting material!",
    "Very interesting materials",
    "Strengths: it connects both psychopatholoy and a more social context, the family. I liked the fact that I can consider these mental disorders in the context of the family and how it affects functioning and the various consequences that it could have. I also liked the more sociological perspective the class took at certain points, looking at relationships rather than simply symptomatology. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the research is really outdated, and the readings could use an update. Updating the reading list with reviews, meta-analyses, and updates on previously existing research would make the arguments presented in the class stronger and more believable."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class. Professor Lockhart is amazing, and you learn so much. She truly cares about all of her students.",
    "I would recommend this course to any students interested in the content \/ how psychopathology and families interact. However, the student should expect that the class is largely consisted of lectures and student presentations over discussions.",
    "I would recommend this course to any junior or senior who wants to take it. Most likely, only psychology majors can take the class due to the size limit. The class is definitely worth it. It's enlightening and engaging, and you really get a good grasp of the content.",
    "YES!! Take if you can, Lockhart is gem",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes absolutely, to anyone interested in psychology and especially families.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Sure - if you are looking to get outside the realm of purely research papers and data, this might give you a breather and a new perspective on psychology and psychopathology. There is not too much work (reading responses and paper), and the professor is willing to help. She is very knowledgeable, and the topics that we cover are mostly interesting."
