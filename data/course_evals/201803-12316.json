    "Sometimes the pace is too fast. Also, the workload varies a ton; some standardization would be nice.",
    "Strengths:\r\n-plentiful practice problems (not that close to the midterm or final)\r\n-answers of midterm posted online after the test\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-limited resources for help\r\n-only 1 teacher (Sudesh) that is very good",
    "Weaknesses: material is rushed as there is a lot to cover; I felt that sometimes there were parallels and connections to previous course material that were not explained (and had they been explained, it might have been easier to conceptualize new topics)",
    "Strengths: fun and challenging for the mathematically gifted\r\n\r\nWeakness: moves fast for those who can have trouble",
    "I feel like too much time was spent doing straight math examples, when test-like practice questions could have been more useful."

    "Yes it is a challenging and important course.",
    "Yes, but only if you need it for your major.",
    "Yes it is not as bad as people say",
    "Yes, definitely if its a pre-requisite. Some aspects of it are very useful and good for you to know regardless of major, but you get to the point where the problems youre solving will seem super complicated and kind of pointless.",
    "Math 120 is a prerequisite that must be taken for a lot of various majors and tracks.",
    "Unlike many people in this course, I took it because I simply liked math. Most people enroll in 120 as a requirement for a prospective major or as a prerequisite for higher level science courses. Not falling into either of these categories, I thought 120 was a genuinely good course. A lot of people complain about it as being impossible, and it has a terrible reputation, but remember that a lot of people who bemoan the workload, pace, and material arent really interested in learning the material for its own sake. If you are genuinely interested in math, this is a challenging but rewarding course that will teach you a lot!",
    "Yes, since I enjoy math, this class is a fun challenge"
