I really enjoyed doing the labs in breakout rooms with a few other people to replicate the in person experience. I also think it was beneficial how your TA and both professors switched in and out of breakout rooms so you could ask questions throughout the lab.",

It's hard to get succinct answers to questions sometimes.\r\nStrengths: Some of the experiments are pretty cool. My TA was super helpful. The labs connect to real-world experiences.",
