                "Writing and argumentation in French, understanding of french music and films, improved speaking skills",
                "I learned a lot more french and developed greater fluency in speaking and writing. I also learned a lot of knowledge about french culture, more than I was expecting! It was great I feel much more knowledgeable about France and other francophone countries.",
                "I advanced my level of spoken French significantly and also learned about a bevvy of social issues in francophone countries, including the environment, history, family, immigration, politics, and religion.",
                "I gained a tremendous amount of knowledge from this course about French culture. From neorurals to French secularism to the neocolonialism of the French language, I learned about the multicultural francophone world and all of its intricate complexities. To say that I ended this course with ten times more knowledge of France than I'd had before it began would not be an exaggeration.\r\n\r\nAs for skills, my oral communication improved greatly. I fine-tuned my speaking ability and expanded my vocabulary by quite a significant amount. I also became far more comfortable delivering presentations in French without a detailed outline; by the end of the course, I was able to improvise on my final, referencing only a few notes to ensure that I did not miss any key points.",
                "A broad but nuanced understanding of the culture and history of France and francophone countries.",
                "I improved my conversational skills and learned about a wide variety of political and social issues in France and in other Francophone regions.",
                "I increased my verbal and reading proficiency.",
                "I have been introduced to lots of different ways of relating to French society and culture; I have learnt how to read a large number of articles in a foreign language in a more effective way. My French skills in terms of writing short essays etc improved and became more formalized through the extensive practice. I have gained more knowledge of different facets of French society such as France the environment, France and immigration, France and regionalism, etc., which will inform my conversations with French-speaking people going forward."

                "The course is a good follow-up to the French sequence as I felt like I was prepared for it after 150 but also still growing and developing my skills. The length of the course was difficult to pay consistent attention through, though, and I might have preferred to meet for 50 minutes three times a week instead of 1:15 twice.",
                "Strengths: Conversation-based, lots of interesting topics, opportunities to present knowledge. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like some of the readings were less important and I would have preferred fewer readings that we really pick apart and study rather than too many that we can't read thoroughly. I also wish we didn't have so much homework over Thanksgiving break, we had several readings and a short essay due on that Monday and it was saddening. \r\n\r\nFinally, I wish our teacher was a little more sensitive when talking about Islam and the LGBT+ community. We had several Muslims and queer students and this climate is very sensitive with all the recent hate, so maybe a little more sensitivity would have helped us approach these topics from a more holistic lens. Populations under more of a social spotlight just need more care when talked about in an academic setting so it doesn't feel like we are using our queer and Muslim students to educate the other students.",
                "I really enjoyed how many different topics we covered in the class and felt that it prepared me for real conversations with native French speakers. I do wish that the readings were selected more thoughtfully, as we were assigned a lot more readings than we actually discussed in class, and I would have appreciated a lesser workload.",
                "Strengths: Amount of material covered, emphasis on oral communication, engagement with different kinds of sources (readings, movies, news clips, etc), and also the fact that the class had many native French speakers (as a non-native who studied French starting in 6th grade, it was very helpful to have so many native speakers elevating the level of discourse in class).",
                "this course engaged with many different aspects of francophone countries including religion history, language, and culture. Weaknesses in my opinion were just that the work was sometimes busy work and that the focus of the class was sometimes overly euro centric",
                "There are a lot of in class discussions and some presentations so there are a lot of opportunities to practice talking. The topics are interesting. The homework is mostly manageable, but sometimes it was hard to get the work done for Wednesday since there would be a lot of work assigned to do in between Monday and Wednesday.",
                "The course covers an enormous amount of topics in only 14 weeks, which is both a strength and a weakness. I did sometimes feel that the rapidity with which we went through the material meant that it was difficult to have meaningful conversations about some of the more complex societal questions, such as immigration.\r\n\r\nTo be able to have productive conversations on such questions requires an understanding of French society and culture that e.g one week of study could not possibly provide. This sometimes hindered me from participating actively in class discussions, since very serious questions such as how to mitigate residential segregation had to be answered in a very brief and simplified way. A solution could be to steer the discussion towards slightly less serious\/sensitive topics, which would place more of the emphasis on practicing our oral French.\r\n\r\nThe selection of articles for reading was excellent. I really enjoyed doing the class presentation. The TYCO-packet was a good way of keeping all the course material in one place. Regarding this my only feedback would be that the vocabulary-lists could be updated - the word-selection was difficult to understand and often overlapped, in a way that did not always justify how their importance was emphasized for our tests. In my opinion, we did not use the textbook Alliages Culturels enough for it to be a mandatory purchase of more than 100 dollars."

So I suppose my only hesitation in recommending the course would be if someone was not interested in the material; if they were more attracted to French lit, or already felt confident in their speaking skills, I would not feel the need to encourage them to take it. That being said, I would not discourage anyone from taking the course. It is a great course, and anyone looking for what it has to offer would benefit enormously from taking it.",
