Additionally, I got the chance to spend a lot of time in the machine shop learning how to use the different pieces of equipment, which was greatly appreciated. Lastly, we learned a bit about drawings and how they are used in industry.",
                "The biggest influx of knowledge and skill came from spending time in the machine shop and gaining a familiarity with machining tools and processes. It was not all-comprehensive of manufacturing techniques, but it was helpful. Having an idea of what can or can't be manufactured in the shop is very valuable.",
                "Static and fatigue failure and expected life analysis for shafts, bearings, and gears. Powertrain design, DC motor basics. Introductory machining and engineering drawings.",
                "I learned how to machine more than I have in any other class. This also went hand in hand with the theory that was learned in lecture each week. I learned how to use: lathe, mill, bandsaw, arbor press, grinder, water jet cutter, among a couple others. In class, I learned all about shafts, bearings, and gears.",
                "I learned how to perform stress and fatigue analysis of fundamental machine parts like shafts, bearings, and gears, and how they inform design decisions. Through the rock crusher project, I also learned and got comfortable with various design machining processes like tolerancing, making technical drawings, drilling, milling, lathing, etc.",
                "I learned to analyze systems of shafts, bearings, and gears, as well as how to use machines including the lathe, mill, bandsaw, drill press, and others.",

                "In this course, I learned about how to analyze fatigue in shafts, bearings, gears, and ultimately, in a power train. I learned about various design aspects of shafts, bearings, and gears, and learned about real world engineering processes involving the three. Additionally, I gained insight into various mechanical engineering industry standards. In the lab component, I learned different machining processes and gained experience on those machines as I built the semester-long project that was the rock crusher."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Pretty well organized. Lecture slides are posted online, psets are regular and weekly, and tests are not too challenging. It is also useful to gain hands-on experience in the machine shop. Weaknesses: I think that there are topics that we could have spent less time on, which would have let us cover a wider range of the concepts present in the textbook. I think making the machining lab be a video-based educational experience followed up by individual, in-person work in the machine shop would be more useful.",
                "One of the biggest strengths is the time spent in the machine shop. Although that was not clear in the syllabus that we would be expected to spend that much time somewhere as a part of the class, it was a good addition. The lectures were mostly aligned with the project of the rock crusher. The rock crusher felt like a very digestible project and seems to be much better structured than last year. The course structure in the syllabus and on courses search was very misleading, including the omission of the fact that there was a lab every week, a midterm and a final, and no presentations. Having a clearer breakdown of the class before the semester starts would be very beneficial to students. Also add some information about FMEA? or add that somewhere in the MENG major? Or design for manufacturing? more extensive manufacturing process knowledge? These could be things that are just added to the major, but boy would they be nice.",
                "I think the machine shop component of the class should be its own class. The lecture material and machine shop class seem very different and I think both subjects would benefit from a more focused approach.",
                "Strengths: I liked getting hands-on experience in the machine shop, I also felt that this was more of the design-relevant MechE courses I've taken so far. \r\nWeaknesses: There were a few organizational mistakes when it came to scheduling exams and assisting with exam prep. The first problem set was way too long, but the others were all reasonable. The machining project (rock crusher) might have been better broken up into a few smaller assignments, so that the parts that inexperienced students machine at the beginning of the year aren't crucial to the functioning of the final project.",
                "This course was taught very well I thought. The lectures seemed to me to be a thoughtful and effective selection of concepts from the textbook, that applied to what Booth wanted us to learn, and what he wanted to test us on. The weekly machine shop visits were great. Keep that. The Friday labs could have been a video.",
                "Strengths: The professor was great at adjusting the course given our feedback. The psets are straightforward and translated well into our project and the exams. Exams were also very manageable and not a problem at all if you did the psets. \r\nWeaknesses: the workload can be at lot at times. The length of the psets and what part of the project must be manufactured can really make or break your week. Course organization was sometimes messy too, such as conflicting information on the syllabus vs canvas. For example, it wasn't stated that there would also be an additional lab component, and the syllabus said there would be no final even though we did have one.",
                "Some of the positives were: interesting to learn how to use all the different machines in the shop, nice to have the rock crusher components spread out over the semester instead of within a week or two like last year, homework assignments were very applicable and seemed realistic. The visualizations during lectures were also very helpful to understand the theory behind the concepts. Impending exams were communicated well in advance which helped with preparation, and the exams seemed very fair in scope and application. Professor was very friendly, understanding, and willing to help. Genuinely invested in student learning and wanting to improve the course which is much appreciated. \r\n\r\nSome of the perpetuating issues were: mandatory lab not listed on the syllabus, final and midterm exams not included on the syllabus and later added 1 month in, and a few assignments that took much longer than the instructor anticipated (e.g. assembly of the rock crusher), making it very difficult to complete other coursework. In addition, some of the machining lab demonstrations became repetitive and seemed unnecessary by the end of the semester. Lectures sometimes explained some equations but didnt explain how to apply them or go through any practice problems. Some general disorganization felt present throughout the class with constantly changing deadlines, requirements, etc. On the final, there were about 5-6 typos that we needed to clarify (not just small typos, but inconsistencies that would drive how one would approach the problem).",
                "From the anecdotes of other students, this course has massively improved from prior semesters. The workload is reasonable and Dr. Booth is extremely responsive to student feedback, so any elements of the class that didn't work well for students (like the Friday morning lab session) were remedied partway through the semester. I feel like I gained very detailed knowledge of failure analysis, and fairly strong knowledge of how to use common machines in the machine shop (as an aside, Nick Bernardo is excellent and make sure to talk with him about advice and tips every time you are in the shop). One improvement that could be made to this course would be the inclusion of a lecture on when it is best to use certain machining processes and the limitations of machines in the shop, as I still feel I lack this intuition. I also think expectations regarding the final should be made clear in the first week of class, as we were not aware we had a final exam until the middle of the semester.",
                "The course layout of having a manufacturing project that paralleled the learning curriculum was very helpful. May have been nice to have access to some handouts and course material prior to the lesson instead of after. It would also be helpful to have the required lab and shop hours, as well as the planned exams posted in the class syllabus before the start of classes.",
                "I think this course could be improved by having our machinist teaching the machining portions of the class. I would like our professor to go over the mechanics of how the machines work and maybe specifics of what it can be used for. Then the machinist could do the in person demos on machines. I also feel that there was some general confusion on deadlines and assignments, for example there was initially no mention of a final for the class but as we progressed through the semester it was silently added.",
                "This course does a really good job of tying together things that are learned whether thats from one lecture slide to the next or from one lecture to another. It presents a continuity in the knowledge such that it makes following along really easy and, for me personally, also figuring out what I didn't quite learn as well the first time so that I could easily go back to fill in any gaps. Additionally, it sprinkles in various aspects of engineering from industry, which I found gave a fuller context of what we were learning in class. The labs were also really helpful in learning machining processes which had not been taught as fully in any other mechanical engineering classes, and by spreading the rock crusher project over the course of the semester, it gave time in the context of learning each machining process to fully sync in. One thing that could be helpful would be having an overview what will be learned and how each of those things fit together with the others at the very beginning of the semester. Since those things wouldn't have been taught yet, students would most likely not fully understand what those things are, but I think it would be helpful to have that preview of how things all tie together prior to learning about them as for me, it wasn't until nearing the midterm that I understood how things connected."

                "This course is required for mechanical engineering majors, so they are going to always be the majority of students taking it. I also think it would be interesting and useful for students outside the major too, however, and I think they would enjoy the time in the machine shop and learning about different mechanical concepts. I would thus recommend this course to most other students in STEM fields who have an interest in design or how things work mechanically.",
                "Eh, its 50/50. It has the possibility to become a must take class for engineering students, but it is not quite there yet. The machining elements is critical to being a successful engineer.",
                "I would recommend this course if you like working with machines hands-on and want to learn how to actually design and create parts and systems. I love gears and stuff like that, so I had a lot of fun. My friends who aren't so into those kinds of topics were a bit less engaged with the class.",
                "Yes! Come to learn machining. One of the most applicable courses in the MENG major.",
                "It depends. The course content is good at teaching stress/fatigue analysis which is a fundamental part of engineering. The psets and the design project really do take up a lot of time though. If it's required (as it is for ABET) then you'll have to take it regardless, but if you're willing to put in the time and work, you do get a solid background of a major part of engineering.",
                "I would say that I have mixed feelings about this course. From purely a content level, this was the class I was most excited about this semester. It is really interesting to get to learn the engineering design process from both an analytical and tangible point of view. I also wanted to gain more experience machining, which I knew would happen in this course. The course essentially consisted of two components: one based off of theory/calculations where we learned how to design/analyze a gearbox, and another more hands-on manufacturing/machining element where we built a rock crusher throughout the semester. \r\n\tHowever, this excitement was tempered by some reviews I had heard from previous students discussing how disorganized the course was and how unreasonable the workload was some weeks. While I did experience some of these difficulties as well, it seems that necessary changes were made in the course organization which greatly improved the course structure. \r\n\tSome of the positives were: interesting to learn how to use all the different machines in the shop, nice to have the rock crusher components spread out over the semester instead of within a week or two like last year, homework assignments were very applicable and seemed realistic. The visualizations during lectures were also very helpful to understand the theory behind the concepts.

Some general disorganization felt present throughout the class with constantly changing deadlines, requirements, etc. On the final, there were about 5-6 typos that we needed to clarify (not just small typos, but inconsistencies that would drive how one would approach the problem). \r\n\tSuggestions for next year: Would have preferred online homework submission as well as slightly more timely feedback. Assembly of the rock crusher throughout the semester instead of all in one week. Machining lab being optional/other machines being demonstrated even if not directly applicable to the project; explaining the capabilities of the machines rather than just how to make the weeks parts. \r\n\tOverall, I would say I enjoyed the course - just would have been a slightly smoother experience with a little more organization!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. You will gain a strong background in static and dynamic failure analysis, and you will strengthen your abilities in the machine shop. As a piece of advice to students taking this class, start your final assembly early; it will take you much longer than expected.",
                "Yes, it was good to learn manufacturing and design processes. It is also required for the Mechanical Engineering major.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course as ties together many of the things learned in earlier mechanical engineering classes, which I think exponentially increases one's understanding of what mechanical engineering is."
