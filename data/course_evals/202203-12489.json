                "I learned how to think about a variety of topics, from collective vs. individual tensions, to empire and race as a production, to representations of the marginalized. I also learned to be more confident in my ideas in class.",
                "I learned a lot about how we conceptualize history (collective v. individual, progress v. process, etc.) and the different forms it can take. I really loved the approach to read from traditional historical fiction about the French Revolution to fantasy \/ queer love stories to narratives of life as a Black Briton. This course was incredibly ambitious in its scope and offerings but ultimately extremely successful! I feel like I'm walking away from this class with a more honed specific knowledge about the French Revolution and British history, but also a broader understanding of what \"history\" itself can mean.",
                "I learned about how the way we tell history changes based on genre, time, and how these changes function as political acts. We learned about theories of History and how these theories relate to different iterations and tellings of past events using primary sources and then reading different theorists\/novels\/fictionalized accounts to see how the event was told through different angles. I also felt my writing grew tremendously under Professor Lindskog and I learned about becoming a better writer."

            "comments": [
                "Course had interesting readings, though at times I was just so confused about the reading\/plot\/chronology of events, and feel as if it would've been useful to go through more of this in class. A weakness of the course is that it felt as if topics such as race or queerness were being talked about in a detached manner, in the abstract, as if nobody in the class resonated with either of these labels. This is a common academic move that I find myself doing in writing, but it feels just very different, perhaps a bit alienating, in person, to talk about myself in the third person.",
                "One of the major strengths of this course is Katja. She is incredibly sharp and knowledgable, and she came to every class extremely well-prepared to guide intriguing discussions. She also curated such an incredible reading list! I was delighted to see how all of these seemingly very different texts on the syllabus came together to craft a fascinating, multi-faceted view of history and storytelling. The only weakness of this course is that it was only a semester -- I would've loved to stay with this class for another.",
                "I am typically not a huge fan of reading responses - when you do them for a lecture course, they often feel a bit superficial. However, in this class, I thoroughly enjoyed not only having a low stakes setting for Dr. Lindskog to see my writing but also having the chance to read other individual's thoughts. It allowed me to ruminate on a few of their ideas before class, which made discussions much richer!",
                "Strengths: Well selected readings and reasonable workload. Prof. Lindskog is great!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some discussions felt like they didn't lead anywhere or build up to a greater point or them-a stronger sense of course themes throughout might be useful.",
                "Strengths: the content was so engaging! I felt challenged and engaged by the different texts we read and we even discussed plays and how theater interacts with the historical imagination. Furthermore, the class was well organized with reminders about work coming up, when a heavy reading load was ahead. We also did individual presentations which allowed us to use the skills from class to connect to the present or to areas we hadn't yet explored. \r\nWeaknesses: Not many! At times the reading load was heavy so I wished I had made a better reading schedule for myself to keep up."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I loved both the content of the course (there was not a single book that I did not like) and Dr. Lindskog is one of the best professors I've had at Yale \r\n\r\nThe reading assignments always felt like a fair amount. The course content was very varied, meaning that even if you were not particularly interested in one topic, it did not become all-consuming.",
                "Yes! As someone interested in both history and literature this was a great introduction to literary analysis of historical fiction\/historical imagination with a diverse set of readings!",
                "Yes! If you are interested in the humanities and want a great class for credit or if you are someone who is looking for a course that is engaging and will help you grow as a writer while having consistently interesting discussions and really fascinating and fun reads! We discussed broader ideas about History, the ethics of re-telling, ethics of trauma in literature, the idea of the archive, and more."
