                "I learned more about the inner workings of the American Revolution, specifically relating to its causes and the trajectory by which it evolved. Instead of the purely causal links often drawn by a survey course, I learned about the long form reasons for its existence. I also gained much insight into the Caribbean and what it was doing during the 1630s and beyond; specifically, what discourse did they have with Britain and why did they not revolt when America did. The two colonies analyzed the most were New York and Jamaica, however the course touched on all parts of the thirteen colonies and most of the Caribbean."

                "The material of the course was very interesting but I don't think we really needed to purchase the books that we were asked to buy: we only used them for 1-2 readings. Although the material in the 4 chapters that we read was interesting, it doesn't seem too essential to the course that we needed to buy them.",
                "The course set up was very simple which I enjoyed. The class could be improved by the inclusion of powerpoints or study guides that help explain broader themes.",
                "Strengths: The readings (generally) were quite good and interesting. Until the later half of the semester leading up to the final, they were pretty manageable. The final essay was fun to research and write.\r\nWeaknesses: The discussions. At times they felt more like Q and A with the professor about the readings rather than a living discourse between the students. This will, of course, vary from class to class, and there were plenty of good discussions in ours, said phenomenon was just noticeable at times. Some of the other essay prompts also felt disjointed with the rest of the course and like they did not fit."

                "I would recommend this to a student interested in history with some background in US history. You don't need to know a ton off-hand, but having a general idea of the evolution of the American Revolution is helpful. Everything you need to know will be gone over though. The course gives you a solid introduction to reading analytically and the professor presents good advice regarding your essays."
