Under Professor Choi's guidance, I feel confident enough to will keep expanding my project in the coming year so that it is eventually ready for publication.",

    "An amazing experience---it's a privilege to be able to work on a substantial project like this under the guidance of brilliant and accomplished writers.",
    "I would, but make sure you start the project early so you have plenty of time to edit. And make sure you pick an advisor who will push you."
