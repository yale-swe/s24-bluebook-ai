                "I learned that medicine is more than science and facts. It is about empathy, bias, and a love of learning. I learned that once doctors graduate medical school that is not the end of their learning. They are learning every second of every day. I also learned that medicine contains conscious and unconscious biases and every decision we make has a consequence. I learned about how to balance medicine being one's job, meaning you cannot let emotion cloud your decisions, and knowing that the person you are operating on has feelings and emotions and is human. I learned that the humanities are a huge part of medicine.",
                "Learned a lot about how humanities affect medicine and completely shifted my perspective on medicine as a science. Shows the constant uncertainty that is present not only in medicine but in life",
                "I learned how to interact with texts related to philosophy and ethics, and this helped me to feel more confident speaking about topics that I wasnt aware of previously. I learned a lot about how to be a more well rounded human and doctor, and how being well read can contribute to being a good scientist.",

                "I gained a greater insight into the humanistic aspect of medicine and science, and a greatly expanded understanding of philosophy and its place in how we should think and live our lives. In addition, I gained an insight into the ideas of some of the greatest writers and thinkers of history (Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Bulgakov, Pascal, Montaigne, Wittgenstein, Popper...)."

                "Much of the class felt like a lecture rather than a seminar as Dr Morrison would put slides up and teach us about writers and professors. This took away from it being a seminar at times. However the readings we were given allowed for interpretation and discussion so we could engage with our peers and contemplate what stances we took on certain topics. The visits to sites like the Cushing Center and from people like Dr Honan were my favorite parts of the course and enhanced my love for medicine. Reading about topics is very different than seeing them in person or hearing them from a first person account.",
                "Strengths are that Dr. Morrison is an excellent professor and someone who provides so much support of his students. He clearly has a passion for teaching and really cares about the material he shares with us. Weaknesses are that a lot of the readings do not seem to be connected by a central theme. This made writing essays a little difficult since he would not really share what exactly he wanted from us in our essays.",
                "I thought the course was greati loved the open discussions we would have, the fascinating guest speakers, and the passion of Dr. Morrison. I also really enjoyed the lectures. I do wish we had more time to be able to read full books instead of excerpts, but this is just a matter of time, not course design.",
                "It was a fun course because we went on many field trips and the workload was not very heavy in terms of graded assignments, but we did have a lot of readings",
                "This course was one of the most engaging courses I have ever taken. This class was truly, as its name might suggest, a deep exploration of the way humanities plays a role in medicine and vice versa. Though the connection may seem somewhat tenuous going into the class, Dr. Morrison's teaching very quickly immerses you in a world of philosophical thinking, all of whom are invariably tied up in the certainty and uncertainty of medicine. The course evolved throughout the term, which is one thing I loved about Dr. Morrison's teaching. the beginning had a lot of medical focus, including guest speakers and visits to the med school and botanical gardens, all of which were meticulously planned to fit into the schedule of various readings. Once this entry point was established, we dove more and more into certainty and unknowing, which we discovered was inextricably tied to both medicine and philosophy. And, the latter half of the course ended on a more philosophical note as a result of this continued exploration, which I absolutely loved."

                "I would recommend this course to someone who has an interest in philosophy. Much of this class was reading philosophical papers and listening to Dr Morrison lecture about writers and philosophers. I would also only recommend this course if the topic of medicine interests you.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course for incoming first years. It is a good transition to the College and an eye opening experience for those who are interested in STEM and medicine.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course, I gained so much insight and truly enjoyed this class. I think its a fantastic introduction to Yale as a first year seminar.",
                "Definitely!! You get to visit many places around campus and discuss interesting medical and philosophical readings. Instructor is very clearly passionate about teaching.",
                "I would suggest, without hesitation, that anyone who gets a chance to take this class does so. Even if you have no aspirations at all to be a doctor in the future, the exploration of philosophy in this class and its inescapable ties to certainty and uncertainty is incredibly intellectually stimulating. Dr. Morrison is one of the greatest teachers that I have had the chance to encounter and enthuses endlessly about his love for the humanities, which I'm happy to say that he instilled into me (despite the fact that I had actually come into the class with quite a disdain for the humanities). Medicine fits perfectly into this class because it is inherently both an exercise of humanity (dealing with human patients) and science. But, as mentioned above, you will learn so much about life and change the way you view how science explains the world (for the better) throughout the class."
