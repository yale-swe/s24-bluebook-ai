    "how to watch films with a critical eye -- the eye of both a literature student and a film student",
    "Analyzing the various elements of films--lighting, acting, directing--both in a classroom setting as well as through papers.",
    "I previously didn't know anything about film, and this course both made me love film and taught me how to think about it. I found that as the semester went on, I had more and more things to say about the film's we watched, and I couldn't wait to write my papers.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of the meaning of nuances in films and how they add to a film's overall meaning and message.This course gave me extensive practice in and equip me with skills toward viewing a film even more critically than I had in previous film courses. Through looking at the works of one director for a focused period of time, and then doing the same for two other directors, I was able to gain a greater understanding of the patterns within a director's creative visions and to draw connections across directors and understand the influence of outside sources on film as art.",
    "I learned a lot about films specifically those of Lang, Renoir, and Bergman and thereby I learned a lot about life. I learned a lot about films too in general and criticism as well."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: great class discussion, phenomenal films, brilliant instructors. 2 teachers = 2 sets of comments on our writing!! extremely helpful feedback.\r\nWeaknesses: Fritz Lang, but that might just be me",
    "This course is a great way to get acquainted with the ways in which we talk about film in an academic setting. The in-class discussions were often enriching and I learned a lot from my peers. However, I think to pair a class called \"Interpreting Film Masterpieces\" down to only three directors is a shame.",
    "The course is very well organized to facilitate learning, and Professor Bromwich and Professor Andrew are the real deal. It's incredibly exciting and energizing to be in the classroom with them; they are respectful and very good at bringing out the best in the students. \r\nMy one recommendation for the course in the future would be to include more of a focus on reading. That isn't to say assign more texts; rather, assign just one each week and bring it more into the discussion. The readings were a bit diffuse, and we didn't really talk about them, which is a shame because I really enjoyed some of them.",
    "One of the strongest aspects of this course was exposure to varying views of the same subject due to the fact that two professors lead the seminar. The fact that Professor Bromwich and Professor Dudley commonly held differing views on the implications or meanings of a certain aspect of a film, or that they emphasized differing parts of films to differing degrees helped to expose the subjectivity of film as art and to open the mind of me as student when approaching a film. Further than this, each professor's strong knowledge on the topic provided a strong background and basis for each contrasting view, giving me as a student a comprehensive understanding of a film, its important components, and its overall meaning.",
    "This course is awesome. It's wonderful having the ability to watch a film and then discuss amidst peers and two great professors.  We wrestled with many questions and grew to understand more and more about these three directors and their sensibilities. I got to experiment with some new types of writing as well which was fun. Only weakness is that the course ought to never end."

   "comments": [
    "yes!",
    "I would not recommend this class because I do not think it should be co-taught. The dynamic between the two professors felt competitive, disrespectful, and blind to the needs of the students. The class--which was selected by the professors--was male dominated and highlighted the same voices over and over again. The structure of it needs to be seriously reconsidered if taught again.",
    "Absolutely. You'll watch some great movies and talk with some of the best professors at Yale. The workload isn't too heavy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Even if you are not a film major, this course will open your eyes to a new approach to film analysis rooted in three of the most powerful directors of all time. The choice of films and readings was exquisite and the level of discussion in seminar, only possible due to Professor Andrew's and Professor Bromwich's high level of passion and engagement with the related subject matter and inquisitive yet analytical approach, would no doubt add excitement and new ways of thinking o any student's time at Yale.",
    "If you want to see some incredible films, take this course",
    "Dudley Andrew and David Bromwich should start a podcast where they discuss films. Just being able to sit in on their discussions is a pleasure and being able to discuss with the whole class too is a fantastic time. I enjoyed every single discussion and was able to learn a lot and laugh too. This has been one of my favorite classes at Yale. You learn a lot about these three directors, and films, and a lot about life too. Both Bromwich and Andrew push us to think critically and deeply about the films we see and in this way one is able to grow."
