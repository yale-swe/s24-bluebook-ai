It was cool to relate literature to historical context and talk about our personal family histories along with the intellectual information we learned. I particularly liked talking about the geography of the region and Polish-Jewish relations throughout history.",

                "I developed a much deeper cultural understanding of Poland and its relationships with its neighbors. The course also provided a great overview of/exposure to Polish literary traditions. As a heritage speaker, this course allowed me to develop a more advanced, academic vocabulary."

                "As this was a small class, the course allowed the students to incorporate their interests in their studies, whether in the texts or in final presentations. This made the course very engaging and interesting, also incorporating a multitude of different mediums.",
                "Strengths of the course include the reading selections and small class size. The only potential weakness is the absence of a dedicated unit in grammar review. If a week or two of solely reviewing grammar rules were included, this course would be even more gratifying."

                "Yes. Pani Krystyna is an amazing teacher who cares about your learning within the class. If you need extra help, she will be more than accommodating in tutoring you after class. The scope of the class, as well as the different methods used, allowed for a diverse and comprehensive study of Poland as a whole, from language to history. Also, every class someone brought authentic Polish candies.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who already has a good knowledge of Polish. As a native speaker, I thought the courseload was at my level and I enjoyed discussing literature and history almost entirely in Polish. If someone is learning Polish from the beginning, this course may be challenging or require extra tutoring.",
                "I would recommend this class to other students interested in the Polish language and/or its culture.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course. The small seminar style and meaningful material covered are enriching to anyone, but especially heritage speakers. The professor takes into account student interests when selecting material, and allows for lots of opportunities to practice and get feedback instantly.",
                "I highly recommend this course.  Prof. Iakowicz allows a lot of discussion time and flexibility in the course based on students' areas of study and interest.  In Polish L5 one can especially develop the Polish vocabulary and skills relevant to your goals in using Polish."
