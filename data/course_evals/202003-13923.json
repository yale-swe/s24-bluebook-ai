                "No strengths of this course.  Had I no prior knowledge of Calculus, I would have failed for sure.  This course needs a complete overhaul.",
                "All the outside of class resources (peer tutoring, office hours, test review sessions) were super helpful. The lectures themselves moved a little too quickly for me and were sometimes hard to follow in the Zoom format.",
                "Strengths - the class is well-structured with weekly problem sets. Professor Dhillon explains concepts well and keeps everyone engaged with the class exercises. \r\nWeakness - course feels rushed, we didn't spend a lot of time on each topic before moving on to the next. It felt like we were always cramming in material last minute before the upcoming exam. Explorations on Canvas are unhelpful and unnecessary.",
                "The class was exactly what you'd expect: a survey math class. My professor was very nice, and he seemed to genuinely want us to succeed. He was very receptive to questions and even encouraged them. However, the class was extremely disengaging. I found it hard to focus during the lectures (this may have been due to the Zoom format). Everyone's cameras were off, and we had very few opportunities to interact with each other and work through problems.  Furthermore, I genuinely learned more from peer tutors than from the class itself. I had no idea how to apply the information from class to problems, and we were given no guidance on how to do so. The information on the exams required you to know things not discussed in class. There weren't opportunities to get re-grades on P-Sets. When we received grades back very little information was given to explain missed questions. I had some knowledge from high school that helped me limp through the more difficult stuff, but I can't imagine taking the class without that background. The class obviously had a clear plan, and we were given surface level information about each of the topics we needed to cover. Unfortunately, that information was not enough to deal with the complex problems we were given on graded assignments, and I'm afraid that will be reflected in my grade.",
                "Online classes are very difficult to understand. Coupled with a lecture format with kids of all different levels of math understanding, the class was almost impossible to follow. \r\nI also think that having so many different sections of the class take the exact same test was unfair. Different teachers have different methods and skills which can mean that different sessions are able to gain different understandings of the class. \r\nI like the explorations and concept checks, they were very helpful and good for establishing a good base understanding for all students.",
                "Seminar style was pretty helpful.",
                "The course was fairly organized and I could follow the schedule well. It was a bit fast paced, though I guess that is the nature of a college course. I wish the comments on graded exams and problem sets were clearer. I can only improve if I see what I did wrong, which is most helpful if the solution is attached to the graded exam or problem set. There was an exam where I got the question wrong, and the only comment was \"no.\" I recognize it is wrong if I got points off; the issue is understanding how to do the problem.",
                "The lectures were organized and the material was explained well by the instructor. The problem sets and explorations due before each class were definitely manageable. However, the example problems reviewed during each lecture seemed much easier than the level of problems on the problem sets and the exams.",
                "This course was strong in that it gave the sense that each instructor was familiar with what they were teaching but one weakness that arose from this was that occasionally this made it so that it felt like they did not always understand the questions being posed by students. This will hopefully be improved once Covid passes.",
                "Strengths: the course provides review sessions for midterms, final exams, etc.\r\nWeaknesses: Not all professors are great at teaching and this course really depends on your learning style and the type of professor that you get. Virtually, it was difficult forming study groups.",
                "Straightforward math class. Nothing can solve this but its tough that some students have already taken higher levels of math than others, so first chapters are mostly review for some.",
                "The structure of the entire course is in terms of order of material is odd.",
                "There were a lot of resources put in place to help out students. However, learning this class online was difficult at times.",
                "Good pace with a lot of resources.",
                "My lecturer provided poor explanations for much of the content. In several cases, we had to learn an entire concept on our own after class. This course needs to standardize how the material is taught between sections because my section was at a MASSIVE disadvantage compared to other sections."

Students cannot control faulty internet connection or other technological issues. The recorded lecture does not have to be posted on Canvas; if the student needs the lecture for any reason, they can email the professor directly. That way, students can still be encouraged to come to lectures and the lecture is available as a backup for students who need it.",

                "Although the live lectures worked well, I often wished that the lectures were also recorded so that I had a chance to go back and review parts of class against my notes. I understand why this wasn't the case since that might cause most of the students to not wish to attend the live portion of the class, but it would have been helpful when it came to review. On top of that, I wish all of the review sessions before the exams would have been recorded because sometime their time conflicted with other commitments and I found that hurt my performance on the exams, but I am grateful that the ones before the final were recorded.",
