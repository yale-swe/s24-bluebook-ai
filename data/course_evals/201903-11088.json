   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Lectures are poorly put together and not organized for learning. Professor just rattles off information. Readings are often only vaguely connected to course content. Midterm grading seems arbitrary and more of a time crunch than anything else.",
    "I thought the lectures were kind of boring and sometimes hard to keep up. I wish the material taught connected better. There were definitely some overarching themes but still a lot of the historical trends\/events seemed really scattered. Also, I know a lot of public health is social and political, but I felt like there wasn't enough of the science discussed in this class",
    "The grading of the midterms was extremely unfair and I believe it ruined the class for many people. In a class of over 100 people, rather than having certain TAs grade each question, they simply had the TAs grade their own section's entire midterms. This resulted in some sections having an average grade nearly 20% lower than other sections, with little effort to check the grade distribution. What was a very interesting course turned into a very stressful experience for people.",
    "Very interesting topics and material, but Professor Rogers always went through the information too quick to keep up because she would try to squeeze too many slides into each lecture.",
    "Strengths: cool topics\r\nWeaknesses: boring lectures -- I could barely stay awake. The lectures also move way too quickly, you can't even take notes effectively.",
    "Weakness: General Overview over extensive history that dilutes the history into one rather than allowing us to fully understand the topics and see the interconnectedness (Would have been better to teach by time period rather than topics)",
    "Strengths of the course include the interesting information at nearly every lecture; I greatly enjoyed learning about the history of public health in the U.S. through Professor Rogers' slides. Section readings were a good supplement to lectures. The course could be improved with inclusion of other parts of the grade, such as reading responses, or something of the like, in order to prepare for the final paper. Additionally, the course could have students write their final paper earlier in the semester or in steps and receive feedback from their TF; it was difficult having the final paper and final exam (together, 70% of the grade) within the same week.",
    "I thought a lot of the material was very interesting, but I think the professor made a lot of over-generalizations and assumptions about the history. There were many gaps in her simplified statements that she did not acknowledge. Some of the things she said were not very culturally-sensitive. She made a few racist generalizations about China that made me pretty upset.",
    "This course needs to be more intentional with the material it covers. It tried to cover every single thing associated with Public Health in America since 1793, and I found myself worrying more about remembering names\/dates than actually important lessons.",
    "I think sections could be improved to be more effective and the final paper could be due earlier in the term.",
    "I think the content of this course is interesting, and I think the segmentation of the course into each individual lecture makes a lot of sense. I think the lectures are fairly well-structured and flow logically - however, they contain a lot of information. While this is not necessarily a weakness during lecture, it can make it difficult to recognize what is most important and what we should focus on, particularly for assessments. I appreciated the lists of key terms that were presented alongside lectures, and those did help, but I think even those lists of key terms were sometimes a bit dense. Perhaps some slides could be indicated as less important and just for background, so that students get to hear the information but don't fixate on it.\r\n\r\nAnother weakness, in my opinion, is the way in which the exams are graded. It seems somewhat strange that each ID response must include certain, specific details, or else students lose points, when the questions are worded in such a way that we are asked to share about each topic and why it is significant. That makes it seem like students should be assessed on whether they have correctly described that topic in context and its significance, instead of hitting every item of a checklist. (This also contributed to another weakness, which is that we don't receive very detailed feedback throughout this course. The exams were graded such that only point totals were written by our questions, so we didn't know what exactly we missed.)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while I can appreciate that a final paper and a final exam assess different skills and are each valuable in their own way, I found the timeline of final assignments to be incredibly stressful. The final exam was the first slot of the exam period, and the essay was due two days before, during reading period. This meant that I was spending a huge amount of time on this class for a few days and that I had to split my time between preparing for two very different assessments; plus, it meant that I felt rushed on the paper because I didn't have much of reading period to work on it. I think it might be helpful if the paper was due at the end of finals (like the 18th), so that students can better budget their time and dedicate more time to writing and to studying.",
    "Strengths of this course are that there is a pretty low amount of coursework and the lectures are interesting, but sometimes it feels like the lectures aren't as cohesive as they could be.",
    "Strengths: interesting topics, easy to understand, readings are super interesting, not a lot of work which helps you engage more and worry less about work\r\n\r\nweakness: taught very out of order, there was a HUGE issue with TF's and uneven grading on the midterm",
    "I don't think the weekly readings were necessary or coincided with the course that well (or exams, to be honest). There was a lot of information on the slides (and sometimes the points made on the slide were incomplete or not clear so Wikipedia was my best friend when studying for the final). Midterm grading was also pretty harsh (and many of my friends ended up dropping, which is so sad considering how public health impacts us every day!).  Just stay on top of the information and memorize all names of old, racist, white men\r\n\r\nMaybe work on essay not during the reading period (like many others, including myself, did and regretted).\r\n\r\nAlso,  having both a final AND a 10-page paper due on the same week (while also counting 70% of your grade) = fail.",
    "The strengths are the variety and breadth of topics covered and the knowledgeable TAs. However, this class has many weaknesses, including the incredibly vague, unclear, and often confusing lecture slides. I had never seen lecture slides completely filled with text before taking this class and was impressed with the amount of information Professor Rogers was able to fit without making it at all clear what the main point was. All together, I do not feel that I learned anything substantial and wish I had taken a different class that would be more helpful for my future career in medicine. Clearer lecture slides, relating the material to present day, and allowing for greater discussion rather than presenting material in biased and unnecessarily inflammatory ways would be a huge improvement.",
    "I think the material was very comprehensive and it told a great story about the development of health in the United States. Sometimes the lectures could be a bit dense though. The workload of this course is pretty light -- all you had to do were a few readings each week for discussion section. One way to improve the class is to maybe move the due date of the paper. It was a lot to handle during Reading Period to have both a paper due and exam to take within days of each other.",
    "This course covered an incredibly wide time period. That being said, there was a lot of material which required memorization. The topics themselves were interesting and very important to consider for anyone interested in health in America. However, I feel that given more time, or perhaps a smaller scope, it would have been beneficial to delve into more about the political and social atmospheres in which the topics of the course took place. Some of this could perhaps occur is section. Rather than merely reviewing the important facts of lecture, it would be good to have time to discuss what we learn in the context of our own lives. For example, I would have enjoyed the opportunity to unpack the differing views of second wave feminism between white activists and black activists.",
    "This course has potential to be good, but could be improved in a variety of ways. First, the lectures simply cover too much content, so the professor often runs over or speeds through things towards the end. Second, parts of the content covered problematic theories or histories, and the class claims that it teaches about about intolerance in public health and how to prevent it, but the professor did not do an adequate job of explaining the problems with these theories. She often mentioned very briefly why certain theories had racist\/sexist\/classist roots, but does not spend nearly enough acknowledging these facts.",
    "Boring as dirt",
    "The amount of content in the course is the right amount and most weeks the readings were manageable. However, I feel that we did not have enough time on the midterm.",
    "Lectures are boring and not engaging. Hard to pay attention. Section much more helpful.",
    "I absoultely hated this course. The material itself is fine and sometimes interesting, but the way the professors interplays it into her message is extremely annoying and false in information.",
    "This course is all memorization.",
    "Lectures were extremely rushed, would make sense to comprehensively review for at least an hour instead of 50 minutes",
    "The material was very interesting. I really enjoyed writing the research paper and engaging with the material on a deeper level. The lectures are not the most engaging, but if you are fascinated by the material, they are pretty enjoyable.",
    "Lectures were very interesting! Perhaps more clarity and communication between Prof. Rogers and students.",
    "Weakness- the course and lectures are organized by topic which makes sense, but could have done a better job of putting things in perspective with each other to give us a better sense of the chronological order of everything.",
    "Its not interesting stuff. Its just about racism and sexism. This should be somewhere in the description.",
    "Needs a lot more structure. The section was good but lecture very disorganized as she just talked.",
    "Strengths: interesting material, now that the class is finished I'm really glad I learned it all, useful stuff to know\r\nWeaknesses: The organization of the lectures was not very clear. I wish she started with an outline of where she was going, and then dived in, because the movies and media were all interesting and all but they made the point she was making kind of unclear. I wish also the technical issues with her microphone could have been resolved, because she does have a really soft voice.\r\nAlso, the readings should be optional in my opinion, because we never used them except to talk in section and they weren't necessary to get the main gist of the course.",
    "Strength was that it did an adequate job of giving information about public health from 1793 to the present. Weakness was that I'm not sure the way the grading worked was the best to assess student performance.",
    "The only major weaknesses of this course are that 1.) if you need to miss a lecture, it is very hard to get the information you missed unless you have a friend in the class, and 2.) exam grading was pretty vague, and we didn't really get feedback on how to improve for the final.",
    "Maybe less readings, but more focused readings.",
    "The lecture wasnt great. Material wasnt organized in a manner in which it was chronological, so figuring out how to place certain events into a timeline was difficult",
    "The lectures are not very rich or engaging, and so it is difficult to retain information on the spot. The exams also do not seem to test our understanding of the material as much as they test how much of our hippocampus we have left to memorize the entire curriculum. Also, feedback on the exams would be helpful, as points on the exam were taken off without any explanations; the average on the first midterm was a C+. I think there needs to be a mutual understanding among the TFs grading and the students so that the correct information is given about exams and papers.",
    "The grading for the midterm was an abomination. I had essentially the exact same test as someone else and I received a c- when others got As the discrepancy between grading was horrible. Im not even close to the only person who experienced this",
    "Strengths: interesting readings and interesting course content; low workload\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lecture and section material was presented from a very left-biased perspective with little opportunity for discussion; expectations and grading for midterm exam were unclear; very little guidance was given for the final paper; discussion sections were rarely insightful; lectures were hard to hear; lecture material was factually inaccurate (Ex. We were told that Margaret Sanger used the eugenics movement only to help immigrants while it has been clearly documented that she wanted to use abortion to eliminate blacks...); overall, the course is very hostile to 1) people of faith, 2) people who dissent from the class' quasi-communist consensus, 3) people who believe in the inalienable dignity of human life, and 4) people who believe in individual responsibility and a moral standard of behavior.",
    "Each lecture had so much information. The first midterm was graded very harshly and they were unclear about what they wanted as answers. There was also such a great discrepancy between the grading of the TA's.",
    "the content was very interesting and the content was well-organized (since it was chronological), I think there should not have been a final exam nd final paper because that is a lot for one class, the paper could have been due earlier or there could have been two midterms instead. I also do not think we were given enough direction for the research paper because essentially we were told to write a research paper on anything in American public health that interested us.",
    "I don't think the way this course was taught was conducive to learning the information in an effective way.",
    "The order of the lectures was a bit confusing. And I think the grade weightings could be adjusted a bit.",
    "This course was designed to present public health history in the most basic possible way. It is a traditional lecture in which Professor Rogers stood and talked for the entire class period. The lecture slides were not abundantly helpful and the specificity of the identification terms on the exams, particularly the midterm, made it difficult to do very well in the course. The content is interesting but the format of the lectures and tests leaves much to be desired.",
    "I thought the lectures were somewhat disorganized. Sometimes it felt like a general topic was picked and then random events and ideas were chosen within that broad topic. I also felt like the grading was dependent on the TA that graded your test which didnt seem fair. I think each TA should be given a question to grade (like each TA is given one ID that grade for everyone) that way the grading is more consistent.",
    "Strengths included Professor Rogers' and my TA's enthusiasm and passion for this course. Major shoutout to Krishna for being such a fantastic TF and for making this class more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses included how sometimes there would be the most random details mentioned in lecture that we would be expected to remember that are pretty much inconsequential when looking at the scope of public health. Also, the grading is pretty wack when it came to the midterm. Finally, having a 10-page paper due AND a final two days after was definitely stress-worthy.",
    "The course was well taught and put together. I would only recommend spacing out the due date of the essay and the final exam.",
    "professor needs to speak louder and have clearer slides",
    "Strengths: Professor Rogers is extremely knowledgeable. Weaknesses: not great organization.",
    "Strengths: you can choose how much you want to participate (doesnt mean it's an easy A) the material is easy to grasp, Weaknesses: a lot of information to memorize, having a research paper and a final due was too much work",
    "I felt that the essay writing process was slightly unclear and unrelated to the rest of the courses structure. I learned about a lot of history and interesting topics, and the course had an excellent breadth and depth of information.",
    "Strengths are that the lecture were very straightforward and the sections were helpful in connecting the readings to the in class material",
    "i think that the sections could be better tailored to review. I also feel like they didnt tell us a lot about what was expected on the paper",
    "Interesting",
    "I think that the strengths are definitely the discussion sections, the very engaging lectures, and the extremely engaging course material. However, files (ex: presentations, readings, etc.) are fairly disorganized on Canvas. I would have greatly appreciated a zip file or some way to download a week's readings all at once.",
    "The lectures were disorganized at times and presented too much information.",
    "A weakness is that this course doesn't have clear feedback and grading seems arbitrary and clear. Your whole grade is based on one midterm, one final, and a final essay.",
    "Grading on exams was far too difficult and did not clearly lay out expectations. For those of you planning to take this course in the future, be sure to ask specifically how the TAs are grading the IDs as this really put my grade in jeopardy after the midterm exam. The lectures were solid but felt pretty rushed times. It was hard to tell how to study for the exams because there was just so much material covered. Solid TAs that were very helpful and understanding.",
    "Midterms graded pretty harshly",
    "Strengths: interesting material\r\nWeaknesses: fail to create longer coherent narratives of POC activism, difficult to engage with class material",
    "I think this course covers too much material at a superficial depth. It would be much better if the amount of material was cut in half and the remaining topics were covered more effectively.",
    "I do think that the lectures were very informative, and our sections did lead to good discussion for the lecture topics. However, I do think that the level of engagement could have been increased as the lectures did get repetitive at times. I also wish that the format for the midterm had been better explained, especially for people who had not taken a history class before, but you do learn a lot about the public health movement and themes that still apply to today.",
    "I found the content of this course very interesting and the lectures very engaging. I did not like that there were only 3 assignments to make up the entire grade.",
    "Very broad overview of public health. You have to find the material interesting to engage with the course because lecture and section will not be that interesting.",
    "I feel like the class covers so much information and such a broad time period that it is a bit difficult to fully comprehend every event that is discussed in class.",
    "Strengths - very interesting topics covered! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Professor Rogers spoke very softly in lecture so I often had trouble hearing her even with the mic (I sat in the back), and sometimes a bit too much historical context was given in lecture and I had trouble following how it connected to public health.",
    "The topics were incredibly fascinating but I found that the lectures were often rushed. Similarly, I found that the assessments in the class should be more evenly spaced. I would prefer to know more about my academic standing in the class prior to reading period. Furthermore, I think that there should be more discussion about the amount of writing required for the exams. Although I felt like I had a solid understanding of the content covered, I didn't believe that the exams were structured in ways that would allow me to fully showcase my knowledge within the given amount of time.",
    "Unclear expectations but great content",
    "Strength: not a strenuous workload, lectures were interesting, material was fairly easy. \r\nWeakness: sections were poorly organized. The students in the various sections were not receiving the same instructions for things like the final paper or midterms, or even covering the same material in class. We got almost no feedback on how we were doing in the class (mostly because there is so little engagement and very few assignments) . The class is very heavily oriented to public health as it applies to white, straight men, with minorities all tacked on at the end, or given their own separate lesson and then never discussed again.",
    "Each class was a 50-minute lecture, which required nonstop note-taking. It was very hard to stay engaged the entire time or keep up with the lecture.",
    "strengths- interesting information\r\nweaknesses- dry and difficult to understand lectures",

    "If you're interested in public health or learning about America's shitty public health responses towards epidemics\/illness\/sickness, I'd say yes. Keep in mind that it's also a history course (not just HSHM) so be prepared to memorize the numerous names of old, white racist men who guided the initial public health system in America if you wanna do well on the midterm. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, if taking this course, the info is interesting but be prepared to hear a lot of generalizations. There is literally one slide where she's talking about food from different cultures and she says that Hispanics eat: \"tortilla \/ salsa \/ mashed beans.\" Being Hispanic myself, I was T R I G G E R E D that she incorrectly said Hispanic foodwhich stems from 15 countries, and is influenced by other cultural styleswas just three ingredients. That slide was just filled with generalizations, so why include it (ESPECIALLY when one of the biggest problems in public health is generalizing or simplifying super complicated issues)? This one slide made me realize, what other things does she generalize? What is just her inputting her opinion and what is actually the truth?\r\n\r\nAnd that's my TED talk",
    "No, take a more engaging HSHM class if that is what you are looking for. Also, if you are premed, do not expect a great deal from this class; the information is presented but not much useful information is learned.",
    "Definitely! If you are curious about what public health is, this is a great introductory course. Even though it's primarily history, it is somewhat interdisciplinary.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who does not have a background in history or public health, but is interested in learning more about both disciplines.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have any interest in medicine or historical developments in the U.S. related to public health. However, be prepared for the reading load and the amount of terms you have to learn the definition and significance of.",
    "No. Better \"easy\" options out there. Hard to do well on exams without studying hard.",
    "No. The grade wayyyyyyy to hard for the only three assignments there are. its not worth it in any sense of the matter. its a ridiculous course",
    "Maybe",
    "This course is all memorization, please take a better history or public health course.",
    "Yes.  It was a fascinating course.  The subject matter was really interesting, and I would recommend it to any student interested in a career in medicine.",
    "Yes! I really liked the course. I left feeling confident in my knowledge of public health history, which is applicable to all parts of life (and medicine)!",
    "Yes, if you are interested in public health.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student - both history and non-history majors. I learned a lot about the history of public health and various epidemics that hit various places and how they were solved.",
    "Nope.",
    "Not really unless you are interested in public health.",
    "Depends on what you're looking for. It can kind of be a \"gut\" (there are no true guts at yale I guess) during the semester, but then 70% of your grade depends on the last week (30% 10 page paper due Tues 40% final exam on Thurs, I don't remember the exact percentages, but I think that was what it was) \r\nIt took a long time to study because I had no idea how to prepare which is my fault but then I spent a ton of time memorizing just about as much as I could. \r\nOn the other hand, very happy I know this information now and actually remember a good amount. I organized the material myself to study and the main themes are pretty interesting. Wish the class did that for us through the lectures but it didn't really, but the information was still good to know.",
    "No. I would definitely not recommend this course to anyone. The lectures were dry, were more history than public health based, and the grading could not have been more unclear on exams.",
    "Yes, it is indeed a survey of public health in America, if that is something you have the time and opportunity for. I think public health is important and I appreciated the fact that it always draws back to health disparities that have existed in the past and are still present today. It encourages me to try to make a change.",
    "Yes, very interesting, learnt a lot.",
    "I would just because all of the material was really interesting",
    "If you need this for your major, please get some sleep. It is not worth losing it trying to memorize every potential name, event, and date that might, but probably won't be on the exam. This could be a really good class with less emphasis on memorization and more on just using the material to develop connections and thought-provoking answers.",
    "No, not unless you want to be taught historically inaccurate information and taught to think from only an uber-liberal perspective. Don't take this course if you think that objective truths exist; if you do take this course, you will be sorely disappointed by its rampant relativism.",
    "Not really.",
    "yes the content was very interesting and the workload is manageable",
    "No.",
    "No I would not, not great lectures.",
    "Yes! Especially for prospective HSHM majors.",
    "If youre looking for a good Hu class to take, I would not recommend this course. If you are really interested in Public Health history, then this course is interesting enough to take. Definitely not a guy, despite being a large lecture.",
    "I think you really have to love the topic of this course to take it.",
    "To be honest, not really. There are probably better HSHM classes you could take.",
    "Yes, I think it is both an interesting and well taught class.",
    "no, it is advertised like a gut then graded ridiculously hard",
    "Go Liberal or Go Home (and with a C)",
    "yes I would if they are interested in public health, and to pre-med students",
    "Yes, I think it serves as an excellent introduction to public health.",
    "Yes. Interesting and not too time consuming to understand and learn the topics covered. Gives an important background into public health in America that helps you better understand current issues",
    "yea if you want a general overview of public health",
    "No",
    "No. The grading of this class was not friendly. Despite following strict guidelines for the midterm, many students resulted in very poor grades. The average of the first midterm was in the high 70s range, and there was no further instructions given by the professor on how to improve them.",
    "Yes",
    "I would heavily recommend this course to all students interested in the health sciences or history.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in the history of public health.",
    "This class is NOT a gut! Although the workload is relatively low the whole semester with reading for section being the only work required, so if you are looking for a class that's relatively low in workload this would be ok. However, the grade is dependent on three things so I would not take this as a fifth class if you are stressed about grades.",
    "If you are taking for a HU credit as I was, you should go elsewhere. This course is too difficult to be worth it and you can probably find something easier. Otherwise, for those into Public Health and find this material very interesting I would say that I learned a lot. However be sure to be conscious of exam expectations because that really set me off after the first midterm.",
    "Its a relatively straightforward Hu credit but not the most engaging.",
    "No, I would suggest taking a class that covers content on a more meaningful level than simple rote memorization.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who has an interest in public health or health history in general, and for potential pre-med students who want to learn a bit more about what they might be involved with in the future. If you put in the work and start studying in advance then it should be fine in terms of workload and exam difficulty.",
    "Not necessarily. This course helped me realize that I don't care as much about American history as I thought I may have. I might recommend a friend take a different course in the HSHM concentration.",
    "If you have any interest in public health or need a humanities course as a premed, this is a solid option.",
    "I would recommend this course to only those who are truly interested in the topic.",
    "Yes, definitely if you are interested in public health or the medical professions! You learn a lot about the history and development of key events in health and medicine in America, which helps you understand why things are the way they are today!",
    "Yes but not a gut",
    "Would be a good 5th class to take as an upperclassmen.",
    "Yes.",
    "Extremely disappointed with the content, teaching style, and overall trajectory of this course. Out of the many classes I have taken, this lecture course was by far the worst and I regret taking it. Most of the lecture content featured was highly irrelevant, miniscule details that detracted from the major themes that Dr. Rogers tried to convey. When we received back our midterms, there were numbers marked next to our answers to designate points awarded, with no comments in any of our bluebooks. We went over the correct answers briefly in section and everyone that had individual questions about their exams had to meet with our extremely unapproachable TF. Students had no one to go to to voice their concerns. As well, Dr. Rogers does not lecture with clarity and makes herself very unavailable to students that seek her help, leaving the Teaching Fellows to pick up the slack, and the experiences I had in my section were very unpleasant.\r\n\r\nMy Teaching Fellow confused me with other students in our section, hardly listened to anything I had to say when I spoke in section, and made us all feel incompetent. Everyone in my section was very unhappy over the course of the semester, yet our TF and the professor herself gave us no opportunity to voice our discontent. I came into this class with the hope of understanding the field of Public Health with more clarity and instead found myself feeling as though I wasted a credit. For future aspiring HSHM majors, take it from a student that enjoys learning and has had a generally positive Yale experience during my time on campus, don't waste your time with educators that do not take the time to curate an enjoyable course.",
    "I would recommend this class to get a baseline of public health knowledge.",
    "yes- a good introductory hshm course",
    "no, it is hard and boring"
