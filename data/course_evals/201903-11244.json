    "No weaknesses. Loved the course",
    "Good engagement in class",
    "More worksheets and interactive activities during class would have helped more. Sometimes the instructor goes on too quick without the students grasping the material.",
    "My strengths included having good attendance, and writing down notes. I attended peer tutoring for multiple hours per week. I struggled however applying what I learned to the problem sets and actual problems outside of class. Perhaps I could have improved this by attending office hours or asking for more help.",
    "My biggest weakness going into this course was justifying my answers with explanations. The course forced me to improve my written justifications in order to get full credit.",
    "There was a lot of material covered but classes were not very engaging",
    "I think the weaknesses of this course are a lack of teaching clarity. I think this could be improved by more problems worked out in class."

    "Only take this course if you are required.",
    "I think it is a good class to start your mathematics adventure at Yale, if math is not your strong suite",
    "Yes. It was a great intro to calculus",
    "I personally would not recommend it, but I am biased because math is not my favorite subject. However, besides this I did not find the way the course was taught entertaining or stimulating in any way. The whole class felt like it was note-taking and occasional problem solving, which I did not find particularly interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course as a good reinforcement of calculus skills, but not to as a first experience with calculus.",
    "Yes. Its a good math course for students who already have a little background in calculus. I think it is a little difficult if someone had not previously taken a math course.",
    "I would recommend this course because I feel like the topics covered were very useful for future math courses",
    "I would not recommend taking this course to another student. The difficulty of this course fluctuated wildly. Some parts of this course were incredibly easy, while other parts were incredibly challenging. It was not consistent. The teaching was also not the best.",
    "Dont take this course if you dont have to, never take this teacher for this course.",
    "No. I don't believe aimlessly solving problems without any real reason other than to solve them is philosophically or morally useful."
