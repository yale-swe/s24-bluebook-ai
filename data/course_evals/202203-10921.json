                "Strengths: the class was well-organized, and the material was taught in a very understandable way. The exams were also very reasonable, and felt like a good test of what we had learned. Lectures were always available after class as well for further review, which was really helpful if you had to miss.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The homework assignments were definitely a weakness of the course. They were extremely difficult, often not testing on material actually taught in class, and could generally not be successfully completed without the help of a TF in office hours. No homeworks are dropped, and there is no curve. Generally, these homework assignments felt impossible at times, even if you had been attending class consistently and paying attention.",
                "Strengths: Professor McKay teaches at an appropriate pace and breaks down mathematical concepts well. Although this course is called \"Tools for Computer Science\" there is very little discussion about applications to computer science.\r\nWeaknesses: Professor McKay doesn't give a lot of direction or examples on proof-writing.",
                "I personally don't think it should be required for Computing and the Arts majors who are not interested as I do not see it being useful to me outside of just general problem solving skills.",
                "This course is well structured and the pacing was fine.",
                "I thought the class was really solid. I don't have any complaints. The pset grading rubric seemed a little harsh at times, but overall, the lectures were clear and well-taught.",
                "The lectures were a good introduction to the material, but the PSETs differed significantly in difficulty. Supplementary videos could help make the PSETs less daunting.",
                "The professor gave very clear and well-rehearsed lectures and provided good examples to illustrate what we were learning. The ULA's for the course were also incredibly critical to the quality of the course, since they really helped us understand the homework and lessons. A weakness of the course was the difficulty of the problem sets and how they sometimes did not correspond tightly with the lecture. Even after studying the lectures and reviewing the notes, I usually was unable to understand how to approach many of the homework questions without assistance from the teaching faculty.",
                "Strengths - lectures were usually clear, and office hours were frequent \r\nWeaknesses - lectures did not adequately prepare us for the level of rigor of homework; unnecessarily difficult and time-intensive course",
                "Strengths: lectures explained the concepts well and we were able to engage throughout them, rather than just listening for the entire lecture. The grading system is also great - psets are tougher and are meant to pose a challenge but are worth less of the grade, while tests, the primary grade component, focus on ensuring you understand the core concepts.\r\nWeaknesses: psets often required unintuitive solutions/ways of thinking that one couldn't really figure out without going to office hours and getting the answer from a TF.",
                "Strengths: helpful TAs, interesting topics with a focus on how they're applicable to computer science, Dylan\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Difficulty of the homeworks (usually there would be one part of a question, for instance, that would take up a disproportionate amount of time and be very challenging compared to the rest) while the exams would be much easier, Dylan's explanations sometimes could be confusing, and lectures often disorganized, difficult to know what we should expect to be tested on when, often, many topics from lecture did not appear on the homework, class can be daunting if its your first experience with proofs",
                "Strengths are definitely lectures. I actually went to them, and Dylan was great at building things step-by-step from one topic to the next. Weakness is for sure exams. There is so much weight on the final, especially, and it covers so much material that it's hard to feel prepared. I felt I had a good grasp of most of the things we covered in class, but don't think that came across in my performance on exams. Also, proofs are hard.",
                "Strengths: much easier than MATH 244, (Amy Zhao - GOAT TA, only go to her for help)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A WHOLE LOT\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this was just my class (FALL 2022), or if it is the course in general, but in what world do you not have an answer key to the PSETS ready at the start? Because the \"official\" answer key is created by the HEAD TA, not the professor, AFTER the PSET is due, there is no standardization to the course. The number of times I have gone to one person's office hours and been told one thing, to go to another person's office hours and get told the other is UNFATHOMABLE. It is truly a waste of everyone's time if you have 30 people sitting in a TA's Office Hours, and we are all waiting on A: the TA to finish the PSET themselves, or B: the TA waiting for the head TA to answer their questions on Slack to get clarity on the PSET because there is NO FREAKING STANDARDIZED ANSWER KEY. This issue boils over to the grading as well. During office hours, I get told that a particular way of proving something works, but, when I use it in my proof, I lose points because it isn't viable. And then when you go to regrade it, saying that a TA told you this works and that you do not need to further prove this lemma or this case, they do not accept it. Thus, there needs to be an official answer key and more standardization before PSETS are even released so that there is never this confusion and stupidity going forward. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, PSETS are for testing the knowledge you learned in lectures, not as a substitute for lectures. So maybe let's not use \"Clifford is a big red dog\" to introduce sets in the lecture, just to go 100x harder on the PSETS, while also dedicating the first 1-2 pages of every PSET to teach a new topic that has not been taught, and won't be taught in class. BOTTOM LINE: either the lecture examples need to be harder to better reflect the PSET questions, or the PSET questions need to be easier to better reflect the examples shown in the lecture. \r\n\r\nIt is a clear reflection of the course when the entire 2nd floor of AKW (where OH are held) is filled with people sitting on the ground, the radiators, and pulling chairs from other rooms just so they can get help from the poor TA.",
                "One strength of this course was the quantity of resources available to students. If someone was struggling with the course, there was always office hours and other resources available to help students.",
                "The lectures were understandable but not at the difficulty/complexity required to complete psets.",
                "Strengths: plenty of opportunity to go to office hours to seek help from TAs\r\nWeakness: content of the psets didn't seem to align too well with what was taught in lecture at times (more challenging/difficult). I also wished that late days were counted by single days rather than by 2 days.",
                "Strengths: Engaging lecturer, good review materials. Understandable introduction to proof-based thinking.\r\nWeaknesses: Step-up in difficulty from previous years might make it difficult for first-time learners / weed some people out of CPSC.",
                "the professor speaks really slowly and his presentations are often a little disorganized, so it made me prefer to watch lectures asynchronously. also, the TAs are not given answer keys so sometimes I am led down the wrong path with homework psets.",
                "This course was well taught. Homeworks were a bit too difficult and I think too much of the course's grade is made up of exams (75%), of which there were only 2.",
                "Strengths: OH with Amy and Gus, lecture was engaging, open notes tests were very nice (emphasizing knowledge of content rather than formulas), the final exam review week with OH every day was very nice\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Lecture content was way too easy compared to the pset difficulty (we were also learning new topics on the pset as at times there would be a page discussing a new topic)  I would either make lecture example problems more difficult or pset problems easier/more in line with lecture\r\n- Annotated slides were not always posted (about half from after the midterm were not posted when I was studying for the final)\r\n- Discrepancy of pset answers/ways to do problems at OH from different ULAs (I assume there is no standardized answer key)\r\n- Practice exams posted about 3 days before the exam\r\n- Pacing of class was too slow; we didn't get to linear algebra and spent 20 minutes on probability",
                "I thought the course was very well organized and structured overall.",
                "The TAs were this courses strength. Difficulty in homework can be considered a weakness considering the big jump made from lectures.",
                "Strengths - content was important.\r\nWeaknesses - problem sets were so detached from lecture, that they were too difficult to attempt. I spent a lot of time in office hours learning the content for the first time.",
                "The lectures were very interesting and engaging, learning a lot from all of them. Also, the Office Hours clarified all my questions regarding the problem sets or other material from the course. I enjoyed solving the assignments because they were original and required unusual, inventive approaches.",
                "Strengths: great ULA support and help with psets and overall concepts. \r\nWeaknesses: low communication with professor and overly difficult problem sets that did not reflect the difficulty of practice we did during lectures. There was a considerable gap between what went on in class and what we did for homework. I'm only thankful that we had a great team of ULAs who were willing to help us understand the material and do the homework without such difficulty.",
                "I thought the lectures were interesting and I really liked the fact that the course gives an overview of many different topics, giving me an idea of the different branches of mathematics relating to CS. I didnt like how the material in the psets was much harder than anything covered in the class, meaning I had to rely on the TAs to help me through the psets, and there weren't any practice materials that matched the course. Many of the TAs would go over material that was beyond the scope of the class in their review sessions, which I couldnt understand and was thus not very useful. I also think making the final 45% of the grade is excessive.",
                "Because the course was not extremely difficult or stressful for me, it was pretty fun and a good balance to the other classes in my schedule. I also liked the logical puzzles, and I found the other material enjoyable.",
                "The course was well-organized, and having recorded lectures to re-watch explanations was infinitely useful in my studying and understanding. The class could be improved by getting quicker feedback on the problem sets. Most of the problems are proof-based and you can take different approaches, so although the answer keys were very useful, having direct feedback would also be very helpful. \r\nThe problem sets were sometimes time-consuming and tested a deeper understanding of certain concepts, so I wish they had a higher weight in the course. I sometimes felt that I was putting in a lot of work without much in return. Maybe implementing the previous suggestion and having two exams + a final exam would help make the final exam less stressful (your entire grade is basically determined by that), and also test your understanding more frequently throughout the semester.",
                "A strength of this course is the office hours. I feel like I learned more during office hours than in lectures. A weakness is that I wished Professor McKay would give more content and in-depth examples in lectures that would be helpful on psets. I wish the psets were more 'practice what we learned in class' rather than 'go explore'.",
                "The in class lectures are good, but the psets are too hard. It's as though Dylan teaches algebra in class and gives calculus on psets. Also, the final exam is weighted so much more ( 40% of your overall grade), which is a bit unpleasing because all the work done during the semester wouldn't yield much result if you just a single mistake on the final."

But until they make PSET answer keys available to TAs before the PSET is due and they hold their OH, and until they make the lectures and PSETs reflect each other in terms of difficulty, this course is just a mess of unorganized chaos.
