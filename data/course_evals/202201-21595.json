Office hours were great (especially since there were so many opportunities to go). There were some inconsistencies with how well your TF/professor could explain the concepts.",

Additionally, the course had a great support system. From your instructor to peer mentors, somebody was always available to go over your questions with you. I wasn't personally a big fan of pre-class explorations. I feel like it was a tedious additional form of work that I didn't really benefit from at all.",
