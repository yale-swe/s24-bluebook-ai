Office hours were great (especially since there were so many opportunities to go). There were some inconsistencies with how well your TF\/professor could explain the concepts.",
                "The course facilitated learning very well. I liked that it was very structured; you could always find information about whatever you were looking for. Additionally, the course had a great support system. From your instructor to peer mentors, somebody was always available to go over your questions with you. I wasn't personally a big fan of pre-class explorations. I feel like it was a tedious additional form of work that I didn't really benefit from at all.",

                "This course is well organized, focused, and the expectations are very clearly established.",
                "Strengths: Lots of support with office hours, peer tutors, 1-on-1 tutors. Weaknesses: huge discrepancies between the TAs and the pace was unbelievable fast for those who were actually learning the material for the first time.",
                "Needs more individual teaching",
                "Very well organized with explorations\/videos before class, a good textbook, and helpful lecture notes. Exam prep was streamlined by review sessions and past exam availability."
