Ive learned grammatical, vocabulary, speaking, etc. Being able to be in a classroom environment with such likeminded individuals was so beautiful.",

His passion for teaching is such a high in the course. He engages his students so well & makes everyone feel heard and smart (even if sometimes we arent). I cant wait to take literature courses with him in the future.",

                "I think the variety of activities and class types throughout the week made it a lot easier to not get sick of class unlike those with the same lectures every two days. I also think that seminars were the way to go with Zoom, I felt way more engaged in my small classes than I ever did in Econ 115 and 116 - I don't know who decided to eliminate the seminar versions of those classes, but I have a bone to pick with them. Having group projects - with the groups assigned by our professor - also built into our class a way to get to know our classmates, which I really appreciated with the Zoom format and having been a remote student this semester. I also liked the consistency of assignments and clarity of instructions which accompanied them, I always knew what was expected of me which was a big deal when you couldn't easily just pop into your professor's office or office hours and ask a quick question.",

                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning the Arabic language. I entered this course with NO prior knowledge. After one year of working with Professor Elbousty, I have developed communication skills that will enable me to interact in the Islamic world. Most importantly, Professor Elbousty creates a safe space for students to explore their intellectual curiosities while learning a new language. I met some great people and forged long-standing friendships while taking this course.",
                "Yes, the course is integral to learning Arabic to a proficient level and is very well organized.",
                "Absolutely. I made some of my best friends in this course even though we were on Zoom just because of the energy of Professor Elbousty. Also Bayan and Salma were outstanding TAs. The course is definitely a lot of work, but you will get out of it exactly what you put in. Ive loved every minute of learning Arabic. Its so rewarding.",
                "Definitely! Arabic is a hard language to learn, but because of that looking back on your progress is honestly astonishing, and it means that Arabic is a fairly small community, which makes it a really amazing one. Everyone I met taking Arabic this year was just a lovely person, and the sense of community in our class with Professor Elbousty was strong. And like I said, it's a really rewarding language to study.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The Arabic language is intimidating to want to learn but this course makes it very doable.",
                "If they want to learn Arabic, of course.",
                "Definitely. The Arabic language is very fascinating and I've greatly enjoyed learning it under the amazing teaching team I had this past year."
