Having class everyday presented a challenge to my time management, but I was over to overcome my difficulties with it. Also, speaking Spanish in groups was a fun and inspiring experience.",
                "I learned basic communication skills in Spanish and also learned a lot about the culture and history of many Spanish speaking countries, both through the text book and through assignments given in class.",
                "Developed a fundamental understanding of basic Spanish grammar structures and vocabulary as well as a better understanding of many Hispanic cultures .",
                "I learned basic Spanish skills, primarily how to speak, read, and write. The course focused on pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. I also learned about the culture of some Spanish-speaking countries, which was integrated into our learning.",

            "comments": [
                "I think the strength of this course is the small class size and the fact that it meets every day. I feel like I really got to know my teacher and thus was able to learn Spanish on an intensive level. The weakness of this course was the length of the classes. I think the classes should be longer to allow for us to have more time to do activities in class.",
                "The strength is that it is an every day class so it is very easy to consistently work on you language skills. The design of the course helps to stay on task and does not allow student's to get distracted by the workload of other courses taken -- which is a good thing. The weakness I observed is regarding the Linguameeting sessions that were required of students to complete the course. I found that the sessions were not as helpful to improve my speaking skills, mainly because the sessions were too short. However, it did help me spot my weaknesses and allowed me to work on them.",
                "While the course gives students a lot of practice with the material it covers, there are too many required assignments with many of them being disorganized and difficult to keep track of. Whenever you finish an assignment, there is always more to be done and it is frequently redundant. \r\n\r\nThat being said, this course achieves its goal of teaching introductory Spanish to a very effective level.",
                "Strengths: the course was very well structured and taught in a way where the amount of knowledge learned wasn't overwhelming. The daily practice helped with learning vocabulary and grammar. I liked learning the material before class, as it allowed me to use class time to practice what was learned beforehand.\r\nWeakness: some of the homework assignments on Supersite were very difficult because the instructions were not clear, which made it difficult to recognize what you were getting wrong.",
                "The online materials, specifically VHL, that were provided to us students really helped me practice writing and reading in Spanish. However, spending more time on specific grammar concepts could be an improvement to this class."

                "I would recommend this course to students who are serious about wanting to learn a new language rather than fulfill the language requirement and move on. The class itself is enjoyable enough, but there is a lot of work to be done. Expect multiple assignments due for each class. There is a flipped classroom setting with learning via videos and practice speaking and understanding in class. Also expect to work in pairs and groups frequently.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It's a great introduction to Spanish, and we were able to learn a lot in just one semester. Even though there is a lot to learn, it was not too fast paced or stressful.",
