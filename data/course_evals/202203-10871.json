                "I improved my ability to speak, read, and write in academic Spanish. I also learned about concepts like globalization, host/guest relationships, and fast and slow violence. The class also introduced me to techniques of media analysis that I will continue to use in the future.",
                "Learned to read, comprehend, and analyze different academic texts in Spanish as well as use different modalities to produce my own knowledge. Additionally, i learned to interpret current events in a sociological point of view that takes into consideration the history and processes that govern borders and globalizations.",
                "I feel like I gained a clear understanding of the concepts of bordering and globalization in their many facets within the context of Spanish speaking countries and beyond. I can apply this knowledge and understanding to other relevant courses, which has proven invaluable. I also gained important insights into my own identity and my place in the world as a Yale student.",
                "my comprehension of oral spanish improved dramatically, as well as my ability to produce a large amount of written spanish work",
                "I learned about different forms of globalization and how borders are more than just physical lines that separate two pieces of land.",
                "I was so grateful to learn about core intellectual concepts that challenge the way I interact with borders and globalization every day. This class has weaved together ideas from lived experience and my other classes to give me critical thinking tools that I can apply to often-overlooked aspects of everyday living. Learning about historical viewpoints and narratives in the hispanophone world that are simply left out of secondary level texts has been very eye opening.",
                "These past few months have been filled with much learning and accomplishment. I entered Borders and Globalization in Hispanophone Cultures with the fear of not being able to function adequately in class. However, this has been a space where I have learned more in three months than in a year in any of the courses of my high school career. It is very satisfying to know that I can describe concepts such as spherology, the social womb or the worldviews of indigenous peoples to my social circle in a direct and clear way. It also gives me happiness to realize that I have the potential to excel academically in my native language, even when studying in an American environment.",
                "I learned about the diverse historical and social relations that drive processes of bordering and globalization. I also learned about the modes in which knowledge production shapes our reality.",
                "In this course, we approached our topic of borders and globalizations through several geographic and historical foci as well as through various philosophical concepts. These foci included North Africa and the Mediterranean, Equatorial Guinea, and Mexico and Central America. Philosophically, we read the work of Bruno Latour and Peter Sloterdijk. While we approached borders through the typical meaning of the word, we also explored how borders are constructed socially. Skills-wise, we read and analyzed a variety of texts, including poems, short stories, interviews, photographs, documentaries, sculptures, visual art, etc. This was in the service of the courses employment of multimodalidad to nurture multiliteracies. Through this course, I also refined my use of Spanish. As a heritage speaker, I especially gained a lot of skill in Spanish through discussing the more advanced topics we did."

                "This class is SO much work. This is good for creating an immersive experience and practicing the skills, but I spent about 5 times as much time on this class as my thesis. It is worth it, though, because I've created products I'm proud of. I just wish there could be a slight reduction in workload, as well as clearer communication (outside the syllabus) of assignment expectations and due dates.",
                "Biggest strength is that it implements different source forms into the curriculum including videos, movies, journal articles, advertisements, photos, etc. This makes the class more enjoyable while still diving into the theory of the topic at hand. In manages to merge theory with reality which makes it really enlightening. However, it was still very stressful in certain periods of time even after the revisions to the curriculum (used to be more work prior years).",
                "I think the content covered is excellent and spans a wide enough range of topics to solidify our knowledge. I do, however, feel like the course load is so high that at times it is difficult to fully internalize the material because we only scratch the surface of so many ideas. I know Prof has already made adjustments to reduce the course load for future semesters, but it feels important to note that it truly was an exorbitant amount of work. That being said, the subject material was fascinating, and the class 100% helps students achieve the course goals outlined in the syllabus and then some.",
                "strengths much growth in academic spanish and discussion skills, as well as knowledge in different anthropological questions.\r\n\r\nweaknesses exorbiant amount of written homework put great strain on my week",
                "The professor is very passionate about the material. Sometimes the expectations are not clear on what the prof wants to see on the assignments, but she is very good at clearing it up WHEN YOU ASK HER. Additionally, the workload can be very intense, especially towards the end of the semester, but she is usually good about giving deadlines.",
                "strengths\r\n- class readings are necessary to complete\r\n- class discussions are thoughtful and encompass entire class\r\n- students are given academic agency through projects and occasional student-run discussions\r\n- weekly feedback and consolidation of learned principles\r\n- encouraged to reflect on our own positionality\r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n- high workload\r\n- assignments due on Friday were quite stressful as the prospect of turning it in weighs on you all week (I personally prefer midweek)",
                "I admit that there were moments during the semester when I felt extremely anxious because I needed more time to finish and deliver the work with quality as I always prefer to do. But constant practice helped me hone my skills, especially my writing in the language.\r\n\r\nThe help has not only been in Spanish, but also the language that I am still learning: English. Now that we are coming to the end of the semester, having the opportunity to think critically about how we inhabit the world in Spanish has helped me further develop and hone that ability in my second language.",
                "Strengths were the diversity in modes of text that we were assigned as homework - books, essays, videos, pictures, visual art, narratives, etc - which made it much more engaging. I also appreciated the diversity of perspectives that we engaged. What could be improved is posing more open-ended, yet slightly more specific guiding questions in class because sometimes just asking 'what do you all think of x' leads to moments of dead silence. I found that when there were slightly more guided discussion sections, students were so much more engaged. I would've liked to spend a lot less time on the colonial maps because honestly, we learn that history in early education, and rather than studying the past which was a less stimulating and interesting unit, focusing on contemporary issues and struggles feels so much more relevant politically and personally. Also the workload was very inconsistent and for short bursts felt very unmanageable when we had multiple projects at once. I'd have preferred a more evenly spread-out workload.",
                "Strengths: The varieties of  the source we analyzed and the types of assignments we had.\r\nWeaknesses: Oftentimes, the workload felt excessive. After midterm, we were expected to write basically one essay a week, on top of keeping up with more and more readings, and our weekly journal of 500 words. Professor Njera allowed us to skip our notebook entries a few times,  but when we didnt, this workload felt difficult to sustainably accomplish.\r\n\r\nI would recommend reducing workload to allow for increased engagements with the course materials."

Although it was a fair amount of work it was one of the more interesting classes I have taken so far at Yale.",
                "Yes! I would recommend this class to anyone who wants a little bit of a challenge from a language class and is interested in anything Social Justice, Native American and immigrants rights issues, global politics, or anything in that realm. The material covered in this course is relevant to many other disciplines and helps instill in students a sense of global and social responsibility. Truly a fascinating class.",

Coming from a native Spanish speaker, the level of Spanish found in the course materials and used by the prof is VERY advanced, and I found it to be difficult at times. Despite being a tough grader, the prof seems to be good about giving As.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. If you're looking for an L5 Spanish class that doesn't require complete fluency to get an A and actually engages you, this course is perfect.",
                "YES! Being at Borders and Globalization in Hispanophone Cultures opened my eyes to how much I love learning Spanish and to realize that border and immigration awareness has excellent career potential for my future.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the material we've seen, I wish worldviews through the indigenous lens had been touched on more fully. In my opinion, this can be achieved if some of the material from Spain is cut out, for example, the way we talk about watches or the newspaper of Pigafetta or Corts.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for me to choose the lesson that I have enjoyed the most because \"unfortunately\" I enjoyed them all. However, one that marked me forever was the work El Espalda Mojada by Jorge Bustamante because the author does a beautiful job of showing immigration from the most rational and fair point of view possible, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the immigration process and also emphasizing the strengths and weaknesses of the immigrants you travel with.\r\n\r\nI finished this class satisfied with my learning and the pieces I have produced because I have seen remarkable growth in my academic and personal skills. In academic terms, I have developed my Spanish to a high level and, personally, I have learned to express my thoughts in the language clearly and effectively.",
                "Absolutely. I learned so much about important issues related to migration globally and engaged critical perspectives that really expanded my thinking. It is 100% worth the workload because learning about borders and globalization is so important to understanding and combatting systems of violence gobally.",
                "I would recommend this course to those wanting to engage the topic of borders and gloabalization in a way they havent before: in a way that analyze our very way of seeing. I would especially recommend it to those that want to produce knowledge in Spanish and not merely practice the language, something especially useful for heritage speakers."
