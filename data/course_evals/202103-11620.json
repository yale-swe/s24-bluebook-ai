                "This class taught me more about acting than almost anything else Ive ever done. Constructing a Character gave me the opportunity to dive into plays, texts and characters to gain a specificity in acting technique second to none. The diversity of scenes and monologues assigned gave me the opportunity to learn from others creative processes as well - Chekhov to Kushner! I feel I can say I am a better actor having taken this class and would recommend anyone interested in anything related to acting (not necessarily theater or film) to take this class. The holistic understanding of the human condition one gains from this class is unbelievable and I thank Professor Wallace for his valuable insight throughout this class. Be it in the first or last class, new ideas always came to light through the fact that regular performance was integral to this class; and thats what it offers, a structure and framework for understanding how one acts - finding the true essence of a character and their personhood. Acting is a much more cerebral endeavor than people give credit for and this class proves it without drowning the artistic aspects of acting. Moreover, one has to take initiative in arranging times to rehearse scenes outside of the classroom with other students.",
                "This course ABSOLUTELY improved my acting and performing skills. It taught me a new and effective way to approach character work. I feel like a much more adept actor now.",
                "An interesting approach to acting, heavily dependent on experiential memory to 'get within' the circumstances of a character.",
                "This course was really helpful in reframing the way I think about acting from generating emotions and experiences to play myself to focusing on the other person in the scene."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths include: engaging environment and culture of collaboration, diverse range of texts, Professor Wallace has an innate ability to communicate ideas in a nuanced yet understandable manner, appreciating the need for breaks during the class (taking 5 or 15), everyone there was on the same journey and learning together, I felt like I made friends through the class, you learn the importance of preparation without the workload being overwhelming\r\n\r\nWeaknesses include: sometimes classes felt a bit rushed due to 8 people being in it (though I recognize this is small, at times it felt like I couldnt go into the depth I wouldve liked), it is at 8:25am and it genuinely just takes a while to wake up, it only meets once a week which means that if you are ill one day it feels like youve missed a lot of class, the ballroom is very cold",
                "This course thrives in its specificity and slow pace. We did not move on from something until we had it figured out. I cannot think of a weakness for the course, so I will not try to manufacture one!",
                "Gregory's insight is truly invaluable. I felt like I learned so much every time he gave notes on a scene or explained concepts to us. At times, I felt like the course moved too slowly, or I wished that we got to apply the concepts to more scenes and monologues."

            "comments": [
                "I would undoubtedly recommend this to other students who is open to learning about acting in a very interactive way. You will always have to be on the ball and work consistently, but not egregiously so. Note that a chunk of lines do have to be learned for the final, so be prepared. Above all, it is a very applied class - more of a lab - in which you dont study theoretical concepts of acting but more turn to using techniques to construct a character.",
                "Yes! I had a wonderful time in this class. It was fun, enriching, and educational.  I am incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to take the course at all. I would recommend it to anyone interested in honing their performing skills, or who is interested in the process of learning to act and analyze characters!",
                "Yes.",
                "If you want to have four hours a week dedicated to working as an actor in a low-stakes, lab-style environment, this is a great course. Since Yale theater often revolves around productions, it was really beneficial for me to go to the basics and think about and evaluate what exactly you're doing as an actor in each moment."
