    "This class covers important authors in the intellectual genealogy on distributive justice. Prof. Roemer's approach is very unique and interesting: he uses the tools of economics to constrain\/test the theories that we discuss in class.",
    "I became familiar with historical debates about egalitarianism and distributive justice. I learned how to model economic arguments in distributive justice. I practiced forming philosophical arguments about these topics.",
    "We covered works by Mills, Nozick, Rawls, Cohen, and Roemer."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Great reading list on distributional justice, interesting takes from Roemer. \r\nWeaknesses: Class discussions seem to be a bit tilted given the structure (e.g. most of the time in class is spent lecturing -- could be good depending on your style!)",
    "I think this course could benefit if there was more emphasis on teaching the theory (especially the mathematical theory) rather than just reading out material from the lecture notes.\r\nA definite strength of this course (in terms of logistics) was that all study materials were posted in time on Canvas, as well as the lecture notes, which made regular reading and studying easier.",
    "Strengths: excellent readings; the readings truly demonstrated how several authors, including Professor Roemer, were in conversation about topics of egalitarianism and distributive justice. The problem sets adequately tested familiarity with the economic models. Lecture notes were clear and informative.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked seminar to have more discussion. The class notes were distributed before each seminar, but perhaps class notes can be assigned as required reading, leaving time in the seminar for questions and discussion. Clearer feedback on papers would have been helpful.",
    "I think if possible it could have more discussion or student presentations."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I think the course really pushes the boundaries of \"traditional\" neoclassical economics and forces one to think critically about key economic principles and, of course, distributional justice. The reading list is wonderful and Prof Roemer's perspectives are usually insightful. Heads up: all classes are essentially two hour lectures from Roemer -- sometimes great, but can very much limit discussion and true engagement with the material. Overall: great course!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The material is super interesting and helped me clarify my thoughts on distributive justice, capitalism, etc. The idea of approaching the material from a philosophical and a mathematical perspective is great. I think that anyone who is interested in leftist thought (either as a supporter or an opponent) should take this course, as it covers super important material that conveys very well leftist intuitions.",
    "Should be mandatory",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in distributive justice, egalitarianism, and Marxist economics. The course successfully bridges ethics, politics, and economics. The seminars might be underwhelming to students who expect more discussion, since they are more like lectures, but students were always welcome to speak up and ask questions. The problem sets applied the material , but did not demand great mathematical rigor.",
    "This seminar is run as a lecture, which can be very very dry at times and honestly hard to stay awake for at times. I think if I was more engaged, I would have loved the lecture itself, but without being engage enough - it was bit difficult. The material itself (outside the class) is incredibly interesting. I think that it can be intimidating at times. Leave time for writing essays because philosophy papers are hard."
