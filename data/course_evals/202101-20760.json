                "Strengths: The pace of the class was good, and there was always a lot of reinforcement for everything we learned (breakout rooms, assignments, practice in class). I also liked how assignments were graded for completion, not accuracy; it allowed us to make mistakes on new grammar concepts and get helpful feedback. Though a little strict at times, Choi SSN is a very kind and understanding teacher. Overall, the class is reasonable, not too difficult, and you do learn a good amount of Korean. Weaknesses: The class was not very organized, as a lot of time the course schedule was unclear, or assignment instructions were unclear, or I didn't know what vocabulary we were expected to know for a test\/quiz. There would be a vocab document for each lesson, but it didn't seem like it was comprehensive. Also, the test format could definitely be improved in this virtual setting: screensharing the test and scrolling through questions was often frustrating, as we couldn't control the pace of the test and it was very inefficient overall. It would've been much better if she released the test as a pdf, so we do the test at an individual pace.",
                "One strength of this course was the size. The student to faculty ratio was very small and enabled great personal relationships to grow.",
                "The homeworks where we had to write sentences were really helpful for solidifying new grammar and vocabulary, and the only criticism I really have is that, toward the end of the course when we were writing our final presentations, we didn't have these homeworks and my rhythm of learning was a little messed up (I feel like this left me less prepared for the content of the unit 7-8 test).",
                "Strengths~ Lots of time spent on practicing. Weakness~ A lot of homework, so it became a little overwhelming at some points."
