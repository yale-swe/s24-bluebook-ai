                "The course definitely helped improve my close-reading skills. Lectures and section focused heavily on dissecting the precise language of the readings. It really prompted critical thinking of different political stances and ways of thinking.",
                "This course taught me about the history of centrism, how centrism is an obstacle for social movements, and the ways that centrism shows up in works of literature. You also learn about how to apply close reading to poetry and prose. Additionally, this class teaches how concepts from political theory (such as nationalism, radicalism, centrism, conservatism) show up in literature.",
                "I learned to deeply evaluate my own political beliefs and attune myself more closely to certain political undertones in works of literature and art through close reading.  There's so much underlying centrist liberalism--and so many forms that it can take on--that I hadn't known before taking this class.",
                "The course enhanced my understanding of the origins and influences of centrist liberalism as well as the role centrism and other compatible and conflicting forces have played in shaping the past 2.5 centuries of world history and literature.",
                "I learned the roots of contemporary political ideologies and how different authors/artists throughout history have contributed to these developments.",
                "The course clarified the exact differences between conservatism, liberalism and socialism and explored the meanings of terms like totalitarianism, populism and extremism",
                "I learned a lot more about close reading in this class and gained a deeper understanding of certain political terms such as \"centrism,\" and was reminded of the importance of connotation when we discussed the \"mob.\"",
                "Learned about how centrism is naturalized and how literature can serve/reject different ideologies",
                "I feel as though my ability to analyze a text and then develop and write my own opinion based on said text has improved a lot due to the course.",

                "How to understand political theories and ideologies, as well as how to understand their relationships to each other.",

            "comments": [
                "One of the strengths of the class is that it provides insight into how centrism inhibits social movements and shows up in our daily lives. The class also does a good job of showing how centrism shows up in works of literature. The lectures are always engaging and the workload is manageable. Although the course includes works by Martin Luther King Jr., Audre Lorde, Kim Scott, Pablo Neruda, etc, I wish that it included more political philosophy outside of the white Western cannon, especially in unit 1. For the first half of the term we spent a lot of time reading Wallerstein and Burke so the midterm essay was heavy on the Western cannon. It would also be interesting to read some more critical theory articles in this class (perhaps articles on the books/poems we are reading) because that could add to the level of depth in the course.",
                "This course does a really great job of blending politics and literature to show how the two might be more intertwined than we might realize.  I appreciated working through both the political theory and literary analysis sides of the class--Professor North is an amazing lecturer who brings the room to life with his passion.  In an age that needs more radical action, the class illuminated the subtler dangers of centrism and the ways in which our art can often perpetuate these political attitudes by cultivating certain implicit aesthetic tastes.  One drawback is that the mandatory discussion sections were often not very engaging.",
                "The lectures were incredibly engaging, and the readings were all well-tailored to the message of the class.",
                "The professor doesnt adhere to the schedule in the syllabus very well, which makes it hard to plan ahead.",
                "This course is really engaging and I felt very good about the way lectures were presented with enough time for questions at the end. There were no slides which sometimes made things difficult to follow but I think that the \"no laptop\" rule made the class engagement much better. I think one thing that could be improved is the number of essays assigned. On the one hand, only having two essays made the course load a lot lighter, but it left few opportunities to receive feedback on writing.",
                "The readings at the end of semester are lengthy and a grind, but even if you arent able to complete them, the lectures and sections are extremely insightful. Professor North lectures a lot, but I enjoyed his commentary and perspectives.",
                "I feel as though a good strength the course has is its engagement with the students during lectures. Giving students the opportunity to voice their own opinions fad theyre developing on a new topic is very interesting and insightful. A weakness for the course is the structure of the workshops. They got boring quickly and didnt feel like they introduced anything new.",
                "I think the lectures could be more of a group discussion.",
                "I really liked how Professor North set up the structure of the class. The lectures were a continuous train of thought, as he put it, supplemented by the weekly readings, which made his overall message very clear. I also liked the readings we did, both on the literature side and the social justice side.",
                "Name was a bit of a catfish, didnt read a single marginalized author until about halfway through, maybe call it Literature and Centrism or Literature and Political Theory?",
                "I think the choice of readings could be fixed, as well as the quick turnaround between novels. I really liked the lectures and the discussion section though, and think those were very well thought out.",
                "This course was interesting and well-paced. One weakness could be slight disorganization between sections as different sections had different expectations.",
                "The strengths were the lectures and classroom discussions."

            "comments": [
                "Yes. Lectures are always insightful and revealed interesting points through the lens of centrism. I also really like that the course was structured based on ideology and not time periods or subjects of social justice. For instance, we'd examine extremism, totalitarianism, etc. This structure was helpful for making connections across time periods and seeing how the terms and ideas have evolved.",
                "I would recommend this class to other students because it teaches students a lot about the role of centrism in society, which is very applicable to life today and a challenge faced by many social movements.",
                "Yes!  If you want a closer look at how literature interacts with politics--or even just understand some of the current ills facing our current politics--take this class.  It changes the way you view your own politics and art.",
                "Yes. I think the course is incredibly interesting and Professor North's lectures are very engaging. I would recommend watching the course video before enrolling as I think the title of the course may not necessarily be the most appropriate descriptor of the course's contents (it may be more appropriate to call the class Centrism, Literature, and Social Justice, as the focus of the course (at least this semester) was certainly centrism, and our engagements with literature and social justice primarily come through analysis of how centrism and similar forces interact with them), but if you're interested in political theory or the history of political ideologies and movements, I'd wager you'd find the material interesting as well. Additionally, not only are Joe's lectures entertaining, but he also is clearly very passionate about the material he's discussing, which is pretty touching and I think makes it even easier to feel engaged. I personally found it really endearing to see Joe legitimately tear up while reading a poem about police brutality and talking about the destruction of 50,000 years of aboriginal culture. I think it's nice to see a teacher demonstrate their humanity and it also puts in perspective the real human cost of our academic subject matter, which I think is really important in academia. Beyond those merits, it's also a very relaxed and low-workload writing credit, so I think there really are a lot of reasons to take it.",
                "Absolutely! Although there are many readings, they are very relevant and powerful pieces. It's interesting to see how fiction and non-fiction pieces have contributed to ideas of liberalism and radicalism, and this course does an amazing job teaching you how to parse between those definitions.",
                "I would. I think the material we went over and the questions we grappled with were very interesting, especially if youre interested in political theory and social justice. The workload isnt very high either so it can be a pretty easy  writing credit.",
                "I would recommend this course if you're ready to do some deep reading and spend a lot of time revising essays to make sure they're perfect; there are a lot of nuances with the class material that you're expected to understand and display in your papers.",
                "Yes, for sure, especially if looking for a WR credit thats not overwhelming but still insightful and interesting. Theres not too much work outside of the readings, especially for a writing credit. Its just 4 short worksheets that take relatively little time to complete and 2 manageable essays. There are many choices for prompts, so its not too bad. The content is great too.",
                "I would because the professor makes the class pretty exciting and the material itself is interesting as well",
                "Yes. This course is incredibly accessible while still introducing complex political ideas.",
                "It was pretty good, Id recommend",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to everyone. It was a fantastic look at centrism, literature, and politics; if you want to read interesting works and also feel more politically literate, you should take this course.",
                "Yes because I learned a lot and the professor is amazing.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the basics of social movements and literature. This course gave a good overview of many important texts but did not go as deep into each one in order to cover a wider range of literature.",
                "Definitely. It's a really great writing credit. It's very interesting and the workload isn't overwhelming."
