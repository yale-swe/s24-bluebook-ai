                "I especially learned about the mechanisms and applications of many organic reactions and can propose some possible retros. I also learned a lot about the stability and reactivity of organic molecules, from chairs to carbocations. I have especially learned about molecular orbital theory and its role in explaining reactions.",
                "This course is incredibly fast-paced and requires a lot of work and effort to be put into it. The instructor says that you should be spending 2-3 hours a night on this class, but most of the students I've talked to simply do not have the time to do that. Without putting in this effort and actually reading the textbook chapters, however, this class is impossibly hard. I learned a lot during this semester, with topics including a general chemistry review, acidity/basicity, stereochemistry, retrosynthesis, and reaction mechanisms. As a pre-med and non-chemistry major, however, I question how useful this class actually is for my future. A lot of the information that the instructor went over definitely was not retained by my mind, and it was difficult to always understand both the steps to solving a problem and the theory behind it. Taking organic chemistry with no previous experience in my first semester is a decision I regret; however, it definitely taught me a lot about time management, stress, and study strategies. I definitely know how to approach other difficult STEM classes in the future much better, but taking this class was certainly a trade-off: many hours of my time for very little reward.",

                "I learned about molecular orbital theory, resonance, and reactions one would typically learn in an Organic I course. More importantly, this class emphasizes learning over memorization by focusing on MO Theory. Near the end of the semester, it was hard to not memorize the many reactions necessary for the midterm and final, but the class taught me how to focus on learning rather than memorizing.",
                "I learned a lot of orgo. More than 220",
                "Obviously, I learned tons of organic chemistry. But in addition to all the reaction mechanisms and theories and concepts that I learned, I'd say the most valuable skill I acquired is WHY things happen in chemistry the way that they do. Honestly, truly understanding chemistry makes your life so much easier. Instead of having to memorize everything, you will be able to rationalize what you're doing. This skill is applicable to so many different aspects of chemistry. When presented with a reagent you've never seen before, you'll be able to make an educated guess as to what it will do to your starting material. Learning to do retrosynthesis problems is another thing that helps you develop your problem soling skills. Once you get the hang of it they're really fun.",

                "In this course, I learned many fundamental organic chemistry concepts including molecular orbital theory, frontier molecular orbital theory, stereochemistry, regiochemistry, arrow-pushing mechanisms, conformations, configurations, and retrosynthesis. I learned how to use underlying principles like molecular orbital theory to tackle a large number of mechanisms and how to effectively rely on this chemical intuition, rather than memorization. I also learned how to think creatively to put together synthesis pathways and approach product prediction.",

I learned about a plethora of real-life applications of organic chemistry, which made me even more excited about what I was learning in the classroom.",
                "Well, a lot of complex chemistry - but importantly how to spot patterns in chemistry (e.g. MO theory) and using them to direct how you learn the new material. Because the lectures were really fast and confusing at times (and also the fact that through my own fault I did not read the textbook prior to lecture most of the time), one thing that was really important for me was taking the lecture content, going to section and basing my learning of what we needed to know / would help to learn FIRST. For example, for the third midterm I learn the basic backbone reaction pathways first, and then built mechanisms etc. from there, whereas if I just went of lecture notes I would not have been able to learn everything in time - so time management as well!",

                "Strengths are getting to work closely with other students in the class, it is easy to make friends and feel close to others. The TA's are amazing and the Achieve program is very helpful for the class. A weakness is that the flipped structure with highly challenging problems during lectures favors students that have previous knowledge of organic chemistry. It can be demotivating in class to never know what is going on. The readings for each class are also sometimes very long and require much more time than given to fully understand. A mix of some lecture during the class itself or a review of the reading instead of pure problems and applications would be extremely helpful.",
                "This course is taught in a \"flipped classroom model\", which I personally found to be incredibly difficult to follow. We basically read the textbook (if we had time) and taught ourselves the material, and then the instructor went over incredibly challenging problems very quickly, without much explanation. I personally would have preferred a lecture style, especially since this was my first ever difficult STEM class at Yale. It definitely showed me an alternate teaching style, but I'm not sure this is the best method of introducing a science subject to first years. I would have preferred more guidance and lecture-type teaching. Discussion section, however, was incredibly useful and one of the most helpful parts of the course. My discussion section, which started at 8pm and was meant to take until 8:50pm, often took until 10pm or 10:30pm. The TAs were very willing to help us and stay for hours to make sure we understood the material. The course could be improved by switching to a lecture style and also adding in additional review sessions before each midterm. The reviews were always amazing, but it would be better to have at least 2 of them, and more spaced out before the midterm (rather than the night before).",
                "There's a lot of collaboration, which is good. If you don't fully understand all the material before coming to class it's really easy to get lost.",
                "Other than organic chemistry just being hard, there really aren't any weaknesses about this course. But this class was the perfect environment for first-years learning such a difficult subject. The organization of students into tables to facilitate group participation pushed individual engagement higher than what you'd find in a typical lecture.",
                "I learnt a lot about orgo, and the class format was really engaging. I am still not convinced that a flipped classroom is better though, since we have to do a lot of pre-class reading to even follow the class.",
                "Discussion sections and the TAs were the only things carrying this class. I believe that the in-class model of this classroom needs to be totally remodeled.",
                "Strengths: The TA's were really great, and the exams were quite fair. \r\nWeaknesses: I think the achieve homework was sometimes incongruent to the material we actually ended up using throughout the class.",
                "The strengths of the course were that the assignments and exams were very fair and Tim was very clear about the material he was going to test us on. However, I think the organization of how he taught was lacking a bit because they usually did not align with the textbook readings and sometimes the textbook reading never came up in class. It could be improved by giving us clear readings he expects to cover in class that align well with the material, and before we start a new day he review the basic concepts of the basic things we needed for the day before we go into more complicated stuff.",
                "Strengths: Tim is such an interesting and fun professor. The TAs are also great. There were so many study halls and students were allowed to go to any discussion section(s) they wanted to go to, so it was a really free environment to choose the teachers/approaches that best cultivated learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that Tim didn't really have accessible and consistent office hours--I would appreciate more consistency in these office hours. I also felt that some of the classes went too fast, and Tim didn't slow down to answer questions; I think that maybe slowing down the curriculum a little bit could help significantly.",
                "Very engaging and lots of resources for help. You will struggle with readings and learning all the new material. TA's, study sessions, and fellow students are your best bet for help.",
                "I personally really enjoyed the flipped classroom model. It was definitely much more engaging than a lecture. I also enjoyed that I was able to meet more of my coursemates this way. The drawback of the flipped classroom, however, is the fact that it does require you to put in more effort than a lecture. Learning to read the textbook and understand new topics before going to class is definitely challenging at first, but once you get the hang of it the course gets much easier workload wise. The TAs of the course we're absolutely amazing. They were super helpful in clarifying whatever might have been left unclear during class, always answered your questions, and were generally really supportive with whatever problems you had, whether it be a specific retrosynthesis problem or your motivation to study chemistry. Occasionally, I felt that the class went too fast. In some classes, I just felt like I was simply trying to copy down whatever Tim was writing on the board, but did not have time to actually think about what I was writing. I had to take the time after class to really conceptualize what had happened in class.",
                "Strengths: Exceptional TAs who were patient and clear when answering my questions, less stressful (essentially completion) homework and Psets, and clear expectations for the exam material (not including the final exam).\r\nWeaknesses: Frequently, the Loudon textbook, homework problems, and lecture material were incongruous. Perhaps most importantly, I felt that the discussion sections were a bit too late to discuss lecture topics. Due to the flipped classroom design, I feel that having the discussion section on the lecture material right after the relevant lecture would be most helpful to truly understand and synthesize the material.",
                "The class is flipped classroom, so you will be doing the majority of the work on your own. This is good because you can learn at your own pace but also bad because the work can pile up and be overwhelming.",
                "Weakness -> The flipped learning environment was somewhat helpful, though at times I felt that it wasn't conducive to my learning style. Sometimes I just wanted more support and wasn't able to find that from study hall and lecture. \r\nStrength-> The class is extremely collaborative, though, and that helps in solidifying material and making sure I had a deep understanding of the material. Peer tutors/TAs were extremely helpful and always willing to talk through issues I was having.",
                "The strengths of this course was definitely the TAs. The weaknesses of this course was the flipped classroom design that was utilized by the professor. I would have much preferred for the class to have been in a regular lecture format.",
                "i learned a lot from this class, but i feel it's like only because i was expected to do readings and preclass assignments for every 3 classes of the week, on top of 3 lectures and a discussion section, and if you want to count more, the lab too. but the topics are interesting and i think doing retrosynthesis is really cool and satisfying",
                "Strengths: fast-paced chemistry class that was very interesting. I was never bored\r\nWeaknesses: lecture was at times useless because of how much time was necessary to truly understand topics. I didn't prefer the flipped classroom setting.",
                "A strength of this class would be the teaching assistants/fellows and how involved they are in student learning. Their discussion sections, review sessions, and in-class help constituted a large part of my learning, and I was able to ask them questions over email if I really needed help. Another strength would be the table groups in class. I think a weakness for me would be the flipped classroom because I had trouble learning from the textbook, so I was very lost during the class sessions. Also, the textbook, the Achieve, and the class sessions sometimes didnt line up, which made it a little frustrating.",
                "Strengths: Frequent study hall and discussion sections. Ability to collaborate with table groups. You make a lot of friends through shared suffering.\r\nWeaknesses: Professor does not provide answers to practice tests which must be sought out through teaching fellows, review sessions, or study groups. It makes learning concepts quite difficult and more confusing if you do not already have a strong understanding. Lectures did not thoroughly explain the topics in the course. Much more learning is done outside of the course during study hall/discussion sections. Flipped classroom requires more work as students need to learn from the textbook and apply the concepts in class through lecture problems. Learning is very self-motivated. Lectures could include more instruction and example problems done by the professor to clarify the textbook material. Otherwise, it just feels discouraging",
                "strengths: amazing teaching fellows, lots of support (study halls and discussion section)\r\nweaknesses: moved too quickly, hard to catch up if fell behind",
                "Strengths of this course are that it facilitates collaboration and offers a great way for first-years to meet. The flipped classroom format, however, may not work for everyone, especially for those who prefer lecture-based learning or who do not have prior experience with organic chemistry.",
                "Strengths: The support system  instructors and TAs were very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: More of the exam content should have been covered in lectures.",
                "One strength would be the emphasis on problem-solving and understanding rather than memorization. One weakness would be the class was very fast at times and the achieve problem sets often tested us on things that were not necessarily relevant to the class.",
                "The class was very engaging, and I think the additional study halls and discussion section meetings were particularly helpful in solidifying existing knowledge as well as clearing up points of confusion. I felt that the class environment was fairly conducive to working with classmates and peer tutors to get a stronger grasp of the material as well as develop problem-solving skills. \r\n\r\nAlthough the class was smaller than a traditional lecture course, I still felt a bit self-conscious about speaking up in class (but this also has to do with self-improvement). The course speed and volume of readings were also a bit difficult to manage, although the syllabus did explicitly note the classs heavy workload. I also found that, personally, the online homework assignments were not as good of a gauge of understanding concepts (or would sometimes be irrelevant to what we would cover in class). Perhaps this is based on a personal preference, but I think that other assignments or practice problems would have been useful, much like the worksheets that we received in some of the discussion section meetings.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The flipped classroom format keeps you significantly engaged the whole semester\r\n- The problems provided in class and the practice exams help you develop and practice new skills very easily\r\n- The support the TAs provided during the whole semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The amount of reading needed for each day could vary and it was sometimes hard to predict how much time we would have to allocate to the class.\r\n- Office hours with the professor were limited.",
                "The flipped classroom model was quite effective at encouraging regular practice and study outside of class. However, I would have appreciated having solutions to practice exams online or available: I was often unable to attend exam review sessions due to conflicting time commitments, and it was a bit inconvenient not being able to see corrections to practice problems.",
                "The TAs for this class were splendid and put in a very high amount of effort in making sure the class ran smoothly. The flipped format was a bit tricky with such a big class but overall also was a good point if you put in the work.",
                "I disliked the flipped classroom aspect because there was a disconnect between the readings and class activities. I think even taking 10 minutes of class to lecture a bit would be more helpful.",
                "The strengths of this class were that the TAs and discussion/review sessions were very helpful in understanding the material. The weakness was that I would have preferred more of a lecture type class instead of a flipped classroom structure.",
                "The teaching aid staff was incredible and taught most everything I learned in the class. The professor, however, didnt really teach during lecture, and I felt that lecture wasnt actually conducive to learning. In fact, a lot of people in class (not myself) would skip class to just study on their own because they felt the solo study was more useful.",
                "Strengths: the course was very tied to the textbook. There were lots of problems to solve. Also, it was helpful having assigned group mates with whom to discuss in-class problems.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course had a very large workload (a preclass problem set before every class and a weekly problem set), especially considering that we meet three times a week (four if you count discussion sections). Also, the pace of the class was very fast, and without the book, it is only too easy to fall behind. Part of this is because organic chemistry is a very different subject, but the flipped classroom also takes getting used to. Also, the class size was advertised to be about 30, but in reality was about double that. Also, grades were not posted in Canvas which makes it hard to tell how you are doing.",
                "Material was interesting, intellectually challenging and taught in an engaging way. Problem sets and practice assignments are graded for completion - which is crucial, because with the flipped course design that's where the actual learning happens. I learned so much material much more solidly than I would have thought possible. The class atmosphere could be a little stressful sometimes though, and it didn't always feel like the professor was willing to support students who were struggling. The TAs were excellent though.",
                "I really liked the support system built around the course.",
                "Strengths: the TA's, the material (I found it to be interesting and relevant to the course), the number of resources (study halls, TA's, textbooks, etc.), having the class be only freshmen. \r\nWeaknesses: a third of the class has taken the course before and will make you feel dumb in the beginning. I also believe he was teaching to the people who already had the course before, meaning that he would spend less time explaining things like MO theory, thinking we already understand what he is saying since the kids who already have taken the course would be able to answer his questions in class).",
                "The pace was a bit fast. A lot of the time you end up having to teach yourself.",
                "The strengths of the course were that it was covering pretty interesting topics of organic chemistry and was pretty well-structured with a very good timeline. New topics built upon old topics such as using alkene addition mechanisms to deduce other addition mechanisms. \r\nThe weaknesses of the course was that it was a flipped course. The material in the textbook was often not congruent with material reviewed in class and shown on exams. In particular, MO theory was barely covered in the textbook compared to its coverage in the course.",
                "Maybe too intensive",
                "I love the flipped classroom format for a first-year course. I got to make lots of friends in the small Chem tables while discussing problems, and I was able to challenge myself. I absolutely loved this class as a result of the social aspect.\r\n\r\nI think that sometimes, the lectures went by a little fast. It was hard to understand what was happening and write it down at the same time, so I took notes toward the beginning of the class and later switched to not taking notes. Both had their advantages. Our understanding might be increased if the lectures were a little slower, but overall Id say that this is a fairly minor weakness.",
                "Strengths: Achieve is only graded on completion and makes the pre-class assignments less stressful, and Tim stresses MO theory, which allows you to not memorize everything but instead understand why it is.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Due to the flipped classroom design, you basically have to teach yourself everything or hope that you have a good TA. This leads to this class being a ton of work. Lectures mainly go over practice problems, but sometimes the problems felt unnecessary to what we had learned in the reading and weren't explained well. Also, I dislike the grading system since you can only drop either the first or second midterm, but not the third, which I felt had the most difficult content. This means that you are severely disadvantaged if you do poorly on the third midterm, even if you have done well on the other two. Meanwhile, others who bombed the second or first midterm are completely fine. In addition, the final is only worth 10% of your grade whereas midterms are worth either 20% or 30% depending on whether or not you drop one. It feels like the final is worth nothing in comparison.",
                "strengths: emphasized reasoning and de-emphasized memorization, fun and created sense of community among first year students\r\n\r\nweaknesses: required a learning curve to acclimate to flipped classroom model, required a lot of self learning and teaching",
                "The primary weakness of this course was the flipped classroom model. I highly benefit from lectures so having a flipped classroom model made me feel as though I was underprepared before every exam. The primary strength of this class were the TFs, since they severely made up for my lack of understanding during class.",
                "The professor makes the tests unnecessarily hard, especially considering the lack of direct instruction the students receive. The flipped classroom model worked well in the beginning, but when moving on to advanced topics, class time became increasingly less organized. Less time on obscure examples, more time on general theory would have been highly beneficial.",
                "A primary strength of this course was its focus on the overarching foundations of organic chemistry, specifically molecular orbital theory, rather than memorization. This meant that we were able to develop a chemical intuition and approach a greater breadth of problem types. Another strength was the frequent applications made between the course content and the real world, as it helped ground the coursework in something tangible. The TAs and peer mentors were definitely a strength of this course, as they were the most helpful points of contact for questions and review.",
                "The flipped classroom structure ultimately harmed my personal learning because I did not have enough time to dedicate to preclass textbook reading, so I lacked foundational knowledge and was constantly confused in class. However, a strength of the class was the gracious support of the TAs, especially in discussion sections and review sessions. Another strength would be the professor's emphasis on a specific theory (Molecular Orbital Theory), which changed course content from being memorization-heavy (as is the case with many other organic chemistry classes) to a bit more focused on conceptual understanding.",
                "One of the biggest strengths were the discussion sections. The discussion sections really help you understand the material and provide you with great examples. All of the TFs this year were extremely helpful. I like the way the homework and problem sets are through achieve and graded for completion because it allows you to learn from your mistakes. Out of all of my classes, this one had the most collaborative environment. The classroom is set up with tables of people that you sit with for the entire unit. The study halls also help foster this collaborative environment. The practice tests were immensely helpful and probably the most valuable resource for studying for the exams. I think the exams for this class are fair and reflect what we have been taught. While the practice tests are definitely helpful, the answers to the practice tests are never posted and you have to get the answers the night before the exam at the review session. This makes studying the correct information difficult because you are given such a short amount of time to look over it. I also think the practice exams should be posted sooner. I do not think the textbook for this class was very helpful. The textbook just had so much information that we were not held responsible for knowing. This made reading the textbook often feel like a waste of time. I think I learned the most just by repeatedly doing the practice problems the TFs provided. I think an improvement to this course would be if the instructor provided practice problems for everyone. The textbook being unhelpful is definitely an issue in this class since the format is flipped classroom. I think flipped classroom would be much more effective if we had a better means of learning the material on our own. If flipped classroom continues to be used, I think it would be beneficial if the instructor posted explanatory videos or supplemental materials that taught the concepts in depth.",
                "I think the variety of options available to get extra practice/help (study halls, discussion sections, and office hours) are really valuable, and it's also nice to have a cohort of freshmen who tend to be taking similar classes to form study groups. I think it could be improved with having some open-ended homework similar to test questions that's handed in to TAs for feedback, because the Achieve homework, while definitely useful, did not provide cover the scope of all the types of questions we were expected to understand.",
                "The flipped classroom design is a big weakness. I feel like no one really liked it and would just prefer to have a lecture.",
                "Tim is a brilliant instructor  he is incredibly knowledgable and made me really excited about everything we were learning. The flipped-course design took some time for me to get used to, but I don't think I would've learned nearly as much as I did if the course were taught as a lecture. The textbook reading and pre-class homework ensured that I came to class with a baseline understanding of the reactions we were going to be discussing, which meant that in class, I was able to focus on understanding why the reactions occur and how they can be applied to the real world. The material is definitely challenging, but there are so many opportunities to get support  the TA's were amazing and always willing to answer questions or further explain concepts, and you spend so much time learning and discussing the concepts with your classmates in class, in discussion section, and in study hall.",
                "Strengths: Sections are the main strength, and attending them really helped me to understand what I 'needed' to know from the lecture content and practice chemistry concepts. Furthermore, review sessions were especially helpful in terms of preparing for the exams as the week before the exams I would not know most of the content. Lastly, getting to know other people in the class due to the format of the TEAL lab was really nice\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture content - not the chemistry itself, but more so the structure and pacing - I felt really lost at times and I know the rest of my table felt the same way. It was really difficult to know all the content prior to the lecture so I was learning content in class simultaneously with applications and really fast synthesis questions which lowered my engagement in class.",
                "Strengths: There's a lot of places to go to get extra help (discussion section, study hall, office hours).\r\n\r\nWeakness: The flipped classroom design relies on the assumption that everyone not only reads but fully understands the assigned textbook sections. The harder concepts in the latter part of the semester are difficult to get a good grasp on just by reading.",
                "The content was kind of hard and I wished the homework was better tuned for our class.",
                "It is strong in that it covers a great deal of detail through the book. If you fall behind in the book, however, it becomes difficult to understand and contextualize but I dont think this is something the teaching team can or should fix.",
                "The strength of the course was the focus on underlying principles and ideas rather than rote memorization. The course could be improved with better organization and structure, especially pertaining to reactions.",
                "The strengths of this course are definitely the instructors and TAs; the discussion sections were so helpful in cementing understandings of the new concepts. I found the flipped model tough, however, in establishing equity within the classroom, as I felt like it was easier for students who had already taken organic chemistry in high school to adjust to the faster pace of learning. Perhaps, a regular lecture model within the classroom would better allow for other students to catch up as well."

                "Yes but it's a lot of work",
                "If the student has some previous knowledge or background in organic chemistry then absolutely. For someone without much background, it depends on the experience the student wants in the class. Chem 174 is very much not knowing what is going on in class at all, learning on your own, going to TA's but having tests that make you more confident. From what I have heard from the normal organic chem class it is more lecture-based, learning in class, and feeling awful on a test before the curve.",
                "I would recommend this course only to students considering a chemistry major. Honestly, I'm not sure why this class is required for the pre-med track, and  I only took it because I had to. Only take the course if you do not have a lot of other difficult courses, and if you are prepared to put in the time required to actually understand the material. Otherwise, this class is very difficult and memorization won't really get you through it.",
                "First-year orgo is tough. You have to be pretty self-motivated to keep up and not just scrape by. The TFs will save you.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Newhouse is wonderful and it's a great opportunity to learn organic chemistry with fellow first-years.",
                "Well, unless you are pre-med / want to explore Chem as a major / have this as your pre-requisiste, you might not want to take this class. it's not a gut.",
                "Yes if the student is sufficiently interested in the material, and is willing to devote a significant portion of their time to the course.",
                "For those who want to be a bio/chem major, I would advise them to take first your orgo. It was a great experience that bonds freshman together and although it is difficult, the material is intriguing and not far out of anyone's intellectual capabilities. You just need to dedicate time to studying the proper material and you should do fine in the class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. From what I've heard about CHEM 220 (the non-first year version of Orgo), this class is significantly better. The exams are easier, Tim is extremely transparent about grading and exam content, and the TAs are great. It's also nice to develop a community of fellow first-years struggling through organic chemistry. The workload is manageable, the learning is difficult at times, but the effort is well worth the result.",
                "Yes, if you are choosing between 220 or even gen chem you should definitely choose 174. As a freshman, the community feeling in this class is great. It will be definitely harder than gen chem but the challenge is good.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is genuinely interested in chemistry. If you're interested in why things happen instead of just acknowledging or memorizing concepts, then this class is great for you. This is a great class if you want to combine improving your problem-solving skills with learning about science.",
                "Yes. I think this is a really good introductory course for organic chemistry. You learn a lot in the class, but keep in mind that the workload is high. You will likely spend every day of your week doing some work or studying for this course.",
                "Yes! Though it is a lot of work, I think in the end it feels very rewarding as you come out of the course with a deeper appreciation for and understanding of chemistry. You also grow a lot in your personal study skills.I think this is the best orgo first-semester of freshman year can be.",
                "I would recommend the CHEM 220 course over this one for those who are just beginning in Organic Chemistry.",
                "yes, it covers cool chemistry concepts and is fun to learn",
                "Yes, but only if you have to take it.",
                "If youre choosing between 163, 174, and 220, absolutely take 174 or 220, and between those two, take 174. I would recommend this course to a first-year because I met a lot of my friends in this class. Because of the table groups (and lab groups) and the difficulty of the class, you find yourself meeting and talking to a lot of people. The class was definitely collaborative and it was never a class I absolutely dreaded coming to. However, it is a lot of work, the content is challenging, and the flipped classroom style had mixed reviews. But really, you meet a lot of people, so I would say its worth it.",
                "I would recommend the course if the student is deciding between general chemistry and organic chemistry. While difficult, it is a manageable challenge with the right support system. Saves a lot of time in the chem sequence, but definitely prepare for a substantial workload.",
                "yes, but only if you are pre-med or need this for your major... it was definitely a lot of work and by far my hardest class this semester",
                "I would recommend taking this course over general chemistry with lab. In terms of deciding between first-year orgo and sophomore orgo, I would consider the type of learner you are and the teaching style you prefer. If you would rather learn the content more traditionally (in class and through lectures), I might go with CHEM 220. At the same time, a class with only first-years is a unique environmentstruggling through orgo tends to bring people togetherand may make the course worthwhile.",
                "Yes, if they enjoyed Chemistry and wanted to study it in depth.",
                "Yes if you are interested in chemistry or are a pre-med, take this course. Overall, great experience and you learn",
                "I would recommend this course to another student but with the caveat that it is quite difficult and time-consuming. I think that it was an experience worth having upon entrance into college and adapting to a new environment. The presentation of the material was also quite interesting and at times very relevant to everyday life. Although I struggled, I found the class to be very enjoyable and rewarding.",
                "If you are interested in chemistry, I would highly recommend this class. Tim is an excellent professor, and the flipped classroom format helps you engage with the material better. There is an emphasis on problem-solving and understanding the theories behind the reactions rather than memorizing them. Throughout the semester, we also rotated between tables which allows you to meet more people.",
                "Yes, it was quite eye-opening as a stem student to take a class where creative problem-solving was encouraged. The flipped model took a few weeks to get used to but was eventually more rewarding.",
                "This is a great way to get in a term of organic chemistry if you can take it.",
                "Only if needed for a prerequisite. But I would advise to first years over waiting for second year.",
                "I would recommend this class only to students who are interested in organic chemistry and is willing to put in the for to understand the material. This is a difficult class and it is often time-consuming and requires deep understanding and plenty of practice of the material.",
                "I would not. I would recommend someone to take Sophomore OrgO because, from the people in it, it sounds like a course better gauged for learning.",
                "I only recommend this course if you absolutely need organic chemistry for whatever major you are doing. This course has a huge workload and will probably be the most challenging course of the semester, not just because of the workload but also because of the teaching style and the inherent difficulty of the subject. Prepare to spend a lot of time going through the textbook.",
                "Yes!! Take this class if you are interested in chemistry, even if you are worried about the challenging level of the contentProfessor Newhouse emphasizes the learning process and you are able to make mistakes and still recover from them. I gained so much insight into chemical processes and realized that chemistry can be a lot of fun! Although sometimes I wished that this course was a lecture rather than flipped classroom style, the flipped classroom style and small-table seating allowed me to meet so many people, and even some of my closest friends!",
                "It's a great way to learn ochem, you need to put in a ton of work though and don't expect to rely on Tim if you're having trouble.",
                "Defintely!",
                "Yes, if the student is interested/has to take organic chemistry. The course is a lot of work and will take up most of your time. Also, a third of the class has taken the course before so you may feel dumb at times, and it is annoying that they may understand the material better while putting forth less effort. However, this was a great way to meet new freshmen and the class is structured so that it feels that everyone wants you to do well, both of these things I have heard are not the same with CHEM 220.",
                "No, unless they needed it for a requirement. Its not extremely enjoyable unless you like a lot of independent learning and are very talented in chemistry and love it with all your heart. Its often confusing and youre left to fend for yourself which is tough in a first year course. Class isnt enjoyable and learning from the textbook isnt either.",
                "Absolutely. As a first-year, the course helps to meet new people and learn to discuss intellectual challenges with them.",
                "I would recommend starting organic chemistry in your first year since it knocks off a year of the chemistry sequence, especially if you're pre-med. However, I would maybe take regular sophomore orgo over first-year orgo since I have heard that it is much less work due to it being a regular lecture class compared to the flipped classroom design of first-year orgo. I also felt that since a lot of the people who place into first-year orgo are already really strong in the sciences and know it, first-year orgo felt like a toxic pre-med class at times.",
                "yes, this was one of the most challenging but most rewarding courses i took in my first semester, and i am very thankful for the friends and opportunities it afforded me.",
                "Yes, this course is fundamental for someone interested in chemistry who wants an in depth exploration of harder topics.",
                "I would not. The flipped classroom model did not work well and I felt like I had to teach myself the entire course.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students but would first tell them that this course is not something to be taken lightly. With the Flipped Classroom structure, students have to have to a lot of self-discipline and motivation to persevere. They must take initiative to form study groups, attend study sessions, etc. As long as the student is motivated, I would recommend this course because I think it truly pays off in the end both in terms of knowledge and course advancement. You also establish a good group of peers that you will likely work with again in future science classes.",
                "Yes, because organic chemistry is a challenging course that is interesting and relevant to any student of the biological or chemical sciences, and this course in particular goes very in-depth with conceptual understanding rather than the standard memorization in other typical organic chemistry classes.",
                "If a student places into this course I would recommend that they take it. Some students in the class will have already taken organic chemistry before, and it sometimes feels like you are always one step behind them and cant catch up. However, overall I do feel like you are able to succeed regardless of your chemistry background if you put in the work. Prepare to not only go to your assigned discussion section, but others as well. You will also need to go to study halls and all review sessions. This class requires that you put in a lot of time, but I think its worth it. This class has supportive environment and everyone feels like theyre going through it together. Tim really pushes the importance of talking about chemistry with your peers as a way to learn, and I think this results in you making many friends that have similar academic interests to you.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are a fan of the flipped classroom model. This course can work well if you are always on top of the readings before class and I think having a cohort of science-focused classmates in your year that you can study with and get to know is very valuable, but I would suggest the lecture-based (non-freshman) course if they think they might have trouble keeping up with the high level of independent work before class.",
                "To be honest, I would just recommend freshman to take the sophomore organic chemistry.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student who is interested in chemistry. It was an incredibly fun, rewarding intellectual experience; it has definitely confirmed my interest in STEM and has even made me consider majoring in Chemistry. Tim is a brilliant professor  if you have the opportunity to learn from him, definitely take it. I also met some of my closest friends through the course, as it is so collaboration-heavy.",
                "Yes, I think so, even if you are not a Chemistry major. Being able to place out of all the general chemistry courses is really useful for flexibility later on, but I do think First Year Organic Chemistry is, even with its weaknesses, a great course to take if you are interested in chemistry. Because it is exclusive to first years and the classroom format is such that you meet so many people in your class, through the course I have managed to get to know many of my peers really well which is great. The TAs were amazing this year, and coming out of the course I felt like I learnt many interesting concepts and theories even if I were to not take another chemistry course at Yale.",
                "This course has harder tests than Chem 220, but you end up getting to know a lot more people than you would in the larger lecture and you get a good understanding of what happens as well as why it happens. The flipped classroom design is definitely not for everybody, so if you already know it won't work for you then take 220.  Orgo is going to be hard and a lot of work no matter which class you're in.",
                "Yes, this class is important for Premeds",
                "Yes, I think the course is well taught and builds strong understandings of fundamental chemical principles. I have recommended it before but nobody wants to take it :(",
                "Only if they have an interest in the subject or need to take the class as a requirement, as the course , as it demands a lot of time and energy.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they already have extensive knowledge of organic chemistry. When I struggled throughout the course and asked Tim for advice and additional resources, I was told to spend more time working on the class with no insight into how to use this time. The flipped classroom model means that students are responsible for their learning and when they struggle they are left alone.",
                "Yes, it's integral to understanding what concepts of science and chemistry you want to learn and to what extent. It also prefaces the amount of work going into related majors."
