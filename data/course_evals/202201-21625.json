                "- the material was interesting and I enjoyed the problem sets\r\n- some concepts could be explained more slowly, more examples of concepts could be provided",

                "It's difficult as it's a lecture course which I feel is not an ideal way to learn math. Large class size, too, which is difficult.",
                "Strengths were that material and lecture direction were all well structured as well as well as review sessions and problem sets. Weaknesses were that the lectures were not very engaging and the office hours kept moving around.",
                "I think this course was excellent. I would not say there were any weaknesses. The professor did an excellent job making lecture interesting each and every class. Assignments were very informative but also fairly short and doable. The tests were super fair as well. If you study hard, you will perform great in this course.",
                "This course was generally well organized, but I found homework to be much easier than exams. I don't think this is a problem with the course, but perhaps indicates that more could be offered to students to help prepare for exams.",
                "Teaching quality and feedback was not clear. Much easier to learn concepts on my own rather than in actual class",
                "I appreciated the recap at the beginning of each class, it was very helpful in retaining concepts and transitioning into the next one. However, the strict unforgiving deadlines added a lot of unnecessary stress.",
                "I found the material pretty straightforward and the problem sets were helpful in reinforcing the material. I did find the MIT opencourseware lectures to explain the concepts more clearly.",
                "This class has no strength: The instruction is unclear and unrelated to either problem sets or exams, making it virtually useless to go to lectures. Most of the study has to be done by the student via online sources, and this seems to be the case across sections. The Office Hours are sparse and confusing, as TA's change location and availability frequently. Even though this class is supposed to be \"with Applications,\" there is zero amount of application of linear algebra to real world scenarios, unlike ENAS 151. This is an extremely dry course that puts an excessive emphasis on tedious computation and in fact tests it.",
                "Strengths: the problems sets are very straightforward and do not take that much time to do; Professor Landa is also a good teacher who explains concepts in linear algebra very thoroughly and clearly. Compared to MATH 225, this class is much easier from what I've heard.\r\nWeaknesses: there could be more examples of applications of linear algebra to fields like signal analysis, computer science, or anything else. For a class titled \"Linear Algebra with Applications,\" there were not that many applications mentioned in class. This is also not explicitly a con, but beware that the tests contain a True/False section which requires you to think a lot more abstractly to solve its problems, which the problem sets don't really train you to do.",
                "Sometimes the order of topics taught felt somewhat haphazard (e.g. switching topics and then going back to previous ones) and it made it a little confusing.",
                "Strengths: clear lectures, straightforward problem sets and exams \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures weren't super engaging and there wasn't much discussion of applications",
                "This class was taught fairly well; the problem sets were very helpful practice. However, I think less time in class could have been spent on reviewing what was covered in the previous lecture.",
                "I thought that the content was overall pretty interestingwell taught as well. I think that the course moved a bit quickly at times, especially for those without a solid background knowledge in matrices.",
                "This is the worst course by the worst instructor I have ever taken. I should have heeded CourseTable before choosing to take it.  Professor Landa is incredibly unaccommodating to students and does not seem to have a passion for teaching.",
                "The class covered all of the topics of linear algebra in detail. Office hours, review sessions, and practice problems were available, which were very useful in learning and studying for tests. The class could be improved by including practice problems every once in a while during lectures to keep students engaged. It could also be improved by either giving some supplemental information on how to do proofs or decreasing the number of proof questions on the problem sets, because it was hard to do those problems when the technique for writing a proof was never explained.",
                "This class was recorded and also posted helpful class materials. It followed a fairly straightforward order of topics, and was a logical progression that built off itself. Boris started with good reviews (probably too long) in every class. Worst part of the class was that it was quite unengaging.",
                "Strengths: less intense (but still sufficient, I think) linear algebra class. clear lectures and problem sets\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: all or nothing grading for True / False questions on exams is frustratinga) most were fair, but some asked conceptual questions I felt unequipped to answer despite feeling comfortable with psets & practice exams, b) I wish I didn't have to seek outside guidance to figure out the right justification when I got a T/F wrong. They just seemed like the least fair questions, often.\r\nI wish those conceptual questions were asked in short answer / application type contexts (even if I recognize how T/F might make grading easier)\r\n\r\nPlease better attempt to return all relevant problem sets before the midterms that cover the same information. I only received grades for 2/4 problem sets before midterm 1 (both which were much easier than psets 3/4), and made preventable mistakes I could have avoided with feedback on 3 & 4.",
                "Great course with phenomenal instructors who were constantly engaged with the class and its material.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- There was a helpful review of the previous lecture's material at the beginning of each lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Course organization could be improved\r\n- Division of course topics not totally clear\r\n- Insufficient accommodation for students who are unable to take exams as scheduled",
                "Lectures sometimes hard to follow\r\nStrength: course follows textbook well",
                "The most glaring weakness of this course is the lack of communication regarding testing material. As the course does not follow the textbook directly, we were (upon request from our instructor) declined a list of topics or a summary of materials that we would be tested on. Because of this, review sessions were not always comprehensive. This made preparing for finals and midterms difficult. However, I would say that problem sets were usually a fair representation of material covered in class.",
                "Too fast paced, needs to go more in depth as to how and why everything works",
                "The strengths of this course are its wide range of topics covered and its focus on applications. The amount of topics covered really helped build an all-around foundation in linear algebra. That variety allowed students to experience various concepts of that area of mathematics and it really provided a good overview to what linear algebra is about. As for the focus on applications, it made the concepts learned in class more approachable as personally, I could understand how I could use what I learned in every day problems that I might see. However, I think that the goal to cover many topics made it so that the understanding of some of those topics was more shallow. I felt that oftentimes, not enough time was spent on explaining why a certain concept worked the way that it did, and so it made applying those concepts to questions more difficult. As this course if not proofs-based, I think one thing that could be helpful would be having more in-class examples of concepts in problems to help students better see those concepts from various angles. Another aspect of the class that could be improved would be providing an overview or schedule of the topics that students learn. During the semester, I felt that it was at times difficult to see where certain concepts fit into what was already previously learned, and so I think having some sort of guide to the semester would be very helpful."

                "I chose this class over MATH 225 because it is an \"applications\" class. We did not do any examples involving linear algebra applied to real-world scenarios in this class. But, if you don't like writing mathematical proofs this class is still probably a better option.",
