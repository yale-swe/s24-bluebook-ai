                "I gained an appreciation of how to edit. I never really new what to look for specifically in my revisions, and Anne prepared me to confidently improve all of my prose going forward. I learned that I love the nonfiction genre and have an increased interest in the importance of magazines in American literary history. I discovered new authors whom I adore: Joyce Maynard, Lucy Grealy, and Cheryl Strayed, to name a few. This class also taught me procrastination and writer's block coping skills.",
                "I learned a ton about writing, and my writing has improved enormously in this class. I also learned how to edit my own work and the work of others meticulously. Plus I learned a ton about myself!",
                "Nuts and bolts of memoir and nonfiction, including locating one's voice, unifying endings and beginnings, executing transitions, and crafting compelling dialogue. Rigorous discussion of editing techniques, prose style, questions of veracity and authenticity, and the elements of humor. \r\n\r\nInsight into not only the craft of writing, but also the life of a writer. Subjects such as publishing, prize writing, pitching and editing, and approaching overlapping assignments. How to overcome procrastination as a writer.",
                "I left this class with incredible toolkit of practical skills on writing the modern English essay. Beyond just writing skills, my editorial skills were also greatly improved throughout the duration of this course. It's a well-known and well-deserved accolade that Anne is one of the best, most involved and organized professors on this campus (and in the broader academic world)."

                "Strengths: Anne! Anne truly cares about each of us as individuals and writers, and that shows through in everything she does. Her syllabus is excellent. Each text offers a lesson on craft while also exposing us to important and diverse voices from the western canon. I appreciate that Anne took care to include writers from a broad range of backgrounds. I enjoyed the author visits to class and the opportunity to hear from different writing professionals. Anne is incredibly professional and expects all of us to rise to her level. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Class can have a competitive atmosphere at times.",
                "Strengths: the class is so intimate and close-knit. This allows people to write very freely. The syllabus is spectacular, and the class is so organized. The content of the class rocks.  \r\nWeaknesses: I really like that we didn't receive grades on the essays, but I would have appreciated a little bit of written feedback. However, we got fellow student critiques and a ton of oral feedback, so I definitely felt each essay had a ton of support. I also think it would have been nice if students had been more able to post their essays on time; the class is so intense that I was surprised at the lack of punctuality.",
                "Writing about Oneself is a thrilling, beautiful, and intensely challenging course. It's strengths are twofold. The first is Anne Fadiman, whose lucid, thoughtful teaching illuminates in equal measure the mechanics and joy of writing. Professor Fadiman meets with students in one-on-one conferences to discuss each essay submitted over the course of the semester, working through the piece paragraph by paragraph to help students communicate clearly, thoughtfully, and in their own voice. \r\n\r\nThe students are the class's second strength. In my experience, everyone in the seminar was extraordinarily hardworking, committed not only to improving their own work, but also to creating a vulnerable and supportive environment. It goes without saying that your peers will be fantastic writers--I was more motivated than ever before to practice writing and tackle ambitious projects.",
                "Strengths: Well-organized, practical skills, high communal engagement, excellent instruction, detailed assignments.\r\nWeaknesses: NONE"

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to my students at Yale! I think this class is essential for anyone who is considering a profession in writing. The skills that Anne teaches are essential in personal essay, journalism, fiction, and even in academic writing. I feel very grateful to have been included in this cohort and I will remember this experience for the rest of my life.",
                "Yes 100%. Be ready to work hard.",
                "Without hesitation. Writing about Oneself is transformational--by all accounts, I am a different student now than at the beginning of this semester. It is all to do with WaO, which revealed to me the life-sustaining pleasure of writing. I'm enticed toward reorganizing my life in order to fill it with the kind of students I met in this class. \r\n\r\nWhile there are no circumstances under which one should refuse a seat in WaO, it is worth noting that it would be unwise to take the class as part of a 5 or 5.5 course load. It is an extraordinary amount of work. To be sure, the work is gratifying. Every minute spent revising a sentence makes that sentence better. It's just that, for this class, you'll write many sentences, and therefore will need many minutes. Don't take a full load!",
                "Yes! Regardless of whether or not you consider yourself a \"writer,\" you are in this course. Do yourself a favor, and take your writing seriously, because Anne absolutely will."
