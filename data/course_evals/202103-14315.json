                "This course helped me develop my critical thinking and close reading skills through the context of engaging class discussion and exciting texts. I chose this course looking to discuss themes of justice, humanity, and happiness with other students also interested in how philosophy can illuminate answers to these questions. Overall, the structure of the course helped me improve my discussion and speaking skills through communicating difficult ideas from the readings in class.",
                "This course was a great introduction to the thinking of the two philosophers (Plato and Aristotle) that we read, and the world they lived in. Wilford's occasional lectures also provided lots of introductory philosophy and history knowledge.",
                "-how to write philosophical analysis essays\r\n-how to participate in intellectual debates",
                "Youll learn about Platos Republic and Aristotles Politics in depth. Youll also learn how to write cogent philosophical papers and analyses.",
                "I learned basic foundations of philosophy.  I had no previous knowledge of Aristotle and Plato, so it was nice to get the basics of their positions on the purpose of government.  However, I don't think \"ancient political philosophy: the politics of human flourishing\" is the right name for the course.  I thought we would go more into organization of government, but that was really just a small section in Aristotle's Politics.  The course mainly focuses on what \"Justice\" is, so just be aware of that when choosing the class.",
                "I learned a lot from Professor Wilford. I was able to learn from political thinkers such as Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle, first that I thought a lot like them because in a society that values individualism so much, I greatly valued a focus on people pooling their talents and capacities for a good beyond only themselves. I always enjoyed Professor Wilford's office hours because as excellent as conversation with my peers was within our class, talking to someone of her caliber about the text offered me much greater insight. I was most greatly honored when she invited me to participate in the Civic Thought Initiative not only as a matter of pride but I was able to participate in a simple yet underscored means of cultivating political virtue: discussion. Although Professor Wilford was guiding us through ancient political philosophy and only through something as simple as discussion, throughout my various learning experiences with Professor Wilford, the pertinence of the knowledge I was gaining was a consistent element. I sincerely hope that I will get to continue learning from Professor Wilford through civic discussion.",
                "We discussed three important ancient political philosophy texts. The class was largely discussion-based, and we were able to debate some of the themes presented by Aristotle and Plato. It was a good entry-level course for ancient political philosophy."

                "Everyone definitely gets to participate in this course, making it a very engaging environment in which both students and the teacher participate to the conversation. However, sometimes the structure can result in the conversation being choppy.",
                "I felt the workload of this class was very manageable in a way that allowed me to engage with the text with sufficient time to closely read the assigned passages. The papers that were assigned, along with the reading responses, were just enough assignments to make it feel like the class was comprehensive and full-circle. I wish, however, that there was more student engagement when it came to facilitating discussion specifically with their reading responses. I was under the impression that the reading responses would be a framework for student instruction based on the passages they were assigned.",
                "The discussion format of the course was great, and very engaging. Its biggest issue was that students came in with very different levels of knowledge in philosophy, so sometimes discussions would be way over some student's heads.",
                "-there were a lot of tangents which were helpful for discussion but distracted us from the assigned readings",
                "Perhaps having more unstructured discussion could have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Wilford has *fantastic* scarves, is *fantastic* at walking through the text, and makes *fantastic* responses to thoughtful questions on readings.  She is a great professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This should not be as much of a seminar course as it is.  Dr. Wilford made fantastic points about the text, but about 75% of each class was spent by three students rambling about non-points in what I perceived as an attempt to gain class participation points.  Additionally, I felt that I was put at a disadvantage as a result of having no philosophical background.  Other students kept making points about ancient philosophers that were not in our designed readings, which really cut me out of discussions.",
                "Strengths: a great focus on political virtue\r\n                   active participation in discussion\r\n                   The professor had specific points that she wanted us to learn from the text but, at the same time, did not impede conversation\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Really one weakness primarily and, to be fair, this is very hard to combat without stifling conversation. Because we went into such depth in our discussions, we often focused too much on some parts of the text and lost time to discuss other parts.",
                "Strengths were that the course load was light, and Prof. Hirsch did a very good job encouraging discussion in the class. Often times the discussion did get a bit off track or it was focused on one part of the text for the entire class, so we scrambled to finish all the readings by the end of the course."

                "I would recommend this class if you're interested in ancient Greek philosophers. The focus was strictly on Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, involving very close readings with three novels. However, if you're looking for a more broad look at ancient philosophy, this seminar isn't great for that.",
                "Yes! It's a great fun course to dive into some very interesting texts and thoughts, and very low workload outside of the three papers.",
                "Yes but the student has to be prepared with prior knowledge to help learning. If they are not familiar with the texts (no pressure), they just have to make the extra effort to learn.",
                "This is a great course to take. If you want to develop a strong foundational understanding to ancient political philosophy - similar to what youd get by taking DS, this is the class for you. The teacher is incredibly engaging and a brilliant lecturer. The assignments are fair and there are plenty of opportunities to get feedback.",
                "Yes!  I loved Dr. Wilford.  If you get a group that actually engages directly with the text--instead of rambling about why things that are clearly hypotheticals won't work because of some nonesense point that completely misses the purpose of the dialogue--this class would be extremely rewarding.  Even so, it was a great class.\r\n\r\nPlus, as I mentioned earlier, Dr. Wilford has FANTASTIC scarves.  If for nothing else, take the class to see the drip.",
                "Yes. If you want to learn meaningful virtues which you can channel into meaningful work in any field, this is an excellent class.",
                "If you're not interested in political philosophy, this is not the class for you, but if you are then I definitely suggest taking it as a seminar."
