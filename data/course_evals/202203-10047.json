                "No weaknesses!\r\nStrengths - very insightful lectures and an amazing teaching team.",
                "This course was very well organized and taught. The only critique I have is that it seems like he gives the TFs a lot of leeway in terms of how they want to run their sections and grade, which can result in unequal experiences with the course depending on which TF you have.",
                "I feel that Professor Warner talked very fast and expected us to write everything down very quickly. I did not like how his slides had very few words and were not posted to Canvas after class. I feel that it was hard to take good notes. Also, the readings for the week were very long.",
                "The course could have lectures be uploaded",
                "Professor Warner is a really engaging lecturer. Sometimes, it was hard to figure out how things were pieced together in terms of chronology. He taught a lot of things out of chronological order, or there were things we learned about from different lectures that were happening concurrently, which I didn't even realize until I was studying. It would have been helpful if we could have gotten some more resources from Prof. Warner/the TAs in regard to a study guide/timeline.",
                "Professor Warner is easy to follow and makes the material as exciting as possible.",
                "Strengths: interesting subject matter; concise/engaging lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: wide variation in course experience/grading depending on the TA; readings often did not enhance/add to lecture material",
                "It is a great course to get an overview of history , however, there are times when there seems to be too much information presented in too short a time.",
                "The lectures were very engaging and felt very well-structured.",
                "readings are long and a bit useless\r\nlectures can drone on for so long and become boring \r\nmore films (really interesting primary sources)\r\nfinal paper + exam (3 essays) was a lot",
                "Could be improved by organizing the course better: clear instructions/prompts/rubrics on Canvas.",
                "I learned a lot from each individual lecture and I honestly enjoyed going to this class. The first half of the course was very well structured and felt cohesive lecture to lecture. For the second half of the course, each individual lecture remained engaging, but the lectures felt a little disjointed from one to the next. Perhaps this is just an inevitable byproduct of the fact that the first half covers a much larger expanse of time than the second half, but I think it could have been nice to spend some time working out how all the events fit together instead of just leaving that to the student. Furthermore, we talked about debates regarding nationalized health insurance in the US, but we never really talked about how national health insurance really works and the true pros and cons of it (besides the often deceptive and exaggerated cons that were stated by the AMA). Finally, given that we talked about 1980s discontent with the medical Establishment in America, it seems like we should have covered the HIV/AIDS crisis, and the fact that we didn't cover it makes this course feel somewhat incomplete. That being said, I really enjoyed this course and would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject.",
                "I think providing notes in lecture through slides would be a bit helpful, especially if you have to miss class. However I think thats also a strength since it makes you a more engaged student. I really did enjoy the lectures and learned a lot this semester.",
                "The biggest strength of the class is the reinforcement and enrichment of class material through section time. Additionally, the exam format of 2-3 essay questions promoted a general understanding of the material and trends within history. One section was dedicated to helping you get started on the research for the final paper, which was also super helpful.\r\nNo significant weaknesses.",
                "You are graded against your section. Some sections will have more people who care than others.",
                "Strengths: TAs and instructors\r\nWeaknesses: lectures are mostly just the prof talking at you (like old school lecture style) with minimal lecture slides, so you have to make sure you are really listening to get good notes",
                "The content of this course was very interesting and I thought it was run well. I don't think there were any weaknesses!",
                "The material was solid, but I wish lectures followed a more clear direction/relationship with one another - they felt very disjoint at times. Weakness: A huge accessibility issue for this class was the unhelpfulness of almost all of Warner's slides. All the information he gave was oral, with no useful supplement to read or enage in any other way in lecture. If a class was missed it was nearly impossible to make-up what was lost. Also the lecture in general was not super engaging which was a shame because the material was good.",
                "I thought that the readings were good--some weeks had readings that were too long but instructors were understanding if not everything could be completed. Weekly discussion posts were good but reminders would have been useful as it was always up in the air whether or not we had one to post. I think that Professor Warner did a great job teaching content and incorporating useful information from the readings into lectures so that you knew what the overall concepts to grasp were. The only improvement would be to have either a final exam or a final paper; I believe it was too much having both. Since there was only one midterm it is also plausible to have created a second midterm and then just assign a final paper. Also, we did not do much writing throughout the course so springing a final paper upon students was a bit random so I feel like even just one lecture dedicated towards formal writing (although we addressed it in section) would have been beneficial.",
                "The course curriculum is very structured and chronological. The lectures are interesting and the weekly discussion section keeps you engaged. I think the work was concentrated in the last 3 weeks of the course. We had a 10 page paper and 3.5 hour final in the last 10 days of the semester, and almost nothing except a short midterm and weekly discussion posts prior.",
                "Lecture and discussion session was fantastic. The readings were manageable and interesting. I would prefer more assignments so the research paper and final do not carry such weight. For me, more smaller assignments are conducive to learning and long-term memory.",
                "It is hard to keep up writing notes for lectures but they are engaging",
                "The lectures were really interesting, which was a strength, and I also liked the section hosted at the medical library. However, I felt the readings in the class were sometimes not as helpful, and a bit long compared to how much I felt I gained from the reading.",
                "Interesting material",
                "Lecture based class, discussion sections helpful",
                "A weakness is that the slides are sometimes difficult to follow because there are no words on them. The midterm was also an extreme time crunch.",
                "Recordings of classes would be helpful to be able to review",
                "the material and content is interesting but you have to take good notes during lecture since there is no material that can be used to study besides readings which does not help much",
                "The course has a great start and quickly became boring. In particular, the second half of the course lacked the intellectual stimulation of the first half as there is a a choice of topics that happen to be well known.",
                "Strengths: the lectures were always engaging and distilled important trends/shifts. The trip to the medical library was also great. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no major ones!",
                "There are no recorded lectures so taking notes quickly was very very important. The information itself was very interesting though",

                "Strengths - well organized, not too much work, Dr. Warner is incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about material\r\nWeaknesses- some of the topics and readings can be a bit mundane at times",
                "The entire teaching team was truly incredible. I also thought the lectures and reading materials were succinct and interesting. I would have liked to see more of a variety in supplemental mediums for outside of class preparation, as well as more frequent written responses.",
                "strengths: organized syllabus, thorough knowledge and case studies \r\nweaknesses: not very many, \r\nimproved: in preparation for final exam, lecture videos should be released in case we had to miss a lecture (we can't always email in advance for a recording)",
                "The lecture style was a bit disorganized. A lot of content was presented without much organization. The section was wonderful/",
                "strengths: compelling material, thought-provoking, relevant\r\nweaknesses: date ranges sometimes difficult to follow",
                "I loved the story-telling structure of the lectures.",
                "Strength: thorough lectures, comprehensive, interesting!\r\n\r\nWeakness: Not in chronological order, very lecture-style (not as interactive)",
                "The course covers a lot of material, most of which is important but oftentimes felt like it was provided in a format that only allowed for brute force memorization. Lectures often included dozens of names, events, and terms we had to memorize, and the fact that slides were not provided for us to review meant that it was often difficult to focus on the broader themes when much of the lecture was spent writing notes. The exams in this course were also graded heavily on whether you would include specific terms they were looking for in your essays, which made me and my peers resort to simply memorizing the material before the exam as a means of studying. I think that having these lecture slides as a study aid, along with changes to the way discussion sections and exams were administered, would make this class more conducive for broad-picture learning.",
                "I found the final to be kind of brutal, sitting and writing for 3 hours straight.",
                "Strengths: the lectures were always incredibly engaging. I really liked how Professor Warner paired his lectures with artwork and photographs and gave a brief synopsis at the end of each lecture, making sure to elucidate the larger themes. I also appreciated how he spoke about how the history of the Yale School of Medicine was intertwined with larger global and national trends in medical education and training in the last two centuries. Discussion sections were similarly enriching, and I appreciated the structure and organization of them. Weaknesses: Unclear standards for exams and essays. We were told by our TAs what to expect for the exams, but the questions posed and the feedback received did not reflect what we had been explicitly told beforehand; standards for the exams were higher than what we were told, with a wide distribution of grades that seemed dependent on the TA. It was also stressful to have 60% of our grade be determined after reading period, since the final essay and exam fell in the middle of/after reading period. In addition, the essay itself was very broad, and it was unclear what the expectations were; there was not very much guidance, and each TA had a different set of expectations.",
                "Strength - its a huge survey course where you will get a general understanding of how Western medicine had developed. Im doing so youll get to ask questions like what is a doctor (depending on where and when), or what sociocultural impacts the development of medicine had.",
                "This courses strengths were definitely its teaching staff  amazing TFs and a really kind and thoughtful professor. The courses were taught in a narrative, storylike manner, which I found really captivating. Weaknesses: got a little boring towards the end, didnt provide notes or comprehensive slides so you have to really pay attention and attend lectures, and actually kind of a solid amount of work (though it does help you learn)",
                "Lectures were so fantastic. Professor Warner is an absolute gem and does a great job of tying themes of race, gender, and class throughout lectures. The entire course comes together really well. Readings are relevant and manageable, but it would have been nice if some of the films brought up in lecture were assigned instead of readings some weeks. Workload is manageable and TFs were engaged. Sucked that the final was in person on the last day of finals right before a snow storm, but that's probably a complaint for whoever schedules final exams.",
                "The lectures and discussions were very well-organized, insightful, and compelled students to ask questions beyond the course material and engage with larger historical and cultural themes. Toward the middle of the semester, lectures became a little repetitive, but picked up again toward the end of the semester. The course may have benefitted from increased incorporation of voices from historically marginalized groups.",
                "Strengths: Professor Warner is an excellent lecturer and the content was highly interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Hard to interact with the professor since it's such a big class. Additionally, if you miss class you're just done for the test for that lecture because there are no intelligible slides as Professor Warner just talks (kinda like in a book) to you for 50 minutes.",
                "I love the lectures but the TFs grade too differently and some are much harsher than others.",
                "The strengths were definitely the sections. The sections helped me connect the readings to topics we need to understand. \r\nThere was not really any weaknesses that I felt the course had.",
                "Not enough online resources for students to catch up on material",
                "Strengths: engaging lecture, I always enjoyed going to lecture. Good discussion sections.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish that Professor Warner would post all the slides for the lectures! It would really help with reviewing for the midterm/final.",
                "I think discussion sections could be improved because a lot of my classmates seem to have had different formats and experiences in their separate sections.",
                "Strength - interesting content\r\nWeakness - does not record lectures and gives minimal prep for finals and midterms",
                "I dont really have any suggestions as to how it could be improved! I thought the amount of reading each week was fantastic, the lectures were engaging, and section was probably my favorite out of all my sections this semester.",
                "While Professor Warner was a very sweet person and was very engaged with the matierial, sometimes it was difficult to stay focusing in class.",
                "I wasn't a fan of in class exams in addition to the paper. It was a lot. I would have preferred just a paper, personally, even two papers over two exams. Other than that, great course!",
                "Strength is that very interesting topics are covered in a chronological order. Weakness is that a lot of content is covered in a single lecture.",
                "A strength I had/developed during the course was my note taking. I had never taken a lecture class before and it was a whole new expeirience that I defiantly improved upon. A weakness I had was absorbing all of the readings given for homework. It's hard to fully absorb 50 different pages of reading before section so it's something I hope tp get better at.",
                "The lectures were very engaging.",
                "I wish it were in chronological order.",
                "The organization of the course could be improved. Lectures were a bit frenetic at times and it was not always clear what was expected in terms of papers and exams. No way to go back and review lecture slides or key topics."

                "Yes, gives you the context you need to understand medicine today. The common themes, tensions, powers",
                "Yes, most definitely! The course was very interesting and provided a great survey of Western medicine.",
                "Yes! This is a really interesting course that people of many backgrounds would enjoy. It has a reasonable reading load compared to other history course, and it helps you develop historical research and writing skills.",
                "I would maybe recommend this course to another student. The content was interesting, but it was hard to take good notes. Also, a paper and a final exam is a lot of assessing for the end of the semester.",
                "Yes, if they want to learn about medicine",
                "This is a great course that I thoroughly enjoyed",
                "I really enjoyed this class! I loved the nuance with which Professor Warner approached the lecture material and how he would draw the conclusions of why certain history was important for the class.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student if you have any interest in healthcare. It is really interesting and as an HSHM major, I learned about so many health-related topics that I never knew about before. Professor Warner is a really engaging lecturer and there is a lot of autonomy in writing the research paper. You literally don't even have to write about Western medicine, so you can truly pick any topic that interests you, which makes it a lot more fulfilling.",
                "Yes I would. Its a great history course for someone of any major. Work load is manageable and material is interesting.",
                "Really depends on the TA; can either be a low-stress, pleasant experience or a highly stressful experience",
                "I would recommend this to other students. I feel like the course was structured in a way that invited many types of discussion and perspectives. I am not super well-versed in European history, and this course allowed me to explore the medical history of Europe without needing to know too much historical context.",
                "yes, but not my top choice; gives a broad overview but not very in-depth; recommend other HSHM classes more",
                "No, because the course was poorly organized. No instructions/prompt for the final research paper on Canvas. TF arranged the weekly reading responses on canvas poorly. Notes hard to take during lecture because the lecture slides only had pictures and professor said everything only once and then moved on.",
                "This is a very good class to anyone, premedical or not, that is looking to learn about a very relevant part of modern life. Professor Warner is very good and the readings were very interesting and well-chosen to prepare students for lecture.",
                "Yes! Professor Warner is an excellent lecturer and keeps you engaged the entire 50 mins of class. This is one of the few large lecture classes that I have thoroughly enjoyed and recommend it to all students who are interested, especially premed students.",
                "Yes, I quite honestly think that all students who are planning on entering the medical field or a medical-adjacent field should take this course to gain a strong understanding of the history of public health and medicine in the US and other Western countries. The readings are generally quite manageable, the lectures are very engaging, and you will learn a lot!",
                "I would recommend it if youre really interested in the course content, if not, you might find it boring. But I truly enjoyed the class and would be glad to recommend it to anyone!",
                "Yes, highly recommend it if you're interested in the history of medicine or if you're just a pre-med needing a humanities credit. I was never super excited about history, but this class really had me engaged. It was super interesting learning about perspectives from history and how they have shaped the medicine we know today. The workload is very minimal if you just show up to lecture and take notes, and the exams are general open essay questions that give you an opportunity to showcase how much you know without the stress of needing to memorize every single detail. I learned a lot - great class.",
                "Yes. Super important to anyone who intends to work with healthcare in any way",
                "I would because I learned a ton and students were well supported by our TAs. It was a great class for learning a cohesive history of medicine in the US and the lectures were very engaging.",
                "It's a solid overview of western medicine for anyone interested but be prepared that it's not the best HSHM class you coud take and not always the most engaging.",
                "Yes! I think that this was a fun course with lectures and discussion sections that were engaging. One could sit and listen to lectures or write notes the entire time--whatever was best for one's individual learning. I thought that lectures were extremely well organized and the course is not difficult for those who have little to no experience with America's medical history.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the history of medicine. This is definitely not a sure gut though, as the paper and final take quite a bit of work at the end of the semester.",
                "Yes. Great class overall. Very relevant to now and historically.",
                "Yes!! Great survey of western medicine and Professor Warner really puts his all into the class",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but not if they think it is a gut, you actually have to engage in the class.",
                "Yes! Light workload and very fun to learn",
                "Yes, especially if you have any interest in the medical field",
                "Yes",
                "This is an excellent History gut credit that I would recommend taking for an easy time.",
                "Yes! Interesting content, even as someone who doesnt plan to go into the medical profession, not too much work but I still learned a lot. Pay attention in lecture!! They are critical in connecting the concepts of the readings and section.",
                "Absolutely! I thought the information was very interesting and the overall freedom in assignments made the class more exploratory and tailored to individual interests",
                "definitely. I felt like i learned a lot and it wasnt an overwhelming work load.",
                "Yes if you are interested in learning about the origins of health and medicine in the West (especially the US); interesting and relatively laid-back course if you are pre-med",
                "Although the material is very interesting, I would not recommend you take this class the way it is taught. It is one of the worst classes I've taken at Yale. Lectures and section are super disorganized and random, no material is posted online besides a collection of primary sources, and the course in general does not really encourage you to engage with the material. While Professor Warner does care about his students, he seems far removed from the actual experience of the class. I took the class because the material sounded very interesting, but it is presented in a super artificial manner, with every decade being called a \"revolution\" or \"golden age' -- terms that you just had to memorize for exams. In addition, your experience may depend on your TA to a great extent, since the class relies on section to further teach the material. However, section was super disorganized and my TA only made the class requirements and material even more confusing. Don't take this class even if it sounds interesting or easy! I know people who transferred out of the HSHM major because of this class.",
                "Yes! This is a fabulous course that demonstrates the interconnectedness between medical history, politics, and socio-cultural trends. The modes of assessment also facilitate growth in many ways.",
                "yes, especially if they are in the HSHM major or considering becoming a doctor, important class to remember the medical field did not always look like it did today and all the systemic racism ingrained in the current system",
                "Yes, it is a very good introductory course for history of medicine for someone who does not know anything about the subject.",
                "yes, the material was not only compelling but relevant. lectures were always very interesting. one of my favorite classes so far.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in medicine. This course is not only a humanities credit, but a valuable history lesson that enriches the way I see medicine.",
                "Yes! Coming from a non-HSHM background, it was super informative and interesting!",
                "In its current state, I don't think I would recommend this course. Understanding the history of medicine is definitely crucial for anyone interested in pursuing a field in healthcare or medicine, but I felt like this course didn't allow me to learn in the most effective way possible. The work for this course often just felt like it required us to memorize terms without understanding their broader implications, and the heavy weight placed on in-person, closed-note essays placed an additional stress that hindered me from truly appreciating the course material. I think that, with a revised course structure, this class would be very enjoyable and rewarding.",
                "yes, the course material was interesting.",
                "I would, especially if you are pre-med. This course gave a really great understanding (in both depth and breadth) of the landscape of medical care and treatment throughout the last two millennia, and since the essay was so open-ended, you could pursue any topic of your choice. I came out of this class with so much knowledge that I will carry with me throughout my undergrad career and beyond. However, know that the grading is often unclear, and feedback (on both essays and exams) is very limited and not always helpful; if this will make you stressed out, then perhaps you should reconsider taking this class.",
                "Yes, yes, yes!!! This is an amazing course where youll gain so much, especially if you are interested in going into medicine, public health, history of medicine. By the end of the course, youll recognize big names throughout history that contributes greatly to medicine.  Also youll develop eyes to look at the current world and understand the healthcare disparities, patient-physician relationships, etc.",
                "Absolutely! If youre interested in the history of medicine but dont know where to start, this is a good way to get a cursory knowledge of Western medicine.",
                "Yes! Should absolutely be required for anyone hoping to pursue a career or graduate education in health or medicine.",
                "Yes, a lot of the information I learned here are things that everyone should know and is also interesting enough that I can think and use these pieces of information in daily life and conversation so nothing was a waste.",
                "Yes I think the topic is very interesting.",
                "Yes. I would recommend this course because it is essential to people who want to learn more about medicine. Also, it was not too challenging of a course load, so you will really be able to understand the course.",
                "If they wanted to be really focused. Not a just a class to sit back and learn without really memorizing the material or knowing the details",
                "Yes! I think it was overall a very interesting course, and I enjoyed it.",
                "Yes I would. I enjoyed the course very much.",
                "Yes, I would. It's a very chill class and allows you flexibility in how you respond to the material.",
                "Yes!! Professor Warner and my TF, Breeanna, were INCREDIBLE. Lecture were fascinating, readings were informative but not overwhelming (very manageable), and section was very helpful in deepening my understanding of the lecture material and also learning how to navigate historical writing and reading. I learned so much from the course and also developed very useful skills at deducing and studying broader themes rather than individual facts. Wish I could take this course again!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, especially students like me who dont typically gravitate towards history classes. I don't love science or history but the mix of the two I found quite interesting.",
                "I would! It was fascinating and encompassed so many important topics.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! While it is challenging, the material is interesting and exciting.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, I think that the course gets a lot more interesting as the semester went on. It's really interesting - everything I learned I never realized before and it was very easy to identify the main ideas from the course.",
                "Yes. The work for interest tradeoff is pretty good for this course. Lots of history covered in one semester."
