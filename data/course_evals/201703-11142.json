    "Writing reading speaking",
    "My french skills improved dramatically during French 3. It was the most engaging and successful part of my french experience at Yale. I felt far more involved in the language.",
    "I learned more French",
    "Learned much more french and would be able to have a decent conversation and read literature in french very well."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The material is interesting and introduces students to French literature and film in an accessible way. \r\nWeaknesses: Exams test memorization of poems and oral recognition of quotes from books rather than testing our understanding of the main themes and ideas of the books and films of the course. Moreover, there is less of a focus on speaking than in French 110 and 120, as the focus in 130 is more on grammar and recognizing quotations and vocabulary in context. This is detrimental for our practice speaking the language.",
    "This course was highly effective in developing one's French grammar and providing opportunities to converse in French (via reading written dialogues). I think more impromptu conversations would be great; that is, having peers ask open-ended questions more often, rather than reading dialogues. I really enjoyed Professor Burton's way of teaching and planning classes; no class time was ever wasted.",
    "Very well organized",
    "The homework sometimes feels like an overload, especially during the Jules and Jim section. The MMPs are vastly unnecessary. The tests were overly difficult. I particularly liked the sections on The Stranger and M. Ibrahim, which were run well and very engaging.",
    "I think the weakness of this course is the homework, it could be structured better.",
    "The class was taught very well and definitely improves your french to a higher level. Part of the reason the class is successful is because it is taught every day and requires constant attention. However, class every day is very difficult and only being allowed to miss 5 classes is rather difficult as well and almost unrealistic given that class is every day. Also, the amount of homework given every day is a bit unreasonable because it could easily by three hours a night for the daily homework if you really wanted to learn the material, which did not include anything extra assigned, studying for assessments, or the writing compositions. I understand that these things are part of the reason that your french speaking capabilities improve so much, but the work is too much to handle."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student if the student is interested in French history, French literature, and French film and wishes to learn the language.",
    "Yes, French 130 really solidifies the grammatical knowledge needed for proficiency in the language.",
    "Yes",
    "If they genuinely like and want to learn the French language, yes. But I would not recommend this as a simple way to complete the language requirement.",
    "It's required or its not.",
    "This class was very good and it was quite enjoyable to be in class. However, class every day is a lot to handle, and the homework due every day could easily take you over 2 hours every night for just the basic homework in the course packet, not including anything extra that may be assigned. Madame Burton is wonderful and makes the class worth it."
