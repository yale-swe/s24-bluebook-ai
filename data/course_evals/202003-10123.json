Between the two of them they do a great survey of many topics and their tests and homework assignments are fair. \r\nMy biggest issue with the course was that the lectures and readings were often very high level. Lots of concepts and hand wavey steps but very little actual example applications which made try to apply concepts on the homeworks and in code pretty challenging.",
