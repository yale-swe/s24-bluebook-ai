Some fun close reading group projects in the first parts of the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses  super rushed at the end, just as a result of how short YSS is. Pacing overall wasn't great. Too much time spent in discussion which made it really obvious when some people hadn't done the reading.",

The only weakness I can think of is maybe the high volume of reading, which led me to have to skim some things that I would have preferred to read more closely, but it didn't reduce the value of the class to me at all, and was mostly a scheduling issue on my part."
