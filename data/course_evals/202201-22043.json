I learned about many different cancers and the scientific research that went behind cancer treatment history. I learned about the politics and activism behind cancer research, breast cancer, and financial toxicity.",
                "I loved being able to participate and engage in class discussions with Professor Bazell. His enthusiasm and passion for the subject material allowed us to feel very engaged and supported in deepening our understanding of the science and politics of cancer. I learned more about being able to accurately read through reports and scientific journal articles and understand just how important the history and socioeconomic impacts cancer diseases play in the world today.",
                "I learned about the science behind cancer (cell biology, tumor biology, the progression of cancer, immunology, and how various treatments work), the history of cancer research and treatment, and how politics impacts cancer (drug prices, prevention efforts, patient-doctor relationships, over-screening, access to cancer treatment). I feel confident about discussing cancer topics, giving presentations, and writing scientific research papers.",
                "I cannot stress enough how incredible it was to take this course. I got to learn about the scientific underpinnings of cancer and its treatment, but also about ways in which the politics of good intentions has gotten in the way of effectively caring for cancer patients. Some highlights: the legacy of the radical mastectomy, the rising cost of drugs, prevention efforts, overtreatment, the rise of palliative care, targeted therapies, and the really fascinating intersection between cancer and HIV/AIDS activism.",

                "Strong in how chill the professor is and how fascinating some topics are. Weak in the presentation of these topics---typically through powerpoint presentation and lecture. Did not really facilitate conversations between students but rather framed it as a question-answer dynamic with the professor. Sometimes students would be tasked with teaching the lectures themselves but this, again, was not conducive to inter-student conversation.",
                "The course is well developed.",
                "great class. favorite at yale so far",
                "The strengths of the course were the readings, the lecture slides, student group activities, and the order of the course. One weakness of this course is how much we interact with our readings because we didn't talk about the readings as much in class.",
                "Strengths: organization, engaging lectures and discussion, interesting readings, flexible paper topics, committed professor\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "I think the course is remarkably well-taught and well-structured -- I loved our discussions, our presentation work, and the guest speakers (who were amazing -- I particularly enjoyed talking to Fran Visco, given her unique perspectives!). I also appreciate that Prof. Bazell made us seriously engage with the scientific underpinnings of cancer and its treatment. They really are necessary to understanding how cancer politics can and should progress -- and given that many of us (myself included!) are humanities students at heart, we wouldn't have engaged much with the science if we weren't actively forced to. I'm also glad for the focus on reading and citing formal scientific literature -- which again I wouldn't have engaged with if I wasn't prompted to.\r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, I think there was definitely some confusion and disconnect vis a vis the quizzes. I think other people will talk about that more in their evals, and it wasn't a big issue for me, so I'll refrain from commenting further. I positively loved the course on the whole.",

                "Yes! This class is amazing because the structure and ways in which we learn the material was very exciting.",
                "Yes, I am not a STEM major and was able to understand the science behind how cancer develops and progresses and how treatments work, as well as the fascinating political aspects. Professor Bazell was committed to our class and made each class meaningful, engaging, and fun. I liked the presentations, class discussions, and readings.",
                "Yes!!! Absolutely. I would especially recommend it to students interested in politics, who sometimes have undeveloped ideas about how to approach public health issues, just because they don't have the requisite background in understanding them scientifically. Often times, these students come in with the idea that if we just throw more money at something like cancer research, we'll find a cure just like that. If you tend to be of that persuasion, implicitly or explicitly, please take this seminar! It will change your perspective in ways that don't just apply to cancer, offering lessons that are absolutely widely applicable.\r\n\r\nI'll make another pitch -- if you're a first-year student looking at the seminar list and you're a humanities student, you're probably trying to figure out how you'll get your science credits. This might be the best science credit for a humanities student at Yale -- and one that can and will relate to things that interest you. There's a WGSS angle (medical feminism is fascinating!!), a PLSC angle (I mean look at the title!), and the list goes on.",
