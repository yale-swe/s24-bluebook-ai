    "Improved my Chinese in a very similar way to CHNS 150. Improved listening, reading, speaking, writing with more improvement in listening and writing and less improvement in reading\/speaking this semester.",
    "I continued to improve my vocabulary, benefitting the most in my hearing\/understanding and reading of Chinese. The topics covered in the class also allowed me to learn about Chinese society from various perspectives.",
    "My proficiency increased a lot, there was not a thorough focus on grammar but I had lots of opportunity to improve my spoken skill. Want Laoshi is busy and important, but is amazing at making herself available to students."

   "comments": [
    "Too much work, way too much work, if this course isn't reformed to have substantially less work, I would strongly argue against taking it.",
    "Strengths: A great class on the whole if you like learning Chinese. Small, active classes; great instructors who really care about each student and their individual progress; readings are filled with new words and opportunities for practice; no emphasis on memorizing how to hand-write characters Weaknesses: Test and dialogue questions could be improved to be more clear. Sometimes, I'll understand a dialogue but find the question is looking for a vague answer, two of which seem like they could be correct. Throughout the year I've felt like I've lost some character recognition, especially from earlier chapters -- CHNS 151 should incorporate more activities for review of characters and grammar structures. The course moves quickly through readings and character quizzes every day and some words get lost in the rush.",
    "Strengths: teaching, emphasis on understanding of spoken and written Chinese, interesting topics, tutorial sessions\r\nWeaknesses: few opportunities to practice speaking in class, easily forget much of the new vocabulary because of the quantity learned",
    "Strengths consistency and high level of rigor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses became a little monotnous and too routine to be interesting at times, but I think that also just comes with learning chinese.",
    "I overall really like this class. It was my favorite class this semester. If there's one thing I would recommend or try to do for next year is to allocate more time to practice if possible so we can really internalize the grammar and sentence structures."

    "If you like Chinese and the Chinese department at Yale then take this class. It has a high workload, but you don't care if you enjoy the subject. Let's be honest, language study isn't about understanding radically difficult topics. Studying a language is about learning relatively simple concepts *very well* to have a good grammar foundation and memorizing your vocab. The Chinese department will do an phenomenal job doing this task and keeping you accountable for memorizing your work. If you want to learn Chinese then this is the class for you. If you want an easy A then just take L1 of whatever language you took in high school.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless it is changed to have significantly less workload. It was unreasonably high and burdensome to the point that I truly truly regretted taking this course after already having taken Chinese at Yale for five semesters beforehand.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The course is both rigorous and reasonable. Students will strengthen their Chinese skills and enjoy class time.",
    "Absolutely. I chose Yale in part because I heard good things about their Chinese offerings, and this class is great if you want to continue to improve.",
    "Yes, this is a great course if you want to continue improving your Chinese. The teachers are really helpful, and the content makes it very interesting.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! Especially if you are interested in topics surrounding China, the units in this course are very interesting. Plus, the faculty seem all very encouraging and supportive."
