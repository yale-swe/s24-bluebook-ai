Additionally, we were often not told of presentation details or other important information until the Sunday before class, leaving many people a bit stranded over the weekend and then stuck to cram in work Sunday evening."

I came in expecting what we learned in class to be close to enough to learn the material, but in reality, you will probably need to spend at least double the time you spend in class working on the material outside of the class as class time is more an introduction to the material and you are expected to do a good bit of the heavy lifting in learning the material outside of class."
