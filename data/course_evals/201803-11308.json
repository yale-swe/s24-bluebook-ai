   "comments": [
    "I learned a broad overview of American indian history.",
    "I went into this class knowing very little and learned more than I could have imagined, from the relations between the Spanish empire and the Pueblo Indians in the 1500s West to contemporary issues of tribal law and jurisdiction. It truly changed the way I view American history and opened a door for me to understanding some of the Native experience.",
    "This class should be mandatory - you will become a better writer and your ways of thinking will be challenged for the better.",
    "As someone whose American history classes had previously given very little, if any, context to the historical experiences of Indigenous people throughout American history, I very much appreciated learning from and taking this course. I learned so much about the histories of Indigenous people in the United States that I had no idea about beforehand. In terms of skills, I really liked that the final paper for the class was written on a fictional book, The Round House. This was a very important opportunity for me to consider the ways in which the historical events and themes that we had been learning about in class tied into a novel written by an Indigenous author, about Indigenous people.",
    "You are opened to the world of the history of the  United States through the lense of the American Indian. Very eye-opening course.",
    "I learned a lot about American Indian history",
    "Given that schools do not teach nearly enough or teach accurately about Native Americans, its important that there even is a class at Yale like this.",
    "I was introduced to an entire world of experiences that aren't adequately represented in broad understandings of history. I gained a set of analytical tools and themes to watch for in modern political and economic realities, as well as pop culture content.",
    "In this class I learned a lot about native history that I previously had no idea about.",
    "A much more holistic and complete view of American Indian history, focusing on Indigenous peoples as active agents and participants in their own history, and the fights led by Indigenous peoples themselves to preserve their rights and dignities.",
    "In terms of course content, purely, this was one of the top courses I've taken at Yale. I now realize that it is super important to learn about Indigenous history and current issues.  The course is at its strongest when covering the historically complex relationship between the federal govt and the Indian tribes.",
    "This course provided a vast (if sometimes slightly shallow) survey of Native American history, in doing so calling for a rediscovery of U.S. history. We learned about the Americas prior to the Columbian Exchange, colonial contact between European empires and Native peoples in various regions, the Indigenous origins of the United States, U.S. expansion and its consequences, military, legal, and sociocultural means of assimilation, termination policies, challenges to Native sovereignty and self-determination, and Indigenous resistance in revolt, remembrance, and activism. We also challenged popular myths of the pristine wilderness of pre-1491 America and of American innocence in the catastrophic post-contact Native American population loss.",
    "This course covers the diaspora of American Indian tribes across America, tracing the history, which is heavy in subject matter but necessary to understand the contemporary issues that Native peoples face today. Since this is an introductory course, it covers a wide range of material that comes together to explain the societal and legal dilemmas that Native people are grappling with.",
    "We covered a survey of Native American history from before Columbus arrival to present day. Focus was on dispelling myths of Native American lack of agency in history, both world and American, and on their interactions with other groups, both inside and outside of their tribes.",
    "I learned a lot of general history of Native American history and how it has impacted the United States till this day, and continues to do so. Also learned are skills regarding history and source analysis.",
    "I definitely developed lecture learning style skills such as note-taking and close-reading. The class was an important part to my semester - I learned a lot about indigenous history of the North American continent and how it's been influenced by American Indian Law and Policy.",
    "I learned a lot of Indigenous American history - I most enjoyed the pre-19th century content which also gave me insights about how indigenous communities began to be transformed with the arrival, trading and violence of the Europeans.",
    "I learned how to approach history from multiple perspectives. Rather than approaching the history of the United States through the perspective most often taught, I was able to synthesize Native American perspectives into my own understanding.",
    "This course provides an overview of American Indian history that reorients and Indigenizes common narratives in an engaging way. It covers many different aspects of Indigenous histories, and includes many different ways of learning about them (touching on many things ranging from initial Indigenous-imperial colonial encounters, Indigenous sports, film, stories, Native representations, etc).",
    "I gained a great amount of background in the history of American Indians, which I was quite naive in",
    "I learned about the eras of American Indian history, federal Indian policy, and the true strength and resilience of Natives despite their past.",
    "A deeper understanding of American Indian History and the way that our country views and teaches it. A serious appreciation for American Indian culture.",
    "I learned a lot about history I really didn't know about, especially after 1890.",
    "Got a good overview of American Indian History - helped my general understanding of US history and filled in a lot of gaps",
    "Overview of Native American history from precolumbian period to the present (1st half of the semester to the midterm focused on history up to the Civil War, 2nd half focused on 1860s to the present). Course materials included secondary historical texts, primary sources from European\/American colonial and Native American writers, films, and novels. Particularly new insights on contemporary (20th century Native American history) and the central role of Native American communities in American legal history.",
    "I think it would be very difficult for someone in the course to not have a transformative experience, even with minimal engagement. I am not a history major or American studies major, and took the course purely out of personal interest. I am very happy I did. Native American history is something I had previously only engaged with in my personal life (family friends\/mentors), not something I had ever been taught in school. I strongly enjoyed coming to lecture, doing the readings, and engaging in section discussions. I feel much more equipped to put conventionally taught American history in perspective, and consider the past and current experiences of indigenous Americans.",
    "I learned so much about Native American history that I had no idea about before. It really opened my eyes to the many different facets of Native American history, and has left me wanting to know more.",
    "Essay writing skills, including citations etc."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures are very difficult to follow and not helpful for studying for exams.  although the professor was very engaged and enthusiastic in lectures, the material was not well presented and the lectures had no flow.",
    "The texts Professor Blackhawk chose were all very interesting, including the Van Den Bogaert journal and The Round House. I liked all the guest lectures he incorporated as well as how much the course was oriented towards empowering students to take action in their own everyday lives. I especially appreciated the fact that we covered Native Hawaiians a bit instead of being strictly limited to the continental US. In terms of the assignments, I liked that we had an in-class essay and a paper instead of a final exam. As someone who was not doing the writing credit, however, the short essay in the beginning of the semester felt a bit trite.",
    "This class is all strengths: the lectures were very engaging and I was always excited to go to class. My section was the best section I have been in at Yale so far.",
    "Lectures were really boring. The prof was really nice and passionate but the lecture style was really disorganized, unengaging, and hard to follow.",
    "The course brought us back to the earliest colonial encounter in the United States (and even before then), something that I very much appreciated. But in addition, I appreciated that Professor Blackhawk brought the course up into the present, discussing Indigenous activism during the American Indian Movement and into the twenty-first century. I thought that when Professor Blackhawk provided the key terms from each lecture, that was also very helpful, as I was better able to contextualize what we were learning about in each class. Occasionally, though, lectures were a little disorganized, which made them sometimes hard to follow.",
    "Lecture is irrelevant and pretty brutal to sit through. Very little connection between readings, section, and lecture.",
    "The lectures were very dry and the lecture slides were never distributed. Passing out some materials would help. The readings were very good, however.",
    "Strengths - Subject matter SO important \r\nWeaknesses - Lecture felt very disorganized, left wondering many times, what was the point of this or that. Professor Blackhawk is nice but he mumbles and a lot of the time, you truly couldn't understand what he was saying.",
    "The reading was the highlight of the course. The texts were informative, not too dense, and really interesting. The course was worth it for the reading alone. The lecture could be improved by more organization and clearer themes. Sometimes it wasn't clear what the point was for that particular lecture. It would also be helpful to have the lecture slides uploaded to canvas because the professor covered a lot of information in each lecture so if you missed a point or didn't come to lecture, there was no way to make up the material.",
    "Professor Blackhawk is a funny and engaging professor, and the TAs are brilliant, attentive, and excellent at running discussion sections.\r\n\r\nI think the class could have been improved if Professor Blackhawk focused a little more on the major dates and individuals of American Indian history--some of the texts and guest lecturers seemed to assume familiarity with a base of historical knowledge that we had not been exposed to (for example, the Red Power movement was only given a few minutes and slides--a reading from some broad secondary source\/textbook passage to frame the period would have been incredibly helpful). I also would have preferred more time in the twentieth century as a share of the class content.",
    "Lectures were slightly confusing and slow however the discussion sections were excellent",
    "Strength: Important subject, very interesting readings, great guest lecturers\r\nWeakness: Definitely the lectures. While Blackhawk is clearly a knowledgeable guy, he needs a more logical way of organizing the course. He skips around  a lot in geography and chronology, and it's really hard to follow. He should just stick with chronological order.",
    "I personally got a lot out of this course and really enjoyed it, although it's certainly far from perfect. The course's biggest strength was certainly its material, which was consistently fascinating and thought-provoking, and presented in a really unique and important light. Even those who've studied American Indian history before could learn a lot from this course. The reading material was generally enjoyable, although it was only sometimes relevant to the lecture content. Ned Blackhawk is an incredibly interesting and knowledgable person, who I greatly enjoyed learning from and suspect would be much better in a seminar setting. Lecturing simply is not his strength -- his lectures were so hard to follow and delivered in such a dry, monotonous manner (he often sounded bored by his own words) that it was very difficult to internalize any course material, even though I actively strove to pay attention. In the second half of the course in particular, there was nothing holding anyone accountable for the material, which promoted slacking and made everyone generally less engaged.",
    "Lectures are very dull.",
    "Material was interesting especially the readings we did. Lecture was boring and hard to be engaged",
    "The guest lecturers and the way the syllabus was set up in terms of material covered over the course of the semester made the course very engaging, covering more material than I ever could have expected from an introductory course to the diaspora. However, Professor Blackhawk's lecturing style can be confusing at times and the timelines got confusing as well, as we jumped back and forth between time periods without continuity. As well, sometimes his volume made it difficult to hear depending on where you were in the room. For the most part, Professor Blackhawk had a lot of knowledge to impart to his students and helps make connections between material easily, which is helpful when it comes to synthesizing the readings and lecture material.",
    "This course was very lecture based and slides often didnt help too much with following Professor Blackhawk.",
    "This course does a great job of engaging the students in the class, giving a sense of the history being taught. The course teaches and engages the material in different and unique ways.",
    "The teaching fellows were all very great and kind - it was easy reaching out to them with questions. Professor Blackhawk is also very great and knowledgable, but it was sometimes difficult to follow him in lecture.",
    "Strength - important content that all Yale student should engage with. Good mix of readings from a primary source diary, to academic texts and a great novel.\r\nWeakness- lectures were not engaging and to follow.",
    "Professor could post lecture slides, it is tough to get much out of lecture as is.",
    "I think the content of the course is a strength, but how this content is presented is a weakness. The course incorporates very interesting primary and secondary sources, and the guess lecturers brought in great information. However, often times the lectures could be disorganized.",
    "The lectures can be a little monotonous but overall the information is really engaging, Professor Blackhawk is clear about the expectations and very knowledgable about the material, and the TAs are helpful and give lots of feedback.",
    "This course was a wonderful look at a reorientation of history to include Indigenous voices. In so many other courses, these voices are nearly or entirely omitted, and I loved the fact that they were made into the focus of this course. I loved the guest speakers, the range of geographic locations discussed (both within and outside of the United States), and the range of readings. I really liked that the readings supplemented interesting lectures, and I would not suggest any changes to this course.",
    "Be more engaging. Lecture wasnt that good.",
    "Lectures were very hard to hear and unengaging, sections were good though",
    "Strengths: Good content and interesting readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were sometimes difficult to pay attention to. More visuals and slides on the power-points, as well as guided questions at the beginning of lecture would have helped engagement. Additionally, it would have been helpful to refer back to the power-points on Canvas, instead of feeling pressured to copy down all the words on the slides during lecture.",
    "Sections were extremely helpful and I loved reading the course material.",
    "I did not like a few of the books we read-- they were difficult to understand with my sparse background in the field. However, overall I learned a lot and really enjoyed the tone of the class.",
    "Great course. Couldve had a more intersectional focus. I felt it set up a settler-Native American binary sometimes. But the readings and lectures were comprehensive otherwise.",
    "Strengths: fascinating course material (especially the second half of the course which focused more on contemporary Native American history not typically covered in U.S. History courses), well-chosen and interesting readings, knowledgeable professor, strong TFs (Monique particularly), reasonable workload (it definitely is not necessary to do all assigned readings but they're interesting if you have time!), and very fair assessments\/grading.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: somewhat organized and meandering lectures that didn't always stress key takeaways which made studying for the midterm a bit difficult (a lot of Wikipedia and cramming) despite Professor Blackhawk's obvious depth of knowledge, varying levels of engagement among students (it was clear some students were not particularly engaged which made sections a mixed bag -- my section was very strong, but I attended another section once when I had a conflict and barely anyone participated), uneven reading assignments throughout the semester.",
    "I think the lecture slides should be posted on Canvas, as it was often difficult to write all of the topics down from the first slide, and I often found myself wishing I could revisit different images shown in class.",
    "I think a major strength is the organization. I really like how the class was structured. I dont really know about weaknesses. I also liked that the grades were so spread out with our two papers, the midterm, and the federal Indian law question. That really helped put less stress on me for any one thing and made me feel like I was really being assessed for all of the material that the class covered. I feel like a weakness could be almost that there were too many readings. Of course since it is a history class it makes sense to have to read so many books over a semester. I just felt like there were too many to discuss at the same time like a new chapter in Indigenous London was at the same time as a whole book about Hawaii and I will be honest, I was not able to read the whole thing that week because it was too much, and we didnt even end up discussing the Indigenous London chapter. I feel like less readings would help to be able to flush out certain subjects in detail, but that is just my opinion.",
    "Lecture slides should be posted online so that students can review material on their own as well."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to another student solely because of the lectures.  I am very interested in the material but think that the difficulty of following lectures makes it a little bit of a waste of time.  I would love a class that addresses the same histories but is easier to follow.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn another side of the American history they were always taught and closely examine issues and events that knowledge of which has been systematically suppressed by the powers that be. It's also great if you want to feel like what you're learning is readily applicable to current events.",
    "Take this course, regardless of your major. What you learned in US History class in high school will be challenged by what you learn in this course and will make you think about issues that are normally neglected by our education system.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I find it so important to learn about the histories of Indigenous people in the United States particularly given that they are so often undertold in other American history classroom settings. I really liked the long timespan that the course comprised, and I also really appreciated the guest lecturers who came to give presentations in our class. In addition, I really appreciated that we were able to do our final papers on a book as important to read as The Round House--not only was this a new and different way of thinking about the ways that the histories we had been learning about in class affected Indigenous people, but I also appreciated being able to discuss the book with the other people in my section.",
    "If you need a WR credit, there are more interesting classes. If you need a WR credit, I doubt there are fewer WRs with this low of workload.",
    "Yes!",
    "Don't be tricked. It's not exactly a gut. You still need to study for the midterm. Other than that, the class is pretty easy and the WR option is EXTREMELY EASY. It's like 12 pages in total.",
    "Yes, its so necessary to create more awareness of Native American tribal issues over time and now! That being said, you have to be pretty self-motivated because lecture is easy to miss since its hard to follow.",
    "It is a fairly easy writing credit, and can fulfill the pre-industrial requirement for history majors. I would recommend it for the readings but not so much the lectures.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, though I would try to make sure they were going to be actually engaged with the content. An understanding of settler colonialism ought to be a baseline for living in the Americas, and I wish more Yale students were graduating having taken a class like this. However, I felt that it would have been easy to disengage with the content and merely go through the motions of participation. Due to its low workload it is a strong choice as a fifth class, but the mental disengagement option also means it is easy to paradoxically participate in a class that is, at least in part, about how indigenous lives are systematically undervalued and overlooked, while at the same time ignoring and failing to take American Indian history seriously, or turning away from the immense atrocities in our recent past. Seeing this in other students and occasionally recognizing it in myself were very disturbing.",
    "Yes as it was an incredibly important course to take in terms of American history, very meaningful and you can take away important knowledge and skills",
    "Yes. The lectures are really confusing and hard to follow, but the readings and discussions are good and the material is really important.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who finds the material genuinely interesting. It's the sort of course where you could get away with not learning, but if you make an honest effort, you could get a lot out of this class.",
    "Yes. Important education for citizens of the USA and the world.",
    "Ned Blackhawks class is very dull. His way of lecturing is very scattered and leaves you confused about what information is important. However, he gives you all of the IDs and all the essay questions for the midterm beforehand so the exam was very manageable especially if you know someone who took the class before and can offer guidance about what information Is important for the IDs. We also had a 30 minute in class essay that had to do with Federal Indian Law Policy that was very easy. Students only had to attend the lecture before the essay to know the necessary information to obtain full credit. In terms of essays, we had one short essay based on a 40 page book that was very easy to write. The second essay was about a novel that dealt with sexual assault on reservations. The book was amazing and the essay was a basic literary analysis. This class was very boring but if you need an easy WR you should take it. It was interesting to learn about American Indian History from a different point of view than most people have been taught in high school.",
    "Yes. Take it as a writing credit",
    "I was pleasantly surprised that this course was as engaging as it turned out to be, given that history has bad connotations sometimes. I definitely recommend this course to learn more about a subject that is not often taught, it helped me articulate contributions of other cultures to the founding of America and tell the reality of the founding of our nation. Definitely take it!",
    "I definitely would recommend this course. The material was super interesting and challenging.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as it teaches many invaluable skills about historical analysis. Also, the material in the course is fascinating and provides a better understanding of Native American history.",
    "I have already recommended this class to several people. It's incredibly important to know the truth of indigenous survivance and knowledge so long the U.S. continues to occupy stolen lands.",
    "This is a difficult one. I believe that the content of this class should be mandatory for all students studying in the US. The history of Indigenous communities is ignored, revised and disrespected. Blackhawk is a great historian and we are lucky to have him, his book is amazing! However, the lectures were boring and unengaging. I hope that the class is reviewed to be more accessible so that everyone can learn this important history!",
    "Not really, it was good for a credit (writing \/ humanities).",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student seeking a WR credit.  AMST 133 allows students the opportunity to engage not only with historical material but also with material that is relevant to the modern era.",
    "If there were steps taken to make lecture more structure, then I would recommend this course to other students.",
    "Definitely. I think this is a course everyone should take, it's such an important history and perspective that most people miss, at least coming from typical American public schools. The reading isn't too much and is very interesting, and the midterm and final paper are fair.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think that this class is a very necessary course to take to have an understanding of the true history of the Indigenous peoples of the United States, and to actually understand how this country was formed.  It is a crucial inclusion of Indigenous voices (that were always therein the first place) in a historical narrative that too often intentionally chooses to omit them. It brings up questions that made me think more critically about the predominant historical narratives typically presented as the truth.",
    "Yes! This should be a required course so Student understand Indigenious issues.",
    "If there is a microphone in the class next semester, then yes",
    "I would recommend, because the content was really interesting and thought provoking.",
    "Yes, a good overview of Native American history.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Absolutely-- I think everyone, especially Americans, should take an American Indian history course and this is a great overview.",
    "Introduction to American Indian History is a terrific introduction to Native Studies. The class is foundational in my education and it challenged pre-conceived notions of history by providing complex, alternate, and contesting narratives. Professor Blackhawk is funny and he relates all of the history to current events. This class provides a long-range and wide survey of American Indian History throughout several centuries. The class is constantly engaging, informative, and interesting. I recommend sitting close to the front of the classroom because Professor Blackhawk doesn't speak very loudly. If you do the work, you will get a good grade and will enjoy the semester. Take this class!",
    "Definitely take this course especially if youre studying American history. You likely missed a lot of important events relating to Americans Indian history in your other courses.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, either a history major (especially those in the US track) looking for an alternative and essential U.S. History course or a non-history major looking for a reasonable and interesting HU or WR credit. As a history major, this is definitely not the most engaging history lectures I've taken at Yale but the material is extremely important and readings are well-chosen and fascinating. Would also recommend to students studying colonial\/postcolonial literature or history in other parts of the world as a strong comparative case (I took this class alongside Dan Magaziner's African Encounters with Colonialism and there were many fascinating intersections regarding questions of identity, citizenship, and sovereignty). Not the strongest overall class, but good TFs and essential material for any U.S. citizen or person planning on living in the U.S.!",
    "Absolutely. I would recommend this course to any student at Yale regardless of their major.",
    "Yes, I think everyone should take a class with Professor Blackhawk at some point.",
