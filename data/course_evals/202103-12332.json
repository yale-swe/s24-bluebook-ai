I am leaving this course with a significantly improved ability to read empirical literature, evaluate claims, and independently produce advanced R code.",
                "I learned all things research design  what kinds of research designs there are, characterizing designs using the MIDA framework (Model, Inquiry, Data Strategy, Answer Strategy), how to make your own design, how to evaluate a design and then how to redesign in light of your evaluation, etc. These skills are extremely useful if not essential for people interesting in doing empirical research. \r\nAlso, this course teaches you about the credibility revolution and how bad research designs have low key made so many of the findings in social sciences un-replicable, which is a super important topic.",
                "I learned how to analyze and evaluate research designs more systematically.\r\nI also learned (very) basic r skills.",
                "Wow - what a great course. I am happy to have taken it during my first semester in grad school, because it improved the breadth and depth of my thinking about the importance of research designs in the social sciences. I had taken numerous quantitative empirical methods courses in the past (e.g., my undergrad), but I always felt that a core component was lacking in those courses, such that provided a sort of meta-theoretical structure to design my research. This isn't to say that a \"meta\" design is always necessary for having a good structure to do well designed research - it isn't - but for those of us with ADHD, who crave or rely on a structure to guide us in our processes, this course provided the first step toward a less stressful, increasingly reliable, and absolutely inspiring way of building research designs. I now go forth, with reduced stress, able to focus my predesign efforts on the front end, in ways that are so much more effective than in the past.",

                "I think there's a lot to be learned in this course. I think one weakness is that the organization could have been better (though to be fair it was the first time being taught of a research design book that is yet to be published).",
                "The strength of this course lied in Professor Coppock's lecture style. He was always super enthusiastic to answer questions, in lecture and office hours. First class I've taken where section was actually super beneficial for the PSets. As someone interested in conducting quantitative research, found the material super useful for upcoming research proposals. I don't think this is going to change, since I've heard it's used for all of Coppock's classes, but the 1 to 3 grading scale is a bit vague. Also, Coppock's software package (DeclareDesign) is super useful for PSets and conceptual stuff, but you might benefit from thinking about how to do things in base R as well.",
                "despite its claim to capture all social science research, it's coming from a very specific type and paradigm of research . Experiment student benefits most. It's stricly operating under the post-positiivst paradigm and severly undermines the validity/value of other research paradigms. I wish he could make this explicit, instead of claiming other research questions as bad questions or illusion of learning. \r\nAlso, please don't assume people know things. I was bothered with the PREVALENT use of abbreviations straight out without explaining. I really don't know ATE, ITT, etc the first time I see it.",
                "This course was fabulous. If you like research and care about political science as a discipline, you must take it.",
                "Professor Coppock very clearly explained challenging topics, I think better explaining some political science/economics terminology before learning them in practice would help to set the context.",
                "The greatest strength of this course is honestly Dr. Coppocks M:I::D:A framework. While there is a very steep learning curve in the beginning, I am leaving this course with a significantly better understanding of how to design a research project on my own. Likewise, Dr. Coppocks textbook is excellent and is the best textbook that I have used thus far.\r\n\r\nAnother strength of this course is the true effort put in by Dr. Coppock to accommodate both visual and auditory learners. Every subject had a diagram which made it easier for me to follow. \r\n\r\nThe primary weakness of this course comes from how it handled the prerequisites for R. The syllabus stated that an introductory familiarity with R is recommended but not required; however, a minimum high-intermediate familiarity with R is required in order to not only complete the weekly assignments in a timely manner, but also to understand what is happening in the code. As such, while it is not, and should not be, the objective of this course to be R 101, either a higher prerequisite requirement or more attention to the subject in class is required. \r\n\r\nAnother weakness of this course is the allowance for students to redo assignments late and after the fact. I understand that this is helpful to those who may have had issues; however, it does create a feeling that everything hinges on the final project for final grade differentiation.",
                "This was the first time the course was taught but it was incredibly well done. We followed an online book (written by Professor Coppock) that was in-depth and explained everything well. However, the PSETS could be pretty tough and a tiny bit ambiguous but if you just go to office hours and get help you can do them, there's just a lot of r code trickery.",
                "The course was well sctructured and we covered a lot of ground. I definitely feel more capable of analyzing research and writing about research findings after taking this course. I feel more confident using r, and the learning experience was overall positive.\r\n\r\nA few points that I would like to share:\r\n- Perhaps it worth considering having longer lectures. The classes were 50 minutes, and we were always covering several topics pretty quickly. There usually wasn't enough time to ask questions, go over the explanations once again and let the material \"sink\", or even summarize and copy from the board. \r\n- The class did not demand any background in r, but relatively to an introductory r class, we were provided very little guidance. The sections with Sofia could have included more r guidance. If the classes were a little longer, sections could have focused only on r skills without having to go over the theoretical materials again.\r\n- It took me 10 hours to finish a typical probelm set. That means that I had no time to read the book before class or read any other article. I believe that more r guidance (and more declare design guidance) could have reduced this amount significantly.\r\n- The book is very helpful, but it assumes high knowledge and familiarity of research design and quantitive methods. Though it is a useful resource, but because the materials are complicated, it worths considering sharing slides beforre\\after class with the main arguments in a more straightforward language.",
                "Prof. Coppock and the TA Sofia were great instructors throughout this course -- honestly some of the best I've had for statistics classes at Yale. They were clear and engaging and very helpful for any questions I had throughout the course. I think one weakness of the course was that the final project did not feel connected to the rest of the content in the course. Most of the problem sets were more theoretical and did not use real data and I found myself struggling when we were suddenly asked to do that on the final project. More real-life study examples earlier in the course would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: interesting, widely applicable topic\r\nWeaknesses: had to self-teach R (the PSets were not well-connected to the class material/book work); wish we had talked through the MIDA framework's application to specific studies more during class",
                "Because this was the first time Professor Coppock taught the course and used his newly written book for the course, I think he could have helped in explaining code more in the book and in lectures. I often felt I understood much of the concepts of the course, but struggled on the code. Code is reserved for section, but some more time would have been helpful\r\nThis course was really good though for reading political science research and being able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different studies. I really feel I can evaluate methodology of research much better",
                "Could be good to do some more in depth explanations of research methods in section or in class",
                "The course relied very heavily on the professor's book. While this was very helpful for guiding our studies of quantitative research, I believe more attention could be paid to the principle topics of the course in practice.",
                "Not necessarily a strength or a weakness, but this class does focus almost exclusively on MIDA and the DeclareDesign R package, so it isn't the best if you are looking for a more generic intro to research design. It is, however, very useful if you are already on track to do your own quantitative research and need extra guidance.",
                "Strength: the class is taught based on the professor's book and he does a good job explaining the rationale. \r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes the class is repetitive from the book and the grading sets of the project set is problematic. It's based on a 3 point scale and getting a 3 is not lenient of any mistakes.",
                "Professor AC and TA are very patient and supportive. They always encourage questions and respond in time. \r\nThe course is always well organized. Although we have only 45 minutes every class, we make the best use of them without wasting time.",
                "Had quite the earning curve due to this course really pushed me build understanding about MIDA framework, very conceptual and applied but was looking forward to working with real data, somewhere that connect was missing"

                "As a non-Poli Sci PhD/MA student, this course was less relevant to me than I had hoped.

I was in the middle of designing a quantitative thesis when I took this class, and personally I found it very helpful and applicable. However, I think the material can get a bit dense and the workload is pretty high if you don't really need the course for research/applications. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as just a random elective or fifth class for someone vaguely interested in quantitative methods; but if you need a class like this or want to enhance your skills before taking on your own project, I'd definitely recommend it!",
