                "The topic is interesting, but the readings were often boring and unrelated so it was hard to have a cohesive class discussion every time. The standards for papers were higher than I'd encountered in previous history classes, and grading felt pretty harsh.",
                "Strengths: variety of sources and subtopics within the main topic for each class; diversity of writers and subjects that allowed everyone to see themselves represented in history and focused on underrepresented and marginalized people whose history is often ignored by other history classes; readings were manageable and not too long, but still informative\r\nWeaknesses: would have preferred more structured discussions and maybe notes from the professor before the readings so we knew what to focus on while reading; class presentation part of being a discussion leader was kind of weird/not explained well because we only had 10 minutes but a lot we were expected to cover, too much so for that amount of time; one day you could choose between several different readings, but there was still a discussion leader who only focused on one of the optional readings, so not everyone had read it; papers due on Sunday, which is a bad time, especially for those with weekend commitments or religious commitments that mean that they cant work over the weekend (like Shabbat)"

                "No, it was often boring and I didn't learn what I hoped to learn about women's labor history. There's so much labor history in New Haven that we didn't talk about at all. We didn't really get into the class-struggle elements of labor history, we just read academic articles about what happened. Class discussions were dry.",
                "If its something youre really interested in; otherwise you may find it to be overly focused on one theme in history. I definitely think everyone should take a history class that goes beyond the glossed over, romanticized version most of us get in high school, and that focuses on the histories of marginalized, oppressed, and overlooked peoples in the U.S. and the world, but there are others that are also available, so if labor history is not in your area of interest, there might be another class thats better for you."
