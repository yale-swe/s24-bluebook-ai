    "Partaking in this course exposed me to a vast array of laboratory skills. Despite having learned about some of the techniques in introductory biology courses, it was much different to actually perform them and learn how they are used in a practical setting. The course also helped me to learn about what work in a professional lab is like and helped me to refine my skills in terms of planning experiments and analyzing results.",

    "I think it would be great if we could have some feedback for the research proposal and grant proposal.",
    "I think that one thing that would be very helpful would be to have a meeting or email sent out during the semester prior to students taking the course (in the spring of Neuroscience majors' junior years) to help them understand how the course works and how to find a lab and plan their research. Many juniors are stressed because they don't know exactly what the course entails or how to go about doing this. Also, the course organization is rather flexible, which I think is necessary due to the range of research interests that different students pursue. However, I think that it allows some students to slack off while other students spend much more time in the lab and do much more of the work on their own. Any given student's experience is very dependent on the lab mentor they are paired up with. Overall, however, I have no major issues with the course.",
    "n\/a",
    "Not enough guidance from nsci faculty",
    "This is a great way to get immersed in actual research.",
    "I think this course would benefit from regular meetings within the major to discuss with other seniors.",
    "Flexible structure. However, the proposal and grant could have been better advertised and more guidance given."

However, I would tell other students who will be taking it in the future that it's a great opportunity to see how research is carried out and learn a wide array of laboratory skills. I found it to be very rewarding and exciting.",
