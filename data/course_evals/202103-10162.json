                "The lectures by JDRS were very well thought out and delivered in an engaging way. The homework enhanced understanding of the course material and the exams were fair. Prof. Macdonald is very proactive in providing assistance to students when working on the final project. He offered multiple office hours and was very responsive to emails. However, I felt that in terms of learning R, I did not learn as much as I hoped for mostly due to time constraints of the course.",
                "This course had a lot of notes and asynchronous instruction which were very helpful for review, but the instruction itself wasnt usually enough for me to fully grasp concepts on its own. The professors and TFs are really helpful though and there are lots of office hours to attend for when youre confused! Those are always immensely useful",
                "Strengths for 106: low-stress way to learn R, problem sets were fair, enjoyed the flexibility offered by final project",
                "It was nice that every class was recorded but that also made it harder for me to go to class.",
                "It moved extremely quickly during the first 8 weeks but the last 5 weeks were more manageable.",
                "I like how they split the course into 8 week sections and I also like the way they made online modules to follow along with.",
                "Strengths: working in groups for final project.\r\nWeakness: too many psets for the first half term.",

                "I really appreciated the recorded online lectures and the flexibility of ways to engage with the content. In order to improve my engagement with the class, I did all the homework assignments in R, in order to make sure I gained proficiency with the course material. I didn't like Minitab very much, and I think ideally R could replace it, though I understand not everyone shares my interest in writing code.",
