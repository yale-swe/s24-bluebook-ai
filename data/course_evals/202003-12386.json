                "I gained an understanding of 19th and 20th century German and French poetry. I learned how to identify ambiguities in the original texts, how to close-read passages, and how to interpret poetic form (such as in Mallarme's A Throw of the Dice and Apollinaire's The Little Car). More importantly, I learned about poets who defied conventions, including Holderlin, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Lautreamont, and Breton.",

                "I learned how to analyze poetry particularly by making comparisons between the original French and the translated English versions of the work, while also understanding the historical context and other literary influences of these mad poets, all of which enabled me to develop my ideas on the work in coherent essays written in French.",
                "This course taught us texts from the entire canon of French literature through the 19th and early 20th century, with some necessary German additions. I learnt the multiplicity of meanings that close reading can extract from a text, the power of using etymology, historiography, and mythology to exhaust a text's reading only to find multiplicities already formed at the bottom. Reading how madness shaped the poetry informed the diversity of riches that could be drawn.",

                "Strengths: Great syllabus, the lectures were well-composed and incorporated interactive elements which was nice.\r\nWeaknesses: It would be helpful to break the readings down per class and not on a weekly basis in the cases of readings where we could read half of the selection for one class and finish it for the other class",
                "Strengths: The course is very well organized -- the poets are introduced in a logical order and the class moves at a reasonable pace. Prof Connolly provides a rich background on each poet, which enhances my understanding of their poetry. In addition, every writing assignment was meaningful and fun to write because I could choose topics I was interested in. The system of submitting a draft first was especially helpful in improving my writing. Lastly, the broad range of poets covered in the class exposed me to a variety of ways poets could be \"mad\" and deepened my understanding of German and French poetry.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The labeling of the files in Canvas for each week was sometimes a bit confusing. I think it may be helpful to have a subfolder in each week for in-class material and a subfolder for additional material.",
                "I believe that the course is rather strong in its current form. If I had to name one aspect that could be subject to change is the potential inclusion of some female poets in future curriculums.",
                "I enjoyed the material of this course, but I wish lectures were a bit less focused on the writer's biography and more about the time period, specific literary\/artistic movements, and especially more about \"madness\" itself. It existed as a vague idea over the course, but I wanted to get more into what it means to be mad. That being said, the works selected were delightful to read and Professor Connolly's lectures were very informative and interesting.",
                "I think the greatest value of courses like these is the knowledge that is brought forth during the discussion sections, these smaller group talks allowed me to ask questions I had had about the information revealed during the lecture and develop my ideas for future essays, while also drawing connections to other literature and poetry courses.",
                "Professor Connolly's lectures were very clear and inspiring, often prompting me to write down his words verbatim. The assignments were very liberating, and gave us lots flexibility in the type of things we wanted to write about.",
                "Strengths- Good variety of fascinating poets and reasonable readings, Prof Connolly's passion and knowledge of the poets and the movements they inspired, engaging lecture and casual section, essay assignments also reasonable in their length\/requirements and tremendous flexibility in the topic allowing you to really explore what you want to research and write about\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Honestly no real weaknesses about the course itself. One inevitability for this kind of class is that students who don't know French and German have to rely on English translations of the works we read. As much as I gained a tremendous understanding and appreciation of these works, something is always lost when the poet's original work is redacted. Students who can read French and German avoid this loss.",
                "Strengths: professor Connolly was so knowledgeable and always made class engaging.",
                "Strengths - Prof Connolly's lectures were very interesting and awake the hidden madness inside us all \r\nWeaknesses - Did not receive that much feedback on my papers; a weakness seen by those who prefer structure in a course would be the lack of it in this one"

I learnt a lot and grew as a writer. I also got to practice my French in section which is nice as a native speaker.",
                "Yes, for sure!! Prof Connolly is fantastic and a very engaging lecturer. The mad poets covered in this class completely break free from conventional poetry, so it's very refreshing and exciting to analyze their works. By reading these \"mad\" poems, I was able to think deeper about elements of poetry (like ambiguities and poetic structures), which I have never considered before. I came out of the class as a much stronger writer. Overall, the class has been one of my favorites since coming to Yale, and it's a must-take for any comparative literature or English major!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who is interested in the given course topic. Despite having no prior experience in working with French poetry, I believe that this course was designed in a way that still allowed me to contribute to the group discussions.",
                "I would recommend this course if a student is looking to learn about poetry or how to write about poetry. I don't know if I would recommend the course to a student particularly interested in MADNESS, however, because the topic was not touched on as much.",
                "If you have an interest in poetry or study French and choose to be in the French section then I think there is a lot of vital information and knowledge to be found in a course like this and it will be very enjoyable, also many of the texts we read are fundamental to these fields and they should be on your reading list. On the other hand if you are on the fence and don't have any real interest in poetry or think that poetry is \"easy,\" then I would not recommend this course to you, simply because there is a great deal of reading, though not that much more than most other Yale courses.",
                "Definitely! For those in the French Major: what are you doing if you have not yet read Baudelaire, Mallarm, and Rimbaud. For everyone else: nary has a Frenchman with a soul not been profoundly shaken and then shaped by the poets  of the Second Empire and Third Republic. These poems are the cruel, delicious, salacious counterparts to prim and verdant English poetry, and the writing in this class draws from fields far beyond hermetic textual analysis.",
                "Absolutely, whether you only know English or are fluent in French and German, hardcore STEM major or literature major, this class is very rewarding and far from intimidating",
                "Yes! I great and approachable writing credit with really interesting lessons about history and literature.",
                "I definitely would recommend this course to another student!!!! Prof Connolly is an interesting character that I respect a lot. This is not your typical class which is why I loved it so much. Learning about mad poets entails being encouraged to be a bit mad yourself in your writing and analysis of the texts we read, which I am totally behind. It is also a great opportunity to read the works of fascinating German and French poets. (This class really piqued my interest in French poetry actually.)"
