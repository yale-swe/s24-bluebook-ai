                "Weaknesses: a lot of the material is super theoretical, feels unmotivated, and is covered way too fast. The exam content is a narrow subset of the material taught in class and lectures are not interesting.",
                "Strengths: excellent lectures (very entertaining), decent homeworks. Weaknesses: not really responsible for 90% of the material; easy to just sit in class and let everything flow over your head",
                "Strengths: psets were structured and focused, TAs were helpful. Weaknesses: lectures brushed past difficult math, could've had more OH availability.",
                "Too biological and mathematical for a computer science student",
                "This course presents a unique view into the topic of vision. The material moves very quickly, but it teaches many new useful bits of pure and applied math.",
                "Strengths: Covers very interesting topics and provides opportunities through problem sets to learn the topics in detail.\r\nWeaknesses: There is a lot of content that is discussed that is beyond the scope of the course. Besides, it is unclear to know which content is intended for undergrads and which is for grads.",
                "A lot of interesting CV topics covered at blistering pace but very easy assignments and midterm that only requires last-minute cramming.",
                "This course covers a lot of excellent topics which are at the core of biological and computational vision. However, there does not seem to be enough time to go through them thoroughly. The result is superficial understanding of a wide range of concepts",

                "No. Don't do it to yourself. If you want a science credit, take another class. This is not a computer vision class--it's a computational vision class. If you want to take this course for any reason other than being genuinely interested in the material you will suffer through lectures.",
                "I would not recommend this course. I liked Professor Zucker overall - he seems like a really nice guy and he made a real effort to connect with students and keep them engaged during lectures. However, I feel like this class is mostly comprised of lectures with a lot of complex math crammed in, without enough time to properly explain them. This ended up being pretty confusing and disengaging. I know most people take this class to get a CS elective that doubles as science credit, but I think there are much more engaging science credits out there.",
                "Only to a student who knows a lot of advanced math (fourier series, advanced linear algebra, etc.) and computer science; the prerequisites of MATH 120 and CPSC 112 listed on the site are a complete joke -- don't just take this for the gutty science credit, it's a lot more intense than it may seem",
                "This class is pretty cool! The professor has put a lot of craft into it and expects students to approach it with the mentality of a small seminar, so prepare for that. Problem sets were pretty simple and there weren't too many. Not having a final was also nice.",
                "I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject and has previous exposure to linear algebra, Python/MATLAB programming and working with image data. If not, I would not say it is an \"easy\" science credit if you are taking it for distributional requirements.",

The only exception is when we had to code k-means clustering algorithm by ourselves from scratch. That helped a lot.
