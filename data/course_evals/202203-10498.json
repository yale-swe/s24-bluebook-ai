Italian 130 also helped me to improve upon both my writing and speaking skills in the language, doing so by fostering an environment in which I felt confident, for it allowed me to practice the language without feeling embarrassed at any point. This course also introduced me to the cultural aspects which had originally drawn me to the language."

                "Strengths: in-class conversations in pairs, in-class writing activities (I would have liked to do more short  maybe 10-15 minute  temi that were corrected but not graded), and a truly wonderful professor!\r\nNo weaknesses per se, but I would say the language exchange should be optional. With a 6 hour time difference and partners who were doing the exchange just for fun it was usually very difficult to schedule meetings and it often felt like I had to be on call for my partner for multiple days because she continually cancelled and asked to reschedule. When I did meet with her the conversations were wonderful but it felt like a lot of added stress having to ensure that I met with her twice a month because there was a grade tied to it.",
                "This course was very useful because it covers the topics we were exposed to for a short time in L2, yet we were able to actually understand how to apply these concepts after L3.",
                "The strengths of this course are definitely in the conversations we have with classmates and I also love the presentations we do for class.",
                "The course is somewhat designed in a very repetitive structure, which can be fine, but I believe especially in a language course, itd be helpful if we could switch gears from time to time. We constantly did same kinds of grammar, vocabulary activities and tests, but I dont think we had the opportunity to actually use them. For instance, we could try to use the skills we cultivated in a real-life setting, such as writing an essay for a final project, which could be possible in L3 level.",
                "I thought the course was strong in all aspects. The use of the asynchronous day on Fridays allowed for exposure to Italian culture and a nice break at the end of the week that helped the learning to sink in. The variety of activities used in the class also helped to keep the learning fresh and reduce the amount of pressure and emphasis placed on any singular grade.",
                "I enjoyed the variety of activities and the emphasis on practicing spoken Italian in class. I also think the asynchronous days made the daily attendance manageable."

                "Yes! L3 was by far my favorite Italian course so far. It's really wonderful getting to see what you learned in L1 and L2 all start to come together  it definitely made me fall in love with the language.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who enjoy learning languages or students interested in learning about the rich history of Italy. I would not recommend this course to a student expecting to fulfill their language requirement with an easy class because it is not easy.",
                "I definitely would it was the perfect amount of homework to learn in class and in class we do so much to foster our understanding of the language and become better Italian speakers.",
                "I would if they would like to learn Italian. It is a pretty well organized course.",
                "Yes, of course. Based on professors alone, I have and will continue to recommend courses in the Italian department in general to other students. I haven't met a more approachable group of instructors at Yale. I imagine that most language courses, at least those of lower levels, are relatively similar in terms of structure and material within each language. Where some courses separate themselves, then, are in the professors. The Italian department in general has such professors."
