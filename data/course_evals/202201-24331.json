I did not identify any weaknesses in this course. Maybe the leniency with deadlines could have been stricter to help students avoid procrastination.",
                "Wonderful course! Showed women in power, felt very empowering. This side of history doesn't seem often discussed. Discussions were great thanks to the diversity of the class. No suggestions for improvement, really. Maybe if there were more males in the class?",

                "Strengths: very in-depth analysis of queens, interesting conversations\r\nWeaknesses: felt slightly rushed towards the end (maybe it would be helpful to put the first paper earlier on, so that the second paper can also be a bit earlier), sometimes I couldn't remember all the queens we talked about, so there could be more reinforcing of the material beyond the one class we talk about a particular queen then kind of do not revisit her",
                "Strengths of this course are the very engaging discussions and the structure which allowed both contemporary and historical perspectives of queens to be analyzed. Feedback on assignments were very helpful and gave direction to improve. The course itself had many strengths and little to no weaknesses across the board.",
                "I think the strengths were that the class was very small which made for good conversations and the only weakness is sometimes there was a lot of reading and it was difficult to get it all done",
                "Strength: groups discussions, interactive\r\n\r\nWeakness: only a few assignments so if one does poorly on one, it severely impacts their mark.",
                "Strengths: Engages the students a lot, we would be constantly talking to one another.\r\nWeaknesses: Repetitive conversations",

                "Very well taught , engaging, discussions were interesting and on good topics. What I loved most was mu professor continually asked questions in each class about what we thought. He obviously put lots of effort into making up all those questions for each class and I loved them and appreciated them."

This course really helped to see the similarities and differences between queen rulership. This was by far my favorite course at Yale so far and I would definitely take it again!",
