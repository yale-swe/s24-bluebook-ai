                "Strengths: The teacher is very nice and she's helpful with her assignments. Barely any written assignments.\r\nWeaknesses: Assigned at least 200 pages of reading a night and then picked a random reading to have a quiz on. Also, assigned a fifteen page group paper over zoom as the final project which was incredibly hard. Workload was not manageable and I couldn't read them to learn just had to read them to complete them.",
                "This is a great introduction to American politics if you have never had any sort of exposure at all because it moves VERY fast. You are not expected to memorize or learn every single thing covered in the textbooks, lectures, and readings, but knowing the general gist of it all is definitely essential to writing papers and actually understanding the course. Strengths: Professor Kinane is extremely kind, enthusiastic and loves to talk to her students, lectures in class go over textbook material and is very helpful in consolidating information. Weaknesses: course moves VERY fast",
                "Prof. Kinane is the biggest strength",
                "Strengths was that it's very well organized. However, it almost seems like there is too much material and reading for one semester, making it hard to focus on a singular topic or entirely learn.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kinane was the biggest strength. She was enthusiastic and engaging. This course is a good introduction to American politics if you have no background in the subject, though a lot of the material felt pretty familiar and we didn't go very in depth for a lot of it. The TAs were fantastic and provided very detailed feedback on essays. The course really is set up for students to succeed. Weaknesses: I would have liked to have talked more about contemporary political events in the US. Although it was nice to get an introduction to research in the field, the papers we read had predictable results and were not particularly engaging (apart from the ones we read in the last week which were very interesting). The workload was more than expected (often 100-150 pages\/week of textbook readings and research papers)",
                "This course was an interesting one. Professor Kinane is a really good and engaging lecturer, but I felt as if the discussions in the course weren't that strong--that was due to the zoom classroom experience. Focusing so much of the course during a zoom year on discussions made the seminars, at some times, feel dry. However, the discussions were sometimes interesting. Also, I feel like a lot of information is given to us in the course that isn't deeply explored or even tested. For example, we only had two big assignments: two essays and one short answer question packet. While we were tested on some of the topics, the majority were not revisited in other units, unless they had clear connections through the readings. Being more formally tested on the topics would allow us to retain the information better.",
                "Covers a lot of topics, good introductory course (but also means it doesn't go into much depth on each topic). Also, the final being a group project was definitely a weakness because group projects are rarely enjoyable",
                "Strengths: engaging, interesting content presented in a great way. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: perhaps it was the design of the course (or choosing the less experienced section), but some of the content seemed to be rather basic.",
                "Strengths: Very good slides, Professor Kinane was very energetic, and I thought my TA was very helpful\r\nWeaknesses: Too broad, often feels like an AP Government course; readings were often long and tedious",
                "I thought that the course was very well organized. The professor did a very good job splitting the course between her lecturing and our sections, and I found it very engaging. It was easy for me to speak up during the class and I felt that both she and the TAs strongly encouraged our learning.",
                "Course is very interactive and tailored in the best interest of learning.",
                "Loved smaller breakout room seminars, but discussions sessions couldve been more productive in small groups.",
                "Strengths - pace of the course was super conducive to learning material well. Not too fast! Weekly structure was also helpful with understanding how material builds and relates to the larger picture.",
                "Strengths: I liked all of the readings in the course, and the TAs were very helpful. Weaknesses: lectures were done by reading off of black and white slides, which was not always very engaging. Discussions were a bit too heavily moderated.",
                "The reading quizzes were a strength because they kept me accountable for work outside of class.  I would have liked to discuss current events more as they came up through the semester (like the new supreme court nomination and election) but the syllabus did not allow for much deviation."

                "Overall, the lectures and assignments worked great. Discussions weren't that great, and that was due to zoom. Focusing so much on the discussion was likely the culprit, but the switch in the structure after feedback during the midterm was awesome. Focusing on people choosing to participate, and having small discussion groups made it easier for others who usually didn't participate in the big discussion to have a place to participate with the TFs. Maybe having one day (Friday) be the only discussion day with it split 50\/50 between TF and the larger group would allow for better and more engaging discussions.",
