            "comments": [
                "The strength of this course is absolutely Professor Alex Wong's teaching! He is hands-down the best teacher I've had (for a non-seminar course). He is clearly passionate about the subject material, knowledgeable about the theoretical basics and the cutting-edge applications, and engages the class through questions and in-class coding (and he will learn your name, which certainly cannot be said about most lecture courses!). Another strength of the course is the material covered; it achieved a good depth and breadth. The only weakness of this class is that the exercises and assignments did not cover all course material, so I leave the course feeling weaker on the material I did not have the chance to practice. I believe the exercises were about every 1.5-2 weeks, but I would suggest having a short weekly exercise so material is constantly being reviewed and practiced.",
                "The exercises and assignments did a good job covering important aspects of the lecture, and the lecture slides were also well-organized. However, feedback was very delayed, especially for the first half of the semester.",
                "The course was structured very welleach concept built off of the previous concepts. I found that each assignment was very helpful in helping me make sure I knew each concept.",
                "The lectures work in a logical sequence, the coursework is fair and clearly outlined.",
                "Class was disorganized in some sense and the grading was very delayed without much feedback on the assignments",
                "Maybe some check-ins to ensure people understand the material well enough.",
                "The strengths are succinct and condensed lecture notes which are comprehensive and fairly concise (w/o unnecessary verbosity). There is great cohesion and clarity in the whole course.\r\n\r\nA weakness is probably the fact that this course doesn't require strong python experience, so some lectures are spent on working on quite simple exercises. But I guess to people who don't have a lot of experience with Python this is not a weakness.\r\n\r\nAnother weakness is that the assignments were graded a bit slowly.",
                "Strengths: I liked Professor Wong's lectures, and I thought he did a good job explaining the concepts. I liked that we started the exercises in class, and I thought the exercises and assignments were helpful in reinforcing my understanding of the content they covered.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we'd spent a bit more time on learning-based methods, because they seem to be the present and future of computer vision. Also, I think I would have learned the material more thoroughly if there had been more homework (maybe more coding, or maybe some pencil-and-paper exercises) and exams. As the course is structured, there were many topics with which I didn't have to engage very deeply. The exercises and assignments couldn't cover everything, and because we got so much guidance on them, you could almost complete them fully understanding all the content. At the end of the semester, it was a little difficult to motivate myself to pay attention to lectures about complex learning-based topics, because even though I found it really interesting and wanted to know more about it, I also knew I would never be assessed on my knowledge of it (since there was no final exam, and it wasn't part of my final project). I think this content could lend itself reasonably well to an exam, and that would have forced me to really engage with and understand everything.",
                "The course is very well designed -- the concepts are very interesting and the lectures are excellent.",
                "Strengths: Alex is a very engaging lecture! He is super nice and considerate! \r\nWeaknesses: The assignments designed are not very tightly associated with the concepts we learn in lecture, or rather, I do not feel like my knowledge about the topics was enhanced significantly after completing the assignments. In addition, personally, it was only when I started to do the final project that I felt I had truly grasped the baseline of computer vision. I think that the lecture materials are a bit disorganized.",
                "Relatively simple and straightforward concepts, covers most of the basic topics needed for CV. Might benefit from less interactive time between professor and students to speed up the pace.",
                "The course was good.",
                "Well structured curriculum.",
                "The professor is enthusiastic about teaching and the classes are very engaging. It would be helpful if there are forums to post questions.",
                "The course was very effective at teaching the concepts behind image processing techniques. The workload was very manageable, and the in class exercises and homeworks really helped solidify the concepts, though could be pretty confusing.",
                "Strength:\r\n\r\nWeekly exercises, biweekly assignments and a final project. These are great for gaining practical knowledge which is vital in an empirical field such as this.\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n\r\nI think the course will benefit from having graded examinations so that students are forced to study the material. This would definitely improve how they are able to recall the material two, five or ten years from now. \r\n\r\nIdeally, students should be doing this automatically, but from my personal experience, I'm not going to prioritize revising the course when I have 10 other things to do unless there is an official reason to do it. While this is unfortunate, it is not very unreasonable."

The PSETs do a good job of surveying most of these areas, though the final project definitely feels rushed towards the end of the semester and without any guardrails so I'd recommend you find a good partner to do the project with.",

                "I liked this class. We spent the majority of the class on classical, non-learning-based methods, and I thought it was cool to learn how much can be done without resorting to neural networks and very complex tools. The workload was very manageable, although at times I felt that the lack of work meant that I wasn't learning as deeply as I could have.",
