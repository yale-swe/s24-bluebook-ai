I learned about theory\/physics behind different acoustic phenomena, how different kinds of instruments (string, woodwind, brass, percussion, digital) produce sound, how to make basic models of these instruments (in the labs), fourier transforms, I could go on... I also gained a ton of practical skills such as learning how to make CAD designs in Onshape and how to 3D-print and laser cut using these designs, basics of electronic circuits and how to synthesize sound digitally (and how to code in teensy\/Arduino), and how to use the numerous tools in the CEID.",

                "I learned a lot about musical acoustics and basic acoustic physics, as well as some music theory, and the history of musical instrument design. In addition to the lectures, we also had weekly labs, which we spent building acoustic and digital instruments. Some lab projects include a 1-string ukelele, a recorder, a xylophone, and digital music via Arduino\/Teensy.",
                "In this course, I learned about musical waves and instrument designs. The first half consisted of lectures which taught the science and engineering strategies behind many common instruments. We also delved into electronic instruments and how you can use computer programs to synthesize common instrument sounds. In the second half we worked primarily individually in the lab to create our own instrument using electronic and acoustic resources within the CEID.",

                "I learned about scales, tuning an instrument, and how to calculate frequency and its relationship with length. I also learned about how to digitally produce sound using a breadboard and a Teensy controller. I learned what goes into designing an instrument from the planning to the actual design process. I also became very familiar with the CEID and the resources offered there such as laser cutting and 3D printing."

Totally doable but just requires a lot of patience and openness to catch up if you're not a STEM major\/musician, ideally during the lecture period before project work begins.\r\n\r\nStrengths: the instructors! Seriously, this is one of the greatest Yale courses I've taken all due to the dedication and commitment of Konrad and Larry. They will support you 100% and will spend as long is needed to help you with anything, especially during the project work period. I worked with them on my project constantly(!) outside of class and their patience and passion with teaching and helping us is unmatched.",
                "This is an excellent course!",
                "This course was great in that it provided students with the opportunity to pursue a personal project. It also kept students structured and focused on that project by allocating much of the courses time towards individual work. One weakness may be that the homework assignments \/ labs in the first half of the course were sometimes confusing and difficult to complete individually. They were, however, very interesting and relevant and prepared me for my own project at the end of the semester.",
                "Strengths of this course is everything besides the workload. The class is very friendly towards non-STEM majors and the material is very engaging. No week was uninteresting as we would apply what we learned in lecture in labs which even during COVID were fun and interactive. The professors are passionate and knowledgeable and the time I spent in the CEID was worth it as I would have never ventured to use the space without taking this class. The only weakness of the class is the workload and I think making that clearer could have made the experience more enjoyable, but even then the work is extremely rewarding."

In-person lab at the CEID, which is totally normal any other semester, was a blessing this semester--this was one of the only times I had to leave my home to go to class since almost everything was online and it was so refreshing to be in a large space with other people.",
                "The practices that succeeded were the in-person labs and the Kaptivo board. The Kaptivo board was very helpful in making the lectures easier to read because even though I could occasionally not see the white board, the Kaptivo board alleviated that problem. The in-person labs were very nice too even without being able to use the shop. I cannot think of what could be improved as communication through Canvas was also nice and lectures were even recorded in the off-chance that someone had to miss one."

                "Absolutely: one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Especially for musicians--this is YOUR course. Don't worry that it's a 300-level ENAS course, the course content is not too crazy in terms of math\/physics (though if you're into that, the instructors will be more than happy to go in depth with you on the physics-y side of things). You learn how to use the 3D-printers, laser cutter, and the rest of the CEID's tools (and you can always come back to the CEID to use these skills after the course!). Also just to mention how cool it is that you're making your own original instrument that you get to KEEP after the class--along with all the other instruments you make in the labs.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course. I entered this course with an interest in musical instruments and a desire to create something that I would actually use after the class ended. In the first half of the course I learned a lot of new information on how instruments work and on the possibilities of digital instruments. In the second half, I was given instruction and resources which guided me in my creation of my own novel instrument, which was super cool. You get out what you put in.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. So far, it is my favorite course that I have taken at Yale. The teachers are great, the material is interesting, and you get to actually make something instead of just learning constant theory.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. If they have an interest in music, this is the course for them and they do not even need to have that much prior music experience. If the student is prepared to take on the workload which is fairly heavy, then I would definitely recommend it as it was one of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Yale and one of my favorites."
