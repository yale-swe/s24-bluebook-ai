                "I loved the lab notebook format of the course. Because we didn't have to worry about writing lab reports, and we just had to write and draw observations as we followed the lab procedure, the class was very low stress. The course was also very independent - we were given a list of tasks to complete for each lab, and the order we completed them in was completely up to us. Casey was also very flexible about lab tasks. We were pretty much able to study or examine any specimen in lab however we wanted to, so long as we kept busy! I do think the quizzes were a weak point of the course - they were really difficult to study for, and always seemed to cover random material.",
                "Professor Dunn is extremely passionate and willing to talk about\/explain anything. This is a lab class where you can feel free to explore and have fun. The hardest part of the course was the evaluations and you really need to study in order to do well! I spent a lot of time memorizing. The TA, Namrata, was very helpful and approachable.",
                "The only weakness of the course might be that sometimes it was difficult to dissect organisms because of the lack of diagrams in some instructions, but that is more so a limitation of the information available to us"

                "Definitely, especially if you are taking it with the lecture--I can't imagine not having taken the lab because of how helpful it was for learning anatomy (and some behavior) of organisms we were learning about in class."
