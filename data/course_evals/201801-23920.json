   "comments": [
    "The primary readings for the class were excellent, and many of the secondary articles were well chosen. I think that Al-ghazali was treated with more depth than Maimonides, but that is understandable considering the expertise of Professor Griffel. Specifically, we might have talked more about the epistemology\/metaphysics behind the \"Guide of the Perplexed,\" perhaps comparing the Pines translation to others (such as Friedlander's) for more conceptual clarity. Otherwise, I thought the Professor did an excellent job working the class through very dense material every week."

    "I would definitely recommend this class. Prof. Griffel is a very effective teacher. Good feedback, able to lead good discussions, and the material itself is excellent.",
    "Yes, this course is very good and engaging as a seminar.",
    "I would completely recommend this course to another student! If you took DS, then \"Classical Arabic Philosophy\" received 1 short week of attention, and it is worth so much more than that. Al-Ghazali and Maimonides shaped the intellectual traditions of Islam and Judaism in ways that are philosophically brilliant and historically crucial. You will also receive an excellent understanding of the influence of Aristotle over the medieval period.",
    "YES! If you are interested in philosophy of the time, definitely take it! There material is intersting and there is no better person to take it with the Prof. Griffel."
