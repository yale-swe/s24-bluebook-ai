In-depth study of angular momentum, spin, the solution to the hydrogen atom and the energy corrections due to spin and relativistic interactions, a review of the variational method and nondegenerate and degenerate perturbation theory, introduction to the WKB method and the Dirac equation. Gaining familiarity with solution approaches common to all quantum mechanics problems.",

                "The course was excellent. Shankar is an excellent professor who provides all the resources necessary to succeed in his class.",
