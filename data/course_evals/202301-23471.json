                "Extension of concepts developed in the first semester of quantum mechanics. In-depth study of angular momentum, spin, the solution to the hydrogen atom and the energy corrections due to spin and relativistic interactions, a review of the variational method and nondegenerate and degenerate perturbation theory, introduction to the WKB method and the Dirac equation. Gaining familiarity with solution approaches common to all quantum mechanics problems.",

                "Good professor",

                "The course was excellent. Shankar is an excellent professor who provides all the resources necessary to succeed in his class.",
                "The course is very well structured, content builds logically and is in resonance with problem sets and exams. However, students coming from PHYS 439 will find a lot of overlap and review of topics already covered, especially in angular momentum, spin, and perturbation theory.",

                "Good course to take if you wish to study quantum mechanics at a high level. However, you must be prepared to put in the work for this course. The assignments from before spring break are time consuming, and took more than 10hrs per week to complete.",
                "The course is a well-paced and appropriately rigorous expansion of the quantum toolkit for any student of physics. For anyone studying solid-state, electronic, or optical systems, this course is an effective preparation.",
