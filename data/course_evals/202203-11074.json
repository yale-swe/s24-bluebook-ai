                "From the very beginning of the course, we learned very useful vocabulary. I was shocked when we learned how to talk about the contents of our cupboards and what we needed from the market in week 2. These are exactly the kinds of words I needed for interacting with friends. And these are exactly the words I wouldn't learn until after the first year in my Arabic classes. The course has a strong focus on art, which I thoroughly enjoyed. We often discussed paintings and music, and so we developed some specific language skills in these topics. By the end of L1, we were still only using single-verb sentences and stick primarily to just two verb tenses (past and present). Ezgi Hoca constantly told us to simplify our ideas, which is essential for beginner language learners.",
                "Present continuous tense, past tense, infinitives; interjections, question words, possessive constructions; genitive, dative, nominative, ablative (in certain constructions), locative, accusative; how talk about art, TV, my family, neighborhood, animals, locations, give directions and instructions, etc. Very comprehensive and theme based!"

            "comments": [
                "The course is extremely thoughtfully designed to be practical, engaging, and to meet the needs and pace of students. Ezgi hocam carefully plans each lesson to meet our needs (e.g., if the class is having a difficult time with grammar, we'll work on conjugating verbs or if the class needs practice using vocabulary words, we'll practice writing sentences in class). She also effectively makes the class a cultural and community-building experience, finding creative ways to bring her students together around fun events, like ebru painting, or documentary screening, or ancient text viewing. Each of these interactive sessions gives students more context for Turkish language and culture, and makes it even more fun to learn the language.",
                "The strength of the course was the breadth of vocabulary exposure. I particularly loved the role-play exercises, which have prepared me for daily life conversations. We listened to and read lots of Turkish content, even though we didn't always get into the nitty-gritty of every grammatical structure. While this immersive method definitely has many benefits and helped me improve comprehension, I think the relative absence of formal grammar instruction inhibited my ability to produce text/speech. I think more grammar worksheets and maybe a supplemental textbook could have been helpful alongside the more flexible classroom instruction.",
                "STRONG: small class size is amazing, professor attention to every student is unmatched, thematic learning makes it easy to know what to expect, incorporation of all types of media in instruction and homework, asynchronous class is on Wednesday, so many great community activities and opportunities, grading leniency, focus on communication over accuracy at first; WEAK: I wouldn't say it is a weakness, but I really would love some rote practice skills with grammar, translation from English into Turkish, and sentence building outside of class. Ezgi does a great job with giving us lots of speaking practice, but maybe giving us a reading to do for homework and then questions to answer in class (prepared answers in advance) would help us feel more confident with actually saying something substantive, given our lack of vocabulary. More writing exercises would also help us learn (or at least me), and I think we should really be handwriting our quizzes and tests (especially since I like to underline and be able to erase, and typing is much slower when the special characters are on the colon, comma, semicolon, and slash keys!). The only \"weak\" thing I would say is the unit on art, while very interesting, probably would have been better tailored to L5 or at least at a level that we could have a productive conversation with the new vocabulary - and at L1, I think we should be focusing on usable vocabulary. Some suggestions, summarized: give vocabulary and keywords for usage in class before class; more writing homework assignments or in-class (without dictionary) exercises; drilling grammar individually (graded hw assignments, mini-quizzes in class for retention and application); more reading comprehensions and reading out-loud exercises (it is really hard to do impromptu speaking exercises when we're not sure what vocabulary to use); handwriting homework and at least quizzes, if not tests (I understand the environmental concern, but I really think it is [scientifically proven as well] beneficial to handwrite and see the mistakes with our eyes on paper); and perhaps more relevant themes, but this one depends on the demand of the class. Overall, Ezgi did a phenomenal job."

She is clearly passionate about her language and culture, and it makes her students even more engaged in what she is teaching and sharing with us. It's also an incredible way to build a community of other people who are interested in the Turkish language and culture.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in or personal relationships to the peoples, languages, and cultures of Anatolia and Central Asia. Even after L1, I feel like I am able to interact with so much non-fiction/fiction Turkish media and I can now speak with Turkish-speaking friends on a more intimate level.",
                "Yes absolutely! I love Ezgi :) She's the kindest, nicest, most understanding professor and human I have ever met and I so appreciate her generosity and approach to teaching. Unmatched by any other professor at this university and more people should 15000% take this class. Although I do appreciate that there were only 4 people in it!"
