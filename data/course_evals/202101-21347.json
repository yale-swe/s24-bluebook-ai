                "This class was an in depth advanced E&M class. It reviewed electro and magento statics although I never really feel like I was comfortable with those topics to begin with so it gave some background there, AC circuits and time varying fields, transmission lines, plane waves, waveguides, and some antenna stuff at the very end. I think if you have a brain for physics you may actually get a lot from this class; however, struggle as I do with physics concepts, you might end up feeling like this is more of a survey... you've seen the equations for a broad range of E&M topics but are comfortable with very few of them. \r\nDefinitely a course built around maxwell's equations!",

                "My biggest qualm with this class was that it was very centered around physics majors or physics backgrounds despite being a required course for the ABET EE degree (with a population of EE students dominating other majors). That means we sped quickly through \"basic\" E&M topics and often glossed over foundational information but spent a lot of time on things like deriving expressions for certain circuit elements or the like. It's tough because I think the class was actually very well taught and very well organized (and fair for the most part), it's just a little too lofty for EEs who have minimal physics background. I often felt like I was too confused or too unaware of the context of the lecture to ask effective questions. This was a common feeling amongst EEs I think. \r\nI think the only solutions are giving the EEs more physics background before the course or pairing down the course topics a little so we can go slower through some of the basics.",
                "This course moves very fast and the resources available for help in it are limited.",
                "I thought that it was very challenging in a virtual environment, and there was a lot of material which we could have engaged with more deeply.  The hardest part of the class was the homework because I don't feel like the lectures or reading would adequately prepare us for the homework problems.  Often times, the homework led to more confusion, rather than more clarity.",
                "I wish it focused more on applications like antennas. I also wish there were more real problems with numbers instead of theoretical derivations of equations.",
                "This course was extremely mathematical and rigorous, but there really is no other way to teach the material. I think that the class could have moved a little slower - I often felt like I was just racing to copy down equations as they were written, and would have to try and understand them later. The homework was good practice for exams, and was usually harder than stuff we covered in class, so that it really reinforced material.",
                "Strength - The physics build on each topic, so if you truly understand the foundations (Maxwell equations) then everything else will eventually make sense (i.e. don't have to \"memorize\" lots of data)\r\n\r\nWeakness - Only six psets, due to scheduling limitations, and I felt we did not really practice all the topics in problem solving. (There are plenty of examples in the Griffiths textbook though, so I could rely on that)",
                "Strengths: the strong community created by the class. We worked long hours together on psets and preparing for exams, and it really made the class special\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no office hours with professor Schoelkopf, only 2 hours a week with the TA, Yanni. The class moves really quickly so if you don't have a really solid physics\/ee background it can be hard to keep up",
                "Strengths: in-depth coverage of material\r\nWeaknesses: The workload, especially for this semester, dismissed how difficult this semester was for students. We covered an excess of material, which bled into \"break days.\" The priority was therefore given to finishing the initial predicted coursework rather than giving students enough time to absorb or even learn the material."

Unfortunately we missed a number of in person demonstrations that are normally a part of the course, but sometimes they were supplemented with videos or good descriptions. However, there's nothing quite like sitting alone in your dorm hearing about how cool a demonstration is, and then not being able to see it live since we weren't in a classroom..... that was no fun to hear. However, the lectures were fine to take remotely, and the notes were solid.",

                "I personally just despise physics and was taking this class in order to finish my major. The course really was as horrible as I expected but to no fault of the prof or course organization in general  just due to my own ineptitude on this subject, COVID preventing in person classes, and my senioritis. \r\nMy stance is this: Rob seems to be a good lecturer, his psets and tests are killer but honestly what's new, the topics covered seem like they are important if you want to be an E&M physicist or if you love E&M as a topic. If you are one of those people then sure go for it, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with this class. \r\nIf you didn't like intro physics but you are thinking that maybe this class will spark your love of physics I would say just save yourself the misery. If you are an EE taking this in your senior spring as a requirement, RIP.",

In the beginning of the course, we cover about a lecture per day. This was quite overwhelming, especially during the pandemic. It is a thorough review of E&M, but packed into way too short a time."
