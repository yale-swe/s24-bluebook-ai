    "The intellectual ideas about, in favor of, and against the important political philosophy of liberalism.",
    "I gained an extensive history of Liberalism and the historical environment from which it arose and evolved in.",
    "Great background and intro to intellectual history.  You read a lot of very cool authors, some obscure others mainstream.  Your views will definitely be challenged which also makes class interesting.",
    "I learned a lot about the history and substance of liberal thought.\r\nIt also really helped me to think through my own position on various issues",
    "A deeper understanding of politics, ideology, and liberalism itself, an idea we so often take for granted",
    "How to think critically about liberalism.",
    "I had never previously studied theory (in general) prior to this seminar. I learned how to think critically about different arguments relating to liberalism and liberal thought, especially how to get to the crux of an argument. Also really was challenged to develop articulating my own thoughts regarding the readings during seminar discussion.",
    "This class offered fantastic insight into the topic of liberalism, understanding the sources and misconceptions of the topic in a seminar-style, debate-led class.",
    "I left the class with more questions than answers, but the class allowed me to solidify my political ideology through readings and discussions of great texts.",
    "a breadth of political philosophy, literature, theory. A surprising range of texts to think about liberalism as an idea.",
    "This class is an impressive overview of the main ideas, debates, and ideological revolutions behind liberalism. The course includes texts going back to the early modern period and covers the genesis of ideas about natural rights, political reform, etc."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very good class, prof., readings, seminars... Its quite history-oriented for a poli sci. class. I might treat the readings more like arguments to be challenged\/validated and less like trends and sentiments.",
    "Strengths: Mordechai, readings.  Weaknesses: not much background information is provided for some of the readings.  This isn't a problem per se, but you may have to read up on some obscure debates in British history.",
    "I was the only university (non-college) student here, I was really impressed by their level of engagement with the class\r\nIt was very discussion-based, I prefer lectures but it was a good class nonetheless.",
    "STRENGTHS: Mordechai is amazing and leads the best Yale seminar I have ever been in. Bar none. WEAKNESSES: I did not receive any feedback on my essays or reading responses, which would've been nice. But this is a small weakness. This class is amazing.",
    "The course really helped improve critical thinking and forced us to challenge many common assumptions made about liberalism.",
    "Absolutely great course in terms of seminar dynamic. Everyone put a lot of effort and thought into the readings and discussion was always lively. No drawbacks, really strong course.",
    "This course had some fantastic discussions!",
    "The strengths in this course are absolutely the readings, which are engaging and fascinating. However, it is very difficult to get feedback on your performance in the class grade-wise.",
    "Great discussions and selections of readings. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
    "Very compelling syllabus and trajectory, great, moderated classroom discussions.",
    "One huge strength of this course is the way discussions are structured. They will be heavily based on the readings, but always with the objective of answering larger questions and prompt reflection on the overarching themes of the class. Prof. Levy-Eichel masterfully leads the class, and will prompt certain questions but also largely let the class explore what it wants to.\r\n\r\nI can think of no weaknesses."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, examining the ideas discussed in the class is necessary to properly examining how they influenced the world we live in in ways we take for granted.",
    "If the student is interested in the current political paradigm then this is the course for them. For someone not used to Political Science classes, this course is challenging and you may need to do some research outside of the readings or talk to the professor during office hours.",
    "yes",
    "100% Take it to understand why you believe what you believe, or, to understand why we should be skeptical of liberalism. This class is amazing for liberals, conservatives, and radicals alike! Mordechai teaches you a new way of thinking about politics.",
    "Yes; it is a fantastic course.",
    "Take it! Professor Levy Eichel will seriously cater to your needs as a student. I was very inexperienced with theory previously, and I could tell that he was invested in helping each and every one of us along the way and understanding that we were at different points with our undertaking of the material. I also think this class really is crucial to take given the current political climate and Yale's community.",
    "Absolutely! This was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to someone who isn't too concerned about knowing every aspect of their grades!",
    "Yes! I have never seen students be as engaged as in this class. The course material is an interesting combination of political theory, intellectual history, and English history that I would recommend to any humanities major.",
    "I would recommend this to any student interested in having their beliefs challenge. Mordechai facilitates discussion in such a way that challenges classical interpretations of texts discussed, and allows for greater nuance.",
    "Yes, Mordechai is a professor who genuinely welcomes intellectual learning, and this course, by its title, demands the kind of complexity and unexpected methods that he proposes.",
    "Yes! Whatever your major may be, thinking about how some of the most influential ideas behind our current political systems came about is essential."
