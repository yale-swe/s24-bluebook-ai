                "I learned more about Russia's tactics to manipulate elections in Europe and the US, and how social media makes us vulnerable to misinformation and a weakened democracy.",
                "I gained a deeper understanding of information warfare and Russian intelligence tactics and began to think critically about societal structures which make democracies weak to disinformation",
                "I learned about the strategies that outside countries have used to intentionally spread misinformation and exploit internal issues to divide and conquer the U.S. media. I also learned about the recent trends in American social life and the concept of social capital.",
                "I learned so much in this class! I learned how to examine news outlets and their susceptibility to disinformation as well as the psychological effects their reporting has on its audience. I learned about the history of disinformation, Russian vs. Societ Union active measures, the use of social media in disinformation campaigns, the psychology of disinformation, social capital, disinformation in US elections, and so much more.",
                "I learned a lot about Russian disinformation, social capital, and the nature and psychology of disinformation.",
                "By taking this course, I was able to fully immerse myself in the incredibly vast Russian disinformation sphere that has existed since the hayday of the USSR. It was both infuriating and interesting to see just how developed Russian disinformation is, and how America's systematic and enshrined practices lend to, what seem like, unavoidable vulnerabilities. Professor Rangappa was well-versed in the information at hand, and her perspective as a former FBI employee proved to make the course incredibly nuanced. I think one of the most interesting take-aways from this course will be how to critically evaluate the media that I consume on a day-to-day basis, and how to avoid falling pray to Russian disinformation campaigns within the confines of the United States  I might even be able to convince a couple relatives to take a look at the media bias chart and change their views about what media they consume as well! Before taking this course, I had absolutely NO idea how serious of a threat Russia was to American democracy, but after taking this course, I will keep a keen eye on U.S. relations with Russia in light of Russia's not-so-hidden attempts to weaken our (Americans) collective ties to one another!",
                "I learned so much about Russian disinformation operations, and the ways in which they engage in informational warfare. Additionally, Professor Rangappa incorporated  formal sociology, psychology, and political science theory to make sense of the course material.",
                "I learned so much about the importance of bridge-building both within and beyond the digital environment and its links to democracy. I now view this sphere from a whole new perspective and honestly have a new angle with which to take my further career.",
                "Knowledge on the 2016 presidential election, Russian active measures, how social media affects our cognitive vulnerabilities, and more!"

            "comments": [
                "The readings were particularly engaging for this class. The structure of discussion where three breakout groups discuss different questions then reconvene could be changed. I felt disincentivized to participate until my groups question came up.",
                "The discussion-based structure of the class helped me see different perspectives from my own and I think this played a big part in my engagement in the class.",
                "The homework prepared us well for class discussions and for providing us with different aspects of disinformation: its history, the psychology behind disinformation, comparisons between Soviet and Russian disinformation, and more. The class was very structured around discussion questions, and I wish that it had less structure during the class so that we could talk about the aspects of the homework that really interested us.",
                "Strengths: I think it goes without saying that the most tangible strength of this course is the teaching staff  both Professor Rangappa and Miss Aghekyan were knowledgeable, engaged, and incredibly welcoming to student participation and learning. They made this course applicable, relevant, and interesting enough to students who (like myself) aren't involved in the Global Affairs major/program at Yale. The course's discussion format was both interesting and well-carried-out on a virtual platform like Zoom, and the ability to access discussion questions before class made the course more nuanced and less general. I also think that the media bubble analyses were a low-stakes way to improve your grade in the course, and also critically evaluate our media consumption habits! The readings were mostly interesting, and I thought that the midterm and final essays were quite interesting to write about! Overall, this was a fantastic course. \r\nWeaknesses: Though the weaknesses for this course were minor, I will note them in an effort to further improve the course. I think the most noticeable weakness of this course was the participation requirement and grade that you received after ever class. While I understand the importance of engaging with the material and discussion, it felt like inserting a requirement to participate during class lended itself to speaking for the sake of speaking, so to say. Everyone was nervous about receiving a good grade for participation, so there was definitely pressure to speak even if you really had nothing new or relevant to say. That was minor, but I definitely felt that pressure throughout the course. Maybe inserting a weekly (instead of daily) participation requirement would be better, that way, contributions are meaningful and not based on fear of getting a poor participation grade. Secondly, I think that some of the readings (especially government documents/reports) were unnecessarily lengthy and repetitive with respect to other readings. Lastly, I think that, while the discussion format of the course was really interesting, I would have also benefitted from a lecture-ish aspect mixed into the course. Though the lecture videos were super interesting, I think that some combination of lecture and discussion would have been super interesting! However, that might just be my preference for lectures over seminars sneaking in. Regardless, I think that the course was incredibly strong!",
                "The strengths of the course are the organization, the breadth of material that Professor Rangappa provides, and the experience and knowledge Prof. Rangappa brings to the course. I think one weakness is that sometimes our class discussions lacked good flow, and felt surface-level at times. Additionally, I personally would have preferred if the prerecorded lectures had been recorded fresh for this summer, rather than recordings of old class sessions.",
                "There is a lot of work in this course, but it was worth it. The readings and writing assignments really meld together, and it was adapted well to the COVID format. The final paper was a lot for this timeframe but was very valuable.",
                "Amazing teacher, and TA! Really really interesting material. Only weakness was the fact it happened during a pandemic -- I would've loved to do this seminar in person."

                "Absolutely. Professor Rangappa is extremely knowledgeable and always picked readings that were long but definitely worth the read. She also talked about her own experience with disinformation and brought in a guest speaker who specializes in disinformation and how to use the psychology of disinformation (i.e. cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias, in-group vs out-group, etc) in real-world settings. This class was so fascinating, and probably one of my favorite political science classes I've taken at Yale.",

Just be aware that all of the material revolves around Russian disinformation, and not much attention is put on other nations disinformation tactics. That said, I think this course was extremely well-taught, and the grading is more catered to student learning rather than harsh-eyes on performance. I think this course is a low-stakes way to get involved in learning about Russian disinformation, especially from such a knowledgeable and amazing professor!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. One of the things I loved about the course was that the material felt incredibly timely and relevant, especially given what took place during the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. I also appreciated the sociology and psychology theory that was incorporated into the course to supplement the course material.",
