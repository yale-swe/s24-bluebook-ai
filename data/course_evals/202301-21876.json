This was a great class today concurrently with the lecture section, and the labs really reinforced the information.",
                "Development of critical thinking to extrapolate knowledge of ancient ecology from the limited data provided in the fossil record",

                "The materials you get to handle in this course are incredible; there are few other opportunities in life to see and touch the things you do in this lab. Doing things hands-on really helps you get a better sense of the lecture material. At times labs can feel like they're dragging on, and you usually feel pretty spent at the end of the session, but that's what you get with a three-hour-long lab. If anything, the design makes the three hours go by faster than they otherwise would. It's great having unstructured time within that three hours to talk to the professor; that may be where I learned the most. These guys really are incredible and it's nice being able to talk to them about anything paleontological or otherwise.",
                "The first section of the lab (the first couple labs) were quite difficult. It was hard to answer a lot of the questions with zero geology/paleontology background. By the end of the lab, I felt much stronger in my knowledge of fossils, and was therefore much more confident in completing the lab questions. I really enjoyed the variety of fossils we had the chance to examine (Yales collections are awesome!), though sometimes labs could run a little long.",
                "Strengths: Very cool subject material and the teachers were generally good.\r\nWeaknesses: kind of grueling and long. I spent more hours in class each week for this half credit than I did for any of my full-credit classes this semester.\r\n\r\nWould appreciate some more direction and hands-on instruction from the professors than just being handed the specimens and lab sheets and being told to go for it."
