                "Knowledge of Dickinson's whole oeuvre, more appreciation for poetry in general, improved ability to close-read",
                "an absolutely awesome class. Studying Dickinson reaffirmed and magnified her magnificence to me, gave me important skills in poetic analysis, and also gave me greater insight into myself. Over the semester, I grew so much in my ability to analyze poetry and how to write a paper on my analysis of a poem. I remember feeling totally at a loss at the beginning of the class, fearful of approaching poetry and poking her the wrong way. I ended up learning so much from Dickinson, Riley Soles, and the others in the seminar, and now feel much more confident and excited at the prospect of opening up the hefty book of Dickinson poems to any page and reading.",

                "Strengths: Professor Soles is the true strength of this course. He is super knowledgable and knows how to create a great classroom culture. There is a reason so many people in our class are repeat students of Soles. His classes are always excellent and this one certainly did not disappoint. We really got to the heart of Dickinson and her poetry. Assignments weren't too heavy and the final project (a commentary on what Emily Dickinson we made contact with throughout our semester) is super interesting! We also took a wonderful field trip to Emily Dickinson's house and got to really see more of her life up close.",
                "The strengths of this course lie in its discussions, online and in person. Each week, I loved finding new nuances in my favorite poemsor in poems I had not yet readalongside classmates with whom I grew close. The trip to Dickinson's house in Amherst was absolutely fantastic as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none.",
                "Strengths: super engaging, great reading selection, organized really well and in a unique way, great creative final project opportunity, productive environment to read poetry\r\nImprovements: none :) this class was amazing",
                "lack of structure \r\nawesome professor",
                "I thought our in class discussions were wonderful and Professor Soles is a fabulous teacher. We never had enough time to get through everything, which is pretty typical of a Humanities seminar, but I would rather focus in depth on one poem per week than read several that did not get discussed at all.",
                "Strengths: Riley Soles is such an enthusiastic, kind, energetic teacher! The Amherst field trip component of the course was amazing and shows how devoted Riley is to his students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Riley has a tendency to call on the same students every time, leading us to have somewhat the same conversation every week. I think we should have used more secondary sources, both formal criticism and contemporary poets to add variety to the course. By the end of the course, the conversations were getting very repetitive.",
                "Strengths: Professor Soles is infectiously enthusiastic about poetry. This class is worth taking just to go to his office hours settings. Also, reading through Dickinson's poetry has been a genuinely transformative experience.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The actual seminar sessions felt unguided at times. This was partly because other students would take the conversation in different directions than I personally wanted to go (which is obviously going to happen in any seminar, especially one of this size), but I felt that discussions could have been more productive in general if we went in with more of a prompt than \"Let's discuss this poem today.\"",
                "all strengths, no weaknesses here",
                "Discussions were engaging and interesting and fun. It was clear which poems I should prioritize reading each week, which helped me manage my work. The essays were reasonable and valuable. I appreciated the flexibility of the final project. Small 5-minute breaks in the middle of the 2-hour seminar would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: Professor Soles is fantastic. If you want a Dead Poets Society English teacher, he's it. Animated, incisive, inspiring and inspired. He's great at giving everyone a chance to speak while still directing the class toward more fruitful discussion. The class itself is set up in a way where you only discuss one or two poems a week. As someone who usually blazes through whole books during seminars, this was an awesome change of pace, and it allowed us to truly relish every line. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Reading every Emily Dickinson poem is not only a tall order but frustratingfor a poet who is so cryptic, you can't really get much out of skimming. Soles does, however, give the class 15-20 poems to focus on each week. I wound up abandoning the directive to \"read everything\" and focused on those poems, which was both more enjoyable and manageable.",
                "Strengths: compelling course content (and compelling presentation to pair!), excellent student engagement, and opportunities to independently reach exciting and novel conclusions.\r\nWeaknesses: a few too many students (not everyone was always engaged, and often you could only speak a few times throughout the 2 hour duration of class)",
                "This class was phenomenal. Professor Soles passion for the material and skill to lead a class to a new realization about a piece was a joy to be a part of. While I loved diving deep into the work, I do wish that we had prioritized getting through a few more of the poems each class meeting, since it was only once a week. Also, while I appreciated the emphasis on Dickinsons work, I would have liked a more readings to understand the context of her life. Also, a further emphasis on the mechanics of her poetry would have been appreciated, such as a detailed understanding of the poetic strategies that she was employing. Overall, this class expanded the way that I think about poetry and the world, and I look forward to the next time I get to take a class with Professor Soles."

The analysis of our poems each week never felt ungrounded or surface level; rather our professor pushed the class towards dramatic conclusions at each weekly seminar meeting. The poems themselves are the greatest America has ever procured, and are worthwhile on their own, let alone the wonderful group of people I had the opportunity to study with.",
                "YES YES YES",
                "Absolutely. Anybody who loves close reading and is interesting in Dickinson's poetry should take this course. And everyone should take a course with Soles. He's brilliant, a deep thinker, and Yale is lucky to have him",
                "YES",
                "Yes! If you have any interest in Dickinson, this is a wonderful course. I feel like I have a much broader understanding of her poetry and also feel more confident reading and analyzing poetry in general.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who loves Emily Dickinson and wants more familiarity with her poetry in particular. However, I did not find it to be the most rigorous course I've ever taken. I would not recommend it to someone who wants to learn more about poetics itself, etc.",
                "Yes. For Professor Soles' teaching and for exposure to Dickinson, it's definitely a worthwhile class.",
                "Totally. Dickinson was an absolutely amazing poet to study, and Riley Soles is an absolutely amazing professor to learn from. He's a great presenter and cares about his students and their education so wholeheartedly. He's the kind of prof you almost want to gatekeep but know you need to share with the world- for real, take him if you can.",
                "Yes!! Professor Soles is a great professor. Studying Emily Dickinson with Prof. Soles was a lot of fun, in part because Soles is great, and in large part because Dickinson was such an amazing poet. Her poems are short but rich, condensed.",
                "Definitely! Emily Dickinson is a brilliant poet, and this class allows you to slow down and read her poetry closely (which is the best way to do it). Professor Soles is a gem, the workload is very manageable, and the class periods are frequently illuminating. The creative project at the end is a bonus.",
                "Yes! Professor Soles is a wonderful professor and designed this course to allow for students to take control of what we wanted to learn this semester",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Not only is Professor Soles a great teacher and extremely passionate and knowledgable about the subject matter, but I think partaking in a course in which we had the freedom to interact with Dickinson in our own unique way, while still participating in a rigorous and collaborative environment was an incredibly valuable experience.",
                "Definitely! As long as one is committed to an open mind and heart. There's a lot of Dickinson, obviously, so it's not for the faint of heart, but it's also suitable for beginners and those already well acquainted with Dickinson alike. This is an imaginative enterprise that I think everyone should endeavor in.",
