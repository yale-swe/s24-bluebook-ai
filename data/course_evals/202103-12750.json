                "Honestly, for the amount of time I put into this class and the amount of stress it caused, I got very little out of it. I can't intelligently talk about quantum mechanics or understand it in relation to current events or new technology which is the one thing I was hoping to get out of the class.",
                "Basics of quantum mechanics, also learned more about different algebraic/differential equation methods. Because this topic is so different from any other I've studied, it really forced me to think in a new way.",

Mathematical skills, such as work with operators and Dirac notation were also a feature of the course",
                "As expected from the course title, we learned the basics of quantum mechanics: Schrodinger's equation, solving 1D problems (particle in a box, free particle, harmonic oscillator, etc.), some mathematical formalism (Hilbert space), solving 3D problems (hydrogen atom, etc.), spin and angular momentum, identical particles, perturbation theory, variational principle. \r\n\r\nThroughout the course there's many types of problem solving strategies that I personally have not seen, in relation to solving differential equations, making good approximations, abusing dimensional analysis, etc.",
                "I learned the basics of quantum",
                "Fundamentals of quantum mechanics, basic one-particle and two-particle systems, quantum mechanics in three dimensions, quantum angular momentum and spin, the hydrogen atom, beginnings of perturbation theory. Understanding of the real origins and reasons for quantum-mechanical effects often popularized without a proper explanation, e.g. quantization of observables, random measurement results, Pauli exclusion, superposition, Heisenberg's uncertainty. Strengthening and application of mathematical skills for working with partial differential equations and linear algebra."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Amazing professor, amazing TA, clear communication, well structured, lots of office hours, emphasis on questions, emphasis on why we are doing the things that we are doing  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: after the second half of the semester, it became much much harder and faster",
                "Sohrab is a pretty great lecturer. He has organized the course in a coherent way and the topics were presented logically. Although the lectures sometimes got into the weeds of proofs and math, he provided clear lecture notes that you could refer to to follow the topics easier. These, when combined with the INCREDIBLE Griffits textbook, made the concepts easy to digest if you put the effort into understanding. Overall, the course was tough, but plenty of resources are provided to be successful. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness I would think of is that sometimes I didn't get the full physical/philosophical implications of the content. I understood \"how\" to do it but not exactly \"what\" it was. But this seems to be a common theme across most intro QM classes, I suppose you need to know how something works before you can figure out what it means.",
                "I can't think of any big improvements, I thought the course was well organized. I liked the reading quizzes they kept me on track with reading the textbook but were not too stressful. Also, posting the lecture notes before class was very helpful. With them I could take some notes while still having time to think about what was being said in class. I felt like the material sometimes was tricky and moved fast but the amount of office hours was very nice.",
                "The PSETs didn't prepare you for the exam and were really long and hard. You'd do the readings but then get slapped in the face by twice-weekly reading quizzes that you still couldn't answer easily so those should be gotten rid of altogether. A lot of time in lecture was devoted to answering questions which might have been great for the one or two people that had questions, but they were usually not super related or outside the scope of the lecture/class so that could've been saved for after class or office hours and we could have gotten more lecture in/left 30 mins early.",
                "Strength: professor ismail-beigi was very good at explaining concepts and at providing alternate explanations when we were confused. The textbook and lecture notes were helpful, as well as the course recordings. Additionally, the office hours were very helpful.  Another strength of Prof. Ismail-Beigi was that he often tied what we were learning in class to real experiments, to make the applications clear. He was very obviously super passionate and excited about the topic too, which helps make the class more interesting. \r\n\r\nWeakness/improve: this course could be improved by having more support/office hours throughout the semester. Towards the end, another office hour was added, which was helpful but that would have been good to have from the beginning. Or an additional one from the professor. Additionally, I think having more practice with exam-type problem earlier than a week before the exam would be helpful, as they are quite different from the pset problems.",
                "I think the pace is fine, but the lectures can be hard to follow.",
                "Strengths: organization, accountability through low-stakes reading quizzes, many office hours, two exams both weighed equally, comprehensive PSETS \r\nWeaknesses: exams packed a lot in a little time. though the material was understandable, i could never finish, the lectures could be a little unclear but providing the lecture slides beforehand really helped in preparation",
                "Strengths: A lot of interesting material is covered, and it's done so at a depth that makes you at least contemplate the material instead of just grasping at general ideas. There's also many examples that help ground the theory in concrete terms-why it's important, why it's used, and so on. The homeworks are very reasonable as well. The exams also emphasize conceptual understanding of the material over knowing how to do raw calculation / memorize problems from the homework, which is also a plus. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not really any in terms of the class itself. Although I don't think the book, Griffiths, was that good. Fortunately there are plenty of other textbooks out there to learn from.",
                "It was extremely difficult, but I realize that is just the nature of the material. I felt the grading was a bit harsh.",
                "The course is very well structured, proceeds in a logical manner, and problem sets are very helpful in unpacking lecture material and allowing for ample practice. Tight coordination of lectures with the textbook is very helpful for review, and the pre-lecture quizzes are also very helpful by ensuring students have some idea of where the lecture is headed in advance. I appreciated that more specific applications of quantum theory, like perturbation theory and the variational principle, were covered, as they demonstrated the significance of the theory."

But if you're looking at taking this class, you probably already do. If you have the option to take it with Sohrab, absolutely do. He cares about your engagement and understanding.",

                "This class should only be taken if required. It took up so much of my time, more than any other class this semester. Each class has required reading quizzes and while only half count, you'll still spend an hour or two trying to get a perfect score. Even if you've done the readings you probably won't get it right the first time around and most of the semester the quizzes had issues so you couldn't see if you got a problem right or not. Many of the PSETs are extremely long (think 4hrs on a single problem and you have 6-7 problems) and they weren't anything like the exams. I was honestly confused why we spent so much time doing problems (especially finding the mean of wavefunction problems) when the exams had completely different styles of questions. Unless you've taken Quantum before or you have to take this class for your major, stay away!",
                "yes, I would! it is extremely challenging and moves quickly. The problem sets and exams are difficult and really push you to see if you fully understand the material, but if you keep up with it as much as you can, you will learn so much and gain a ton from this course.",
                "Yes, if required. It's a good introduction to QM. But I think you need to put in a lot of your own effort.",
                "This is a pretty good intro to quantum class that helps with learning mathematical skills you might need in upper-level physics",
