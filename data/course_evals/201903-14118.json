    "I learned about apes and how they are different and similar to humans and monkeys. We went into various topics such as culture, communication, locomotion, diet, habitat, the last common ancestor, etc.",
    "I learned about the evolutionary history of humans and other primates.",
    "I learned a lot about the evolution of non-human primates as it relates back to human activity- a lot of general, across the board knowledge. I developed some good text analysis skills. It was a good fifth class- low workload, and Prof is really passionate. Everything is very manageable.",
    "Social science writing",
    "I learned about non-human primate physiology, mental capacity, social structures, tool use, behavior... the list goes on.\r\nI also learned about evolutionary theory, and was exposed to several different research perspectives.",
    "I learned relationships between apes and humans that I never knew existed, and insights into the human mind that would not have been possible without an ape model.",
    "this class taught me about the ways that our nonhuman ancestors can teach us about our evolutionary past as well as our current society, culture and behavior."

   "comments": [
    "The strength is that all if Professor Watts is very knowledgeable about anything related to apes. A weakness is that the lecture isn't very engaging if you're not super interested in the topic.",
    "I like that the focus of this class is learning and not memorization. I was able to explore topics that I'm particularly interested in in all the assignments, which made the work more enjoyable. I think there should be clearer feedback on assignments, though.",
    "I really enjoyed the lecture style with small class setting making it easy to ask questions and interact with the professor.",
    "Strengths: Good lectures, Manageable workload (2 papers + term paper)\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures can drone on for a long time, easy to sit back and be unengaged",
    "It's interesting and I very much enjoyed the lectures, but it's a bit disorganized at times. I wish that there had been a little more guidance concerning the papers, particularly the term paper.",
    "Excellent course for those interested in the subject, Professor Watts is very comprehensive in the material he teaches and is great at answering questions. It is a bit boring at times when we go into the details on research studies and physiology.",
    "I liked the evaluation style, which was based on all papers (no exams). Lectures were interesting and readings were appropriate \r\n\r\nHowever, I think that there could have been more clear guidelines for the final paper.",
    "this class was well taught and interesting. however, i thought that the lectures were somewhat monotonous. given the small size of the class, a higher level of student participation and discussion would have added to my level of interest and engagement with the material. additionally, the readings were very dense and scientific jargon-heavy, making understanding them difficult for someone without a background in these fields."

   "comments": [
    "Yes if you want an extra class and want to learn about apes.",
    "Absolutely, the professor was great and very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The material was very interesting. I feel that I learned a lot about evolution and the methods we use to study it.",
    "Yes! Such a good, chill fifth class. You learn a lot in a low-pressure setting, and the material is interesting.",
    "It's very interesting, and I found lecture very enjoyable, but if you're someone who doesn't like to operate very independently, it may not be the class for you.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone seeking social science credit, and is also interested in anthropology.",
    "Yes! Professor Watts is an expert in the field and has lots of knowledge and personal experience to share. Even non-anthropology students have something to gain from this course. As a cognitive science major, I learned so much more about the human mind than would have been possible without this class.",
    "i found that his class was a great and interesting class, but that it did not connect to anything else i learned here in a significant way. i would recommend it to someone looking to understand humans place relative to other primates, without too much work",
    "David watts cares so much about this topic and his passion shows in his teaching. Although sometimes a little dry, generally interesting and light workload."
