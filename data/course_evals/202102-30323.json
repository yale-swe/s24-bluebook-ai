I now have adopted a new way of thinking about our different perceptual experiences since I applied one of these theories to my own experiences and identifies with it. This course provided new information for me and was an enriching experience since it made me think deep and analyze the situations in order to understand what a certain theory was saying. This course taught me how to analyze and construct arguments, taught me different perspectives and how to write and understand fully the philosophical texts.",
                "I learned how to write Philosophical essays and how to assess arguments. In addition to that, analyzing these arguments for their soundness and validity is something I learned. I also learned more about college courses in general and what the expectations in college will be like and how the classes in general are. I also learned more about other peoples points of view and opinions and how they can differ from my own.",

                "The strengths of this course are the texts which were very interesting, these included smart and interesting philosophers whoa adapted different views and helped us counter evaluate some and adapt others. Also, Ms. Schroeder was of marvelous help, she was always open to questions and would always being class discussing the texts and clarifying them, she would also provide handouts that helped us understand things better and fully, and very good feedback in all of the assignments we did in class. I believe that a slight weakness this court might have is the complexity and diverse opinions and perceptions, since it is very compressed and includes a different view nearly every class, however, although this was a slight obstacle, Ms. Schroeder eliminated the risk of us not comprehending something and was very clear in explanations and helped us understand fully what we were reading.",
                "One of the strengths was definitely all the reading we were provided. I really enjoyed reading all these different essays we were provided and reading different points of view from different philosophers helped me widen my knowledge and form my own opinion about Hallucination, Perception, and Illusion. Something that could be improved is making the worksheets with different options, so students can decide what they want to work on and how they want to work on it.",

                "Yes, I would really recommend this class to any other student since it is an enriching experience where one learns to read philosophical texts and understand them. I believe that everyone must understand these different ways and problems of perception and learn to asses it and apply it to their lives and their own experiences of perception. I believe that anyone interested in courses of philosophy should take this.",
                "I would definitely recommend other people to take this. At first, I was a bit worried about taking this course, because I never took Philosophy before and I thought I will not be able to keep up. But you did not need to have any prior knowledge of philosophy and it was very interesting to learn about something I have never learned before. If you never had the opportunity to learn about Philosophy, this course is a great chance to understand the basic concepts of Philosophy and form your own opinion about it. I think taking this course is a great insight into philosophy and college classes in general.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are willing to challenge themselves and who are strong academically in understanding hard concepts, since the course is fast-paced but intellectually stimulating."
