Funnily enough, we never are able to fully answer the question of how to tell the truth, however we learn different techniques on how to best weed out falsehoods and uphold truth. Learned how to write essays - strong emphasis on writing a thesis, and strong topic sentences. Our biggest project was the 10 page research paper which was a wonderful experience due to Prof. Rileys guidance and workshops with yale librarians.",

The material was interesting, while at some times long, but I did all come together very nicely with themes of the class. The essay writing process was spaced out and enough time and help was offered to truly succeed."

The books we read were awesome and I have been recommending them to friends and family. The beauty of this class is that it exposes you to the awesome English program at Yale, while also learning interesting topics. If you need a writing credit, or even are just interested in epistemology - take this class!!!",
