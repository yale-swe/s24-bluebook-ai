Scheduled one-on-one meetings with professor proved to be the most rewarding as it provided an opportunity to flesh out ideas and further engage in topics discussed during class. \r\nWeakness: Class discussions could be difficult to facilitate with more \"philosophical\" topics that are hard to grasp/communicate. It might help to summarize readings together or go over certain ideas that we found confusing for every reading at the beginning of class (concrete examples/visualization through chalkboard diagrams was very helpful)",
                "Strengths: in-depth exploration of the field of art theory and criticism; students had some flexibility with what they chose to explore in their writing and were individually guided based on their areas of interest. Weaknesses: multiple changes in syllabus; occasional lack of structure in discussions."
