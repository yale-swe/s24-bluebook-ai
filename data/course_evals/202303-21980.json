The papers that were selected were interesting. The instructors did a good job.\r\n\r\nI wished some of the Tuesday lectures were a bit more closely tailored to the corresponding papers. I didn't like the policy of randomly calling on people to present figures. It's anxiety inducing. The reading guides were a bit too long.",
                "Strength: Ben makes the class a very open environment where people can ask for clarification on topics.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think it should be more formal with 2 lectures and a separate hour discussion for the papers. The discussion for the paper should have more structure and guidelines made before the presentation. Students who do not follow the guidelines should need to redo the presentation",
                "Great preparation for presenting scientific works.",
                "Strength: good explanation from the lecturer; strong involvement of the class; helpful discussion along learning. \r\n\r\nWeakness: few feedbacks from the lecturer and TA. Submitted assignments and weekly report to the class but received not enough feedback."
