                "Theres no hope for this class. Every student was doing other things as the professor just rambled on class after class.",
                "Strengths: light workload, more discussion based, which brings up tons of innovative thoughts. It improves your writing as well in the sense that \"every word counts.\" The professor also gives grammar lessons and writing reviews. Chill course tbh. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the discussions become background information checks which feel off track, and sometimes topics become repetitive. Also too few writing assignments so each one weighs a lot.",
                "Its only strength is that Yale still offers this course despite all of its weaknesses.",
                "I think a seminar like set up would be better for this course rather than the lecture like structure used this year. I felt that it would be a bit more effective to be a part of the conversation rather than listening to the professor rant for an hour.",
                "Strengths \r\n- an introduction to some cool and important (but old) papers about whether computers can be conscious\r\n- forces you to be very deliberate about your writing, even though the assignments are short - a good exercise\r\n- exposure to interesting & controversial opinions about computers, the mind, and consciousness, if that's your thing\r\n- writing credit!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses \r\n- in the entire course we covered about 3 (short) papers total, despite having 75 minute lectures twice a week - very slow pace and sometimes it feels like you're listening to the same lecture over and over\r\n- very low student engagement, maybe 4-5 out of 25-30 students ever spoke? if you sit in the back you can watch a lot of people play wordle\r\n- you're required to write your papers based on the 1978 edition of Elements of Style, so to get a good grade, you'll have to write in a somewhat unintuitive and outdated way. for example, Prof Gelernter only accepts \"he\/him\/his\" when you write about a person of unidentified gender, \"they\" or \"he\/she\" are considered wrong"

                "Yes. Literally chill course. Every essay is basically 150 word paragraph and only so few of them. Plus it generates so many cool insights into the field of artificial intelligence and makes me realize the flaws in the frameworks of current AI models.",
                "No, we spent very little class time preparing to write out the assignments and the classes were not entirely related to what we were writing about every time.",
                "Nope, not if I liked them. If you are looking for an easy B in a course just to complete your writing distributional, this is the course for you.",
                "The workload isn't that bad so if you need a writing credit it is a good option however the feedback you receive for assignments isn't that helpful so I can't say that you would be improving your writing that much.",
                "If you're interested in the material and want a relatively easy writing credit (AND if you're willing to put a lot of time and effort into writing as concisely as possible for the 150-300 word assignments) this class isn't a bad choice."
