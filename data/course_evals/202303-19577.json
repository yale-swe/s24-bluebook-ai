                "This class taught me how to understand myself as a reading being. More than just being another reader in a larger tradition, I gained practice reflecting on reading within particular locations, times, and states of mind. It is hard to leave the class not understanding oneself as a \"student\" and realizing how strange that experience truly is.",
                "Foremost, this course gave me a literary foundation to understanding sovereignty as a concept that is intellectual, emotional, and environmental. Professor Andrews also helped me develop the literary interpretive skills to understand Indigenous literature in both its form and content, and also skills of intention to connect myself to my environment through the embodied act of reading.",
                "This course fostered an understanding of embodied reading and writing and the ways in which our environments shape our experiences with literature. Through this, I developed skills in descriptive and analytical writing as well as in building an Indigenous framework for analysis in various forms of Indigenous literatures."

                "Strengths: Contemporary scholarly articles connected to more traditional readings give insight into the dynamics of budding academic traditions. Readings are entertaining and interesting. Active discussions facilitated by the professor that REALLY push understanding of texts beyond our first read before class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: With contemporary scholarship, not all texts from this class feel irreplaceable.",
                "A strength of this course was the intimacy and trust---I'd argue even sovereignty---that was developed and strengthened by the end of the course. The design of this course in the order of readings and topics discussed allowed for a gradual and intentional development of relationships between classmates and Professor Andrews, which really allowed me to intentionally connect with others about the content and analysis of the readings. A weakness of the course is perhaps the ratio of activities to discussion---I think some activities, especially during weeks with more dense readings, could be abbreviated to get through the readings.",
                "I appreciated the various ways provided to engage with class material, as well as the variety in form and perspective in the class material itself."

                "I could not recommend a course more - such a welcoming and warm environment that made space for SO much learning but in the most joyful, consensual way",
                "I would recommend the class to anyone seeking to understand themselves in relation to the text. The class excels with driving you to read intentionally and rediscover a love for reading that vanished during high school. All the while, you get to engage with content that is hard to find at Yale, even in other Native and Indigenous subjects on campus.",
                "I would recommend this course only to students with an existing commitment to Native and Indigenous studies because this course requires rigor on an intellectual, environmental, but ultimately a personal level. The reading journals encourage and require a level of dedication to yourself as a vessel of connection to the University, your native homelands, and Indigenous literature, that I think will be most meaningful for someone with a commitment to Native and Indigenous studies.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to other students. This course fostered meaningful conversation on how we impact Indigenous literatures, and how Indigenous Literatures impact us. I was exposed to many incredible Indigenous writers and artists and given a healthy, engaging, and safe space for discussions. Of the courses Ive taken at Yale, this is one of my favorites."
