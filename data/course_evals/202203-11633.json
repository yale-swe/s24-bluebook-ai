                "i didnt know anything abt human evolution before taking this course so i learned a lot!",
                "Some insight into human evolution and recent discussions in evolutionary biology about the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis.",
                "I learned of the evolution of hominids, ranging back to hundreds of thousands of years ago. A lot of the overarching myths that were present in the field were contested by this class and thankfully dispelled. I also learned of human culture, from language to rituals to music.",
                "true interdisciplinary thinking and learning! an engagement with the study of evolution--particularly what it means to be human, and if its possible to even pinpoint an origin to our long history of being \/ becoming",
                "Culture and Human Evolution was a great class. Many may be tempted to take it thinking that it is an easy \"gut\" science course. It is not. It is the exposition of Professor Tomlinson's original ideas and combines a diverse range of topics including semiotics, evolutionary biology, historical linguistics, and natural philosophy. The assignments are very short papers, ranging between three and five pages, but I found these to be valuable exercises in summarizing and condensing lots of dense material, which is a valuable skill. Professor Tomlinson successfully demonstrates that the study of the development of human culture -- over the past hundreds of thousands and indeed millions of years -- is an endeavor that scientists and humanists must pursue together.",
                "I learned about the central question and different ways to approach answering it.",
                "I now know how cool archeology is as a field of study, and can have a lot of in depth conversations on how language and humans evolved over the course of around 500k years. I also learned a lot more about evolutionary biology than I thought I would learn before this moment.",

                "Strengths: really interesting content, Tomlinson is extremely well versed in so many areas of study. Wonderful synthesis of lots of disparate ideas. Really well taught. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: overemphasis on semiology, which is somewhat impenetrable to those unfamiliar with it. Interesting content, but perhaps don't need it to be such a focus of the course.",
                "Strength - the readings were very interesting, Tomlinson knows a lot, so has a lot of fascinating information to share. \r\nWeakness - the structure of the class did not promote actually doing the readings. Even if you did do them, that effort would not be rewarded, because Tomlinson would talk the whole time. So often, it was not worth it to do the readings, even if they would have been interesting.",
                "Strengths - Professor Tomlinson is extremely knowledgeable, and his lectures are engaging. However, the class, while it is set up like a seminar, tended to bleed into lecture format a bit too much. I would have loved the classroom itself to have a different setup and to have more student prompts before class, like having students present readings once a semester.",
                "its super interesting, but its taught more like a lecture than a seminar so sometimes it felt really long.",
                "Strengths: the professor was realllly good at making classes engaging and interesting. the topics were fascinating, and there was a good blend of humanities and science.\r\nWeaknesses: could probably benefit from having a little more student involvement in class rather than the class being dominated by the professor talking.",
                "The major strength of this course was the discussion format, 2 hours once a week. Such a long period gave us enough time to really dive into the readings and everyone came to class prepared. The way that Dr. Tomlinson directed the discussions was perfect for the class size that we had and made me feel as if I could participate without needing to speak extemporaneously at great length. \r\n\r\nThe only improvement I can suggest is that the assigned readings changed a lot, sometimes just a few days before we were due to discuss them in class. It would have been helpful if they had been fixed in advance so that I could plan out my time better.",
                "The lectures were absolutely mind blowing. At times the readings could be a little dull but all in all everything was great. Perfect amount of assignments as well.",
                "I cannot identify many weaknesses in this course. It was, in practice, more of a \"leminar\" than a seminar, but I did not mind this as many of the concepts did require extra elaboration anyway.",
                "- I loved the passion Professor Tomlinson brought each day to class - and to the topics!\r\n- I wish there was more visual learning",
                "I think the course felt more like a lecture that was over 2 hours rather than a seminar discussion, I think there needed to be a way to prove that everyone was engaged, like potentially a reading response, and also allowing for a break. Being in the course at a certain point my brain just turned off after sitting down without a break for a long time. I think it really was necessary to have more in-class discussion. I think that would have been more engaging for us to learn as students.",
                "Strengths: Interesting topics sometimes\r\nWeaknesses: Vague paper assignments, syllabus has absolutely no information on grading or assignments, class environment is framed to be seminar-like but only allows discussion that does not seriously challenge the views of the professor",
                "Thes major strength of this course is that the professor is extremely passionate about the subject matter and has such a basis of knowledge on it. The major weakness of the course is that the professor's lectures can be difficult to follow, making for a difficult class for someone new to the subject matter."

                "Yes, absolutely. One of the best Yale courses I've taken, especially if you have a tolerance for philosophy.",

                "I would, but do not take this class if you are looking for an easy distributional requirement. You will have to think hard and engage with the material. If you're up for it, however, it can be a rewarding experience.",
                "yes, but it isnt really a gut. papers are short but pretty difficult if you dont have a science background, but prof tomlinson was always around to answer questions or talk things over.",
                "Not really. This course is much more like a lecture than a seminar, so if you are looking for a discussion, this probably isn't the class for you. Many of the readings seemed to go over many of the students' heads. I found the grading criteria for essays to be opaque and heavily dependent on Professor Tomlinson's personal structural preferences. It also seemed that the class didn't adequately engage with critiques of the racism historically present in the fields of evolutionary biology, archaeology, etc. That said, the class had a relatively low workload (three <5-page papers) and is probably a decent science credit for humanities students and humanities credit for STEM students.",
                "Yes!! It was super cool, one of my favorite classes so far. Professor Tomlinson especially makes it special.",
                "I absolutely recommend this course to anyone who has even a passing interest in the subject material! Dr. Tomlinson is fantastic and the course is structured very well so that you build up your knowledge of human evolution and human culture slowly but securely. This was one of my favorite courses which I have taken at Yale, and the 2-hour discussion format is a great way to discuss the readings and learn about the topic of the week.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Even though Im not a STEM major, I think having a foundational knowledge of human and cultural evolution is still very important!",
                "absolutely--if anything, to be able to have experience with the kind of questions and the form of evaluative writing Professor Tomlinson bases the class on~",
                "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to students in both the humanities and natural sciences. Thinking across a range of disciplines as highlighted above is a valuable exercise.",
                "Yes if the class structure is improved (more slideshows and visual learning)",
                "Yeah! I would warn them that it does have a lot of science heavy information at the beginning of the course, and later on would become more humanities based because I was not aware that we would spend half the course talking about biology. With the readings, it felt like another iteration of the biology sequence at times. I think it was fun, but definitely needed either fewer readings or a greater amount of discussion in class to be very engaging.",
                "Absolutely not. I consider myself to be a rather calm person, but this class brought me dangerously close to the level of fury only ever reached when I was dumped during finals week last year. The first few weeks of the class function as an intellectual indoctrination into the professor's preferred evolutionary theory, the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis as opposed to the Modern Synthesis. The first two classes or so are feigned as a collaborative effort to debate the two theories and reach a conclusion together, but the ending will always be the same. This class operates under the lens of the EES, and no amount of valid rebuttal will change that. You will be dragged along into a semester's worth of reading, papers, and discussions all engineered to bolster a theory you never got the choice to believe in. Giving us the illusion of choice and intellectual discussion put a bad taste in my mouth right from the start. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the semester was more digestible since we moved away from theory for the most part. Readings were interesting sometimes. Other times they were about theoretical archaeology and performance theory. Oftentimes I wondered to myself \"what is the point? why is this even an issue?\" with the \"this\" being whether the archaeology is better defined as the performance of doing archaeology or the study of artifacts in the archives.\r\n\r\nThe papers are another gripe I have with this course. They're short, thankfully, with the first two being 3-4 pages and the final paper being 4-5 pages. But the prompts are incredibly vague, and to this day I still don't understand my feedback. Feedback consists of lots of red strikethroughs that replace words and phrases with synonymous words and phrases. It feels like you're being graded on the extend to which you write in Professor Tomlinson's voice. The only good feedback I got was when I regurgitated the things he said in class. The assignments occupy an odd space, being largely about topics in evolutionary study but requiring the humanities-style prose of a music professor.\r\n\r\nI couldn't tell you how other students felt about the course, because each 2-hour class turned into Professor Tomlinson's personal echo chamber \/ fan club as the semester went on. Never have I felt so outcasted in an academic environment. Perhaps it is because I am not a humanities major, so I am unfamiliar with the flattery and factiousness required to succeed in the classroom, but it was jarring to say the least.",
