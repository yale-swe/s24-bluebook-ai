                "I developed a strong foundation of modern French novels and how to best approach them. Moreover, the course was structured in such a way that we were exposed to a great variety of modern literature, and I now feel confident to tackle any modern French book I would like to read. I also appreciated the emphasis placed on language and how these authors wrote--Professor Cadieu cultivated strong close reading skills in us!",
                "My writing in French greatly improved in this course, as well as my general ability to think critically about French literature. I learned a lot about the current French literature scene, such as the role of autofiction and what media sources cover la rentre littraire. There were also many opportunities to advance my oral expression in class discussions."

                "This course is taught a bit like a high school English class, with clear structure and expected responses from the students. I would have liked a more socratic approach to the conversation, allowing for students to voice their ideas without trying to predict what answers the professor was looking for.",
                "The class discussions and writing assignments were innovative and engaging. The readings are doable in the week we get to complete them and the essays aren't too strenuous.",
                "I really liked the structure of the course! I liked most of the things we read and the discussions were really interesting. Overall, it was well organized, and there was consistent and thorough feedback. There were a couple of weeks where the reading felt like a lot, but that might just be hard to avoid.",
                "Strengths- engaging, Professor Cadieu is very smart and kind and fosters a wonderful learning environment, you develop a strong sense of modern French literature \r\n\r\nI personally do not see any weaknesses. On a personal note, I do prefer to read books in the entirety as opposed to sections, but I can see the benefit of reading books in sections in order to be exposed to a greater variety of literature",
                "A strength of this course was the style of written assignments which allowed for more creativity than most traditional literature response essays. I had a lot of fun working on each assignment for this class (such as rewriting a passage from one text in the style of a different author and then analyzing the choices made) which made the work so much more enjoyable. Our class discussions were also always very engaging and thoughtful which was quite a feat in a two hour seminar format. The texts we read weren't always my favorite (extremely experimental), so don't enter the course thinking that just because these are modern novels they will be easy to understand (they won't)."

                "If a student is interested in modern French literature and the intricacies of writing, I would wholeheartedly recommend this course! Professor Cadieu will transform the way you approach modern French literature",
                "Yes, if you are interested in improving your French and are interested in French literature. Professor Cadieu is fantastic. My only issue was this course is, since it was only once a week, it was easy for me to become disengaged. I frequently walked into class having done approximately 5-10% of the reading, and, judging by the awkward silences in class, I wasn't the only one. If you do the reading, however, class becomes extremely rewarding and exciting. I still really loved this class.",
                "Yes! It was a super fun class and was geared towards student improvement. If you showed signs of putting in effort towards applying feedback and thinking critically, it will be rewarded."
