The relatively low workload but great amount of learned information is also great. The readings are complex, but Professor Tazudeen presents them in a very approachable and understandable manner. You really learn how to write better in this course as well. Professor Tazudeen is also one of, if not the, greatest professors at Yale. He will go over drafts with you on an individual basis and really help you grow as a writer.",

                "Was a very fun course that made me think about music and sound in a completely new way. There was quite a loose structure to the class but I really enjoyed that aspect.\r\nReceived great feedback that really helped me to improve my writing.",
                "I think the course is great. I wouldnt really change anything except adding another reading or two for my section.",
                "This course had very interesting discussions about global sound and its relevance in all sorts of contexts, and did a great job of integrating that into writing teaching and assignments. I felt that occasionally the class felt a little unfocused, like sometimes we didn't get to the main point of the class until a while into it, but that's my only little complaint. I'm also just not really a writing person.",

                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. This course is excellent both on its own and as a writing credit. I really loved the format of this class. Professor Tazudeen places significant emphasis on discussion during this seminar which is amazing. I had never taken a class at Yale where I had the opportunity to talk and express my view on things so often. The course material itself is also very interesting and forces you to look at music in a way you likely never have before. The workload for the course is also relatively low in my opinion. Doing all of the readings only takes a couple of hours a week, and the four writing assignments are given to you well in advance so time management is easy. The last two assignments allow you to explore areas of interest. Lastly, with hard work, it is very possible to get an A in this course.",

                "Yes! If you're looking for a writing course and are interested in music, this is a fantastic choice, it is always great to learn about music from cultures you are less familiar with as well!",
