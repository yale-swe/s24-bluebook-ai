                "Strengths: unique opportunity to take on an applied project for a client (we worked for the UNHCR and Alight), chance to work with an incredible professor (Jenna wrote a book related to the research we were doing and was an incredible mentor throughout the entire process). The Capstone also challenged me to think more deeply about what kinds of policy and initiatives are genuinely feasible in an international aid context, and pushed us to home in on what the central issues were within protracted refugee situations and how to communicate proposed solutions. \r\nWeaknesses: the course should have come with more initial training in methodology, such as how to conduct interviews and how to set up a survey. This prep work could have been facilitated through training sessions by the Jackson Institute, and started over the summer or very early on in the fall semester. Part of this prep could involve bringing in graduate students who have worked on similar research and learning best practices from them."

It was a unique opportunity to take academic interest in foreign policy and development and apply it in a real-world setting."
