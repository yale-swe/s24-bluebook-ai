                "I learned a lot about the history of S.E. Europe and the culture in the region, and got to do through through interesting readings, lectures, and I think most importantly, the excursions and self explorationgetting to interact with others, see the cities and sites, see how life is structured in the various places we went to (e.g. with food, work, city layout, types of stores, everything). It was really engaging and interesting! I also will say, the way the history lectures are structured are so so illuminating! I initially wondered whether all the segments of history would fit together (since we covered so many periods), but they absolutely intertwineit is so so hard to understand even some of the most recent history without really taking in the full picture! So amazing!\r\n\r\nThe course is an amazing starting place for all this history and getting a cultural framework that enhances this historical learningeach segment has so much deep history to dive into!",
                "Enrolling in this course provided me with a fresh perspective on Southeastern Europe, a region I had limited familiarity with. The class delved into a comprehensive history of the Balkans, spanning from the Illyrians and Ottomans to the Yugoslav Banates to Communist Yugoslavia. The readings were notably intriguing as they dispelled many prevalent misconceptions and myths surrounding the Balkans.",

                "The course was really great in the way it combined historical context with excursions so we could see the history and culture of Croatia and Bosnia as parts of S.E. Europe. It really enhanced what we were learning. And It was so so so cool to get to see some of the many sights and relics that we talked about about in class out in real life (e.g. we saw impacts of Ottoman influence in Bosnia with the mosques and markets, and architecture). And it was soooo cool to get to see influences from all periods (e.g. Roman ruins, seeing Dubrovnik and its Mediterranean state old town and museums, art museums, seeing one of the archives). And I loved the amount of free time we got to explore and do a little bit of historical digging our selves. Was phenomenal, and I liked how the responses were geared towards allowing us to combine and synthesize these two experiences together.",
                "This course's notable strength lies in its immersive nature, allowing for immediate real-world application of learned concepts. The excursions, both relaxing and enlightening, provide valuable insights into local cultures and contribute to a richer understanding. The course effectively exposes students to the vibrant culture and diverse cuisine of Croatia and Bosnia. However, a weakness in the class was that the final paper felt a bit rushed and lacked clear, detailed guidelines. Additionally, I wish we would have spent more time covering the sociology of the course in learning more about the sociological perspective of the region outside of genocide.",
                "The course offered a wide variety of strengths, particularly stemming from the weekly excursions and the instructor! The class learned an incredible amount about Croatia's history, from ancient to modern, by interacting with the region's people and its historical and cultural sites while on these excursions.",

The lecture schedule is chill, we get the whole afternoon free, and we usually use the afternoon to go to the beach, walk around old city, explore nearby cities, etc. After the program, you can really call yourself a local of Dubrovnik because of the free time. The lectures are also very comprehensive, giving an overall view on the Balkans, while also presenting many details for you to follow up on if u=interested. The excursions are definitely the highlight of the program. We get to go to different islands to experience different food, culture, and see different artifacts, while also having a lot of free time. Definitely one of by best Yale experiences.",
                "Absolutely!!! Amazing course! Allows you to learn and appreciate the developments in S.E. Europe, which are often overlooked but central and important in understanding the region and how various historical players all interacted (e.g. Romans, Byzantines, Hapsbergs, Ragusa, Venice, Ottomans, Communists, Yugoslavia all were in the region and played left influences), and it was sooo soooo amazing to get to see life in S.E. Europe in the present, get to go on excursions that supplemented our knowledge with time to see museums, swim, see life in the region. So so wonderful! And at the same time you have so much time to enjoy Dubrovnik and Bosnia on your own and with friends who are on the trip! Perfect balance of work and exploration and free time!",

The professors do a great job explaining the region and exposing you to the culture. It is a great opportunity to explore a lesser-known yet captivating region, fostering a deeper understanding that is both enriching and interesting.",
