                "I learnt a lot about the biological processes in the ocean and how those governor the greater ecosystem of the oceans with different habitats playing different key roles",
                "Learned about how the oceans work physically, and how that connected to the biology of the oceans. This includes coral reefs fisheries management, how ocean processes (currents, temperature, latitude, etc) influence primary production and therefore productivity of the oceans.\r\n\r\nI learned so much in this class, and it was incredibly interesting. Sometimes you think, \"Why do tropical reefs have so much diversity?\" or \"Why are some parts of the ocean stagnant yet others have booming fisheries with tons of tuna and other commercial fish?\" This course answered my questions and provided so much more insight in my everyday life as I think about oceans, fly over oceans, and think about fish and the ecosystem.",
                "In EVST 400 I learned the biological, physical, and chemical processes of the ocean. We learned about systems that influence the ocean as well as the impact of the ocean on other systems. The class took a global scope to synthesize our understanding of oceanic processes. We were able to examine phytoplankton blooms virtually from the sound and also learn about the anchoveta-sardine regimes off the coast of Peru."

Some people may call Mary Beth's lectures \"dry\", but if you pay attention and recognize that everything she explains is important in the dynamic of the ocean, you'll realize that they are so interesting because they explain so much of the ocean's phenomena.",
                "The strength of this course was the interactive component of the lectures, as Professor Decker and our TF were incredibly knowledgable and passionate about the content and would often talk about their own experiences working in the field. At times, I was a bit confused about the schedule or assignments, as the syllabus was often changing throughout the semester, but our professor was very flexible and accommodating!",

                "The live virtual lectures over Zoom with a Powerpoint over shared screen were perfect over this setting, especially because the professor would have lectured using Powerpoint anyways. Professor Decker even had us meet her in person to give us samples of plankton and mini portable microscopes for us to analyze.\r\n\r\nCould have done an outdoor in-person classroom towards the end of the semester. But in general, this learning setting was great during the COVID pandemic.",
                "Just that the back-to-back group presentations were not as engaging towards the end of the semester, but were still super insightful. However,  I did appreciate how many levels of engagement they implemented given the online aspect. I especially appreciated the plankton lab set-up they provided for us to get some hands-on experience."

If you don't find the subject interesting though, better give the course to an EEB\/EVST major or someone who is interested.",

It provided a lot of really interesting insight into current topics in oceanography and marine management, and I came away with a broad understanding of oceanic processes and a reinforced love for marine research. Mary Beth is super sweet and knowledgable, and I had a great, low-stress experience with this class (despite not being able to go on field trips this year)."
