I also learned some more formal language, which is useful when I'm listening to the news in Chinese or trying to communicate a more formal topic, like politics, in Chinese. I also learned more about Chinese culture, as well as ways to describe many cultural experiences. We also learned about many important cultural elements in China in a lot of depth, such as the 4 core arts of China.",

                "This course and the structure of it definitely creates a comfortable environment to challenge yourself to improve your Chinese. One weakness of the course is like 152, I wish there was more focus is learning the different uses of the characters that we memorize.",
                "The lessons and assignments all helped to improve and sharpen my skills, particularly in writing and grammar. Lessons were all very engaging, and the fact that everything was conducted in Chinese helped to improve my listening skills as well.",
                "I really liked the textbook because the topics we covered in the lessons felt highly applicable to our lives and introduced advanced vocabulary I wouldn't learn in an everyday conversational context. I think the course could be improved with a little more opportunity to practice speaking in class in a low pressure situation where we receive immediate feedback."

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to someone who wants to further their Chinese vocabulary and studies. The course is pretty well organized and straight forward, and the professor is super friendly and fun.",
                "Yes! The course is designed well to help heritage speakers sharpen their skills. As someone who came into this class already speaking and listening pretty fluently, this course emphasized improving my writing and reading skills.",
                "Yes, this course really challenged me and helped me improve my Chinese. The Chinese professors at Yale are all very conscious of every student's unique circumstances and take that into account as they teach the class. They also think a lot about the best way to teach Chinese, considering the backgrounds that students grow up in."
