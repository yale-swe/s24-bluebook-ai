                "I learned about the history of racial science and practiced putting scholarship from diverse disciplines in conversation with one another. I also got to do a creative workshop project as my final project assignment.",
                "This class provided an academic space to consider many social equality issues that are often left out of classroom conversations. I learned how to critically read historical and scientific sources, build connections between their conclusions, and prepare my thoughts for class discussions. I realized how broken the science of biology is and how much space for improvement there is in the future.",
                "I learned so many valuable lessons in this class. We discussed the importance of intersectional approaches to science, the structural racism present in science, and how science has been used as a weapon to support structural racism in America. This class mixed heavy scientific papers with personal narratives and historical journals. It gave a voice to so many underrepresented groups, and there is honestly no better science class I have ever taken in my entire life.",
                "I learned a great deal about the ways science has not only contributed to many forms of discrimination, but has provided fundamental legitimacy for them (we focused on race and gender, but also discussed many other topics).",
                "This is the best course ever! It covers such disparate topics as the history of race and medicine, the basic biology of genetics, and the philosophy and morality of objectivity. \r\n\r\nBut you get more than an overview of those areas. You learn about what a collaborative classroom can look like. You get clear feedback on your writing and participation in class. And you get the wonderful role models of professor Roberts and Horsely.",
                "We discussed a lot of ethical and social implications of many different areas of science/medicine, including race, gender/sex/sexuality, weight, medical technologies, etc",
                "The study of the sciences and the social sciences are often separated. This course married these two fields of studies, and consequently allowed us to understand how society and science affect each other.",
                "The course content offered comprehensive insights for understanding many of the biases and injustices that characterize our current medical system and scientific culture. The instructors made sure to highlight the real-world stakes of so many medical and scientific issues that we often overlook, and facilitated critical thought on how the history of science has often been exclusionary such that the impacts are still felt today."

                "I found myself really pulled in by some readings, like the historical pieces (Dorothy Roberts is always a hit!), while I found it harder to engage with others. It was disappointing to see class engagement go down so much during the course, in terms of both class attendance and doing course readings. I think we found a good rhythm at the end of the semester with small group discussions on Thursdays, but the chaos early on definitely required some time to sort out because the course was so new.",
                "Strengths  brings together STEM and humanities students together for rigorous conversations regarding best practices in STEM research and medical practice",
                "I think the main strength of the course was the diversity of student perspectives and readings assigned. There was so much to draw from, so much to learn from, and so much to say. Small group discussions were also a major strength of the course, especially as the enrollment numbers pushed higher than expected. Above all, Professor Roberts was a major strength of the class. Her insight, discussion moderation, care for students, and dedication to teaching shone through most brightly in the class. She was simply a joy to work with and an inspiration every day. The assignments all built in a powerful way and gave me the opportunity to explore a really well-researched final essay I was proud of. Feedback was also a strength of the class. I got extensive and specific feedback on my writing which was very helpful! I think that one weakness of the course was simply the large class size, especially given that it was designed for a smaller number. I think there was some space for good discussion, but there could have been a lot more if we had a smaller class size.",
                "Strengths - The different backgrounds of Prof Horsely and Prof Roberts made it so this class was super interdisciplinary, everyone in the course felt comfortable even as we navigated some of the most challenging and sensitive material. This class is incredibly welcoming to people from Humanities backgrounds and those from STEM backgrounds. It covers a space never before seen at Yale -- there are no science classes that tell you about science as a cultural entity in the way that this class does. THERE ARE NO WEAKNESSES TO THIS CLASS!!!",
                "This course has so many strengths I hardly know where to begin. First of all, the teaching staff  their persistent advocacy for this course allowed it to be taught in the first place, and being able to hear some of Professor Roberts's lectures is always a treat. The well-being of the students and our values as a learning community were also made central to the course in a way I have never before experienced. I learned so much from our readings and discussions and in the process of crafting my final project. The main weakness I perceived is that I felt like, as we progressed through any given module, our conversations tended to bring us to the same conclusions. Perhaps both students and teachers in the future could be more intentional about taking discussions in new directions.",
                "Strengths: it's the only class at Yale operating at this intersection! Amazing content. Great structure. Best professors.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it was too big in this iteration. The professors hoped to accommodate more people but I think it came at the cost of the small group for engaging.",
                "The class was incredible. I think it took a little while at the beginning to get adjusted to the larger class size, which made it hard to have class discussions, but the once a week small groups ended up working well",
                "I learned the most from the lectures. I wish the Professors would have lectured more. I do not believe the amount of time in small groups was necessary."

                "I think this course would be best for STEM students interested in learning about social science and humanities perspectives on their disciplines. I was somewhat disappointed that I didnt achieve some of my personal goals for the course  including deepening my understanding of my trans and non binary friends experiences and improving my readership of scientific papers. However, I did gain skills and knowledge that I didnt go into this course particularly seeking, including how social science and history could best be taught in STEM.",
                "Absolutely  all STEM students who are invested in being ethical and socially responsible scientists should take this course!",
                "Yes! Especially for students who are interested in entering a job within healthcare!",
                "I would recommend this class to another student, or any like it that allows students from a variety of majors to come together and learn together. It was great to hear so many perspectives and ways of thinking and made for a fascinating conversation! That said, I think in future iterations of the class, it would be great to make the course capacity more limited and consider integrating more guest speakers!",
                "YES YES YES. This is not only the best science class you will ever take but it is taught by some of Yale's brightest teachers. The class conversation in this course is like no other. It is so inclusive. This class will challenge your subconscious biases and make you a better person. It is so interesting and welcoming.",
                "Yes! A lot of the content of the curriculum should honestly be mandatory learning for everyone, and you'll learn so much not only from the teachers and readings, but also from your classmates.",
                "Absolutely! You will never get professors so committed to their students in addition to their material.",
                "Definitely! One of my favorite classes at Yale, very kind and supportive profs and overall class environment, relatively low workload, and extremely engaging and important material",
                "Yes. The subject matter was very important, and the professors were kind. A great science credit for non-science majors. There was also a sense of community within the class which was great."
