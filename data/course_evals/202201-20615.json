                "A framework for thinking about statesmanship, but primarily a chance to just speak on some of the most influential leaders in history.",
                "It's a great political theory class on statesmanship",
                "One major takeaway from this course is that it allowed me to explore fundamental questions (about political things and political leadership) in multiple, deeper ways. Rather than accepting an answer or two answer to a question, I learned to keep pushing on until every possible answer is exhausted. More importantly, I become a better writer  because of Professor Smith's invaluable feedback. I leave this course bolder and braver in my writing skill, and resolved in grappling with difficult, often uncomfortable questions, themes and ideas."

                "Truly, Professor Smith crafted a tremendous reading list. The essay assignments, too, were a great opportunity to dive deeply into a few of the thinkers we discussed in class. I do think the course would have benefited from some non-Western statecraft conceptions. For instance, statecraft in the Confucian tradition diverges profoundly from Western notions. Furthermore, I think we ought to have spent more time considering the context in which a particular statesman or notion of statecraft took place; the context in which Moses led was profoundly different than that in which Lenin led.",
                "S - Loved the Bible weeks on Moses and David. It's what caught my attention to the class. \r\nW - Class was a little big, but it's such a good class I understand.",
                "Wonderful Professor and topics covered on syllabus.",
                "Strengths: interesting topic\r\nWeakness: n/a",
                "Everything about this course is perfect. I will only add that the class should try to generate more opposing views rather tread with a single view, perspective or interpretation."

                "One of the distributional requirements for the political science major should be a seminar with Professor Smith. His style of teaching and his approach to political philosophy changed the way I viewed the discipline. Furthermore, the course offered a broad approach to the study of statecraft, meaning the options for essays are incredibly flexible.",
                "Yes, I recommend to a student looking to really learn from others in a seminarboth students and Smith.",

                "If you interested in politics and looking to explore the questions which lie at the core of political life, then this course is a perfect fate. In fact, I think this course should be taken by anyone interested in creating change in whatever field or area of study, because it explores leadership in all its various facets."
