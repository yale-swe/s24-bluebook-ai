                "Prior to this course I knew and cared very little about climate change.I knew that certain things were 'bad' for the environment and that I should probably eat less meat and recycle but that was the extent of my knowledge. After taking this course, I realized that human civilization is sleepwalking towards a climate disaster that will probably devastate the world as we know it. I also learned about how badly scientists communicate climate change issues to the general public, which is why nations, peoples, and individuals are largely apathetic towards climate change. Through this lens, I came to appreciate, value, and really believe in the value of the humanities as a means to bridge the gap between dry climate change science and the general public.",
                "I got a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the role the humanities can and should play in climate change discourse and action. I was exposed to a variety of sources related to this core idea, from historical narratives to present-day speeches and indigenous texts.",
                "My writing improved a lot over the semester as Dr Lindskog provides very detailed and helpful feedback on the papers.  I learnt so much about the environmental humanities as a discipline, and thought about climate change from angles I had never considered.",

                "Strengths: Professor Lindskog is amazing. She's a pleasure to spend time with, very intelligent, and a great listener. She also does a great job of selecting students for the course, so if you are lucky enough to get in, you'll get to know a really good group of students. The material is also very interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish that we could have talked more directly about the specific ways that certain works of art and literature could help combat the climate crisis. To me, Professor Lindskog left that mostly for the students to figure out, which I appreciated to an extent, but I also feel that we would have benefited from a more targeted approach.",
                "The structure of the course's three units and individual class topics was effective and helped break the course down into more digestible parts. Katja was also an great instructor who's ideas consistently added value to the class conversation. As for improvements, my only recommendation is to make the course more of an open discussion. At times it felt like a mini-lecture with interspersed class discussion rather than the opposite, and the most successful seminars I've taken in previous semesters had a more open format where students conversed and debated for most of each class period. This format may be more challenging in a virtual seminar, however, so I understand why it might not have been possible.",
                "The two paper topics were quite broad, which allowed us to explore an extremely diverse range of topics and interests. I really enjoyed learning about what my classmates were writing and thinking about for their projects. The course could feel a bit diffuse and scattered at timeswe explored so many different media, time periods, forms of writing, topics related to climate, etc. but I think that is a necessary part of the course's design. THere's not much out there that isn't touched by climate change in some way.",
                "The readings are so interesting and range across a variety of topics and forms, including films, YouTube videos, articles and books.  Class discussion was also conducted well, with a good balance of input from Dr Lindskog and the students.  The workload was also manageable which left more time to actually enjoy the readings.",
                "Strengths\r\n* Great selection of readings, at a manageable amount\r\n* Unique perspective into climate change\r\n* Very welcoming to people with very little humanities background\r\n* Amazing professor\r\n* Classmates will generally come from different backgrounds, which is pretty cool\r\nWeaknesses\r\n* A little too intro-level at times  just because there are so many interesting points to talk about, some of which are much harder to grapple with than others, but I sometimes feel that we spend too much time during our seminar just talking about"

                "If you are lucky enough to get into this course (there was a waitlist of 50 students when I took it), then you definitely should. Great Yale courses are all to do with great Yale professors, and Professor Lindskog is great. I also think that it's a unique course in that both STEM and humanities students are able to contribute and learn a lot from the experience.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student, especially one who feels like they haven't learned or thought critically enough about the climate crisis and what it means to live on the planet right now.",
                "Yes, for sure!  Dr Lindskog is a lovely person and great professor.  You will learn a huge amount and think about the humanities relationship to climate in a whole new way.  The readings are really cool and there are a good amount of assignments (2 papers and weekly reading responses) which gives you the space to enjoy what you're learning.",
                "Yes!! It's so rare to find a course that looks at climate change from the humanities perspective, when most courses study the science, politics, or economics of it. It'll change the way you think about nature, indigenous knowledge, wilderness, and more, and about why we still need the humanities, not just the science, when talking about climate change. Professor Lindskog is amazing  she helps us form connections between all the different readings, structures the seminar to maximize our learning (e.g. by consolidating questions from throughout the semester), and is always accommodating towards people's different backgrounds."
