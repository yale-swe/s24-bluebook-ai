                "I gained a thorough understanding of the basic concepts of the french language. I learned numerous verb tenses, grammar, and a variety of vocab. I am able to construct full sentences in past, present and future tense. Additionally, my oral comprehension skills increased tremendously.",
                "I developed a working knowledge of conversational French.",
                "In this class I learned French in the best way possible. French became accessible and interesting to me.",

I developed my circumlocution skills to effectively communicate in a new language when I didn't know something. I learned about French culture and customs as well as how to pronounce words and improve my accent."

                "She is an amazing professor and this was one of my favorite classes. It is very well organized but you have to be willing to put in the work in order to get the most of it. The class isnt unreasonable but after 13 weeks its amazing how much french you learn. Dont take it if you just want to get a language over it. You should really want to learn French.",
                "Because the pace is so fast, you don't really have time to forget anything, which made it easier to synthesize everything we've learned. I also personally enjoy French in Action and thought that the videos helped me latch onto vocab and grammar. I find it a little annoying that all our assignments are due on Tuesday and Wednesday because if you don't understand a concept, you'll get points off for that on all the assignments for that week, but it's not that bad and I understand why it has to be that way schedule-wise.",
                "no weaknesses. Strengths - engagement with material, professor Sherak, and the French in Action program",
                "This course has very strong speaking practice. It moves at a rapid pace, so most of the time in class is spent covering material that we learned the night before in homework. I think the course could be improved by sticking less closely to the French-in-Action timeline if some lessons could be condensed and covered in class in less time, it might help with providing reprieve from the workload and keeping up student morale. I also think the course really thrived when we brought in outside material, so more options for reading/watching outside or inside of class might be helpful.",
                "This is a wonderful course! The material is very interesting, the immersive teaching is very efficient, and I love how Madame Sherak brings extra materials into the class, like The Little Prince,  etc.",
                "Strengths: Madame Sherak is the BEST French professor I could ever ask for. Not only is she patient with us and goes above and beyond to help us both inside the classroom and outside the classroom on Zoom (whether to review before exams or for extra language practice during her off-work hours), but she understands when we can't always complete assignments on time due to how busy the semester is and allows us to have flexibility with deadlines. She adapts her teaching to the needs of students and explains concepts/answers questions well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Too much work... the amount of work that is required for the class is not sustainable as college students who are involved in other courses as well. I was also not a fan of the exams being in the evening -- I would have preferred shorter, in-class exams. I find that my cognitive abilities decrease throughout the day and I become extremely exhausted after classes, so it was difficult to focus on the exams. I'm sure it would have been better had they been in-person, but all of them were online, and I often had to rush out afterwards to not miss the dinner after exams.\r\n\r\nSuggestions: I would have liked more writing practice, since my comprehension, speaking, listening, and reading skills developed generally well throughout the semester, but I fell short in writing. More oral dictation/spelling checks would help."

                "I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who has a knack for languages and is willing to put in the work. You reach such a high level of comprehension in just one semester, and I feel like I was taught French in a way that has set me up for success in the future.",
                "Yes! It is much better to take this than 110! You create such a great community; you learn faster as well. Madame Sherak is an amazing professor.",
                "Yes, definitely take it if you want to learn French or a foreign language. Just take it instead of L1, it's definitely worth the workload, and honestly, the workload is not as bad as it looks at first. I found it to be much more manageable than expected.",
                "absolutely. taking french at yale is an absolute privilege, and the intensive course is a wonderful and thorough introduction to the language.",
                "I would only recommend this course to a student who had enough time to devote to it and who was excited by the challenge of learning French in a single semester.",
                "Definitely! If they are serious about learning French, and would love to spend their mornings in an immersive learning environment, go for it!",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend it to anybody wanting to learn French at a quick, rapid pace (~3/4 lessons weekly) and get the basics underway in order to move on to more advanced classes earlier, prepare for summer session or study abroad in France, or simply learn a new language before graduating during your senior year. It is challenging, and the workload is the greatest I have ever had for a class here at Yale, but the skills you learn organically along the way more than make up for the efforts put in. Madame Sherak is an amazing professor! If you are considering taking it, some tips: set time aside daily to practice, do the workbook pages little by little (I ended up cramming before the exams, which was NOT recommended and I also do not recommend, but it is inevitable to not fall behind), watch French movies/listen to French music/podcasts, read French books/newspapers/blogs to familiarize yourself with the language, reach out to Madame if anything comes up or if you need help, do the Mise en Oeuvres at the end of each lesson! If you know other Romance languages, French will come really easy to you."
