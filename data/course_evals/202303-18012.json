                "Strengths: Professor Muravnik is a great guy. Super knowledgeable about Russian history/politics and very encouraging during class. TA was great. The   (lunch with professor/TA) were very fun. The readings are actually super interesting, and you leave the class with a much more comprehensive view of Russian Imperial history from the time of Catherine the Great to Nicholas I (all in Russian!). || Weaknesses: a more clear grading rubric from the start?

                "As with any language course, the recommendation is based on the student's level. For a student of high language capability, this course is disappointing at times because of the frequency of English conversations. For students of a low language capability, the course might be excessively challenging because the textbook is filled with difficult historical concepts. I personally found it fulfilling and especially appreciated the many opportunities to speak aloud, both for recordings and for oral presentations/assessments.",
                "Yes, if you are trying to improve your Russian and have the time to invest in it. While what we learn in class is cool, in order for the material to really stick (at a level which actually improves your language ability), one would need to put in many many hours a week drilling vocab/grammar. If a student is committed to doing this, then they should definitely take this class. With that amount of time put in, it will be stress-free and you would get a lot out of it. Prof Muravnik is a fantastic and knowledgeable Professor, and he's very good at explaining very complex grammatical concepts."
