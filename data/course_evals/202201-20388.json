                "Professor Harms just reads off the lecture slides, and by week 4 our class had shrunk from its original 30-person size to only 6-8 kids at the lecture. You didn't need to attend lectures and could still get an A in his course. He should change up his lecture pedagogy and format.",
                "This class was good and really shined through with professor and teaching fellow. My only critique is there is no variability in the Prof's lecture. You could honestly skip lecture and read the slides before every section.",
                "Professor Harms reads off the lecture slides word for word. Eventually, he uploaded the slides due to COVID. Still, the lectures felt incredibly pointless because everything he said was written in the slides. As a result, attending the lectures was hard because I felt that I could just look at the slides later.",
                "Strengths: Interesting readings, Patrick was a great TF, workload wasn't too tough.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures themselves could be pretty dry",
                "Interesting and easy to grasp content is a strength, but Professor Harms' lectures are often monotonous and dull leading to very low attendence since most of what he says can be garnered from the slides he reads off.",
                "The class lecture was unenganging and unmotivating. Professor rarely deviated from lecture slides. However, the lecture content and readings were extremely interesting.",
                "The class content is very interesting. The Professor just reads off of the slides, but it is still an enjoyable class.",
                "It's a well organized course! I think if anything maybe less weight on the final.",
                "One of the weaknesses is that an African studies class is being taught by a white man. Honestly, I do understand and respect that the course instructor is well versed in the topic but sometimes I would be seated in class as an African and gear him butcher the pronunciation of African names and cringe. Changing the professor would be too much to ask but it would be nice if the department was able to seek for African TAs who would bring the African touch to the class."
