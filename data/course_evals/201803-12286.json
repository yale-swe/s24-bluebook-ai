    "I learned much about calculus",
    "I learned a lot of new math that I hadn't learned before.",
    "Very good understanding of Math principles. I got to know what I'm doing in math and think out of the box.",
    "a great foundation of\/for learning calculus",
    "I gained quantitative skills as well as analytical skills.",
    "I finally learned how to do math.",
    "Improved my math skills tremendously",
    "Strengthened my understanding of calculus at a more conceptual level.",
    "I learned an extensive amount of knowledge about derivatives and the applications that go along with it.",
    "I learned about calculus.",
    "Problem solving, math.",
    "This course was a great introduction into Calculus topics ranging from optimization to derivatives of logs, and a lot of the information is applicable to any career.",
    "Basic concepts to do with functions, limits and introductory calculus.",
    "I better understand calculus and how to better work my way through math problems. I took calculus in my high school but it didn't have the best math program. This course helped me make up for the deficits.",
    "Computing limits, derivatives, functions, quadratic equations, rational functions, exponential functions, and logarithms.",
    "I was able to improve upon my calculus skills. The problem sets also helped me improve my critical thinking skills.",
    "Foundations for and basics of calculus",
    "I feel confident in what I've learned this semester. Aside form answering problems, i feel like i really understand the reasoning behind why things are solved the way they are and that really helped."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "very strong teaching, off-topic questions could be dismissed potentially",
    "The course is hard to follow at times and the material taught in class is not always consistent with assignments.",
    "Coming to this class, I had very low expectations due to my own lack of understanding in calculus. However, I was very pleasantly surprised, and found that Prof. Hall was able to make the topic rather interesting! More importantly, this class (as taught by Dr. Hall) was easy to understand if you listen and do work, which is especially important when you haven't been exposed to any of the material before. Plenty of additional work was offered for those who wanted to do more or practice for exams. One improvement might be to do a few more exam-like questions in class: it seemed that exam-style questions had a specific form for justification that may be overlooked. Additionally, it might be a good idea to do a warm-up before the quiz, although this is not necessary.",
    "Very good breakdown of math 112. It helps the transition of precalculus to calculus be easier. I think that the quizzes before every class were unnecessary.",
    "The best part about this course are the frequency of office hours. Having them literally every night but Friday and Saturday made me more eager to study\/do sets in advance because I knew I had someone available to help if I got stuck or didn't understand something.",
    "The course was incredible. Professor Hall was really invested in making see students got all the help we needed. The only thing I didnt like was the daily quizzes.",
    "John Hall is an awesome teacher. Plentiful resources available to get an a.",
    "More one on one with teacher.",
    "Strengths: help was readily available with professor and ULAs.",
    "My weakness was that I didn't take calculus in high school.  My strength was my knowledge of algebra.",
    "It had lots of strengths. There could have been a higher ULA to student ratio at office hours, but prof hall was very willing to answer questions and cared a lot about his students learning.",
    "The course is laid out well, and the class does not move too fast",
    "Professor Hall is definitely the strength of this course. He is an incredible professor who clearly has a vested interest in his students understanding the material of the course. The weakness is the textbook we use. We aren't allowed to use calculators on the exam but almost all of our textbook problems require them.",
    "It's a very good course with a lot of support.",
    "The lecture is a weak point in the course. It needs to be more engaging. The problem sets were very helpful. They helped us practice the skills we needed in the class.",
    "The classes were structured well, and it was nice to see an agenda of what we would be doing on the board. The quizzes at the beginning of class were helpful tests of retention and comprehension of the last class.",
    "It was a great course overall. There is nothing else that I would recommend."

   "comments": [
    "Maybe, not sure, the PSets were tricky",
    "Maybe, if they are very good at math and really enjoy it.",
    "While it does depend on the student and their abilities, I would probably recommend this class to other individuals who have a similar foundation in math to myself. The course provides a solid introduction to topics in calculus, and was very well-taught. Real-life examples were also very good to see for those who may not understand simple definitions and theories of calculus.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to not rush with math, get a better understanding, and also make sure that has the right basis to continue to further math classes.",
    "Yes, if they are willing to put in work to understand the material\/pay attention in class. It is a great way to learn fundamentals of calculus.",
    "I would! Professor Hall is amazing.",
    "Take this class if you need to, but dont expect to take it because you took calc in high school and want an easy a. Dont make my mistake. The psets are long and graded very harshly, and the midterms can be tough. Take this if you need to. Its very easy to get an a, if you go to office hours every week and study a lot. Theres plenty of resources available to get an A, but you need to put in the effort.",
    "Yes good entry level math",
    "Yes, my high school math background was not very strong so this course helped me fill in gaps in my knowledge.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student with little calculus knowledge.",
    "I would if you dont love math.",
    "Yes. If you're not very confident going into Math 112, this is a great start since it's the same concepts as it's extended into Math 111 in the spring.",
    "If somebody doesn't have a strong math background and plans to go into STEM or econ then I definitely would recommend this class.",
    "Yes. It's a great course especially if you don't have prior exposure to calculus.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it was not too difficult. It went slow enough that it was fairly easy to learn the material, but it was also challenging enough to not be boring.",
    "As someone who is not confident or enthusiastic about math, I was still able to understand most of what was taught in this class.",
    "YES! It was a great course! In addition to a great teacher and a manageable workload, after it was over I felt very fulfilled!"
