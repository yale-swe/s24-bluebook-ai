Professor Navi's films, discussions, knowledge, and her capacity to steer the conversations of the seminar was outstanding to how I invested in the information infront of me. She encouraged to bring all my architectural experience and interest to the table and it proved to be extremely valuable in how I was able to apply my own research interests to the film content we were looking at. I was able to apply analytical skills that are both spatial and pictorial to understand the power of film and cinematography in shaping how we see the world. Film and Architecture can have such a powerful connection and Fatima gave me every opportunity to see that.",
                "Insights into post-war German cinema",
                "Knowledge: a comprehensive view of post-45 German film, and the sources and tools by which I could zoom in and study any part of that history more deeply. This was achieved through the syllabus construction and especially through the inclusion of generously-selected optional reading and additional films, presented in class. \r\n\r\nSkills: Prof. Naqvi models a way of sitting with and reading films without snap judgement or understanding which I hope to emulate. From my fellow students I have also learned many things about how to discuss films clearly, and how to develop an idea in discussion."

                "Strengths: \r\n- syllabus construction: a productively perplexing set of films, with a good balance of films I'd long been meaning to watch and films I would never have considered watching without the framework of a course. This challenge was what gave our discussions their value. \r\n- guest invitation: talking with Sauper and Radlmaier was really special\r\n- classroom management: I'm very grateful for how effectively the instructor intervened in especially presentations that dragged to keep time for discussion. \r\n\r\nImprovements: \r\n- the only idea I have, which I have mixed feelings about, is that I wished we had more time for basic discussion of films and readings. This was especially true for CACH. To carve out more time for discussion would almost necessarily require reducing the amount of material covered, which I am not convinced is a good idea either; what one wants during a course and what one can take away from a course seem to diverge along the same lineslooking back, I am very happy to have covered so much material and to have a syllabus which can direct me to more. I guess this point only amounts to the recommendation that no *more* material be added to the syllabus unless there is somehow more time added to the day or to the semester."

                "Absolutely, the films and readings combined were such eye-openers. The knowledge of Germany and the world around it at the time the films were made painted such a clear and broader picture of the world within the films and parallels with the world we live in today. Fatima and Benjamin were also so generous with their knowledge and their discussions. Taking a course with them would be beneficial to any student at Yale.",
