I would say that about 3/4 of the class is focused on proteins and nucleic acids. You will also discuss several important scientific papers along with their implications because the class also teaches you how to properly analyze those papers and in how to develop your own.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Sections were interesting & informative, particularly when we got to read papers; the final project was a good way to apply concepts from the course; found many of Professor Koelle's lectures to be quite interesting/well-explained.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course did not do a good job at catering to both students who had never taken biology and those who had prior experience; many concepts were either far too watered down/oversimplified or were explained at too high a level for an intro class (i.e. lots of jargon, incomplete explanations of complex concepts). The quizzes did not seem to be designed to test our grasp of the material, but rather to see how well we could memorize the more obscure parts of the lecture. There were some questions on material not explicitly covered in the class material that were almost impossible to answer without a strong prior background in research/biology. There were also several logistical errors (errors on quizzes/assignments, unclear deadlines/assignments) that took away from the learning experience.",
                "The lectures were asynchronous, which made them flexible but less interactive. I loved how Professor Koelle explained everything but there is definitely room for improvement for Hartman and Kabeche. The homework and benchmark were usually well-designed and manageable, but the instructions were sometimes vague. There are weekly quizzes, but the final exam doesn't affect your grade any more than a quiz, although it covers more content. I usually received prompt feedback on homework, benchmark submissions, and quizzes. The discussion sections were very chill and usually not intellectually challenging. My teaching fellow could not explain the concepts very clearly.",
                "Strengths: I think the lectures, slides, and study guides were very cohesive and helpful in preparing for the homework assignments / psets. There was also a solid support system, and every week Prof Hartman hosted a pset session, which was very useful for facilitating peer collaboration. This class is also pretty forgiving, which didn't put a lot of stress on grades and allowed you to learn without pressure.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the online lectures were not as engaging, and some of the discussion sections were boring at times. However, I think this could be improved with time with in-person lectures.",
                "I loved how this course was structured around key concepts, and how we weren't forced to memorize tons of information. All of the content was super interesting, and I really enjoyed the final project. I felt very supported, because there were places to submit questions, optional enrichment sessions, collaborative PSET hours, and overall many opportunities to receive help if needed. \r\n\r\nI actually really liked that the lectures were online. This gave me the flexibility to watch them at my own pace.",
                "The lectures really should not have been virtual this semester. The course was minimally engaging and I was not happy with how the lectures were the same pre-recorded ones from last year. Felt like the professors didn't really put much effort into it. Some of the lectures were vague and the homework did not fully reflect the content of the lectures. The open note quizzes were nice though. Also the 10pm deadlines were very inconvenient.",
                "The method of online lectures was a very poor way to deliver lecture material. It made me as a student feel disjointed, especially considering how there were several professors who co-taught the course. This meant that the lecture styles and resources given in canvas varied in style, making it difficult for me as a student to find a rhythm with the course.",
                "Strengths: professors were very accessible and flexible. Discussion sections were also the best part of the class.\r\nWeaknesses: assignments were unclear and the work is very heavy in the early part of the week when it could be spread out, TAs grading of the material felt inconsistent across the student groups, and the benchmarks project felt very vague with TFs commenting and grading in seemingly more harsh ways than others. The biggest weakness is that this course is not in person so students cannot ask questions and get in person feedback. If the course was in person with quizzes on Fridays, it would be significantly better in my opinion. Personally the three mentor meetings were not useful to me whatsoever. I felt like I was going through this class just to check off a lot of boxes and not actually learning anything substantially new from a high school AP class. Mentor meetings did not help me understand the content.",
                "I mean, it's an intro biology course, so I think the class definitely fulfills its purpose. You need to put in the effort to do well, and the class is going to teach you the biology basics. I like biology, so I had no issues with the class (except it is very easy to make seemingly trivial errors on the quizzes, which will annoyingly have an impact on your grade). You're not going to be diving into too much detail (i.e. you're really only going to be exposed to the basic mechanics of biological processes), so don't expect to be an expert after this class. I don't think the class has any significant weaknesses, though. You'll just want to make sure that you're putting effort into all your assignments and not making foolish mistakes on quizzes because there doesn't seem to be much error when it comes to grades (I don't actually know the curve for my class yet, but a lot of people in the class are gunning for pre-med, so cutoffs will probably not be low).",
                "I really liked the course format in which assessment is spread over the various p-sets, quizzes, final paper, and miniquizzes much better than an exam format. I felt really like I could learn the material. Professors Kabeche and Hartman was absolutely awesome and I would love to be in class with them again soon. There aren't too many weaknesses I can think of.",
                "Strengths are its teaching about scientific papers. Weakness was that it was online and no real direct communication with the professor ever (unless you were in enrichment).",
                "Strengths: It was super well-organized; easy to know what needed to be done by when. I also honestly to some degree liked having online lectures, because it allowed me to pause and rewind to go over confusing concepts, and it also allowed me to watch them whenever I wanted. The downside of online lectures is that it's easier to procrastinate on watching them, and I spent way longer watching them than I would have spent in a lecture hall because of all the pausing to take notes and rewinding. But overall, I think the pros of online lecture outweighed the cons for this class, especially because it was my only class that had online lectures. If I had two or more classes that had online lectures, I think I would have disliked having online lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: during in-person quizzes, I was worried that people would easily be able to look at other students' answers, and unfortunately this did turn out to be a problem. I personally care a lot about academic integrity so I managed to avert my eyes and didn't look at others' quizzes, but I easily could have. My friend who also took Bio 101 told me in passing that he had originally put the correct answer for a question but then saw the answer that the person in front of him had marked down, and my friend switched to that (incorrect) answer instead.",
                "Strengths: pre-recorded lectures are well-taught and typically at a good pace (especially at the beginning), lots of support, logical thinking + problem-solving skills developed, and learning how to apply knowledge to examples in biology (in problem sets). Very clear expectations. I wish other classes had as clear expectations as this class does.\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures later on in the course are oddly taught, where the material may not necessarily be well-understood by the lecturer. The videos cut off oddly.",
                "The strengths were the professors and all of the teaching staff and all of the resources that were offered. The weakness was the recorded lectures I wished they had been in person",
                "it felt like lots of busy work. i spent most of my days doing some aspect of biology which made me resent the class. watching all of the lectures/taking the mini quizzes whiles trying to make sure my notes were solid in addition to working on a pset, studying for a quiz, and working on a final project benchmark made each week feel very overwhelming/jam packed. biology overshadowed all of my other courses and demanded almost all of my attention every day.",
                "Open note quizzes were a big positive because you needed to understand the material but didn't need to waste time freaking out about minute details that you could look up in the lecture notes. (Make sure to watch the lectures though!) The Mini-quizzes embedded in the pre-recorded lectures were also helpful to check your understanding (and you have unlimited tried to get them right which is great). Enrichment is also helpful if you are struggling; Hartman really makes an effort to help students understand the material. Final project was interesting and it was really nice to have a take-home project be a fairly significant (30%) part of the grade, rather than just timed quizzes. Weaknesses: Often, the quiz questions seemed unnecessarily tricky -- they were asking for specific words in the short answer response that seemed like a stretch to include, especially when the short answers were limited to appx 60 words. Sometimes the Kabeche lectures (the course is split into lectures by a few different profs) were confusing and unclear.",
                "I appreciated the structure of the course: the lecture videos were short and easy to comprehend, and the collaborative pset sessions made it much more easy to work on the homework. I also found the discussion sessions very helpful. \r\nMy biggest piece of feedback is that it would be extremely helpful if the homeworks and quizzes could be graded more quickly. It is difficult to improve or adapt studying habits for an upcoming quiz if you don't know how you did on the previous quiz and you have no idea what to change for the next time. I completely understand that there are lots of students taking the BIOL sequence and it's difficult to grade things very quickly, but if there's any way to get students feedback on homeworks and quizzes before the subsequent quiz or homework, it would be greatly appreciated by the students.",
                "I enjoyed how the discussion sections were structured - they helped me apply the material and be able to ask questions about the content. I wish that it wasn't all online since we did not have the chance to interact with the professors or see other students outside of our discussion sections.",
                "Strengths: There are a plethora of resources to seek help (enrichment, office hours, etc) and I found most of the psets helpful in reinforcing material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I am not a huge fan of the asynchronous format; I think it makes it slightly more difficult to seek clarification/time manage the workload for the course. I also found that the key concept structure made it a little difficult to know what details we should be focusing on, especially for quizzes since it was often very broad.",
                "I enjoyed this class and think the teaching fellow were amazing. I also think the molecule project that was worked on throughout the class with benchmarks every week was a great way to use the key concepts in practice. I did not really enjoy the online format of the class and felt that it added to the hefty to-do list for the course that had so many small parts that it got a little confusing to figure out what was expected of us every week.",
                "Strengths: grading scheme is conducive to student success, quite a few opportunities for help, professors are knowledgeable and engaging. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: discussion sections sometimes felt like a missed opportunity to clarify tough content, quizzes could be tricky and not representative of knowledge.",
                "Weakness: Asynchronous lecture videos are helpful if you miss class, but bad for engagement with course material. an in person option would be helpful (if possible) while still keeping the online lectures as an option. For some weeks, there was not enough time to do the homework (posted on Monday and due before section starting on Wednesday). In the future, making all homework due at the same time for every student would be helpful/more fair. \r\n\r\nStrength: Professors are nice and seemed passionate. Enjoyed the freedom/non restrictiveness of the final project.",
                "I liked the flipped classroom, but I do wish there were more in personal aspects of the class. It was hard to stay engaged virtually",
                "Strengths: Cumulative course, flow from topic to topic was very good. Putting together the Final Project was a rewarding experience. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Open-note (including printed lecture sheets, opening lectures on devices, etc) discouraged me from taking notes. Would have engaged more with course if quizzes were closed-notes.",
                "some recorded lectures were more difficult than others to understand-professor koelle's lectures were more easily understandable \r\nembedded quizzes were helpful\r\nslides were useful \r\n\r\ngood project",
                "Strengths: \r\n- the lectures are prerecorded which helps so much with learning\r\n- lots of assignments that help boost your grade\r\n- focuses on application \r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- lack of consistency with lectures (some professors are MUCH better at teaching than others)",
                "One of the strengths of this course was the clarity of the material and the quality of the lectures. Every topic was thoroughly explained and well presented. One weakness was the virtual format, which limited discussion.",
                "Online I could access the lectures at any time and review it over and over until I got it (made sure lecture material was consistent). The only downside to this was not making many friends within the class so often I felt on my own when I wanted peer help.",
                "- Strengths: Exposed us to fundamental lab techniques, discussion threads \"Professor Challenges the class\" were very engaging, content was always discussed in a real world context, availability of recorded lectures\r\n- Weaknesses: quiz had unfair point distributions where missing one question or concept wouldn't permit a decent grade",
                "The main strength was the amount of support provided. There were homework collaborative sessions, office hours, and enrichment sessions on top of the lectures and discussion section, and if one needed more help, it would be offered if they asked. The main weakness, in my opinion, was the grading. The grading felt inconsistent at times, and sometimes, even inaccurate.",
                "Strengths: Discussion sessions\r\nWeaknesses: Though the course is shown as a 75min classes for two days a week, the recorded lectures together were often over 2.5 hours. Moreover, there would be quizzes during class time. So you have to put aside time for watching the lectures earlier or later.",
                "Weakness it was online",
                "The weaknesses of the course are: \r\n- incomplete explanations by Dr. Kabeche\r\n- the format of the examinations does not reflect the way the class is taught\r\n- the grading is unnecessarily harsh. It attempts to be consistent, but as a side effect punishes completely correct answers just because they do not exactly match the requirements of the rubric. For example, I got many points off on the assignments just because I failed to mention the exact \"key concept\" number from the course along with a completely correct description. The syllabus says that the class focusses on \"higher-order concepts that underlie the complexity of life,\" but these concepts exist regardless of the arbitrary labelling used in this class. \r\n- the \"specificity vs. word limit\" paradox. In order to get full credit for a question, I must a) be within the word limit and b) use the exact right words from the rubric. It is extremely difficult no matter how precise the wording to describe the concept well enough to get the points while also being within an arbitrary word limit.\r\n-  I found, too, that even a synonym would not award me the correct number of points. I said \"function\" in one of my responses, which, given more words to explain in detail, approximately means \"mechanism,\" but I got points off that question because I neglected to say \"mechanism.\" These mean the approximately the same thing, I believe, and perhaps I had the incorrect word, but given more words to explain myself, I believe it would have been clear I meant \"mechanism.\"\r\n - I have found that at Yale my obedience and memorization are rewarded over understanding to a tragic degree. Grading based on understanding, and perhaps correcting our word usage occasionally without docking points, reflects the course structure and material better. \r\n\r\nThe strength of this course was Dr. Koelle's lectures, which were concise and logically organized. My TA was also very good, and they understood the type of understanding I described above which was not properly assessed in the graded assignments.",
                "There are no weaknesses of this course, I loved how it was organized.",
                "The way the course did quizzes kept changing a lot, which made going at the right time less straightforward than having a quiz at the same time every week. I liked the flipped format.",
                "more engaging lectures",
                "Everything was conveyed well, deadlines were very clear. I wish there were more clear instructions and guidance for the paper and benchmarks.",
                "some strengths were the study guides and resources that they posted. weaknesses is that it was online",
                "There was so much busy work. Between the psets and the benchmarks, all I ever did was bio homework. Additionally, the online format added to the headache--the videos were much longer than the allotted class time, and gave unclear and indirect explanations that often left me confused. Overall, the sheer amount of work we were assigned, between psets, benchmarks, recorded lectures, and quizzes, made it hard to focus on any one aspect of the course. I was always scrambling to get everything done because there was just so much to do. Strengths of the course were that there were a lot of visual diagrams and videos the lectures used to explain, which was helpful. There were also a lot of office hours opportunities, and Prof. Hartman's weekly checklists were INCREDIBLE.",
                "Stress isnt high!",
                "The strengths of this course was the discussion sections and the type of assignments. I feel that they really helped reinforce the information. The main weakness for me was the recorded lectures since I learn better in person.",
                "I think there is a lot of support available, the enrichment sessions were extremely helpful, as were office hours with both prof hartman and the peer tutors.",
                "Weakness: it was online",
                "This course was great, but would be much better and more engaging in person.",
                "I believe the content of the course was mostly useful and explained well, but greater revision of lectures could be implemented to reduce errors and improve flow if the videos are used again.\r\n\r\nI believe students would also benefit from weekly homework being due at 11:59pm rather than 10pm.",
                "Strengths: a LOT of support for those with no previous experience in biology. The department does a really good job of accommodating all students regardless of their proficiency.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: given how many topics we covered and how little time there was available, I felt that I was not able to appreciate the concepts in detail and connect them with each other (although the last module on Covid-19 did help put these concepts into practice). Content was a little dry but again, it helped that a lot of it is relevant to the current pandemic.",
                "A strength of the course was its forgiving nature. Your lowest grade in each category was dropped. This helped ease students into the class. A weakness was the obscure due dates for assignments. For example, many assignments would be due on Saturday night but office hours would be on Sunday (although there were office hours available on Wednesday).",
                "The BIOL sequence is run very well. No weaknesses. You will learn a lot, and the professors and teaching team are incredibly caring and passionate about the subject.",
                "Well taught but sometimes struggled to maintain engagement with the lectures because they were virtual/recorded",
                "Good organization in terms of you know what you need to do and learn.",
                "Strengths are certainly the format of the course. Having no final exam is really nice and makes introducing the subject less pressured and more enjoyable.",
                "I believe that there is too much coursework. In addition, I was struggling to finish assignments by Saturday at 10 PM (I believe the Monday deadline is much better). I also believe that the synchronous quizzes are not an accurate measurement of the learning in the course (many times, I found myself answering pure facts more rather than applying the key concepts into experiments). Although I did like the process of revising the final project (since we could apply our knowledge of terms and techniques to reading papers), I believe that the individual benchmark submissions should not have points taken off since it is a chance for students to receive feedback.",
                "The online lectures were not idea.\r\nAt least in my section, the TA was very helpful and helped me understand better.",
                "Not sure what the reason was for this course to be held online. These were the same recorded lectures as last year's and unless there's a good reason that this course material was recycled, it felt lazy. I just couldn't find myself willing to put in any effort into this class considering how much effort was put in by the professors. Benchmark project was a slog and felt more like gruntwork than anything else.",
                "This course was very well-organized and Professor Koelle was exceptional. There were many resources available if you wanted extra help, and I really liked that the lectures had mini-quizzes at the end to help gauge our knowledge. I loved that we had a final project that we worked on each week because it helped to apply our knowledge rather than performing mere memorization for an exam. The only things I didn't enjoy were the distribution of work over the week, and I thought there was a big inconsistency between professors (Koelle explained things very well, while the others did not as well).",
                "Strength - the lectures being recorded\r\nWeakness - the lectures released each week, rather than them all being available at the start of the course",
                "strengths: recorded lectures in small 10-30 min chunks, well organized \r\nweaknesses: benchmarks become kind of repetitive",
                "I didnt really enjoy the online lecture format. It was also frustrating to have to go to science hill for the quizzes for the second half of the semester. I wish other measures to prevent cheating (perhaps Zoom proctoring) had been enacted. The individual project was great, and discussion section activities were great.",
                "This course could be improved by having quiz questions be more accurate and also removing ambiguity in assignments.",
                "Strengths: Dr Hartman is exceptional and is very intentional about making bio 101 not a weed out course. Few other pre-Med read are as well designed for students of different backgrounds than Bio 101. Good content. Lectures are interesting and online so easy to go at your own pace. Assignments arent too time intensive. Enrichment (optional weekly review help with Hartman) is so helpful for people new to bio (like I was).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The quizzes are poorly worded and more dependent upon test taking ability than actual knowledge. That said, if you study, you should do well on the quizzes for the most part and lowest quiz grade is dropped. Sometimes I felt the course was far too easy and insulted my intelligence. The content taught went very in depth and was super interesting but evaluations were at best superficial, as indicated by an average grade in the course being nearly 96% (which to be fair also demonstrates that Amaleah is an exceptional professor at explaining everything in a way thats easy to understand). I was very happy that everyone performed well, but I found it slightly frustrating that you had to focus more on test taking than learning to get an A due to the exceptionally high average grade. To resolve the issue outlined above, I would get tide of 2/5 benchmarks which got very repetitive and boring near the end and replace them with more in depth evaluative assignments like discussing a lecture topic.",
                "I think that the videos were more than what a normal lecture would be and that was frustrating at parts.",
                "I would have preferred in person lectures, the virtual lectures were not as interesting to engage with. My favorite part of this course was the protein project we worked on throughout.",
                "I loved the concept of the final project; I learned so much more than I would've, if I would have had a final exam, and it honestly motivated me in terms of what I want to research in the future. I think the quizzes were a good marker to make sure I was staying up to date, but I also loved the idea of recorded lectures, because it helped me review concepts that were harder to grasp as many times as needed. I think it could be improved by adding the one-on-one meetings onto the Canvas calendar as soon as they start, because sometimes the potential for the meetings to help weren't fully explored, due to the calendar notifications getting lost in other work, until shortly before.",
                "The recorded lectures were very well made, and the study guides given out each week were helpful. The guidance received on the final project was also very helpful, and discussion sections always felt well organized. Hearing that people were cheating on quizzes was disheartening since I did not and this course seemed to be graded on a curve, so I hope that the curve on the early quizzes was not too affected.",
                "A strength of this course was that it did a good job of teaching skills in addition to biological facts. A weakness was the amount of time each week we were expected to spend doing coursework, compared to other classes and compared to BIOL 102. I think the final project was useful, but it was also time consuming to do in addition to the homeworks.",
                "This course is very good at making everything about learning, rather than the grade. I have nothing to say regarding improvements.",
                "Its strengths were the level of depth of the information and the level of detail presented. The benchmark assignments were nice for breaking up the pressure of the final project.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was the way the course was organized online. The recorded lectures were quite long and took up more time than the normal lecture time if we were in person. Although this individually was not a problem, it was difficult to allot the amount of time necessary given that I needed to balance multiple other course-loads, and the time was very precious.",
                "Weaknesses: Organization \r\nStrengths: Online lectures",
                "The class was fully online and it would have been nice to have in person classes.",
                "Weakness - being online. I really did not enjoy learning from recorded modules. It is always harder to pay attention + can never ask direct questions.",
                "Strengths: This course is structured to make you succeed. As long as you keep up with the lectures and assignments, you should be able to learn the material and do well in the course. The problems sets provided good practice for the material learned in class and the teaching team is very happy to help students. Weaknesses: None.",
                "The biggest strength was how the content was taught in a very accessible way and there was a lot of readily available support if you felt out of depth. The weakness was the online formatI found it difficult to connect with people and the course and feel inspired by it.",
                "Was only pre-recorded online lectures, so timing was totally up to you. However, very little engagement with the professors or TAs.",
                "Great resources for learning. Many opportunities to learn and earn points, which made the class more about learning as opposed to receiving a high grade.",
                "The video lecture format was nice in that it allowed for detailed note-taking, but the workload was tough to keep up with as it often ran over what a traditional classroom lecture timeline was. As a result, I felt very unprepared going into the first lecture for BIOL 102, as I could no longer take notes by hand. However, I enjoyed the structure of the course overall; discussion sections enhanced my understanding of the initial lectures.",
                "One strength of Bio 101 is the teaching staff. They were all very kind and helpful and wanted us all to succeed. I think another strength is the incorporation of the final project rather than a final exam. I think it allows students to absorb more content and actively learn rather than simply memorizing things for one final exam. I do think that in section I would have liked to spend more time going deeper into some of the key concepts discussed in lectures rather than doing high level reviews of some of the more basic ideas.",
                "The online lectures were nice to have because I was able to speed up, rewind, or slow down the videos. The embedded quizzes were also nice to make sure I was gathering what I needed to from the video. For the final project, I felt like it wasn't really furthering my understanding of a concept and felt more like busy work.",
                "This course was very organized and the requirements for each week were thoroughly communicated. There were also many resources and forms of outreach available if extra assistance was needed. I do wish that this course had taken place in person, as it would have provided more direct interaction and collaboration of material.",
                "Strengths: The incorporation of practical knowledge about reading and understanding scientific papers, the very organized course format, and it's not too hard to get a good grade in the class. \r\nWeaknesses: Grading inconsistencies between students; I've noticed some of my friends have been graded more harshly on quizzes and homework than I have been.",
                "If it was in person would be better to learn",
                "I think the strengths are that it helps to get students thinking like biologists. I really liked the final project as well and felt that it was a good way to go deeper on one specific protein, something that I wouldn't expect from an introductory bio course. \r\nI think the class could have had homework and benchmarks due either Sunday at 10 pm or Sunday at 11:59 as opposed to Saturday as my practice schedule made it difficult to find time to look over my work and submit it I hadn't already done so before Saturday.",
                "Strengths: The quizzes and assignments were really designed to have students succeed and show off their understanding of the material and I feel like the grading was very fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I did not like how it was all recorded lectures and I also think that if the discussion section slides were made available after section that would have helped a lot.",
                "Strengths: Breadth of content, clarity of learning priorities, accessibility of instructors, interesting content, fast but manageable pace.\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of due dates and required activities to keep track of each week. The online lecture format sometimes made the class itself feel like a homework assignment, and there were a lot of assignments and deadlines (for lecture quizzes, discussion section, homework, and benchmark assignments) each week."

                "If you can place out of the course, then by all means do so. I took 101 hoping to expand on my high-school biology knowledge and get up to a \"college level\", but was thoroughly disappointed. The course provides a very shallow and somewhat poorly-explained overview of the subject that is less comprehensive than most high-school AP courses. If you are taking biology for the very first time then it's probably the right move, but it still will likely not be a pleasant experience.",
                "Only if you need to take the sequence as a prerequisite to your major or other courses. If you are not a bio major, I'm sure there are more interesting courses to fulfill the Science distribution requirement or just learn cool things in biology.",
                "Yes. It was a very solid introduction that you could take more in depth if you wanted to.",
                "Yes, this course is a great way to ease yourself into the bio sequence. Just make sure to take away as much as you can for this course, because the other sequences will be a bit more challenging content and structure-wise.",
                "Yes, if you are genuinely interested in learning about biology. This course is amazing compared to most intro bio sequences, which can be super dry and memorization-based. A quick note - make sure to choose a protein you find really cool for your final project; it will make it enjoyable and exciting.",
                "No. It was basically a repeat of high school introductory biology. Many of the assignments did not help me learn any biology and felt like a waste of time/busywork. Did not enjoy the benchmarks whatsoever; did not learn anything useful from them either.",
                "This course is very important to take as a student pursuing biology or other related fields. However, I feel that I didn't learn much at all from this course. It seemed that I was simply counting on my previous experiences with biology to supplement the areas of our class lectures that were lacking. If I hadn't had exposure to biology and fundamental biological concepts in high school, I feel I would have been incredibly lost when completing assignments or taking assessments.",
                "Some majors and pre-med require it, so I guess you'd have to take it in those cases. But you can also take it for fun or to see if you have a passion for biology like I was. I thought some of the topics were interesting, but the workload is not necessarily low, but it is manageable depending on what your other classes are. Your enjoyment of this class will really depend on if you want an intellectual challenge and if you actually find the topics interesting, but if you're looking for an easy science credit to fill your distributional requirement, this might not be the class for you. Overall, I thought it was an enjoyable experience, but I wish the class itself was in-person because watching the lectures just became another homework assignment (it will most likely be in person in the future). You can easily do well in the class if you go to the office hours and collaborative p-set sessions. Ms. Hartman is also a very smart and kind teacher. If you ever have any concerns about anything, she is an amazing resource.",

                "You probably need to take it, but it's a genuinely good course too. The final grade isn't entirely timed quizzes, which I appreciate -- instead, there are other ways to show your learning (Psets, Final project, etc).",

                "Yes I would. I enjoyed how in depth the course went in explaining why things happen in biology such as why proteins fold a certain way and why molecules perform certain functions. I also really loved Dr. Koelle's lectures and the way he taught the information in such a clear way.",

                "I would recommend this course as an intro to science classes since it was a very positive environment that wasn't incredibly challenging at all. You don't necessarily get to meet faculty but at least you can familiarize yourself with the STEM side of Yale.",
                "Yes definitely- the content is very interesting and relevant and support was available.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It is a good course to take to get yourself accustomed to taking classes at Yale. It's interesting, and there's a great support system.",
                "Do not recommend if not a requirement.",
                "Since it is a prerequisite, I don't think most people have a choice, so yes.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would because it was an excellent way of learning about biology in an intro course.",
                "yes if its required; enrichment session was very helpful",
                "Yes, I believe it provides a very strong biological foundation and skillset",
                "Yes!",
                "yes, it is fairly straightforward and easily digestible content",
                "Not unless they needed it for a prereq. The workload is entirely too much, and there's too much content in the quarter, for this to be enjoyable.",
                "Pre med students",
                "I would recommend this course if they are interested in a major involving biological sciences. It's a good introductory course and I think could provide a good base for higher level courses.",
                "absolutely, it was a great foundational course",
                "I dont think I would recommend this class because I was not very engaged with it",
                "Yes! If you're interested in bio or want to see if you'd like to pursue bio further, I definitely recommend this course.",
                "I would recommend it to students seeking to pursue a biology-related career as it gives a good introduction to several concepts.",
                "Yes - even if you are not someone who does not have much experience in biology you will be ok. Join enrichment if this applies to you.\r\nIf this is not a pre-requisite for your intended major you can still take it, but a lot of the content is new, even for some who did AP Bio. My understanding is there are other biology courses that non-stem majors can take to fulfill the science distributional requirement.",
                "Yes! You will likely have to take this course for your major anyway, but it is a great course nonetheless.",
                "This really isn't optional for most people who are taking it. The bio sequence does not give a lot of wiggle room. The final project is as interesting as you make it and people actually interested in bio will probably like it. I will say it's kinda a false lead into the rest of the bio sequence. Enjoy the simple and straightforward class while you have it",
                "Yeah for major",
                "Only if it was required, I believe that there are probably better courses to fulfill the science requirement, as well as other courses for students to get invested in the stem majors.",
                "I would not unless they are very interested in biology. I know most people take it as a premed course, which was my original intention, but biology is not particularly engaging for me.",
                "People who are taking this course are likely taking it for pre-med or for their major, so they should take it. But if you're taking it for funsies, consider something else.",
                "Yes, it gives a great foundation of the basic principles of biochemistry and biophysics.",
                "Yes, good introductory bio class",
                "Yes, but only if they needed to as a credit. Otherwise, no.",
                "Yes!! Even if its not one of your pre-reqs, I would take this course. I had a great experience even though many students had previous AP bio experience and I had none.",
                "Yes, I enjoyed this class. I think it will prepare me for future science classes here.",
                "Yes if it pertained to their major.",
                "Yes, I think this course taught me things outside of biology with its schedule - time-management, personally tailored note-taking and learning styles, and more. I also think the course's focus on learning instead of memorizing ensures that the concepts learned in this class will stay with me.",
                "Yes, a great introduction into biological concepts, and they also teach important skills outside of that such as reading, researching literature, and writing.",
                "yes, it built a good foundation to biology",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is planning to pursue interests in biology, because it gives you an idea of the expectations in a Yale biology class and how to write about biology. I would probably not recommend this course to someone who was not planning to study biology further.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. In my honest opinion, it is a great course for students needing it as a major requirement, but also for students who need a science distributional requirement. It is a relatively easy-going science course.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless someone is interested in getting an overall review of molecular biology. If possible, those interested in pursuing molecular biology as a major should aim to skip the course and go to the next level class.",
                "Yes, I do as long as they have taken biology before.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this class. It is a core introductory class for many science majors first of all. Second of all it feels like the course structure was quite conducive to students success. No finals, just weekly open note quizzes, very manageable psets, and a final project that was very relevant to course material.",
                "Yes, I believe everyone should have at least a basic understanding of biology.",
                "Yes! This course is a great introduction to biochemistry and biophysics.",
                "Yes! It was a great introduction to bio at Yale and gives you a chance to meet lots of faculty.",
                "I assume you are taking this as a pre-req, or you love biology. If either of those apply, yes take the class, if not, do not.",
                "Yes, it was a great background course for understanding chemical biology.",
                "I would recommend the course to another student. However, much of my understanding came from the biology course I took in high school; some key concepts were explained in such a way that they might have been confusing for someone with no background in biochemistry or biology.",
                "Yes, I think 101 is a good intro for those who are interested in taking bio and will provide a good background of what to expect in the future.",
                "I would recommend this course to students that wish to gain fundamental biology knowledge. While some concepts were fairly introductory, the clear explanations provided in each lecture allowed for comprehension.",
                "If they're like me and are a first-year trying to figure out if they want to major in Biology, but have not taken a college-level bio class before, then absolutely. This class teaches you a lot and is very well-organized for learning.",
                "yes, it was a good intro",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who either hasn't done bio in a while or didn't feel like they understood it before. Coming from a strong base in bio, I did feel as though a decent percentage of what we were learning was either review or felt very easy to understand given my other experience in bio, but I also appreciated being able to go deeper into the material when I wanted to.",
                "Yes, it's a good introduction to Yale biology.",
                "I would to all students interested in pursuing a major in biological sciences or just STEM courses in general, because of the practice it gives students with basic necessary skills such as analyzing papers and communicating effectively.",
                "Yes; its design helps students succeed and it teaches very important information for many curricula.",
                "BIOL 101 is a good way to start the biology sequence, with instructors who want to help you learn and course content which will be new if you havent taken AP Biology but manageable with the supports provided by the class. Homework assignments and the final project were helpful in fortifying concepts and the course was beneficial in understanding the background of biological concepts.",
                "If you are interested in learning the basics of biology, then yes this course is very helpful and builds a solid foundation for further learning.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who did not take AP Bio in high school, or who want a refresher.",
                "Yes. It was a very good intro course"
