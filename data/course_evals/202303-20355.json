                "Its got good flow, the final requirements are a bit much, I would prefer two more psets and a project rather than a final exam and project",
                "Professor Holland makes the class engaging through interactive lectures, group work, and pre-lecture videos. We manage to learn a lot in just a few weeks.",
                "Strength: interactive activities during class\r\nWeakness: since the ligand development was a huge part of the criteria, i think more emphasis on the ligand should have enforced earlier part of the semester than the latter.\r\nI think some of the concepts at the earlier part of the classes lacked explanation.",
                "I like how there was a mix of lecturing and class discussion \/group work",
                "Lectures were pretty well organized. However, presentation of certain course concepts was not clear. In addition, course did not go much deeper into material than undergradute inorganic chemistry.",
                "A strength of this course is that it covers a range of useful topics, and provides many specific examples from the literature. A weakness of this course is that it jumps into high level material too quickly, with unclear expectations for what is supposed to be known prior vs. what is supposed to be learned during the course.",
                "Class was well organized and I always appreciated the opportunities to practice what we were learning in class and immediately get feedback. There were a couple classes where it felt more as though we were talking about case studies then broader principles; thats not a problem, but I wish those classes had been framed more in that way.",
                "Professor Pat Holland is a very engaging lecturer. He was definitely the major strength of the course. Even when I was not particularly invested in some topics, I appreciated the way they were presented and the discussion questions posed during class. I cannot think of major weaknesses.",
                "There was a lot of work associated with the course which made sure that you demonstrated learning on the topic, but it was a lot to accomplish with other grad classes at the same time. It would have been helpful to have more detailed notes\/links to resources to fill in the gap necessary to complete assignments.",
                "The strength of the course lay in the professor's consistent preparedness and willingness to address questions in class.\r\n\r\nAs for the weaknesses, the professor failed to establish clear boundaries between grades and selectively graded students at the end of the semester. He took an advantage of 'fuzzy boundaries,' enabling him to grade students individually as he pleased rather than adhering to a clear standard. For instance, Student X completed the course with a total of 89% and received an A, while Student Y completed the course with 90% or more and received a B. This treatment reflects bias, leading to unfair and discriminatory grading. Additionally, the professor's email responses displayed a somewhat passive-aggressive tone, attacking and belittling the student. Furthermore, the professor posted a statement on the Canvas website after the final exam, specifying that an A would be 'roughly 90%', and a B would be 'roughly 80%.' It appears that the professor did not consistently follow these numerical guidelines, indicating a biased and possibly personal approach to grading. Such actions represent a clear violation of equitable assessment standards that should have never happened at Yale."
