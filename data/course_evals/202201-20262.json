                "In terms of knowledge, I learned about urban spaces and how they can be used to discriminate against black South Africans. The term \"unreliable narrator\" was also very interesting to learn about. Different types of literary texts helped me to branch out from the kind of writing we're used to reading in classical Western literature.",
                "Knowledge: introductory understanding of the recent history of South Africa, a taste of the vast expanse that is recent South African literature\r\nSkills: improve as a writer, reader, and thinker; how to research; how to make a short presentation\r\nInsights: how diverse and complex South Africa and South African literature are; various literary insights about literature and the world (especially academia's impacts on the real world and the power of certain narratives)",
                "I learnt about South African literature and history with which I was not familiar prior. I also learnt to use other research papers as source in essays and build off of existing ideas in an original manner.",
                "The amount of knowledge you gain from this course in understanding the impact of apartheid on South Africa is immense. I learned so much more in the understanding of South African history. The insights gained from the novels we read were amazing. The skills you gain can vary depending on how much you want to engage, but personally, I thought the classes helps with public speaking, close reading, analytical thinking when writing papers, research skills, and so much more. This is by far the best class I've taken at Yale as the amount of knowledge and insights you gain aren't limited. South African literature is a great place to delve into and Steph Newell is the best professor for this class. With her passion, enthusiasm, and expertise on this topic, there isn't anyone else who can parallel her adept ability to carry out the requirements of this class.",
                "Ability to combine historical documents and literary close reading. A great appreciation for the nation of South Africa.",
                "I learned a lot about South African history and culture. I became a better writer and specifically learned how to include journal articles and other scholar's articles in my writing.",
                "I gained a great insight into South Africa during apartheid years and post-apartheid years in a way that simply wouldn't be possible from a history course. I also developed insights into the ways in which specific themes such as women, animals, dirt and cleanliness, cities and queerness manifested in South Africa and in its representation. I learnt a lot about the transition process and the Truth and Reconciliation committee. I also developed my writing skills through writing three papers and was introduced to incorportating secondary materials into my work.",
                "Learned a lot about South African history which was so interesting especially since I knew almost nothing about the country beforehand. The class really challenged me to analyze literature beyond pure close reading, and I think Steph is such an amazing teacher of literary analysis that you come away not only with more perspective on how literature operates, but also a greater appreciation for its role and value."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Lots of areas for discussion, so if well-facilitated, can lead to various conclusions and takeaways that build knowledge. \r\nWeaknesses: There isn't any primer for apartheid history, so people coming in without any knowledge of historical events can get really blind-sided.",
                "Strengths: consistent and organized schedule\/structure, AMAZING teaching, lots of engagement consistently from most of the class\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, discussions got really derailed\/abstract, which is a problem for some people",
                "This was an amazing course. A strength was definitely Stephs teaching. She was so involved and interested that it became contagious. Another strength was all the opportunities for participation and presentations. One thing I would have liked would have been to receive more constructive criticism on presentation style and structure. Because they werent graded and werent meant to be stressful we didnt get much negative feedback but it would have been helpful for personal progress.",
                "The class has so many strengths and very little weaknesses in my opinion. The major strength is the professor who teaches this classes who is so invested in the topic and her students. This contributes to a lot of the other strengths of the class such as the wonderful developed syllabus with thoughtful novels selected for course reading, activities such as presentation and analysis of various art subjects such as poems, pictures, and cartoons. Furthermore, the overall engagement in the class led to an enjoyable and enchanting classroom discussion that didn't disappoint. All of this tended to the overall strength of the class. On the other hand, the only weakness I'd say is that we had to read a lot in a very short amount of time. At times, It was very difficult to stay on topic of the readings with the demands of a lot of stuff outside of the class.",
                "First discussion (Tuesdays) could benefit from having a specific question to start it off given beforehand. Other than that, a perfect course.",
                "Strength: STEPH!!!! I also liked most of the books we read. \r\nImprovements: since it's a book a week I sometimes felt we were moving too quickly\/not actual delving into the text of the book. But it was also nice if there was a book I didn't really like we would only spend two classes on it. I would also say it would have been helpful to have a class or two at the beginning of the semester purely with historical information surrounding apartheid because I did feel like as a class we were missing that foundation.",
                "I really liked the way in which examined a variety of media beyond literature such as looking at cartoons, magazines, photography and art within the presentations.  The essays provide a lot of room for creativity, developing interests and reserach. Steph is also a wonderful professor who is definitely a great strenght of the course.\r\n\r\nI think the course was excellent, but the reading load is definitely pretty substantial - a book a week. This meant that certain weeks we had a book to read, paper to write, usually a book to partially reread for the paper and sometimes a presentation as well. Ultimately this meant that certain weeks I was unable to fully appreciate the book as it was too rushed a read.Some of the novels are very hard-hitting and reading them at 2am in the library was particularly brutal. I think this class is also highly dependent on the people in the seminar too.",
                "Steph is such a gem!!! So smart, so knowledgeable, so kind, and so willing to go above and beyond to help you learn and get the most out of the class. You learn so much and have really rich discussions, and the syllabus has a great variety of texts. Reading load is reasonable but heavy (both in volume and in content\/depictions of violence); I honestly used the readings to procrastinate other work because they were so engaging. I really appreciated the balance of workload and the use of the discussion board in addition to both essays and presentations. I really dont have any weaknesses (let alone complaints) at all."

                "Yes! As a first-year seminar, this is a good course and definitely very engaging. It is an intellectually stimulating course, and you will also get clear feedback on your writing. Workload might be a bit too high since you'll have to read plenty of novels, but if you read ahead of time, you'll be good to go.",
                "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to any and all students. If you're on the fence about taking it... TAKE IT!!! It's an amazing course with great teaching, engaging content, thought-provoking conversations, and lots of cool people you'll get to know during the seminar-style discussions",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend. It was eye opening, really interesting and somehow fun despite the difficult topics discussed.",
                "Absolutely! It is a great honor and privilege to take a course taught by Stephanie Newell. It's nearly impossible to find a class topic and professor who will provide an experience like that done by Newell's classes. Newell is a holy grail of Yale teaching and every student who has the opportunity to enroll in her class should capitalize on this opportunity.",
                "yes!! Steph is an amazing teacher that somehow generates insightful comments every minute of class, while still listening to each student's opinions, too.",
                "YES YES YES!!! Steph is amazing. This is the best class I've taken at Yale. You'll learn a lot, and it's honestly not that much work. You technically read a book a week but they're novels so they go by pretty quick. You then write a blogpost a week (but they're pretty chill) and three essays throughout the semester. Steph is super chill with extensions and just wants you to learn so she's flexible. All in all AMAZING class, would 1000000% recommend.",
                "YES - I would! So far this has been my favourite class that I have taken at Yale. It has made me very keen to take some more global literature classes at some point. I am not an English major and hadn't taken a literature class in a while so this class was a little bit daunting however I really enjoyed it and have a whole host of books that I can't wait to read this summer! I think the books selected are gauranteed to prompt some interesting conversations and I got a lot out of almost all the books we read, even books I enjoyed less. As with most classes, the more you put into this class the more that you will enjoy it - stay on top of the readings and you will definitely enjoy it.",
                "Hands down. Regardless of major or interest, I think this course is just super worth taking. Incredible professor who will work with you to create essays that you are personally interested and invested in, great syllabus, and eye-opening texts and discussions."
