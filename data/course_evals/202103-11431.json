                "I wouldn't say that I learned too much from this course. If anything, I learned how to take constructive feedback on my writing from others in real time. For example, in classes, we would workshop our writing by having one person read their story aloud and everyone give feedback. I did learn some technical elements of storytelling, but they felt very specific to the class and did not radically change my view or ability to storytell.",
                "This course taught me how to formulaically I repeat formulaically prepare interesting, engaging autobiographical stories. The course allows students time and practice developing stories from our own lives into engaging stories rather than simple retellings of prior events. We learned how to review our stories and hone them into a medium that can consistently engage their audiences, no matter the storytelling format."

                "Really fun course, loved hearing everyone's stories.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- good workshopping of stories - taught me about ways i could improve my stories and gave me insight into other peoples lives\r\n- homework assignments were fun to listen to and read, perfect work load\r\n- essay assignments were engaging because they were non fictional and about our own lives, which is not commonly something written about in classes\\\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- the seminar style class was not very engaging\r\n- i didn't feel like i was learning a lot of new content besides the components of storytelling\r\n- i would've like to learn more about the harder parts of storytelling (eg character development, formats of stories, rhythm, genre, opening lines, closings etc) not just the components that make up story telling",
                "A strength of this course is that it was never stressful. It felt low stakes and like I really could bring questions to the class, and feedback was usually clear and constructive. The weaknesses were that it was extremely unorganized and we ended up not having readings for the second half or doing half of what was in the syllabus.",
                "Strengths- Engaging course, accessible/practical readings, very clear goalposts to meet in order to succeed, focus on storytelling strategy above all.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Course was perhaps too light on content at times. Class did not follow the syllabus, so readings and projects were up in the air until a few days before the due date. The course did not give much attention to advanced storytelling techniques, and there is a large focus on written/oral stories. I would have liked to see a week or two addressing alternative methods of storytelling, such as through interviews or film."

If you are looking for a course in which you can learn a lot of valuable soft skills (ie. how to tell a story in front of an audience or how to communicate effectively), this class will be helpful for you. The professor is also incredibly clear with feedback and will help you through anything you may need to work on!",

                "No. Do not take this class.",
                "Yes and no. I like the premise of this class and i believe storytelling is a powerful tool. However, the class itself didn't feel very productive.",
                "I would not recommend this class to another student unless they were looking for a low-workload, low-stress fifth class. When we did have readings they were very fun and engaging, such as listening to moth stories or comedy shows. That was the highlight of the class.",
                "I would recommend this course to students in STEM or the social sciences. As a humanities student, this course felt a little bit unchallenging."
