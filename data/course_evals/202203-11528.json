I learned how to synthesis information, how develop a strong claim, and how to utilize the bass research platforms at Yale.",

I loved our seminar style class and the work load was very reasonable. I would have love to spend more time with Yale librarians as our class visit provided very great insight.",
                "Strengths: the Professor brought current events into the conversation, which we looked at through the lens of the course topic of censorship.\r\nWeaknesses\/improvements: despite being a seminar, this class was mostly lecture. I wish I had been able to have more discussions directly with my classmates.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it is not tailored to a specific student audience, meaning anyone can excel in the course.",
