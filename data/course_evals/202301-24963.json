                "I developed a deeper understanding of Roman history and an ability to synthesize and engage with a plethora of scholarly articles. Moreover, I now feel confident in assessing and understanding how \"objects\" fit into the study of history and will no longer neglect their significance.",
                "I have learned so much more about Roman history and culture than I could ever have imagined was possible just by studying objects. This has been such a fascinating course and has totally changed how I view material culture (not just restricted to ancient Rome)",
                "I have come away with incredible visual analytical skills  -- I had no idea how much could be gleaned by closely looking at an object. As such, through material culture analysis the class dived deeply into the Roman understanding of themselves, of their history, of their families, and of those on the peripheries of the empire. This focus on social factors and the Roman psyche was even more interesting than mere history -- I feel like I'm well acquainted with them despite the millennia between us. I've also developed even greater knowledge of Roman history, from the Republic to the Empire. I learned so much through the course of the semester!",

                "Fantastic course! Very well taught, loved the discussions each week",
                "Strength: unique approach in teaching about Roman civilization from unseen perspectives (freedmen, provinces, early settlements) and using a framework based in material evidence, not textbook-based, well-facilitated discussions, relatively comprehensive coverage of Roman civilization both geographically and chronologically\r\n\r\nSuggestions: could be good to always start with an informational quick lecture to set the background of discussion, some of the group-based activities took a little too long (perhaps not every group has to share, or could spend less time on them, and discussion alone sometimes not helpful to learning content even if they were engaging)",
                "I did not see any weaknesses. The strength, in my opinion, was definitely the engagement of both Professor Johnston and Ziming (the feedback from both of them was incredible and helped me improve so much). I also enjoyed the breadth of the course in moving from object to object week to week, while still maintaining specificity in the object itself and the specific history. I also loved the smaller writing assignments and the ability to synthesize all your skills in the final paper (the support in the final paper process was also incredible)",
                "Prof Johnston and Ziming are the GOAT",
                "Prof. Johnston and Zim were the beating heart of this course. They made every class so engaging with fascinating lectures, engaging activities, and open discussions about the objects every week. I also thought they picked excellent readings to contextualize the objects we studied.",
                "Strengths: Professor Johnston is an incredible professor, among the best I've had at Yale. He is enormously knowledgeable on the subject and is extremely kind and attentive. He leads very interesting seminar sessions that perfectly mix discussion, teaching, and the occasional brief lecture. I've also really enjoyed the fun activities we've engaged with and the visits to the YUAG. Awesome class!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "This course was very nicely organized so that, despite seemingly unrelated objects each week, we were able to trace the evolution of Roman society at a large scale. The objects were excellently selected and the activities that accompanied our discussion was both fun and helpful in providing a more well-rounded understanding of how the items were used in their historical contexts and how they may be misconstrued by modern audiences. The writing exercises were also well spaced-out and cumulative, and the feedback provided was thorough and helpful in improving our skills. Both Professor Johnston and Ziming Liu were very accessible and dedicated to helping the students get the most out of the class. Perhaps the course could be improved by"

The approach to the study of history using material evidence is unique, you really work with objects and practice visual observation skills so important for producing 'original research' that will help beyond just this class. You can design this course around what you want to learn more about, through the flexibility of the writing assignments!",

                "One of my favorite classes. Fun and low-key but also extremely engaging and intellectually stimulating, it is very multidisciplinary, blending archeology and history to develop an understanding of the Romans and their world. Each seminar felt perfectly crafted and it's apparent lots of thought went into designing the class, with mini-lectures, activities, and structured discussions. The highlight is Professor Johnston, who is an incredible scholar, seminar leader, and teacher.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in art history or history in general, as well as for archaeology students looking for a somewhat different perspective on the field."
