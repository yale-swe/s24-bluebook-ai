                "Strengths: promoted critical thinking and the final project allows you to learn a lot but is broken up into very manageable chunks\r\nWeaknesses: Prof Leonard is an amazing teacher and I think she has learned a lot from her first semester of teaching here. Lectures were engaging, but we did a lot of student presentations which were not",
                "On the one hand I think the group work and projects were fine, it they were only done once in a while. But a huge weakness of the course is that there was no real exams, just one final paper and then a lot of group work. I did not feel like the group work was designed in a way that taught me anything. Sure, we got better at public speaking, but I took this class to learn about Dev psych. I feel like I'm walking away knowing the few studies that I did my group work on really well, but nothing much other than that.",
                "i appreciated that there were no tests in the class, it allowed us to engage with the material just for learning without pressure. I also found a lot of the projects to be quite engaging but a weakness was the amount of in class group projects and presentations.",
                "If you want to learn how to present scientific information, this course is for you. I really did not learn much about developmental psychology and you can get away with not paying attention to anything in class as it can all be done outside of class on your own.",
                "I wish there were more lectures done by the professor over group projects and presentation of the group projects. I tended to learn and take away a lot more when the professor was lecturing. This is not to say the group projects were not engaging, I just wished there were less of them.\r\n\r\nA lot of professors say they don't believe that tests should define our grade and how we do in a class but don't actually put that in action. I think this was a great class where the professor actually attempted to teach without testing. I learned a lot without all the added stress especially as someone who isn't a great test taker but is willing to put in the effort.",
                "Strengths: Professor Leonard is a wonderful lecturer, and this is a fascinating topic! Weaknesses: Only that Prof. Leonard didn't spend enough time lecturing! Instead, a lot of class time was spent with students giving presentations. It would have been great to have more time with Professor Leonard sharing her knowledge and insights on these topics. I also think that more frequent, smaller assignments would have been more effective for my learning than a few very large assignments.",
                "Since it was a shift in professors I understand that there will be course difficulties. With that being said, the group projects were not a good way to grade. I was placed into a group where minimal work was done and due to this, I received a grade I did not deserve.",
                "I went into the course with the impression that it would be a standard lecture course. I was surprised to find that there was a very high amount of group projects and presentations. I think the group project and student-presenting format was hindering to my learning. It was hard to follow student presentations, as they were all formatted differently and it seemed somewhat disorganized.",
                "Strengths: no exams, creative assignments to engage with the material \r\nWeaknesses: difficult to actually retain knowledge because there were no exams",
                "Weakness: We could have had more guidance with the final paper.",
                "One major strength of the course was the nature of the assignments - they were diverse and provided enough direction to allow for student creativity. The biggest weakness of the course was the lectures themselves. There were no quizzes and the assignments didn't really line up with the content of the lectures so there really wasn't any incentive to pay attention in class. The lectures did feel like a bit of a waste of time.",
                "For me, the lectures were the main strength of this course. Prof. Leonard is a wonderful lecturer -- it's clear how much she is excited about the content, and that makes lectures really engaging. She was also really responsive and easy to meet with. There were no tests in this course and I was still really engaged during each lecture because I found the content to be so interesting. We had several group presentations assigned, and, for me, this was a weakness. I think too much class time was spent on students presenting to one another, when we would have actually learned more from Prof. Leonard herself. A couple notes, though: 1) I don't like group presentations in general and have friends in the course who enjoyed this aspect, and 2) this was Prof. Leonard's first time teaching the course and she continuously mentioned that she is incorporating our feedback for the future, so I imagine this will change to some extent.",
                "A lot of busy work.",
                "I would have liked to have more personal feedback on my assignments.",
                "Not having any exams made the class a lot more enjoyable. Really good class and lectures were presented well and were engaging.",
                "Strengths: lively professor and interesting content\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of a group projects",
                "Amazing Professor!  Great class, really centered around learning and engagement.",
                "The course was not very focused on grades and traditional assessments which was refreshing.",
                "Strengths: very interesting topics were covered in class\r\nWeaknesses: too many group projects slowed down our intake of more interesting topics that could be covered",
                "The course started out a bit disorganized and rocky since this is her first time teaching at Yale. However, Professor Leonard cared a lot about improving, and by the middle/end it was so fun and enjoyable. The assignments at the beginning were a bit unhelpful in terms of the content, particularly since she divided the huge lecture class into groups of 4-5 or so to individually present to the rest of class, which took up a lot of time and no one was really paying attention. But by the end, the content and assignments shifted towards more engaging work and lectures and was super interesting.",
                "Strengths -- high energy professor, great use of videos in slides. Weaknesses -- way too much group project-based learning. Since all assessments of the course were based on projects, I felt little motivation to keep tabs on how much material I was retaining on all of the content learned.",
                "no more debates!",
                "Developmental debates (on controversial topics in devpsych) were fun and engaging. Papers were enjoyably loosely defined so we could write about whatever interested us most. The reverse inference challenge didn't really work, but did teach us lots about our topic.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- got to engage with a lot of different students\r\n- academic freedom to choose to work with topics that interest you\r\n- lots of real-world application from both information and types of assignments\r\n- lots of feedback from instructors\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- group presentations took up a lot of class time, and lecture sometimes felt rushed\r\n- though amended to be more forgiving, having graded lecture participation during COVID was a bit concerning given the considerable amount of contact tracing/development of COVID-like symptoms from colds etc. that would hopefully prevent people from going to in-person class",
                "Interesting content and good lectures, however not super intellectually challenging.",
                "strengths: the professor! she clearly loves the material and her lectures were engaging and easy to learn from\r\nweaknesses: none!",
                "Great structure, great varied assessments, great teaching team that was engaged and cared and made time if you asked.",
                "One strength was availability of resources (from both professor Leonard and both TFs). I found it very easy to communciate with all of them and they akways gave very constructive feedback. \r\n\r\nOne weakness was some of the structure. I almost wished the three debates were back to back, to keep students engaged and so that the workload of the course was even throughout the semester. I know some people that debated early and got it out of the way vs other students that debated during the last week of classes which was stressful.",
                "Strengths - lots o opportunities for engagement \r\nWeaknesses - some group activities should potentially be edited for maximum engagement",
                "Too many presentations for a lecture. Two presentations should be the maximum. Also, a lot of what we were learning in class as far as content was not needed in our work for the class.",
                "There were too many projects and presentations that it was difficult to keep track of everything. The lectures by Prof. Leonard were really interesting and most helpful to my learning. I wish that fewer of the lectures had gone towards group presentations. The final paper was a little bit strange to write since we had to make up results, but overall I learned a lot from the assignment. I am torn about whether a final exam would be beneficial. Perhaps having the first half of the semester organized around lectures and a midterm exam would make sense so we have a really strong foundation, and then the second half of the semester could be more project oriented and allow us to focus on our areas of interest.",
                "The course primarily revolved around group projects and presentations -- getting through all the class presentations took a really long time, and students were often made to rush through presentations that they'd spent a long time preparing. The lectures were really interesting, but because of how many days were spent on projects / presentations, there weren't actually that many lectures and they felt kind of disjointed.",
                "many group presentations that were not always effective to learn from (but will be adjusted!",
                "Strengths: low workload, interesting content, no exams\r\nWeaknesses: the pollEvs. I definitely understand having some sort of lecture quizzes to encourage attendance, but poll ev just had a lot of issues",
                "strengths - engaging lectures\r\nweaknesses - sometimes the class material and assignments weren't conducive for learning",
                "Rather shallow and a bit slow on the progression of concepts that we learned. Far too many group projects and days when i completely checked out in class because entire sessions spent on group presentations of research papers or debates - this didn't feel like a good use of anyone's time. \r\nOverall good energy from prof and TFs with great presentations and engaging videos to illustrate concepts.",
                "I really enjoyed lecture and appreciated the interactive nature of the course but do wish it was slightly more lecture-based.",
                "The strengths were the uniqueness of the class and the way Professor Leonard was able to make a lecture class feel engaging and close.",
                "Strengths: Professor is very invested in teaching, not just memorization like the old model of the class \r\nWeaknesses: Too many student presentations",
                "I think this class could have use more interactive components to be more engaging but I think the structure of the lectures functioned well."

                "Yes! Professor Leonard is amazing and I'm sure she'll get even better the more she teaches. Take this course if you'd like to learn for the sake of learning and engage with the material in a way that is different from other classes. The public information project and the final research paper are essential elements of the course that make you think, but are super manageable and divided into chunks that make it so they do not feel to challenging. Show up to class! Prof leonard does really care about whether you are there and if you are learning.",
                "Not really if it is taught in the same way. Like I said I think it could be taught much much better and more organized.",
                "I think the course was overall okay. It wasn't the worst course I have taken, but think there are better psychology courses out there that are more engaging.",
                "Yes! Children and babies are fascinating and trying to figure out how to test what they know takes a lot of creativity that we learn about in class.  However, this is an extremely introductory course, one of the projects was actually able reading research papers. As an upperclassmen, assignments like this were less engaging than compared to the in class debates that we had.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in this subject! It may be possible to coast through this class with relatively little engagement, which it seems like many students did, but if you want to get more out of it, Professor Leonard and the TAs are great resources and you should go speak with them!",
                "No, unless you need to take it for major requirements.",
                "Yeah. If you're interested in psychology. It is possible to learn something valuable from this course but the assignments take up a good chunk of time and attending the lectures can be droning.",
                "Yes! I loved this course. I found all of the content super interesting (there is a good amount of overlap with what you would learn in an intro psych or cogsci class but I learned a lot). Prof. Leonard is a great and engaging lecturer, and it's clear how much she likes the material she teaches. There are definitely things I would change about it (I think we spent too much time on group presentations and should have had more lectures from Prof. Leonard) but this was her first time teaching the course and I think it will only improve in the future. Also, there were no exams, which meant that you get out of it what you put in. I loved lectures and paid attention during them so I felt like I learned a lot, but it was definitely possible to zone out and not walk away with much from the course.",
                "Yes, it was interesting and helped me with public speaking (we did a lot of projects that required speaking in front of the whole lecture)",
                "I would recommend this course to any student that is interested. It gives you a good understanding of how we learned the things that seem so normal as an adult.",
                "Yes I would recommend. Very interesting and fun class. The class format is a nice change from usual classes",

                "Yes! It's fun and interesting, and Prof Leonard is great! She tried out lots of different projects and learning styles- I thunk this class will get better and better over time.",
                "Yes! Super interesting and I think its really important to know about development. It was different from other classes Ive taken because it encouraged lots of group work and projects. I would def classify this as a gut",
                "i would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in learning more about developmental psychology",
                "This was the first time teaching it, i would recommend prof leonard, but i assume the structure of the course will be different next time it is taught.",
                "Of course! I would recommend this course to anyone interested in developmental psychology.",
                "Definitely! A must take class",
                "I would recommend this class to early psychology students who have an interest in children's development. I think thee class had a lot of interesting and engaging information and surveys a variety of topics so you can find what you are more interested in further researching. If someone is looking for a more hands on class tho I wouldn't recommend this course."
