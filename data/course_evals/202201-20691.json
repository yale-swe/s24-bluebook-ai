            "comments": [
                "The strength of the class is that all of the assignments are practical. All concepts that we learn are applied to our project, and we learn how to work with a team in the real world. I really liked how we all started out on the same project to understand the concepts and then were given more freedom in the second half of the course. The only thing that I could think of improving on would be having more in-person lecturers instead of them Zooming in on a computer, which is more a fault of current circumstances.",
                "The course was great but I think we should have more time dedicated to the design project part of the class.",
                "Loved the series of guest lectures and field trips throughout the semester. Being able to shadow Dr. Wiznia in the OR as he performed a hip replacement surgery was also an incredible experience for a BME student.",
                "To start, I think the class could have more potential if it was structured a little better and students have more time to work on their projects. You spend the first half of the semester on failure analysis and FEA, which was not super helpful for almost all of the project. The class expected you to learn how to 3D print and use the resources at the CEID but it would have been better if there was a whole class on just that. Watching training videos and then actually performing the task is two completely different things. Having a class where we go over tools that we could potentially use and getting hand-ons training would have facilitated a better experience. Getting back to the FEA, I think it would be better if students not working on orthopedic projects to have a more simplified project and getting more training on 3D printing, which almost everybody used. Overall, I think if we had more time working on the project itself, we could have gone a lot further in the prototyping stage. \r\n\r\nIn terms of lecture, I did find the small class field trip we took to be very helpful and learning about why medical devices are important in a clinical setting. However, some lectures were not helpful in terms of advancing our project. I think there should be more emphasis on device design and prototyping at the beginning of the semester. Learning about FDA approval and patents were great but considering that nobody's prototype was fully developed halfway through the semester, these lectures should be saved for the very end. It would be helpful if the final device presentation was 1-2 week in advance. That way the last few lectures could be on advancing the prototype further outside of the class for those students who are interested.",
                "The strengths were definitely the accessibility of the professors, the collaborators for our projects, and the teaching fellows. Everyone I interacted with was super invested in the course and were always going above and beyond to help out. Even just based on the number of speakers we had and the number of field trips we took in and around New Haven, you could clearly see how much time and energy our professors put into the making of this course. \r\nHowever, I really do think this course needs to change slightly. The whole first part of the semester was devoted to modeling different implants and learning a new software which is certainly a great skill. Except then, we had to do a 180 and dive into our product design, mine being one that used 0 skills learned in the first half of the semester. My project was mainly centered around CAD and 3D printing so a lot of the skills from the first half of the course were not necessarily useful to me. Because there were a lot of ortho projects that relied on Abaqus/other software but also a lot of projects centered around 3D printing and CAD, I feel like the first half of the course should be split between these two trainings. I had no experience with 3D printing at all and felt rushed to learn that material on my own. I think our products would be much further along if we had more focused trainings on this.",
                "I wasn't a big fan of the FEA project. It felt like we were just copying exactly what someone else was doing and didn't actually gain any skills. I think it would have been better if we all developed an initial product and learned how to use the laser cutter and other valuable tools.",
                "The main strength of the course were the continuous resources available for support during our project.",
                "I really enjoyed the hands on nature of the class, and both the midterm and final project. I didnt always get as much out of the guest lectures, and I feel like I would have appreciated a few more hands on skill building sessions (like the FEA one) for some of the classes instead",
                "The guest speakers and visits are unbelievably good. The material covered in the class is immensely relevant as well.\r\n\r\nI only have one minor suggestion - it would be great if the course were structured to allow people to start on the projects earlier on in the semester.",
                "Strengths: interesting projects and strong engagement from mentors in general\r\nWeaknesses: Not all projects are created equal. I'll leave it at that.",
                "The hip implant failure analysis was useless in my opinion. That time would have been better spent working on my project.",
                "I loved the projects and the field trips, but the first project was not very engaging.",
                "Field trips were certainly a highlight of the course! Additionally, the class was strong in the wealth of knowledge it provides surrounding the making of medical devices all the way from conception of an idea to mass production. However, the way this information was delivered through guest lecturers could be a bit boring.",
                "This course was truly incredible and I learned a tremendous amount and enjoyed every bit. The guest speakers were extremely engaging and taught my material that I would never have been exposed to such as the FDA regulatory process, IP law etc. A weakness of the course is that it depends heavily on outside group project work time which is sometimes hard to coordinate with busy Yalies! I think the course could be improved by creating structured work time every week so that students have an overlapping time to work on the project.",
                "strengths: incredible field trips/opportunities (seeing surgeries, companies, real clinical settings, etc), professors who really care, i felt motivated to learn on my own in a non-stressful way\r\nweaknesses: i didn't really get to know anyone in the class other than my project group. i had a great time with them but it would also be nice to know the rest of the class a bit better too! one improvement would also be to spend less time on the FEA project because we really only had about 4 weeks to focus on our final project. by the time we figured out an idea that we wanted to prototype, we had about one week left and it felt very rushed creating our device prototype. if more time could be spent dedicated to the final project, i think that would be more valuable."

                "Definitely but keep in mind that your experience strongly depends upon the project that you choose and the teammates whom you get paired with. I happened to get super lucky in both areas and has an amazing experience, but don't assume that you will also get this lucky.",

                "Yes, I would highly recommend the class! The instructors are incredibly nice and the course staff is very helpful. I took this class as an EECS major and learned a tremendous amount about the Biotech space.",
                "yes!! super fun, very cool course that you will love if you are interested in the intersection of medicine and engineering. i loved the flexibility of the course. i feel like i was given the space to learn on my own, and i truly did learn so much. you definitely get out of the class what you put in, but it's very worth it to put in a lot :)"
