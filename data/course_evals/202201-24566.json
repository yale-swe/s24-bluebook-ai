                "We read Rabelais's Gargantua, a foundational text in French literature (the first modern novel). We examined the text under all sorts of angles, starting with a close reading of the themes of body, laughter, war, religion, and education that are at the forefront of Gargantua, and with questions about the novel's structure.\r\n\r\nMme Brancher likes to use very academically rigourous secondary literature that probes the historical context of themes and episodes brought up in the novel. We recontextualized many important scholastic and political debates that happened in 16th century France, and saw how Rabelais treated them and responded to his critics. Class discussion was all over the place in the good sense: it was energetic and jocular, and we often confronted a small number of 'big questions' like the reliability of text\/reading, the meaning of freedom and liberalism, and debates on the topic of mind-body dualism."

                "The course had a good mixture of primary and secondary readings. The instructor's class presentations were extremely engaging and thought-provoking. My only suggestion would be that the student presentations were quite demanding given the required duration. I think these would be more effective if they were shorter; this would also allow the instructor to give more feedback and it would leave more time for discussion.",
                "The greatest strength was the structure. Mme Brancher gave lectures and led discussions for the first month or two, and we ended with classes that were initiated by a student presentation to which she provided context and other insight. The discussion in class was very free-flowing. Very light workload! Only one book to read, though the secondary literature does pile up (and is in fact quite necessary to go through, though I don't bemoan that at all). A short paper, a presentation, and a longer final paper."
