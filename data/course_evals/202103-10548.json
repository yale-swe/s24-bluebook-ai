                "I learned that science is about precision. Everything you write and say must be precise to every detail. This is something I struggled with before and during the class, but it has made me more aware going forward.",
                "I gained a deeper understanding of immunology and microbiology.",
                "I learned all about microbes, sicknesses, and various pandemics/epidemics. It was a very very interesting class. I would 10/10 recommend for anyone even remotely interested in immunology.",
                "I learned the basic concepts of biology in addition to the social implications of disease and its effects on history.",
                "scientific literacy skills and in-depth knowledge of the immune system as well as immunity and microbes on a social/historical context",
                "I loved learning about topics in epidemiology and immunology as well as the social and political impacts of various diseases. Amazing class to develop a well-rounded understanding of diseases and their role in shaping history.",
                "Knowledge: I gained a basis of understanding for both the adaptive and innate immune systems of the human body. We learned about inflammation, pattern recognition receptors, T/B cell receptors, T/B cell activation, the function of different type of immune cells/the proteins they create, creation of diversity within the immune system, immune system memory & vaccinations. I also learned about the state of immune systems during different types of autoimmune diseases, during COVID infections, HIV/AIDs, smallpox, polio, and influenza. We also spent the last few classes talking about the microbiome and its relation to the immune system. \r\n\r\nSkills: learning how to decipher complex diagrams about the immune system, reading scientific papers (necessary for in class discussions and the final project)\r\n\r\ninsights: not only did I gain a lot of insight as to how the immune system functions, but I also learned a lot about the connection between society and immunological discoveries and advancements. Many of our readings (epidemics and society, polio, etc) were from the perspectives of historians that traced the evolution of diseases as society rejected or accepted scientific advancements.",

I learned about the adaptive immune system, the innate immune system, the history behind big pandemics like influenza, HIV/AIDs, and HPV, and we talked about the science behind COVID-19. We discussed the healthcare system and went to the YUAG to learn about artists in the time of the pandemic."

                "Strengths was that I loved everything I was learning about and got to learn new things as well. Weakness is that the topics were sometimes difficult or science-heavy/detail-heavy but otherwise fantastic.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting material and interactive ways of engaging with materials (trips and active learning) \r\nWeaknesses: I felt very singled out towards the end of the class despite multiple efforts to ask for help. It felt as though sometimes I was graded more harshly and didn't receive constructive criticism (especially towards the end it felt like destructive criticism).  The book that we received was helpful generally, but the phrasing of it made understanding the material confusing. I put a lot of effort into this class and sometimes felt that my work wasn't reflected in my grade.",
                "Strengths of this course include a great amount of teaching. A big weakness of this courses is failing to make clear that students should come into the course with a through understanding of certain biological systems and vocabulary.",
                "Strengths: all of the material is very interesting, not a lot of physical homework to be done, however requires lots of studying. \r\nWeaknesses: it is heavy in material to learn, so should be taken in consideration with other class workloads in mind",
                "I enjoyed how the course was split between science lectures and discussions. It was interesting to learn biology while also discussing the role of social factors in the spread of disease, and how the disease has affected history.  At times, however, both parts of the course felt a bit rushed. I didn't always feel like I left with a solid understanding of the science because we moved so quickly.",
                "great organization of slides and course information, the provided booklet was super helpful.",
                "The class was very well structured and I felt like we spent a well-balanced amount of time on problem sets and readings respectively. Cannot think of any weaknesses for this course.",
                "Strengths: allows students to gain a broad overview of the immune system as a whole and apply it to current and historical epidemics, small group discussion time was highly valuable. I learned a lot from this course, and I found the booklet provided in this course was incredibly helpful and information-packed. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would personally be interested in learning more about specific areas that are currently being researched and what advancements have labs/individuals made, but I understand there is a time constraint since we have so much to learn. I also think the quizzes could be better constructed to better reflect what we learned in class.",
                "Overall, the class was structured well and I loved the field trips and unique opportunities. Sometimes, the lectures in class time were rushed.",
                "Lectures are vary fast and cover a lot of material, especially when class time is split with a reading discussion or other activity. I think if lecture classes could just focus on lecture there would be more time for questions and other activities could be done on non-lecture days.",
                "The course's scientific aspects were very informative, and I particularly liked the interdisciplinary aspect of discussing history books. My favorite part was the YUAG art trip and the fact that we read many papers on different topics. I loved that we received a solid foundation in the immune system. \r\n\r\nOne major difficulty I had was following the science. It went very quickly and was hard to follow. The slides were really dense and too full of information. But, the amount of information/pace was perfect. I wish that the lectures were recorded so that we could rewatch them on our own and we had HW beforehand to read the lecture before class. \r\n\r\nThe quizzes/tests seemed also too high-stakes; there were very few points available in the class."

                "If you love microbes or you like learning about the science behind your immune system and microbes, this is a fantastic class. If you don't, this is still a fantastic class. Beware, you will go very in depth when it comes to immune system reactions. Be prepared to learn about the ins and outs of that. This class was amazing.",
                "Yes, I would recommend a student take this class because of the fascinating concepts. However, although you don't need a sufficient biology background, it can be confusing without AP Biology (at least). I would say this class is a nice lead-in to MCDB courses, and if interested take it.",

                "I would, but it is definitely helpful to go in with at least a basic understanding of biology. However, it is an interesting science class especially for non-stem people because it has a reading/writing/history aspect to it. It was really neat to take this class during the pandemic because it helped me further understand how the pandemic affects the body and how vaccines work.",
                "yes, such an engaging and intellectually stimulating course",
                "I would 100% recommend this course! Whether it is the breadth or depth of the material covered, I feel like we hit it all! Definitely furthered my interest in biology and public health, especially in the context of policy and social change over time.",
                "Yes, regardless of future career/academic interests, immunology is relevant and this course does a great job in introducing students to it. At the end of the course, you have the chance to do research on your own topic of study, applying the immunology learned from this class. It's genuinely really fulfilling to be able to read scientific papers on current topics of interest and understand the science behind it. \r\n\r\nI also really enjoyed the intimacy that the small classroom provided for discussions-- I definitely felt comfortable sharing my opinions and learning what others had to say.",
                "Yes, it's a great exposure to the field of immunology.",
                "Yes. If you are interested in the immune system!",
                "Yes! It was an incredible dive into the immune system and I learned so much about pandemics over the years. I can now think critically about scientific research into pandemics and how we can sociologically address them."
