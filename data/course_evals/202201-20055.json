                "This course was a fantastic introduction into the discipline of Anthropology through a thematic core which engaged a wide range of students with a great amount of diversity. I specifically benefitted from how the course structured its readings because the instructors kept an eye out for impact when it came to thematic content, making the readings particularly beneficial. I also enjoyed the amount of nuance that anthropological thinking brought to the analysis of capitalism, which forced me to often take a step back and reconsider my analysis from multiple perspectives.",
                "Really insightful ways for thinking about capitalism and its lived experience. Loved getting to do fieldwork.",
                "I learned what anthropological writing was and learned how to effectively \"skim\" texts. I also learned how to conduct research and how to work well in a group paper environment,",
                "I gained the analytical skills and knowledge background to contextualize capitalism in society and people's every sociopolitical lives. I also learned how to employ ethnographic methods to analyze a capitalistic firm.",
                "I learned a multiplicity of ways to approach and evaluate capitalism as it affects culture and daily life. This was also a great crash course in ethnographic reading and writing!",
                "One of the few opportunities to take an Anthro class where you actually get to conduct ethnographic research! Learned so much from just that portion of the class, definitely the highlight",
                "I learned how to critically analyze as well as write ethnographies, as well as read social theories about capitalism.",
                "I had no idea what anthropological writing was before I took this class, so this was a cool learning for me. I really enjoyed engaging with some of the foundational economic and social theory like Marc, Smith, Weber, and Harvey. I think this course gave me a great intro to the field of anthropology and what its about",
                "I learned a lot about anthropology as a discipline",
                "I learned how to think about capitalism outside of the realm of supply and demand, but explore how people experience, perceive and mold this economic structureif it can even be abstracted as an economic structure at all. I learned to read and analyze ethnographies and gained insights into how to think about capitalism and economic systems more broadly.",
                "My perception of capitalism has greatly changed. Rather than a neatly defined, Adam Smith encapsulated essentialist system, this class taught me to understand capitalism as a process that is always in flux and doesn't conform to neat boundaries. Through reading ethnographies and looking at the lives of people under various economic constructions, I gained a better understanding of what it meant to live under and adapt to capitalism.",
                "I gained a strong vocabulary and theoretical background around capitalism and how it manifests itself in everyday life. This course teaches you to appreciate and observe small-scale phenomenons and gives you a great base to observe capitalism in your life and in academic research. The readings are incredibly engaging and teach you well about ethnographic fieldwork and best practices in that."

            "comments": [
                "I think the course structure might be improved by dividing it into two one hour sessions over the course of the week. At times I found that the conversation got bogged down and students did not seem as engaged. The course is definitely very strong in its understanding of the students' skillsets and was at a very good level of rigor to both challenge and reward students for their efforts.",
                "Strengths: All of the ethnography we read was terrific. Yanagisako and Mitchell's theories of capitalism were much more productive than the strong theory we read, though I think its useful to start with that groundwork. Really, the readings were great. Prof Rogers and our TF Michelle were also terrific, led great discussions, and had really insightful comments about the way we might think about capitalism and its lived experience. The paper was extremely fun to research and write.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Reading Weber. It felt like a lot of topics we didn't have enough time to talk about, and there was a substantial amount of questioning from certain students about whether or not certain things were capitalism, which I think struggled to recognize that its a lived experience that affects people daily. Really wish we could've talked about certain readings more, especially Cattelino and Fattal, as well as Yanagisako, Mitchell, and Ho. Some of the readings were long, but they're honestly really good. The group project part of the paper was a bit weird...my group was terrific, but writing a paper with multiple people is never easy, and I honestly probably could've written 20 pages myself with extreme ease.",
                "I think the class was a little large for group discussions. It never necessarily felt like we were discussing, instead everyone was just regurgitating what the text said. Every now and then someone would make a comment that I felt like could be expanded on and made into a discussion, but people just moved on. \r\nI also wish we could've learned a little bit more of what anthropological writing was, especially leading up to the midterm which was very difficult with little direction.\r\nOther than that, I really liked the texts we engaged in with the course and office hours were really helpful, and the project was one of the coolest pieces of  work Ive done at Yale.",
                "strengths: great readings and interesting material, Prof. Rogers facilitates great discussion\r\nweaknesses: felt like we could have read more books to engage with ethnographic material",
                "Strengths  well-crafted syllabus, interesting readings, Prof. Rogers is great at facilitating discussion and creating a fun classroom environment, and we got great feedback from our TA. Cool final project too!\r\nWeaknesses  more an issue with any once-a-week seminar, but I often wished there was a way to break up the class time with more activities, rather than just discussing the readings for 1 hour 50 mins.",
                "I really liked all the readings and many of the discussions were really great. There were a number of moments where, and I havent taken a class that really covered many of the ideas we discussed before, I would have preferred for Prof Rogers to take a little bit more control of the discussion. While loose discussions are really nice to talk about whatever students found impactful in the reading, if Rogers had really helped us narrow in on a key insight or structured some more obvious closure at the end of class, I think I would have been able to carry ideas between the weeks much better.",
                "Strengths: Prof DJR and Michelle, the TA, were very involved and receptive, facilitated conversation well.",
                "The readings were appropriate for a once-a-week seminar (around 100 pages per week). The feedback and instructor availability was absolutely amazing. so much detail and care. I didnt love how some of our discussions got side tracked from intellectual discussion and analysis sometimes, although I would say this was rare. I would love if professor Rogers and Michelle would talk more in class. They basically served just as facilitators and sprinkled in a few words. Would love for them to share more of how they analyze readings and their backgrounds! They are so smart and interesting.",
                "great, super friendly Professor and TA, most of the readings were interesting",
                "Strengths: Taking a sophomore seminar was a fun experience and a good way to learn to be in a seminar class, where if felt like everyone was around the same place in their college career. The readings were really amazing, and I felt that every class provided me with more insights into the world which I didnt have before. \r\nWeaknesses: the seminar format of this class meant that if I was confused about the readingwhich I often wasit would take me the entirety of class to become un-confused. It would have been nice if Professor Rogers had ordered our discussion a little bit more clearly, and maybe spoken to us about some of the concepts beforehand."

                "I would recommend this course to another student with the warning that much of anthropological thinking is very descriptive in a way that can sometimes feel frustrating because anthropology is not necessarily in the business of judging human behaviors and patterns of conduct in a way that offers a prescriptive answer for how to improve society. This is of course part of the field and an important thing to learn in the class, but I found it frustrating.",
                "Yeah, but push hard for discussion topics.",
                "Yes if you are interested in ethnographical writing at all.",
                "Yes, if really interested in capitalism and anthropology because the class, readings, and prof\/TF were really interesting. It was also unique to write a group ethnography about NHV businesses. Definitely deepened my understanding of how capitalism permeates our everyday lives, but felt like I needed to engage with the readings more to walk away with more knowledge\/skills.",
                "Yes! Sophomore seminars are rare and super cool, and this was a great intro to anthropology and an effective way to learn more about capitalism and its effects.",
                "I loved reading the ethnographies. If you havent read and then discussed full length ethnographies before, this is a great class to start. Also a vital class for Econ majors who need to learn that humans dont experience the world as points on a graph. The final project can be fun to do, an introduction to fieldwork is great, I had Ana amazing group for my final project, but I still really dont like having to write a final group paper, thats kind of what we are stuck doing for the medium of the project, but just be aware of that. The Prof and TA do make it a very achievable paper.  Some of the discussions could feel a little meander-y, which I think is inevitable for a two hour seminar, so make sure that you are comfortable with some weeks of long readings and meandering discussions, and if you are good with that then this can be a great course",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! This is a great seminar class; the readings are really interesting and the prof is very knowledgeable. The final project is also very insightful, although it can be challenging to write a long group paper. It is a get what you put into it kind of class, and I think I enjoyed it mostly because I genuinely tried to read as much as I could and that helped me engage more deeply with the seminar discussions in-class. I would definitely recommend!! It's a cool class and everyone is a sophomore which makes it a less nerve wracking seminar style class if you haven't taken many before. It can be hard to get in touch with the prof though, as most office hours and questions are directed to our TF, but she was also amazing and super helpful! Overall, definitely one of the best seminars I've taken at Yale so far.",
                "Yes, absolutely",
                "I would, if you are into anthro or willing to be open minded to the way this discipline works. Its very different from the more straight edged disciplines i had studied before (history, stats, econ). I think this was a great complement to my knowledge though, and valuable for my growth as a student. I started this course wanting to know whether capitalism was inherently exploitative, what capitalism actually was, and whether there were better alternatives or whether we should just accept capitalism as a flawed but best-we-have system. I did not answer any of these questions, and anthro as a discipline does not like to make such generalizations. Instead, I answered questions like how does the culture of wall street enable the reproduction of capitalism? and other niche topics like that. Really enjoyed the readings. Just know that you wont come away with black and white conclusions about capitalism; the discipline and course intentionally tries to muddy these definitions and anything you consider black and white. Teaching was fabulous. I did find writing a group paper to be frustrating and inefficient. I wish we had each done our own interviews, shared them, then written about conclusions and findings on our own. It is challenging to write a cohesive essay with one thesis about 4 peoples papers combining. Otherwise, I enjoyed the assignments. I think there could be clearer instructions before the midterm paper. I had no idea what the kind of argument we were supposed to be making was, and therefore did poorly on the midterm even though I put a ton of effort into my paper. Providing a successful example essay could remedy this. Really enjoyed group discussions when they stayed on the topic of the readings which was most of the time.",
                "I would recommend only if the topic interests them",
                "I would definitely recommend this class! It was an amazing experience, and I feel much more knowledgeable about capitalism and able to have conversations about what capitalism means for people.",
                "Definitely! The readings can be hard and confusing, but in many ways that the point of the class. The understanding and perspective you walk away with is invaluable, and I'm so glad I gained this new outlook on an otherwise impossibly unwieldy system. The readings will make your brain hurt, but Professor Rogers was wonderful at guiding us through. Also, everyone else in that class was so smart and made connections I had never even thought to consider, I learned just as much from them as anything else.",
                "Yes! You only get one shot in your Yale career to take this, and I think no matter your major or interests it's incredibly interesting and applicable. It's shaped how I view the world and gives you great vocabulary and tools for interpreting manifestations of capitalism in everyday life or other coursework. Your final project is also a small-scale ethnography, which gives you a piece of small origin research and exposes you to a (potentially) new research method."
