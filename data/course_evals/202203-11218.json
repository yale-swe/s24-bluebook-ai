                "Strengths: well-designed labs that train non-coders step-by-step\r\nWeaknesses: Class contents on voting and polling were a little bit light, less intellectually challenging, and less thought provoking",
                "Professor Kalla is great, he's very engaging and approachable. The workload is low and the psets are interesting and fun. Can't think of a way to improve the course.",
                "For someone with very limited coding experience, I found this class very accessible. The labs build up your knowledge of Python gradually (and do rise a bit in difficulty towards the end of the semester), but they always felt doable. I do not recall spending more than four hours on any given lab, and the TA\/ULA team was extremely helpful whenever we had questions. I appreciated that Professor Kalla gave us time at the end of class to work on our labs, as this made getting our questions answered much easier. \r\n\r\nThe content covered in class was also fairly straightforward, and very digestible. I appreciated that the scope of the class was not overwhelming (i.e. the class took a \"less is more\" approach). The assignments and final project also gave us plenty of room to explore topics of interest to us.",
                "Labs were hard but manageable. Content was very interesting!",
                "Great class!\r\nVery good for people who don't know much about python and still interesting for more experienced python programmers",
                "The professor is awesome, the Tis were great, and I liked the format of it.",
                "Strengths: Prof Kalla is passionate and very knowledgeable about the subject, explains concepts extremely well and committed to each students' understanding (when asked to re-explain, would do so and ensure students understood conceptually not just how plug in etc). The topics in the class are selected intentionally (we were able to see real data sets of voters, real data from canvassing orgs etc, new articles and understanding analysis behind them) that it made it more interesting to learn the data science as well. The homeworks and problems we were assigned felt meaningful to work on!\r\n\r\nWeakness: While I understood the philosophy of coding is learnt best through doing and we had time in class to ask questions, given the size of the class and also varying coding backgrounds of the students, it might've helpful to walk through an example together of a hard\/moderate difficulty problem in class together. Some felt there was a slight disconnect between the coding based homework and largely conceptual nature of the lectures. Nonetheless, it was definitely doable especially with the availability of office hours.",
                "Strengths: so many. The collaborative portion of each class makes it super approachable, even if you dont have a strong coding background. professor Kalla and the TFs were also very straightforward about the expectations. \r\nWeaknesses: we didnt get keys of the labs, so there is no way of checking your work besides your grade.",
                "Very helpful professor and TFS. Even though we do not learn the coding in class the labs are well structured to help you learn. I found that having to figure out the coding myself helped be better understand what I was doing.\r\n\r\nLectures were interesting and relevant.",
                "Strengths: prof was good, content was interesting\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The Python modules were extremely clear and I feel much more confident in my ability to analyze data in Python\/Pandas after taking this class.",
                "I wish the course had been way more specific  teaching us to grab, interpret, and display data for very particular cases and problems instead of broad conceptual work. We never learned anything at all mind-blowing  and data is such a pivotal part of politics today! I wish all of the exercises for homework had been taken from real life examples of data display and manipulation. This course was very manageable, but it never felt like the homework, readings, and lectures were synced, and I would rather have worked harder for more interesting content than skimmed the surface as we did.",

                "I really enjoyed the lecture portion of the class, where Professor Kalla would talk about the theoretical concepts surrounding campaigning. The coding section of the class was very difficult for me and I would have liked more guidance in this area - I know that coding is very self-taught based, but as someone who learns by doing, it would have been helpful to walk through some examples at the beginning of the class.",
                "The class was well-thought and immersive. I feel like I learned a lot in a short amount of time. I do wish there was more support when learning how to code but attending office hours really helped.",
                "I think the biggest strength of this class was the connection to the real-world that we were able to make all the time. It made the content a lot easier to understand because we got to apply it to something that we understood.\r\nA weakness in this class was not really going over the content in the lab before we started them. I feel like most labs we were left to figure out alone with the internet and I realized during the second midterm review that had we had a breakdown of every function before the lab, it would have been a lot easier.",
                "Prof. Kalla is phenomenal and does a great job at introducing new topics at a digestible rate. I think we could've talked about coding a bit more during class; however, I like the structure of using the last bit of class to ask questions about the lab and work on it in class.",

                "The course was very well organized. Something that really irked me however was that the short essay was single-spaced. I hate writing assignments single-spaced if i doesnt include a word count. Its much more depressing. I liked how the class was split in two, one part for the lecture and the other part for coding. While the syllabus says half and half, its more like two-thirds lecture and one third coding. I also did not like how office hours was meant to only answer specific questions and not air sur and be with the TF or other students. I dont understand why that was discouraged.",
                "I think that the labs were really helpful to look back on and build my understanding of python",
                "The strengths of this course is that the class lectures are very clear, Professor Kalla is very thorough with his explanations and welcomes questions throughout class, and clearly tells the class what he expects us to know and understand for the midterms.  Another strength is that the second part of the class is for starting work on the weekly labs; this also allows for students to ask questions about the lab in person before working on the labs outside of class. \r\n\r\nOne way that it could be improved is by having more office hour sessions before the lab is due."

If you go in wanting to learn about data science and campaign strategy, you can learn a lot - but I do know people who didn't put in as much effort and then weren't satisfied with the results. It's a pretty chill class, so if you're into the subject matter you should definitely consider taking it.",
                "Yes, for sure. Anyone interested in social sciences and looking to go into industry should take this class. It's exceptionally well taught, and you'll learn some super useful data analysis skills that should prove super useful in future jobs and internships.",
                "This course was an incredibly easy QR credit (though to be fair I was familiar with Python after having taken YData the previous semester). The material is objectively relevant to politics today, and wasn't dull exactly, but even having never studied Polisci in college I could basically have told you everything we learned before we learned it. I thought that the general YData class helped me to learn Python and apply it to fascinating and particular coding problems really quickly in a really fun way, and YData for political science was just never as exciting.",

                "Yes! It's a good introduction to python especially if you've never used the language before. The grading is fair. The instruction is accessible. I liked the format of the final project because you could really dive into whatever interest you have.",
                "If you have a desire to become better at coding and python while simultaneously learning more about the effect of Big Data, then this class is for you. Students have wide creative range for creative projects, and there is always help available if you need it. Put the effort into this class and you will be rewarded.",

The lectures are interesting and the psets can be challenging, especially in the second half, but theyre not too bad, especially if youve done coding before. If you havent it might be tough. Professor Kalla is a great teacher though, and you really feel like youre learning real skills.",
