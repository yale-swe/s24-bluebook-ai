Importantly, this information was provided through the original papers of each of these systems, which helped in building a better foundation towards reading and evaluating academic papers.

                "It was very instructive. The projects were also very helpful towards understanding some of the course subjects.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Course material is very well designed. A wide variety of topics and approaches. \r\n- Dr. Khandelwal is a very clear presenter. His depth of knowledge and understanding of the _context_ in which these papers are published is enormously helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Most classes consist of: \"read a paper at home, write feedback, show up to class, listen to someone talk about a paper you already read, then sit in silence for 20 minutes while other students ask extension questions\". \r\n- In order to write intelligent feedback about the papers, I need to have understood the papers well. And if I've understood the papers that well, the student presentations don't do much for me. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't have a solution for the problems above. Fostering a \"discussion\" style environment is a difficult problem. \r\n\r\nMaybe if the student presentations were kept to 10 minutes each, and the discussion for another few minutes -- then it would be useful? Maybe the solution is to watch the student presentations first, _then_ read the paper and respond, _then_ talk about more advanced topics. Maybe we just need more guidance in terms of what cool questions to ask after the paper. IDK.",
                "Strengths: The course covers some of the most important systems in the \"Big Data\" domain, proving useful insights on which problems each of these systems solve, what its background was at that time and why/why not they became successful. While this domain is enormous, this course offers comprehensive information about its most notable sections/points of interest, in order to provide an excellent starting point for research in this space. Furthermore, I enjoyed the programming project, while it required too much time in order to learn Rust and build a sufficient prototype of the system requested.\r\nWeaknesses: I believe that the students would benefit from one or two classes specific covering Rust, given its rather steep learning curve, as the whole project requires it and it is not required knowledge.",
                "The material of the course and its overall structure was very helpful. The paper review format was very useful for graduate students.",
                "There is a strong emphasis on student discussions in the course which can both be a strong point and a weak point depending on how the students engage with the current material. Overall it was good.",
                "The paper assignments were very instructing and also covered a wide range of datacenter development throughout the past decades.\r\nThe assignments were also very useful, as I familiarized myself with Rust and got to choose some design tactics (especially for assignment 2)."
