What's even better is that Zoom breakout rooms provides ROTC students with the opportunity to discuss ethical scenarios and hold competitions. This is very easy to do online.\r\n\r\nClass is 7am on Fridays, which can be a pain, but is also great since it frees up the rest of Friday for other classes that may interest you."

If not, you just chill in a discussion room, talking about ethical scenarios and preparing your brain for analyzing real-life leadership situations. It is a very low-commitment class (although even as a civilian you must be there 10 min early to not face the wrath of the officers.) This Fall 2020 semester, former Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Richardson even dropped by to speak."
