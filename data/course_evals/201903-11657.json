   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is only composed of eleven question sets and a final exam. If there was a midterm exam covering all information learned up until the midpoint of the semester AND a final exam covering all information learned after the midterm, I believe students would be less overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information presented in this course.",
    "The class would be improved so much more if there were quizzes or midterms. There is too much content and students can't be expected to be constantly reviewing it in preparation for the final. If there were smaller exams, it would force the students to study smaller, more digestible chunks of the course. It is too dense to study in one week.",
    "This course allows for a super-comprehensive understanding of the brain and its functions. I wish we could have more engagement opportunities with our professor, other than review sessions.",
    "I think more guidance in what will be on the qSets would be helpful. I would honestly recommend a midterm, considering the final is cumulative AND the first closed-book assessment in the class.",
    "Strengths: material interesting, case studies add a lot to learning. Professor McCarthy is a great teacher, really engaged with the material and funny. The qsets help consolidate learning and the online lecture notes really add to the class.\r\nWeaknesses: the final is a lot of content and a bit stressful since there is no midterm.",
    "I learned a lot of cool information but sometimes it was hard to follow all the info given",
    "The strengths: the lecture recordings, the online resources and lecture notes, the review lectures, the weekly assignments, the professor, the content, the feedback on q sets, the organization of content... all excellent. really excellent.\r\nThe suggestions: perhaps leave time for questions during the lecture. I'm sure people have lots of questions but are afraid to ask them. Maybe stop every 5 slides to ask for questions. I guarantee that people will ask you questions! I think the speed of the class far exceeds what most people in your audience are understanding or learning.\r\n\r\nI wish that there was a midterm exam for the class. I understand that there used to be a midterm exam, and from personal experience, I think I would have forced myself to learn more material for an exam. I would NOT get rid of or replace the weekly q sets, but rather have a short midterm (low point value) halfway through the semester to help keep us accountable. \r\n\r\nOr perhaps the midterm is on anatomy only. (This could even be early in the semester.) I think if I had spent more time with anatomy earlier on, then the rest of the course would have made much more sense to me. If I was going to make ONE suggestion, it would be a LARGER and EARLIER emphasis on ANATOMY. Anatomy is not intuitive for most people, and I thought the anatomy review lecture was fantastic, and informed all of my later learning\/understanding. This lecture should be mandatory viewing before the first class! One lecture on anatomy is not enough to understand for people who are not neuroscience majors (I am a cognitive science major). Another idea I had is that during lectures, maybe you can go over the most commonly missed q set question from the previous week (?) or maybe do this when a certain question is missed by a lot of people.",
    "Lectures are organized strangely, wish more papers could be read and discussed, hard to get help outside of designated times",
    "I love the weekly QSets. I wish there were sections in this course, even if they were optional. I think discussing the content would have been fun and helped keep the concepts in my mind throughout the semester.",
    "weekly qset format was a strength",
    "I think the content is fascinating, and the problem sets are a good way to keep students engaged with the material without putting too much pressure on them. However, I think the level of depth to which we need to know each topic is a little confusing because the amount of detailed covered in lecture versus lecture notes versus textbook versus problem sets varies greatly, so it can be difficult to know what we need to know.",
    "The class itself is pretty interesting -- it's cool to be learning about things as they are being discovered. The biggest issue with this class is that there is so much material and when it comes time for the final exam, it's nearly impossible to remember everything. I would suggest maybe having a midterm for the first half of the course and then a final that just focuses on the second half to break everything up.",
    "This course is great, but only having one cumulative final at the end only lends to cramming and undue stress, not necessarily learning. I would prefer if we kept the weekly question sets, and did away with the final in favor of three non-cumulative midterms throughout the semester, similar to many psychology classes.",
    "Strengths were the weekly open note q-sets-- workload was not bad for the class at all and these make up 70% of the grade. However it does make the final exam quite difficult because there is so much information. Even though the final was quite difficult it is only worth 25% of the grade. It's a great credit D as well.",
    "Strength: weekly qSets, set up for gradual learning\r\nReally a great course, just very difficult material",
    "Weekly open-note psets that make up most of the grade are a nice way to review and get feedback. But one large final at the very end was pretty overwhelming as there are just so many topics covered in class. I think it would really benefit from splitting the topics into a midterm and final.",
    "I liked the weekly qsets because they required you to engage with the content every week as opposed to twice a semester for exams. I understand the need for so much contents, since the brain is a complex organ, but I wish the course didn't require you to memorize so much information or know so much detail.",
    "I would have preferred to have at least one midterm instead of having no midterms and then a cumulative final.",
    "I liked the weekly open-note problem sets in place of a midterm--because we have so much information to learn, it's nice that a lot of our grade isn't based on our ability to memorize. It was fast-paced, but material was brought up again and again throughout the course, so we got regular reminders about past concepts (also, it was interesting to see how multiple concepts connected to each other). I didn't love PollEverywhere because it's pretty easy to cheat that system, but I guess there aren't many other ways to evaluate participation in such a large class.",
    "I fell asleep or zoned out in most lectures since they were not engaging or fun, but I thought the content of the course was very interesting and I learned a lot.",
    "This course is incredible important for understanding the brain; anyone who does psychology should be familiar with this content. I think that the material covered is fascinating, but quite dense. The structure of the three-hour 'qsets' each week is really helpful, I think; it's much better than doing just a midterm and final. That commitment to review material each week and answer questions preps students for the final and requires students to be thinking about this material very thoughtfully each week. Since the material is so dense, perhaps the offering of more review materials for the final would be helpful, specifically something like worksheets that have various brain images on them for students to practice identification with.",
    "strengths - open note qsets, reviews sessions, prof mccarthy is really sweet and bright\r\nweaknesses - SSS 114 sucks, qsets are long, final is dense, lectures can go over your head if you're not being attentive",
    "This course presents everything there is to know about neuroscience. It was an amazing course. On the flipside, it is impossible to learn everything presented in the course because it is so much information.",
    "Strengths:  very in-depth and well organized notes by the professor; covered a broad expanse of information. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  the Q-Sets were graded \"to the notes\" of the professor.  Thus, I often lost points because I hadn't worded my answer like the professor, or included one of the categories laid out in his notes.  Over the course of the semester, I felt like I learned that I needed to simply reword what he had already said.",
    "the organization of material made it difficult to learn however the professor gave us a lot of help: lecture notes, review sessions, lecture handouts",
    "I loved the course notes and that each lecture was filmed. If I could make one suggestion it would be to streamline the notes a bit, or to offer additional shorter notes that relate only to material that will be covered in lecture, because I found myself studying those notes before class and then having much of it not be covered in class, which made it hard to decide what to focus on when studying.",
    "The weekly question sets did not help prepare students for the final exam and discouraged students from studying consistently, and instead encouraged spending three hours a week digging through notes and the textbook to try to find very small details that were not emphasized in lecture.",
    "Lectures well organized by topic, plenty of opportunity to ask questions and review before exam, qsets very helpful to boost grade before exam. Just unsure about exactly what to focus my attention on when preparing for exam-- lots of information spread out over many areas.",
    "Everything is online and very accessible. Really helpful. There were weekly timed PSets and a hard cumulative final exam but that was only 25%.",
    "Great material, but its SO MUCH. The fact that we never had a closed book exam until the final made me feel very nervous about the final because I had no idea about the level of specificity that would be required  which turned out to be, A LOT.",
    "Super informative and interesting class, dry at times but generally fun, and organized in a way to really facilitate learning. The only downside was the amount of material that had to be covered for the final, and the final threw some curveballs testing things that were mentioned only briefly in class.",
    "I think the syllabus for this course is awesome and really comprehensive. The course website with lecture notes is absolutely fantastic. I found the lectures themselves to be somewhat dry and difficult to pay attention to for the full 75 minute class. I would recommend perhaps spending less time on the minutiae of neuroscience methodologies,  because while that is useful for someone intending to pursue graduate study in neuroscience, it wasn't terribly interesting.",
    "Strengths: Professor McCarthy structures the course exceptionally well. He provides notes on the content of all the lectures, records lectures for later viewing, and holds regular Q+A as well as review sessions to prepare for the final. I think the class provides a good overview of the basic concepts of neuroscience and the structure\/function of the brain. The weekly open-book question sets are challenging without being stressful, and provide a great opportunity to do well outside of the final.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the only thing I can think of is that without a midterm, we're left guessing about the level of specificity of the final. However, Professor McCarthy does a pretty good job of cluing us in on what kind of test it will be (he provides comprehensive information on the format), and was very helpful in pointing out what to focus on during the review sessions.",
    "I liked that there was no midterm, but I found the lectures covered way too much content.",
    "Strengths: super interesting material, well organized, Professor McCarthy knows his stuff\r\nWeaknesses: intensive memorization, the final is very long and cumulative",
    "I liked having the weekly qSets, because they helped me review the things we learned in class, and the lectures were very organized. However, the final exam was much harder than what we were used to, and I don't feel like we received enough preparation for it. The root of the problem may be that there is simply too much information to memorize--after all, we are trying to learn about the entire complicated human brain.",
    "The content of the course is actually very very interesting but there's just way way way too much. An impossible amount of material for the final exam.",
    "Strength: The lectures are posted and it is very convenient to be able to go back and watch them before qsets and the exam\r\nweakness: The exam is extremely difficult and mentally costly in comparison to the qsets",
    "Professor McCarthy clearly had a very proficient knowledge of the material and he taught it very well! I particularly enjoyed the videos because it showed us real life examples of the topics we were learning about. However, I would appreciate maybe having more tests throughout the semester. It was somewhat overwhelming memorizing everything at the end of the semester. Some psych classes split up the exams into 3 midterms and I think doing something like that would be great and would help me memorize and retain the material. Or even just having a midterm would help. It wouldn't feel so overwhelming at the end.",
    "A lot of information, could have been more geared toward biology\/the actual science, more so than the historical background and the \"irrelevant\" content",
    "There is so much information to learn.",
    "Strengths: A lot of information is covered and the professor seems genuinely interested in what he is teaching\r\nWeaknesses: because there are no exams prior to the final exam, you have to study an insane amount of information for an exam that has a format youre unfamiliar with",
    "I think section could be very useful if added. Also the TS sometimes did not provide the correct answer when I got it wrong on the qset or did not get full marks for some reason. Providing the answer could be very useful for revision purposes.",
    "There is so much information to learn and its very hard to do so with only one exam",
    "I appreciated the qsets for weekly learning but I would like there to be more focus on anatomy in the qsets.",
    "I really appreciated the livestreaming lectures and reviews.",
    "The lectures are great, the Q-sets are super helpful, it's just a whole lot of information to be memorized and maybe having certain key elements instead of giving everything equal weight could help in preparation for the final.",
    "The lecture notes posted before the class, and the lecture posted after each class were very beneficial to me and allowed me to answer questions that I might have had during lecture.",
    "very organized -- i would have liked a midterm exam and non cumulative final",
    "Strength is how good lectures are and how interesting material is. Weakness is sheer amount of material  exam is rough.",
    "The course covers a lot of material, which is at once overwhelming yet after studying for the final\/doing problem sets, you learn a lot.",
    "Strengths: The lectures and material is very engaging even if you are not interested in neuroscience or psychology. There are also many resources to supplement\/review learning including lecture notes that Professor McCarthy hands out before class, and video recordings of the lecture. I also enjoyed the PSET assignments, which allowed me to review the material and get a deeper understanding of what we had covered in the past weak.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the only weakness for this class is the structure of the final. There is no midterm in the class so the final (its only 25%) but covers everything. While there were review sessions, these did little to focus the massive amount of material that was covered in the class. Also no practice exams were provided so it was difficult to understand what was expected. I began studying over Thanksgiving break and still felt overwhelmed and rushed to finish my studying. I think that this class could be improved if either a midterm was assigned or there were fewer lectures on the final.",
    "The lectures were very interesting, well organized, and always posted online for further review. The review sessions were also posted online. The workload was fair and typical for a Yale course (ie. 1 problem set per week), although the problem sets were timed which could occasionally cause problems so I recommend students rewatch the lectures right before starting and refer back to them during the problem sets. The grading was also fair and largely based upon the problem sets (70%), which I definitely prefer and find much less stressful than courses whose grades are comprised almost entirely of 2 or 3 exams. I think it was a great class and I'm not sure how it could be improved. The professor was very responsive to student concerns and questions.",
    "Strength\/weakness: very thorough\r\nStrength: he offers a lot of resources so you have the content you need through his slides\/campus press notes\r\nWeakness: not very effective at making students learn the content throughout the semester",
    "- structure is weekly open notes open computer P-Sets, which puts pressure of exams aside.\r\n- lots of content, hard to understand what is important.",
    "This course was very useful to facilitate learning in terms of the way that there were videos and notes for each lecture and that we did qsets each week. I think, however, it was so much information to learn that it would have been useful to have midterms so we could take each chunk of information, and learn the important things in small chunks, rather than have an overwhelming midterm.",
    "This course is great as it is. The Q set structure is a great way to engage with the material. I would place less emphasis on clicker responses on one's grade because the app is very unreliable. Another thing I would change is reducing the harshness of late Q sets submissions; there is a 10% grade deduction per late day. Since Q sets take 3 hours and you cannot pause them, finding a 3 hour chunk of time was more difficult some weeks than others due to school, work, and extracurricular responsibilities.",
    "It was very interesting but the amount of information was overwhelming",
    "It was hard to really engage with the material until you really had to before the exam.",
    "strengths: The professor broke down his lectures in a very logical and structured format, you knew what to expect in terms of slide layout and lecture structure every class, which was really nice (no surprises). \r\n\r\nweaknesses: there is an immense amount of information thrown at you in this course. it can feel really overwhelming at times to keep up with it all. also, the lectures notes would not always match up with what we learned in class, making it difficult to gain clarification about confusing concepts if you are only looking at the lecture notes.",
    "The course is extremely well-structured and Prof. McCarthy is a great lecturer.",
    "There was minimal work during the year (one 2 hour q-set a week) and then an absurd aount of studying for the final, should probably change that ration around",
    "A strength of this class is the way it is organized. By the end of the semester everything tied together and I had a fairly strong understanding of the brain. However, it was overwhelming at times. It was hard to adjust to the pace and sheer abundance of information per lecture for the first third-half of the semester but once you get over the initial shock and settle into Professor McCarthy's teaching style it's fine. In the moment, I felt as though I knew nothing but when I was studying for the final I was shocked at the amount we'd learned in a semester and it was quite a rewarding feeling.",
    "There is simply too much material covered, a lot of it irrelevant to an introduction to the human brain. The open-note qsets just provide a false sense of security, and setting aside three straight hours every week to complete them was inconvenient. Preparing for the final is a frustrating nightmare, as it is difficult to discern what of the mass of information to prioritize since it's impossible to learn it all.",
    "Required sections in addition to lecture would help to reinforce the information",
    "Strengths: While the first half of the semester covers the neuroanatomy of basic systems (neurons, vision, sensory perception, etc), the second half is much more interesting, because it integrates these parts into broader processes like learning and memory. Even though he teaches a large lecture, Professor McCarthy makes himself accessible to students and genuinely cares about our learning experience in the class. \r\nWeaknesses: Very information-heavy, and sometimes its hard to tell which details are actually important. Make use of weekly reviews and course notes to keep up!",
    "I do think that the structure of having one huge final determining your grade was stressful",
    "i dont think much could be improved it was a very strong course.",
    "Strengths: \r\n- Really comprehensive overview of the brain; \r\n- Riveting material; \r\n- Poll everywhere questions were very stimulating and helped keep us engaged in the content of the lecture;\r\n- Professor Gregory McCarthy is absolutely brilliant;\r\n- Weekly question sets helped us stay on top of our studying.\r\n\r\nHow this course could be improved:\r\n- I loved how much material we covered, but I also think that it was a bit overwhelming to go over all of it for finals (even though completing the weekly question sets was helpful in ensuring a sense of familiarity when looking over the material for the last time). Maybe if there were at least one midterm, studying everything for the final exam wouldn't feel as intense.",
    "I liked the qsets and I appreciated that even though they were open book, you still had to put thought into them. However, one thing I would change is the final exam. To have to memorize 26 lectures was extremely difficult especially as we had never been tested closed book on the material. I believe there should be a midterm exam and have the final exam not be cumulative. It is so much material and I felt expected to know every detail. I wasn't sure quite what to focus on.",
    "Strengths are qSets, weakness is final preparation. I spent hours upon hours studying, went to all the review sessions, and still felt that I wasnt given a good picture of what the test would be. The way the questions were worded was the hardest part.",
    "Strengths- very thorough, if you spend the time to get to know the material in depth you will be prepared for most psych courses \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- theres a lot of material",
    "best course I've taken.\r\nWas very challenging but rewarding.\r\nFinal exam was very difficult.",
    "Strengths: Prof. McCarthy; the organization of the course, the lack of a midterm, open book qsets, notes available online \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: me",
    "Lectures were so engaging and interesting and the weekly qsets ensured that everyone was on top of the material. However, having a cumulative final proved to be extremely stressful at the end of the term, so another method might work better in the future.",
    "The strength is the content of the course. It is really interesting! \r\nThe weakness of the course is that the lecture itself is very boring and dull. It was hard paying attention to the professor for 1h and 15min when he is just talking continuously without really engaging with the class. The lecture and the lecture notes were also a bit unstructured and confusing.",
    "A lot of memorization but it is worthwhile",
    "There was so much material and it was unclear what we needed to know for the exam. Also, the grading for the question sets was a bit unfair. Points were removed for not including things that were not explicitly asked for in the question. The lectures were really good.",
    "The course moves at a very good pace and the material is interesting. However, I felt very unprepared for the final, as there were no other assessments in the course. If there was maybe one midterm, I could get a feel for how Prof. McCarthy writes tests, which would be helpful.",
    "there is a ton of information but if you keep up throughout the semester you will be okay",
    "The strength of this course is that is covers a lot of material throughout the semester and each lecture is very well organized by topic.",
    "Strengths: very well structured and laid out\r\nWeaknesses: such a big class, can't really communicate with T.A.'s and T.F.'s. Grading also varies from T.A.",
    "Nothing to improve",
    "The qsets were superb. They facilitated my learning the most.",
    "The q sets are a fantastic way to review the course material and I found that they helped me to solidify the knowledge really well. I think one thing that could be helpful toward the end of the course would be loose guidelines or a study guide of the important topic throughout the coursepotentially just an outline that students had the option to fill in for their own studying, I found that my studying needed a bit more structure than the review sessions provided.",
    "Strengths: Like the qsets, feel like it is a productive way to understand and engage in a way with all the material\r\n\r\nWeakness: Feels a lot like memorizing a whole bunch of stuff instead of learning.",
    "The weekly psets help student engage in the material and continuously learn. However, I felt ill-prepared for the final.",
    "This courses strengths and weaknesses both originate from the sheer breadth of material covered throughout the course. Beginning with the basic anatomy of the brain, progressing through various sensory and emotional systems, and finishing with psychological neuroscience allowed students to understand the brain on both tangible and abstract levels, and the course is conducive to a well-rounded understanding of the brain. The downfall of such a variety in subject matter is the quick pace at which we must discuss it. While there are various other courses that will focus on different parts or functions of the brain in greater detail, the pace of NSCI 160 is quite rapid. We did cover all the material that we needed to address, and Professor McCarthy presented it succinctly and clearly, but I think overall class comprehension would increase with more visual representations of various processes and anatomical regions. To have a diagram or chart solidifies information that may seem abstract if only presented in words, and I think the course would benefit from the inclusion of more images than it already has.",
    "This class will teach you a great deal about the brain if you keep up and motivate yourself to review the material (there is no midterm to force you to study). Having one cumulative final exam can make exam period very stressful if you take this class for a grade.",
    "Taught very well, lots of student support (weekly quiz sets, recorded lectures, lecture notes online)",
    "I think this is an overall excellent course. The material is challenging but extremely compelling at the same time. Sometimes I got lost the small details and had a more difficult time grasping the big picture. I think a little clearer explanation of how each lecture relates to the next in a broad sense would have helped my understanding.",
    "The course incorporated a lot of material and had multiple sources of information for students to use.",
    "Good structure in class. The qsets helped me learn a lot and retain information.",
    "This has been one of my favorite courses at Yale, primarily because of its content and the way in which it is taught. The information that one has to memorize for this course is absurd. There is so much material and studying for the final was an extremely hard task. The course is very much based on memorization and so much on understanding concepts, and I think that it could shift its focus a bit more towards that. I loved how the lectures were structured and presented during the semester, as I thought that there was a great flow and coherence in that organization. The concepts were all very interesting, and many times got technical and emphasized on the underpinnings of why things happened, which is something that I particularly enjoyed. The QSets were extremely helpful in testing the most important concepts in the course and reinforcing them.",
    "Could have a mid term because it was difficult to learn everything right at the end of the course. I liked the way that the problem sets were timed.",
    "Honestly the timed qsets are nice because it means you wont have to spend more than 3 hours on them (since you literally can't), but it means you are only forced to think about what you're learning for one chunk of 3 hours each week. If the format were different it might encourage students to engage with the material more regularly.",
    "This was, by nature, a challenging course. It's strengths were that the weekly question sets were designed to challenge us but also to help us better understand the material and made for less memorization. Also, Prof. McCarthy's lecture notes online and weekly review sessions were great.",
    "I consider the weekly online quiz of the course a strength, because it measures our understating of the subject in a regular basis. Something that may be improved is the use of poll everywhere that presented some difficulties in some classes.",
    "Prof. McCarthy is an amazing lecturer. I was really, really sad for the class to be over. It's like watching a show! Final was maybe the most difficult I'd ever taken just because there's sooo much material to cover. But the final is only 25%, so I think the grading system is fair.",
    "Extremely well organized. Did not use the book so I guess telling students before they buy the book and spend 100 dollars.",
    "I would have liked more end-of-term quizzes based on all the material. The material was a lot and I focused on details that turned out to be irrelevant for the exam."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless it is required for their major. If the student is a psychology or cognitive science major, I would recommend Intro to Cognitive Science instead of this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone interested in Neuroscience. Otherwise, I would not.",
    "If you can prioritize this class's work in your semester, I would recommend the content. But if you can't dedicate a significant amount of time, it will quickly overwhelm you.",
    "Yes, any student who is interested in extensive learning about the brain should take this course. Students who just want an interesting psych\/neuroscience  class should not take this course because it is too much content and very deep in terms of knowledge.",
    "Yes, the material was very engaging",
    "Yes, it was really interesting and you learn a lot it just can be confusing at times because there's a lot of info",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I absolutely loved it, but I love neuroscience. Please know if you take this course, you will be accountable for your own learning. Most people glide through the semester (very little weekly commitment, all lectures are recorded) but then get bodied by the final exam. If you can hold yourself accountable week to week, you will learn a lot and do well. If you are excellent at cramming, you will also do well. If you don't fall into either of those categories, consider yourself warned. It is an incredible course and the information is very relevant to our lives. It is a bit nitty-gritty. I would suggest watching a lecture online from the course website to realistically estimate if you would enjoy the class.",
    "No, unless it's required\/can centralize all time in this one class",
    "Definitely! I absolutely loved going to these lectures. You always learn something interesting, even if you may need to put extra effort into understanding it. Put in the effort, and you wont' be disappointed with the results.",
    "I would recommend this course because I think the material is really fascinating, and I came away from the class feeling like I learned a lot, or at least understanding a lot of the material covered. I did have a good grasp of psychology and biology before coming to this class, which certain helped, but I think its a good intro class that still gives students a good amount of education on the topic.",
    "If you are interested in neuroscience or neurobiology, this is a good introductory course to take. It's pretty comprehensive and Professor McCarthy is very knowledgeable. I wouldn't recommend taking it if you're not genuinely interested and have a heavy semester.",
    "Absolutely! Especially for psych or cognitive science majors. It's so interesting and Professor McCarthy is a great lecturer.",
    "I would, but only if they understood what they are getting into. An incredibly challenging course but also very rewarding to come put with a better understanding of the brain. The final is horrible to study for because of the amount of material covered but if you study gradually you will do fine. Exams are extremely challenging but fair.",
    "If you have a really strong interest in the human brain and its functional anatomy, go for it. You definitely have to put in work to learn, but it's a very decent lecture course. I'm not sure I would take it if it wasn't required. But it does give a really great comprehensive overview of the brain.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you are a prospective psych or neuroscience major; it requires a lot of attention and effort in order to do well and is geared for prospective majors.",
    "Yes, only if you are neuroscience\/psychology\/cog sci major though, because it really is a lot of information that you can familiarize yourself with and build off of in other classes.",
    "Yes, definitely! It's a lot of work but it's so interesting and worthwhile. Make sure you're reviewing regularly throughout the semester--rewatch the lecture videos every week on double speed\/go through your notes or something, don't wait till right before the final or you won't be able to do well on it.",
    "Yes, weekly quizzes were such a time kill (they should be once every two weeks). This course took so much time, and I thought there could be better explanations\/concept explanations for the class. There was a lot of help\/review sessions for the final even though there was an insane amount of content.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to any student studying psychology or social science. I would also recommend this to anyone just interested in learning about the brain and how humans work. I feel that by understanding this information about the brain, I understand more about humanity and people. There are some incredibly fascinating things covered in the course, things that I will continue to think about throughout my future as a psychology student, as an artist, and as a human being.",
    "definitely for psych majors. I didn't have to take this as a psych major, but i decided that I wanted to know more about the brain for my other classes and it's definitely helped a ton. I feel like more of a psych major now. and there will be concepts you'll recognize, prof mccarthy just goes super in depth. If youre willing to commit to the 3 hours a week for the qsets and a lot of studying for the final, i think its a great class. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as i did. I recommend taking it with a friend that's into it or passionate about it. i did that and vibing off of their energy was huge for me. also having someone to study with is crucial for the exam, she's thick",
    "Yes if you are a neuroscience major, otherwise, save yourself the headache that is the final. It is impossible to learn everything presented in this course because it is so much information. If youre a neuro major, then just enjoy it and dont stress because it's practically impossible to know everything from this class. It is, however, the most interesting neuro class at Yale. Professor McCarthy is amazing and a genius.",
    "Yes, I think that this class is very interesting and a great overview of the human brain.",
    "Absolutely. This was a very interesting class, and I learned so much. Even though the subject matter is challenging, I left knowing so much which is really rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who knows they are interested in neuroscience. It is not a great introductory course to neuroscience because it requires the student to be very invested in knowing details.",
    "Yes, but only if you're interested in neuroscience. If you are, the content is extremely interesting and the course is very intellectually rewarding; if not, it's just a LOT of information.",
    "Yes, I would but I would recommend Credit\/D\/Fail option for this class. Exam was pretty tough even if you went into the exam with an A- from the qsets. Not too much work.",
    "Yes it's really interesting and there are so many course materials that make everything accessible\/online.",
    "If youre at all interested in the brain, this is good introductory class. Its not super easy to get an A because the final is HARD, but if you do well on the open book quizzes throughout the semester you can definitely get a solid grade",
    "Yes",
    "If you really find the brain fascinating and want to know more about it, take this class. The lectures can be pretty dry, but Prof. McCarthy covers an enormous amount of material that gives you a really solid, neuroscientific understanding of the brain. In studying for the final, I truly learned so much and will carry that knowledge with me throughout any other cog sci, neuro, psych, or even CS classes I take. If you are looking for an engaging lecture or science credit, I wouldn't necessarily take this class because the lectures themselves aren't really engaging. I found the greatest benefit from studying the material itself rather than from Prof. McCarthy's presentation of it.",
    "If you're looking for a science credit and are interested in the brain, I'd recommend it. It doesn't have any prerequisites, but basic knowledge of chemistry concepts is useful. If you're not super interested in the subject matter, parts of the course can feel tedious, but I took it as a non-STEM major who loves learning about psychology and anatomy and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
    "Yes, but it i not an easy course; it covers lots of content.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in Neuroscience. This is not at all a gut class.",
    "Beneficial for major requirements or if you have a desire to learn about the brain\/ passion for neuro. Definitely a challenging course but can learn so much as well, very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you are a neuroscience major or if you're curious to see if neuroscience is right for you. If you need a science credit and also like psychology, this may also be a good course for you. However, if you just need a science credit, find something that doesn't require as much memorization.",
    "Not if you dont HAVE TO take the class,",
    "It may be difficult if you are not particularly interested in science or not used to the amount of memorization that comes with being a biology-based student.",
    "If you have time to put into the qsets, and are willing to dedicate a majority of your reading period to prepare for the cumulative final.",
    "Yes! It's a great class if you want to learn more about the brain and how it works",
    "Yes, especially for those interested in pursuing the neurobiological field, or for anyone interested in psychology and understanding the human psyche",
    "Yes if they are interested in learning how the brain works.",
    "If youre a psych major, you pretty much have to take it, but if you just have a passing interest in the topic, I wouldnt recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone highly interested in neuroscience or psychology. Would not recommend to someone who is just looking for a fun\/easy science credit. Much of this information is very complicated, and previous education in psychology is useful for parts of the course.",
    "If interested at all in the brain and how the body works on a fundamental level yes!",
    "Yes definitely if they are interested in neuroscience and willing to put in the time to study for the final",
    "Yes",
    "This was an amazing course. One of the best organized courses I have taken and the material was fascinating.",
    "Yes if you are at all interested in the human brain.",
    "I took this CrD and it was definitely the move since 70% of the grade are weekly question sets. I definitely did not retain most of what we covered just because it was so much but it is a good overview of the brain.",
    "I took this course as a science credit and while I learned a lot and was definitely interested the whole time it was certainly a challenge at the end to memorize everything, but even for non-science majors the professor made all the material super understandable and manageable.",
    "Yes! This was my favorite course and it got me excited for neuroscience everyday. Learning how the brain works even helped me for my other classes.",
    "yes -- this was my favorite course. very interesting and the workload is straightforward and engaging",
    "Definitely. Even as a non-major, this course was a highly interesting and useful way to fulfill a science credit.",
    "if you need to or if you can credit\/d. the class took a lot of time out of my week. my recommendation is to review (or even outline) the recorded videos of the lectures, because it's difficult to keep up during class time, in addition to the online lecture notes before doing q-sets each week. this will be very, very helpful when it comes time for the final because all you need to do then is review the notes you took. I highly recommend going to Professor McCarthy's review sessions because he emphasizes the main points, which is what he is looking for on the final and most q-sets.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student, as it was extremely interesting and accessible to anyone even if they did not have a background in science. However, you need to make sure that your final schedule is not too demanding or else it will be impossible to allot the time needed to prepare.",
    "Yes, definitely. I think it's a great overview of many neuroscience topics and the lectures are interesting. The grading is also quite fair and based primarily (70%) on weekly 3 hour homework assignments.",
    "Not really unless you are going to continue to take courses related to psychology\/neuroscience\/cognitive science. As an intro class, there is just so much content so I don't think it's worth going through it if you aren't going to use the knowledge later.",
    "yes, if interested in Psychology\/Neuroscience. It is very in depth...",
    "Yes, if a student wants to learn neuroscience--this is a great dive into the topic!",
    "YES! It was better than I expected, and I really learned all that I had hoped.",
    "Yes because the topic was interesting and applicable to real life situations",
    "It's a good way to get a science credit and it's a good way to get a neuroscience track psych credit.",
    "If you are interested in psychology or neuroscience, and are prepared to commit yourself to understanding complex concepts\/absorbing a lot of material in a relatively short time period take this class! If you are not prepared to take the time you need to truly study the material + devote yourself to understanding the concepts, I would not recommend this course. On a weekly basis, you just need to complete the lecture note readings and the 2\/2.5 hour long qsets (this is assuming you do not do the assigned textbook readings), but when the final exam rolls around you need to do a LOT of preparation. \r\n\r\nif you are not interested in\/are not willing to spend time learning a lot of dense neuroscience material, this course is not for you.",
    "Meh, probably only take it if it's a pre req, if you're looking for brain knowledge intro psych is probably better but I haven't taken it.",
    "Yes! But just be aware of what you're getting yourself into. This class is not easy by any means and if you want to do well you really have to apply yourself in order to make sure you don't get lost in the dozens of pages of notes and slides. However, if you put effort in then you'll get a lot out of the class. It's pretty cool to understand the mechanisms and functionings of your own brain. In the moment, I had mixed feelings but as the semester ended and upon reflection I genuinely did enjoy this class.",
    "Yes. It is a bit challenging but very interesting.",
    "Dont take this class for fun, because its a lot of material and youre gonna our way more time into it thats you want to.",
    "Great science credit with useful material (if you put in time to learn and rehearse it throughout the semester, instead of waiting until the final). Was definitely dry at times, but a worthwhile introduction to neuroscience. To get the most possible out of the class, keep up with the material from week to week  by reading through course notes and attending weekly review sessions. Professor McCarthy makes himself very available, and few students take advantage of his reviews.",
    "Absolutely. I thought Professor McCarthy was very knowledgeable and a great lecturer",
    "yes, it is well organized and difficult but never feels unfair",
    "Definitely! This was the best course I have taken at Yale so far. The brain is incredibly fascinating, and there is so much to learn about it. The fact that there is a course at Yale uniquely dedicated to talking about it is a testament to that. If you are a prospective neuroscience major, there is no better introduction to the field than NSCI 160, and no better Professor than Dr. McCarthy to introduce you to it.",
    "Yes. This class I think is one of the most important classes I will ever take at Yale. I learned so much about the brain and I feel I have an excellent basic understanding of the very complicated subject.",
    "Yes, good basic understanding of neuroscience.",
    "Recommend if youre interested in how the brain works.",
    "Yes. It will blow your mind",
    "Yep!! This class is fair with the workload if youre credit Ding, and fine if you put in the effort to study throughout the semester.",
    "Yes, I would. Professor McCarthy is very passionate and intelligent and a great lecturer. It is not easy by any means but after taking the class, I left with a feeling of accomplishment and so much knowledge that I gained over the course of the semester.",
    "Yes, if you want to get a bigger understanding of how the brain is structured and how it works without having any earlier knowledge within this field it is a great class! Make sure, to sum up your notes after each class because otherwise, the workload for the final (only test in the course) is overwhelming.",
    "I would to anyone interested in the human brain. An exceptional foundational survey course",
    "Unless youre really interested in the brain, I wouldnt recommend it. Its hard to get a lot out of the course unless you are very invested.",
    "yes! you learn a lot that will help you in future neuro\/psych courses",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It takes a lot of work to prepare for the final, but it is not too much work during the semester. The material is super interesting and very well taught by Professor McCarthy.",
    "Yes, because I think it gives a pretty thorough intro to neuroscience, if you're interested.\r\nNo, because it's really stressful.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Yes. It was a great intro to neuroscience and Greg McCarthy is amazing.",
    "This class is fantastic for anyone interested in getting a better sense of the brain and how it works  coming form a non stem major this was my favorite class of the semester. Its easy to do well in the course, as all of the notes are posted online for your use, but more that that the amount you learn about the human brain is incredibly fulfilling.",
    "It depends If you are interested in being a doctor or neurologist for sure.  If not then no cause it gets difficult.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless youre interested in neuroscience as a major or focus.",
    "Yes, I think its beneficial to understand the workings of the brain for all students.",
    "Highly recommended for students with a real interest in the basics of brain science and who plan on advancing further in a major related to brain science. The quantity of information and the amount that really needs to be well understood makes me not recommend it to individuals with just a casual interest (I would choose a class with a special topic like \"Adolescent Brain\" or BJ's criminal class), but as far as strictly neuroanatomy\/neurophysiology\/brain function style courses go this one is really good.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Anyone looking for a greater understanding of the brain and the human experience would be well suited to take this course. It provides a comprehensive look at the human brain, and the concepts explored in NSCI 160 are vital to other courses in the neuroscience and psychology majors. Even for those pursuing other majors, this course encourages levels of critical and logical thinking that carry value across multiple disciplines.",
    "Yes absolutely. It was well taught, intriguing material, and since we all have brains, seems like a class everyone should take.",
    "Absolutely! This is a must for any psych or cog sci major, and even if you're not, it's still incredibly valuable information to know.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students who might have an interest in neuroscience. It is a thorough introduction to the human brain and covers a lot of material that could be learned.",
    "Yeah its good",
    "If you are extremely interested in the brain and neuroscience, then this course is a great place to start. Bare in mind that it is extremely demanding and requires absurd amounts of memorization, but in the end it is very rewarding.",
    "Yes",
    "Only if it's for your major. If you're interested in psychology, there are more interesting classes related to a specific topic. However, this is a good overview if you truly are interested, it's just quite challenging.",
    "I recommend this course for students who are wondering how human brain works and how it affects our decisions and attitudes.",
    "If you are at all interested in the brain, absolutely. If you're cogsci\/psych, take it sooner rather than later, as it really gives you a strong foundation for other classes. If you're not a major, take it credit\/D! It's so interesting, you won't regret it.",
    "Yes. It is a challenging course with the breath of detail but it was my most interesting and enjoyable class I have taken at Yale. Most organized instructor I have ever had. Book was very complex and not necessary to do well on the Psets or the final.",
    "Yes; it was engaging as a science course"
