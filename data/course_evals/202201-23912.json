Its a community of brilliant students led by an equally brilliant and generous professor. Im going to miss this. Take this class if you can.",

But overall, the course readings are amazing (e.g., Venture Deals, HBS Case Studies and more!). If you are interested in entrepreneurship or VC, take this class!!",
                "I think the course itself was well structured for learning and the mditerm assignment provided useful feedback on my progress. I did feel at times like the other students in the class who participated the most were way more informed than I was and so I wasnt always comfortable speaking up in class, though.",
                "The strength is the content -- it is a unique offering among college courses and helps you network and foster connections with guest speakers and VCs. \r\nDean Torres obviously cares very much about his students and their learning. \r\nWeaknesses: the class conversations were dominated by a few loud-spoken individuals. The final paper is so open ended (there is literally no prompt) and office hours, while helpful, should not be the only way to workshop your topic. I wish there had been class time devoted to discussions of final papers (small group breakouts, etc). We also never got feedback on our final paper proposals, so I'm not sure why we did those.",
                "Strengths: a variety of topics covered; many interesting guest speakers; loved the final project / paper\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "Professor Torres was such an asset to this class. The syllabus was varied and covered the basics to more specific topics. Great student led class.",
                "I couldnt possibly suggest any improvements  except to perhaps do some more community-building activities earlier in the semester!\r\n\r\nBesides that, sensational.",
                "Strengths is the breadth of material we covered and the perspectives of the guest speakers. A weakness was how little time we spent in class actually practicing the concepts of VC and it could be improved by focusing on different strategies that are effective sourcing strategies.",
                "Very well structured. Great teaching. Discussions always engaging. Workload ideal.",
                "There were two distinct types of students in this class. One, students who already knew a lot about VC and were pursuing it full-time after graduation. Two, students who did not know much and were along for the ride.",
                "Strengths very interactive. I enjoyed the class trips and getting to know my peers. Professor Torres was very accessible and easy to talk to. \r\nA weakness was that we didn't fit that comfortably all of us in Tsai. maybe 2 or 3 people smaller woud've been better for engagement over all"

Dean Torres is an amazing professor who is incredibly helpful and willing to talk to you about VC, the opportunities, his experience, etc. Also, you form a great cohort of friends in the class as well!",

This is also a helpful class for someone to take who I looking to meet like minded individuals interested in VC, technology, or entrepreneurship as this is a self selecting group of people.",
                "Undoubtedly. This is a fantastic course for anyone in any major interested in acquainting themselves with vc. Workload more than manageable. Dean Torres picks a great group of students. If you get into the seminar, take it.",

The class discussions were great, the world-class guest speakers (from MIDAS list VCs to prolific operators) were great, the 2 after-class dinners were great. The investment memo assignment was fun to put together, and the final paper assignment was fun to research.",
