            "comments": [
                "The professor is fantastic",
                "Strengths: The course teaches a niche topic and approaches it from multiple angles. I think that the commentary assignments were useful to gain comfort for shorter writing. Class discussions were engaging and fun. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class workload was very back-heavy - the last few weeks of the course required much more work than the rest of the semester. I found myself spending almost all of my time on just this class for a number of days due to concurrent assignments.\r\n\r\nMain concern: The course is not taught as it is described in the syllabus. There were no journal papers or popular press science papers assigned, there were few literature driven class discussions, and we were not continually supported on our final papers. There was no instruction on how to write a review paper. The final topic was limited by the instructor and not reflected on the syllabus. This course desperately needs a revised syllabus and some thoughtful oversight.",
                "Strengths: the content is interesting, the professor is very engaging, the TF was really really great, the assignments are mostly interesting and pretty flexible so you can kind of mold the class to your interests, if you put in the work you do get something out of it, the professor is very passionate about the material and the class in general, if you've taken other bio courses here then the material will not be new to you which gives you the opportunity to explore a little bit with the papers and assignments, good writing credit for STEM-focused people since it trains you in scientific writing \r\nWeaknesses: the class at times felt disorganized, we never received a full syllabus, the course is mostly a lecture where students occasionally talk but I wouldn't describe it as a seminar, while the assignments are mostly interesting sometimes it felt like we were supposed to have a new type of assignment almost every week but just ended up reading a text book chapter and writing about it for 80% of the assignments which could be interesting but also felt sometimes like busy work",
                "The course offered so many opportunities to engage with emerging scientific literature through the homework assignments. We also engaged in lots of class discussions which helped me develop new perspectives on certain issues and helped me find ways in which medicine intersects with other important areas of life. I had a lot of chances to improve my scientific writing and integrate a variety of sources.",
                "The strength of this course Professor Ogbunu! He is extremely engaging during lectures and genuinely cares about each student. The material presented in the class is very interesting and builds upon itself.",
                "I really enjoyed this course! It covered a topic I was unfamiliar with but was very conducive to learning. I very much enjoyed the discussion aspect of the class and felt like everyone had the chance to participate in the direction the class took each lecture. I also think the breadth of content really gave us a chance to experience evolutionary medicine in more than just one area of disease or treatment.\r\n\r\nAs for weakness, sometimes the lectures seemed to not really have a direction, like they just turned into one large rant or tangent. I didn't mind this, but it was hard to keep track of what was course content and what was just conversation because there were no slides or really a syllabus to follow in terms of what should be covered. The assignments were also created sort of on the spot, which again is no big deal, but made it hard to keep track of what the guidelines were or what we were supposed to be doing."

                "Definitely if you want to develop a great relationship with a professor",
                "Yes but with a word of caution. The class is fun and engaging, but the workload is very unpredictable. Prof. Ogbunu makes up assignments only a few days before they are due and did not provide a high degree of support for the 20-page final paper.",
                "I would recommend it to others, the content is interesting, it gives you a good perspective on health and medicine, and I think you can kind of make the class fit your interests with the assignments. I will say if you've taken other similar classes or even just other public health/bio classes the material may be a little repetitive and the class is very explicitly geared towards pre-meds; if you're not pre-med (I'm not) I think you'll still get something out of it but just something to keep in mind about the focus of the class.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. It is very interesting and offers a comprehensive introduction of the field of evolutionary biology. The final project allows students to pursue something they are most interested in related to evolutionary biology.",
                "Yes! If you need a writing credit that doesn't involve a ton of just straight writing essays over and over again, this course is great. It's very commentary based and involves a lot of research for each assignment, so if you're a science student, this is right up your alley. I greatly enjoyed the content, the discussions and the professor, and would take it again for sure."
