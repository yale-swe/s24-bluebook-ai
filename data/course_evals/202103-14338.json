                "Selective reading, better organization of written arguments, efficiency in note-taking and discussion, and stress management.",
                "An overview about Ancient Greek political philosophy, Athen and Spartan, and the rise and fall of Rome. This class challenges me to think about from the perspective of historical and political thoughts, how far have we got and how far have we not got. The story of Caesar also made a huge impact on my own life.",
                "I learned that Rome is really important, and really confusing to understand the chronology of. I learned that for a while, historians were kind of just making it up as they went along. I learned that the people of antiquity were dealing with the same fundamental political and interpersonal issues that we deal with now, which was kind of reassuring? depressing? to realize. I learned about the inevitable decay of society, and the myriad of theories that people have about slowing that down. I learned that I'm not sure if humans are essentially good or bad, but it seems important to know if we want to figure out how to govern properly. I learned that I really like thinking about historical and political thought, even though at times, the reading for it is unbelievably tedious.",
                "This course develops critical historical analysis skills through the discussion of some of the founding texts of historical and political thought.",
                "This course was my first introduction to analyzing completely and minutely the rise and fall of empires. I felt that I have gained an understanding of how to evaluate systems of government, their strengths and weaknesses, and the compromises that come with democracy.",
                "I learned about various forms of government, how different authors conceptualize the role of a historian\/how to write a history, how to analyze history from the perspective of political theory, to always consider the perspectives often elided (and study the role\/agency\/perspective of marginalized people, even in texts when the author themselves was not engaged in that type of critical thinking), and how to better structure a paper. I also learned to apply the political theory in the texts to modern concepts, and consider the similarities between the American empire and other empires of ancient times."

                "The material was very interesting but I felt that sometimes the curriculum lacked focus and a connective or purposive element. It seemed to me that many of the texts focused entirely on historical documentation and it was not always explicit what political insight we were supposed to gain.",
                "Strength:\r\n1. AMAZING reading material. If you read it with heart, it will change your life.\r\n2. AMAZING lecture. It prompts me to think about the meaning of my own life and history. It also helps me to understand our current society better.\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n1. THIS IS SPECIFIC TO PROFESSOR KREINER'S SEMINAR: basically, we never focus on any specific paragraph. I don't even feel like I need to bring my books to the class. Many times it is just professor Kreiner talking about something super general but in a very redundant confusing way. After doing all those reading for this class, I felt my work is kinda wasted because I could engage in discussion without reading a single page. I really really hope we could stay more in context. It is great that professor Kreiner could inspire us to think broadly, but I think before that we also need to know what is going on in the book.\r\n2. The feedback is not very in time. Professor Kreiner sometimes would change the regular DS paper schedule because of his own procrastination and that seriously messed up my schedule and added huge pressure on me. Usually DS kids have 10-14 days to prepare for their next paper, but in this section I usually only got less than 7 days.\r\n3. Professor Kreiner graded harshly, thought I would admit his feedback is pretty insightful. However it does't make sense to me to grade harshly while at the same time keep talking about how much grade is stupid to him. Saying that does not make me accept a not so good grade more easily.",
                "One strength is that we cover a lot of material, but at the same time we move too fast over some authors to really be able to absorb them.",
                "This is a strong course but I think we spent too long on Plato. Also it was weird that we read the Bible it was kinda hard to fit that one in with the rest of the texts.",
                "I think a little background prior to each text - just a paragraph blurb - would've done wonders in terms of contextualizing the works within the syllabus.",
                "This course provides an incredibly strong foundation in political thought and early historical rule. A better division of texts could serve to make the course run more smoothly, particularly in regard to the significant amount of time spent on Aristotle.",
                "This course pushed me to think about democracy and the best way for humans to organize themselves into a society in a brand new way. I loved that we dove into texts that I had not read or sometimes had not heard of before. I enjoyed the fact that I could notice through lines between texts and developed a sense for the evolution ofWestern society from the time of the Bible to the fall of Rome. This being said, at times I found the selections from the Works we read to be so large that the over-arching message or takeaways were obscured by the sheer number of pages assigned.",
                "The strengths of this course are that the small size of the seminar really allowed the class to bond and feel like a comfortable environment to share our opinions, the syllabus is set up in way that we can see how political philosophy evolved over time, and we can choose which texts we engage with more based on what excited us the most (i.e. write papers about them). I also liked that for H&P, because lecture was at the beginning of the week, we could discuss what we learned in lecture in our seminar setting. Lectures proved to be a great starting off point for discussion, and it was very helpful to be able to voice what we were confused about. One way that this course could be improved would be that I felt like the syllabus is constructed in a way that Maimonides and Al-Farabi are kind of glossed over. There was not enough time to really delve into their ideas, and we had less of a foundation coming into that week because their ideas were so different from what we had read previously. I also think, and this goes for all DS classes, that we should turn in a first draft of our papers which we can then edit based on the feedback. Otherwise, it is difficult to improve our writing. I really appreciate that Professor Kreiner gave us this opportunity at the end of the semester."

                "Yes, as someone with a lasting interest in history and political science, and potential PoliSci or History major. It gave a solid introduction to the context and implications of the Hebrew Bible, and enabled a lot of my learning about the political theory of the classical era that informs a majority of, if not all, later political philosophy and modern phenomena. I think it is a good starting point for an education in politics but is not in-depth enough in many respects.",
                "I would absolutely recommend DS if you are reading for the intellectual challenges and huge workload. But be cautious of harsh grading and maybe disorganized seminar. Also take DS if you want an intellectual community where everyone can talk about philosophy, literature, politics, history, etc during lunch and dinner instead gossiping random things. DS is also a very solid foundation for any other humanities course you might take in the future.",
                "I would! I think H&P is super interesting, and it was my favorite topic to write about.",
                "The Directed Studies Historical and Political Thought course is an extremely valuable introduction not only to early historical events, but also to the forming political systems and thought that have brought us to the present day.",
                "I would certainly recommend this class to any student interested in learning about systems of government and to anyone curious about the best way for society to organize itself.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I think that the close-knit environment of DS allows for really strong friendships to form based on mutual intellectual appreciation of the material, and this is invaluable. The H&P texts are also really fun to read, especially Tacitus, which I thought was a really great read (very engaging! and critiques empire which we love to see)."
