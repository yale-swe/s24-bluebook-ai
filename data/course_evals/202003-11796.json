Development of primary ethnographic research skills, including the production of a final research project that was fun and also felt like a real accomplishment.",
                "Most of all, I learned how to be a critical, anthropological thinker. I learned to dig deeper into any technology or institution and really ask questions about who it is serving, what values are embedded in it, what norms does it perpetuate, and how we can change it for the better.",
                "This course is an incredible survey of human interaction with technology, and it dives very deeply into how certain technologies influence the world we live in. The class completely changed the way I perceive technology, and encourages students to think more critically about the specific technologies that are changing our lives.  Truly fascinating.",

I develop critical thinking skills that help me judge a problem from multi-dimensions and ask questions about the ultimate purpose and people that some popular technological platforms serve. The course also focuses on ethnographic writing and anthropological theories relevant to the topic.",

                "No weaknesses. Strengths: Professor Messeri, Nala our TA, the content, the readings, the videos, the assignments, the seminar structure. Overall incredible",
                "The seminar was extremely engaging despite the pandemic and Prof Messeri + Nala provided excellent feedback",
                "The strengths of this class are simply so many -- fascinating readings, engaging and creative midterm and final projects, structured and dynamic Zoom seminars, and Prof. Messeri and Nala are so warm and understanding. No weaknesses!",
                "The discussions, even though online, were super interesting and I felt that I learned something new every week. The assignments encourage you to reflect on your own life and interests as it pertains to technology, and because of that you have a lot of freedom to direct your studies. It is hard to think of weaknesses of this great class.",
                "Strengths - incredible readings, wonderful class discussions, very under-discussed field and Professor Messeri does a great job doing it justice\r\nWeaknesses - the material felt too broad at times",
                "I think this course did expect a lot from students (especially given a remote\/challenging semester) in terms of frequent assignments\/high expectations, but Professor Messeri was also super understanding\/wonderful.",
                "Too pessimistic about technology, fails to acknowledge the incredible marvels technology enables. The downsides must be considered in great detail, but the class leans too heavily in their favor at the expense of a complete education (95% 5% in favor of pessimistic analysis).",
                "The course exceeded my expectations about a virtual seminar by facilitating vibrant discussions, both in real-time, through discussion boards, in collaborative learning methods, and through effective writing. The various student backgrounds that the course brought together also make the discussions more engaging. The course could be improved by having a weekly discussion seminar outside of class to follow up on in-class conversations.",
                "I liked that you could tell that both the professor and the Teaching Assistant were really invested in the course. We have very interesting readings, and a manageable workload."

                "Because it is a seminar on Technology and Culture, the argument can be made that this sort of course is better taught online to truly emphasize the technology aspect of the class. I thought having an outside discussion board on canvas helped to give flexibility to topics of discussion. An area that be improved is perhaps the breakout rooms. I personally thought full class discussions were more engaging and interesting than the slightly awkward breakout rooms.",

                "I think Professor Messeri did a STELLAR job of adapting this course to remote learning -- including great usage of Google Docs, breakout rooms, and beyond. I do think thinking through a group project virtually though could have been done a bit better.",
                "It was made very explicit that any difficulties should be brought to the professors attention and there would be a way to work out a solution. \r\n\r\nThe online discussion was a nice touch that allowed us to interact through another medium. \r\n\r\nThis course made the best use of breakout rooms compared to all my courses. We were sent out with clear goals and instructions and often presented it back to the group. It wasn't for too long or too short, and the sizes worked well."

                "Oh, absolutely. This is far and away one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It is incredibly well organized and manages to strike a great balance between covering a wide range of topics in STS and anthropology as well as going deep into some thinkers and topics. I cannot recommend it enough -- it changed the way I look at technology, values embedded in sociotechnical systems, ideas of progress and innovation, digital communities, and it empowered me to believe that we can change the trajectory of some more harmful technologies in the world. take take take!!",

                "YES! This was a SUPER interesting course with a BRILLIANT professor, who cares so deeply about her students\/the material. I left this course genuinely thinking differently about my digital habits, career path, and world view. I was interesting by the readings, engaged by class discussion, and impressed by Professor Messeri consistently.",
                "No",

                "Yes. It has interesting readings, manageable workload, speaks to big and underappreciated issues in our society that will only grow moving forward."
