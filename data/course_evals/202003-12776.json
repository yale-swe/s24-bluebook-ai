                "Strength: Presentation and discussion formats were very effective and the class was conducive to having an informed debate about important issues.\r\nI do not think this class has any weaknesses.",
                "The class is built around discussion - in Zoom, this was better in some ways and in others it was worse because it didn't allow us to engage as closely. I do think this is a great course and Professor Sky is an amazing person who is great to know and you should take this course to get to know her and her perspective but I think the actual course structure isn't as strong as other MMES\/GLBL courses.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. The diversity of people and backgrounds in class makes discussion varied and interesting. The structure and assignments are well thought out and can actually be quite fun, such as giving a speech from the perspective of a Middle East leader for your midterm. You get to follow one country during the semester and give current event updates in class and do partner presentations on the week's topic, all of which aid in your learning.  My one critique is that sometimes the quantity of readings to do or movies to watch was unrealistic for one week.",
                "This was a phenomenal course. The class discussions were highly engaging and I loved how the course was structured for student presentations, as it allowed everyone to share their individual opinions and experiences. It definitely is slightly intimidating at first, as so many members of the class have lived or worked in the MENA region, but overall an incredible learning experience.",
                "Strengths: Professor Sky's experience in the region; also, there are usually a lot of students with pretty cool backgrounds (personal or professional) related to the Middle East, and the guest speakers are fantastic. \r\nWeaknesses: While this class is a seminar, I think I would have benefited from a little bit less discussion time and a little bit more teaching\/lecturing from Professor Sky."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course. I would even go as far as to say that this class is my favorite one at Yale. Professor Sky is phenomenal and the peers in the course are incredibly diverse and bring really valuable perspectives.",
                "Take it!!! It is a great class on the Middle East and while very helpful it does not require previous coursework on the region. You have to be pretty interested in the issues and topics because participation is a very large part of getting something out of the class. Emma is a great professor and engages the class really effectively. The people taking the class is a diverse set of students that bring different perspectives of the region to the table, and constitute an important part of the learning. \r\nAlso really cool guest lectures!",
                "Indeed, best MENA politics class offered in Yale",
                "Yes - definitely. This should be called a seminar covering the Middle East though as opposed to a course on Middle East Politics. Professor Sky is incredible and take it to get to know her but the course itself isn't perfect.",
                "Yes, absolutely if you're interested in the Middle East! Don't be discouraged if you're not an expert or have lots of experience in the region because the course is pretty accessible for all backgrounds if you're willing to do the work.",
                "Absolutely. If you have the chance to take this course, you should. It's an excellent way to learn more about the Middle East and to really delve into one particular country.",
                "Yes, with some caveats. The class could use more involvement\/direction from Professor Sky at times, but the student presentations are honestly a highlight from both ends. What you learn is highly contingent on doing the readings; there is little reprisal in class."
