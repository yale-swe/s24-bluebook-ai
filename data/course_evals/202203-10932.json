None of the problem sets can be solved by course content. I used actively python and sequel in my previous job. I can fairly say the course does not teach anything but make people struggle with problem sets creating the illusion of teaching while using an ancient coding environment with no auto-correct or helper which results in wasting time on small bugs.",

This course is an insane workload, so keep that in mind. It's worth it though, the hackathon was fun. Also, I don't know if it was just me, but Jay and Cody straight up ignored an email I sent them a while ago.

Moreover, I learned how to approach new coding languages and generally how to Google search my way into mastering a new coding language.  (Mostly as a result of the final project.)  The course was an excellent way to get a grasp of all that; the pacing, while difficult, meant that you constantly had to learn to adapt to a new beast the next week.

                "strengths: rich content, reasonable course design, logical and clear teaching style.\r\nweakness: Psets are too difficult for beginners.",
                "I think it would be better for the Yale end of this course to be more engaging. It would be helpful if there was a better way to distribute the lecture material other than by a three-hour long stream. Other than that, I enjoyed the PSETs, though I wish the lecture material was more relevant to the implementation. I felt like for the amount of work and time I put into the class, I wasn't reaping a matching reward.",
                "Strengths: engaging lectures, challenging but not impossible problem sets, lots of opportunities to get points, very often comprehension checks\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of work, sometimes overly so. Almost the entire course is online.",
                "Strengths - great overview across many languages and solid introduction to programming \r\nWeaknesses - very time-intensive for an introductory course; primarily online instruction",
                "Planning and execution is flawless, the course requires a lot of time and is almost impossible to pass without using office hours frequently (considering you have no programming experience). You learn a lot but you need to put in a big effort. Some topics covered seem very niche for a CS audience only.",
                "Strengths: There is a lot of interesting knowledge about computer science that you can learn at basic level. TA and prof are friendly. \r\nWeakness: Problem set is much complicated and so advanced than what was shared during the lecture.",
                "Strengths: great lectures, amazing TAs and staff, so many office hours (you should go to them!), interesting content, you will learn SO MUCH\r\nWeaknesses: It is A LOT of work, and the psets can be very challenging, also the test is very very hard, time consuming",
                "Main strength for this course is how organized it is and how much help there is for us!",
                "Course schedule and place (labs) were not determined until very late and the place of labs constantly changed.\r\nProblem sets are not realistic to solve. Labs and course content are not helpful. \r\nIt is not an introductory course, the syllabus was deceiving. It is impossible to solve problem sets without prior coding experience. Every week a new language is introduced with only 3 hours of lecture and very difficult questions were asked. \r\nIt is time-consuming but not teaching.\r\nTo ask a question to TA I need to wait at least 30 min during office hours which is waste of time.",
                "The course style with video lecture and small session is great for me.\r\nEspecially, the video recording lecture allows me more flexibility and make reviewing easier.\r\nBy recording, I can slow down and watch again where I cannot understand, which is impossible with real time lecture.",
                "I loved office hours in this course. There were so many sessions of office hours, and even if I didn't have specific questions upon arrival, office hours were always a great place to work on PSETs. I enjoyed the time spent in session working on labs, which used many skills that applied directly to PSETs.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course was that the asynchronous lecture and corresponding quiz was always due the day after lecture at noon. I wish that the quiz had been due simply before one's section. Also, I would have loved section to have spent more time on the labs, rather than spending so much time repeating big ideas that we already learned in lecture.",
                "strengths: broad coverage of multiple language.\r\nweakness: the final exam is not an exam, like new lecture session, should change the weight between exam and final project, final project deserves 20% and exam should be 10%.",

Because this is an undergraduate class, for undergraduate student even though they are beginners, I have bunch of time each week to do the problem set, join the lab section, attend TA hours. However, as a graduate student who need to take 12 course in fall semester in total and recruiting at the same time, I got so much pressure from this course.",

This would reduce frequency of work especially fro a grad student while still ensuring the same level of engagement.",
                "Strengths: covers a lot of material quite well\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lecture feels pretty unnecessary. 2-hour section is extremely unnecessary. Everything should be entirely optional aside from the psets. This would make the workload more manageable",
                "It is heavy-loaded. The mandatory class hour per week is at least 6 hours. Since the assignment is not really friendly to who doesn't have foundation of coding, It might take more than 15 hours per week just to finish the course.",

As a whole, I think the course is really well structured and managed. The website is clear and accurate, there is a lot of consistency from week to week, and lots of resources like the notes and walkthroughs of the psets.\r\nMy one qualm is the length of the sections. I think two hours is excessive, especially considering how much time is spent on the psets. Also, there were times that we would be taught a topic in section that was only briefly mentioned in the lecture but that was integral to the problem set and I think that disparity could be easily recitified.",

                "Strength: incredibly well structured, TA's are amazing, so many office hours\r\nWeakness: office hours on the weekends are packed, can wait up to one hour and a half to talk to an TA",
                "Strength: Lots of resources to learn the material like TAs and office hours and other students.\r\nWeakness: Felt like a Harvard class that we just watched sometimes, as the class is literally just public on YouTube. So it didn't feel that engaging.",
                "Some sort of in-person component to the lecture?",
                "The strengths are the great TAs and the many different office hour times. I only completed this course thanks to the TAs, section, and office hours. Regarding weaknesses, I felt like the labs and the quizzes were unnecessary.",
                "I felt this was a highly effective course.",
                "Strengths: lectures and problem sets were fun and insightful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sections can be of very variable quality, yet are substantially long.",
                "It did a great job at teaching a lot of content in a short amount of time. There should be more TA's on weekend office hours.",
                "Sections were pretty effective in supporting our learning in the lectures.",
                "This course is designed to not only introduce students to programming, but to do it in a way that makes them enjoy it. And it absolutely achieves that! From the very first (zeroth) lecture, David Malan and the rest of the CS50 crew made sure the lessons were both entertaining and instructive. In addition, the TAs are really helpful, both in the sections and in the office hours.\r\n\r\nIf I were to design this course, I would change a few things. First of all, the test format could be improved. The test is worth 20% of the final grade and is take-home. It's great in a lot of ways, but one thing it lacks in is the necessary infrastructure to test code. Because of this, we are not able to debug and must submit a first draft that may or may not be right, which results in a lot of people doing badly. Secondly, the course is very fast-paced, with problem sets due every week. I would personally make the problem sets twice as big but give two weeks per problem set, in order to ensure students are better able to allocate time on them.",
                "I wish the workload was less the class was very overwelming",
                "I really loved the course up until the last few lectures, specifically the HTML/CSS/JavaScript lecture. David really rushed through the concepts to the point where it was difficult to distinguish between the languages. I hope in future years he is more clear with his introduction of this lecture, especially because JavaScript is a huge focus for the final exam and can be a useful language to know for the final project.",
                "Strengths: great professor and lectures, very interesting and fun assignments, good teaching fellows.\r\nWeaknesses: workload is quite a lot. When all the work for the class is added together, I was working often 15 hours a week for this class which was beginning to be untenable by the end of the semester as I was taking a difficult workload in addition to CS50. \r\nLectures are also quite long (3 hours), and cover the exact same material as in the sections. This made lectures superfluous, even if they were excellently thought. It was tough to watch the lectures on Monday night after a long day of classes and then complete the quiz by 12pm the next day! It would definitely help if the quiz were due a bit later, like end of day Tuesday. \r\nThe problem sets are often very long, and while honestly quite fun, did get tedious. I totally get that this is part of computer science, but making them a bit shorter might help.\r\nThe test was also extremely long, especially as a test that was supposed to be done within a few hours. It took me around six hours to complete, and I know from classmates that they also felt similarly.",
                "The strengths of this course are its amazing staff and well serviced production. The weaknesses of this course was the lacking engagement for Yale students.",
                "An unnecessary amount of work with lacking lectures that don't really connect to the assignments until the final weeks.",
                "The homework had no late policy",
                "Very well structured but it felt as if we were learning too much in too little time. Lectures were sometimes hard to get through and not a lot of time to watch them (as quiz was due Tuesday midday). Pset workloads were not balanced. However support, the TAs specifically, were amazing.",
                "All of the support resources and contact was strengths. No weaknesses!",
                "This class is very well staffed and has great resources allowing for students to be fully supported as they need it. However, I would've liked the lectures to go into more depth on certain topics, or provide supplementary materials for more depth. However, there were some concepts we simply touched on for a few minutes and didn't revisit.",
                "I feel that without my prior experience in programming, I would have had an even more stressful experience than I did. The fast pacing and the volume of work every week was extremely rigorous. Lectures often cover material that is not relevant to the week's problem set, and material that is relevant is usually glossed over. However, there is a lot of support available at office hours and section to give you the assistance necessary to complete the problem sets. You will likely need to seek this help unless you are already well-versed in programming. If you want to come out of the course with a solid foundational knowledge of programming, you need to be very proactive to really learn and retain any information from any of the lectures or section.",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe course is more interactive than many other intro classes, allowing us to apply our knowledge to actual scenarios represented through the problem sets, and showcase our skills through the form of a final project of our choice. The interactive nature of the course allowed me to understand the process of coding to actually solve real-world problems, and the flexibility and innovativeness that this required. The usage of in-person sections with TAs also gave us a space to ask questions and review more.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nAt times it felt that there was a large gap (in both difficulty and extensiveness) between the content actually taught in lectures and the problem sets themselves. There were complicated functions (that required lots of debugging) that were not covered in the lecture before a problem set in which they were very relevant, and it was difficult to try and explore/grasp the usage of this new function while also having to apply it very precisely in order to get the programs to run properly. Office hours were a very helpful tool, but especially as our lectures were virtual, there was a disconnect between teaching staff and students.",
                "Strengths included a good range of programming languages weaknesses would be the workload",
                "This course has an extreme workload.",
                "The course was engaging because the psets were difficult and I knew I had to start early and to get help as soon as possible. The TFs were incredible and always seeing familiar faces made it feel like a community. Discussion sections sometimes felt a bit useless. Watching the lectures virtually was not the best, but it actually made it more convenient for me.",
                "Strengths: It is a very engaging course with lots of support available. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it feels like the course moves too quickly past a programming language.",
                "Great structure and support from TAs and instructors.",
                "The structure of the class was really good! Not too much work, but have to dedicate time to the assignments",
                "Strengths: organization of the class was really stellar; engaging lectures; difficult but often very fun psets that strengthened my problem solving skills. Weaknesses: discussion sections weren't always the most helpful since we spent most of the time rehashing the basics and didn't start the labs except for one time; discussion sections were very long; quizzes due within less than 24 hours of the lecture didn't give us a lot of time to watch, especially if our Mondays were packed (I understand the intent though; the quizzes did force me to watch the lecture behind discussion section); quizzes honestly didn't seem that necessary.",
                "Strengths - lots of content covered very quickly; all very understandable; good TFs to help students out\r\nWeaknesses - problems were so difficult that TFs were often overloaded when needing assistance",
                "Amazing, organized, and very informative course! The instructors make it very engaging and there's a supportive community with other students and TAs. However, the labs oftentimes increased the workload without really teaching us more skills, and although they are intended to only be worked on during section they are rarely finished and take up time outside of section to finish. A lot of stress and work could be decreased if labs were just something we did during section and did not need to be turned in.",
                "A strength is that there are a lot of resources. There are plenty of office hours that are well-staffed with TAs to help you if a pset is particularly difficult. A weakness is that the class covers many languages only at the surface level, which I don't feel is very conducive to learning for true CS beginners.",
                "Weaknesses: an extreme amount of work, to the extent that it became such a chore and took all the fun out of learning. There was almost zero point to the quizzes and labs except to further push students to the extreme. The lectures provided minimal useful material for the problem sets, which far exceeded the content of the lectures. The sections were WAY too long to be justified on a weekday night. Many students were deterred by the workload and dropped out of the class, which is extremely counterintuitive to what an introductory class should be, especially for CS, which is a useful skill.",
                "Strengths include offering good selection of matrial and interesting p-sets\r\nWeakness was the amount of workload throughout the week, and timing of various assignments (lecture, quiz, lab, p-set)",
                "I think there was too much in the course, which is obviously a known aspect since the instructor called it a firehose at the beginning, but I do think that that makes it hard to enjoy the course when you have so little time to do so much and you are learning so much information.",
                "We learned a lot.",
                "Strengths: great community, Hackathon/lunches, section, amazing TAs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: online format of lectures made it hard to concentrate for the full 3 hours. Also they were interesting but didn't really reflect the problem sets.\r\nFurthermore, grading was unnecessarily harsh in certain sections of the course that constituted a large part of the grade, i.e. the test and the final project. I strongly believe that problem sets should be weighted more than 40% as I grew the most through those.",
                "Strengths\r\n- A wide variety of languages are taught, and I found the project-based homework sets to be super engaging. The final project in particular was great! I learned even more those few weeks than I did in a typical week of the class, and it was super fun as well\r\n- The discussion sections were long, but I found them to be very helpful.\r\n- The few lowest Hw/Quiz/Labs scores were dropped, I found this slack to be very helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- The due date of the quiz (the morning after the lecture is posted) was very restrictive for some students who had busy class schedules on lecture days. Adding a bit more padding would have been greatly appreciated.\r\n- We were instructed to submit a blank document nearly every week for our \"lab\", since our discussion section never got to it. This felt very strange, especially since failing to do this every week would lower your grade by 10%",
                "This is a great introductory course because it provides a survey of a variety of programming languages and their best uses. \r\nAs a beginner, and a non-traditional student that feels less comfortable with technology than many of my academic peers, I found some of the peripheral technological aspects of the course to be an additional challenge on top of the course material itself.",
                "Too intensive and requires too much work and engagement for someone taking other courses as well. Not for first timers.",
                "I think that the course moves too quickly; I started off as a beginner and feel like while I know many languages I can't code proficiently in any of them because we didn't spend more than a week on each one.",
                "The strength is the organization and layout of this course. This course was great in terms of teaching you how to code. A weakness is that it is online only.",
                "Strengths: Tons of support systems and resources for students. The TAs are all incredible. The lectures are engaging, accessible, and super interesting. The psets could be tough but honestly they were very fun and insightful to work through. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was more flexibility and leniency when it comes to the deadlines for assignments.",
                "The course is extremely fast paced and requires an extreme amount of time commitment. It also doesn't allow for collaboration which actually hurts the learning process because then you just become focused on getting it done rather than enjoying the process and understanding how to do it. I understand the attempt to stop plagiarism and relying fully on others but not allowing any collaboration with peers doesn't make sense as coding in the real world is all collaboration. I definitely learned less because of this strict policy. The class is also set up so that you are at a huge disadvantage if you can't attend almost every office hours. I went to every section, nearly every office hours and still had a hard time following because I had no coding experience before hand. I wasn't prepared for how intense and how much time I would have to spend on this course. I hate how marketed this class is as well. The merch being sold online, and a photographer coming to office hours to post on instagram. Felt very fake and forced.",
                "A weakness of this course was that Yale students did not have the option of attending lectures in person. While this was offset by in-person sections and office hours, it was disappointing to never be able to \"go to class\". A strength was the support given by the teaching staff, with many caring TAs who held extensive office hours. However, I found it unfair that students could not set up one-on-one meetings with TAs. This is the only class I've taken at Yale with this restriction and it definitely impacted me when my schedule was tighter and I needed more flexible times.",
                "CS50 is a weird course in so many ways.  The difficulty, while overstated, definitely defines the course.  Especially after leaving C, there is a lot of adjusting to new coding languages fast and applying principles you learn to grasp a new coding language.  This definitely forces you to learn how to approach coding and how to successfully search for specific solutions to problems using the tools in your toolbox.  As a result of this process, I definitely felt like I knew how to survive learning any new coding language that operates under the same principles of things like C, Python, and Javascript.  This links into the greatest weakness of the course; after a certain point, lectures really stop being helpful.  While this forces \"learning on your own,\" the HTML and CSS stuff was 95% a result of forcing yourself to Google search how to do things rather than anything provided in lecture.  This is fine and it definitely teaches you how to adapt, but it is immensely frustrating and time consuming.  If there was something more substantiative in lecture for those languages, they would have saved me time rather than leaving me feel like I wasted my time beyond learning some things for syntax.  I think the office hours are great in theory for this course and I definitely appreciate the frequency and length of them.  However, at the end of the day, I often left office hours feeling frustrated or like my questions were evaded.  The productive struggle has a point that I understand, but after a point it feels like you are slamming your head into the wall and you need someone to explain a command or three that you did not know exist.  Some of my solutions weren't designed super well because productive struggle did not always lead me to an efficient way to approach the problem.  The online aspect of the course is also just a lot to deal with in some ways.  I think the course does definitely teach you a lot and in some ways its harsh methodology works to its advantage.  I just think there are a lot of elements of the process that could be ironed out and improved to make it a little more productive and a little less struggle.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Labs and sections are quite useful for reviewing material and understanding concepts\r\n- Appreciate the community aspects of the course, ie hackathon, colloquiums,  lunches, etc. \r\n- TAs are really really helpful, wonderful, and nice, they want you to succeed and they are very willing to help you\r\n- The class is really well funded and you can tell by the free merch, and free pasteries that were occasionally provided\r\n- Grading is quite lenient and this is really appreciated as I think it is difficult to fail the class as long as you are putting at least a little bit of effort in\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Time commitment is intense (at times 20+ hour per weeks)\r\n- Virtual lectures are difficult to stay engaged\r\n- Hard to feel engaged in the class when I often have to just grind out psets in order to juggle all my otherclasses \r\n- So much information for a complete beginner, support systems are there but still intimidating to access/struggled to find time to access, I think the course could be pared down a little bit\r\n- Learning gap between lectures/sections and the actual psets themselves are just really big and difficult to bridge. I think this gap is impossible to bridge on your own for the latter psets, but even with attending office hours, it's difficult to fully \"catch up\", but office hours do really help\r\n- An important part of computer science is learning to learn new things on our own, and read documentation, but personally this was extremely difficult as someone with no experience. I'm not entirely sure I really learned how to learn new languages. Documentation is hard to understand as a complete beginner, lectures are helpful but lectures still don't cover everything or give enough examples. Office hours are nice but even those are limited by staffing/time limits. I lowkey do wish more stuff was handed to us on a plate, ad it really is overwhelming for a complete beginner in my experience\r\n- I think even more office hours would be appreciated"

                "Absolutely -- does not matter if you are not interested in computer science. It challenges you in very unique ways. \r\n\r\nFor CS students, it is absolute must.",
                "Yes if willing to dedicate the time towards it and if okay with a lot of self-learning",
                "Yes, if they have time to devote to it and are interested in core problems of CS -apart from coding.",
                "Yes. It's hard but deserve to give a shot of trial, especially for those who are not familiar with computer science but still curious on how it works.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to any student at Yale remotely interesting in taking a CS class. I took CS50 with no previous CS experience, to the point I couldn't print \"hello, world\". After the course, I can now say I know how to program in C, Python, SQL, Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and I can think critically about a problem and work through any issues. You learn so much about your work habits, build problem solving skills, and gain logic intuition needed not only to solve CS problems but a variety of other problems as well. The class is a lot of work (over 10 hours a week easily) but it is SOO worth it! I genuinely enjoyed the assignments, even though some of them were very very hard, and as long as you use the resources provided, you will be fine.",
                "Absolutely! Specifically if you have no programming experience because you will learn about 7+ programming languages in just 10 weeks!",
                "No. It is stressful and not learning very much. With the amount of time (20+ hours per week) I put into the course, I can learn useful and decent coding skills through online courses. This course is a waste of time and it is very stressful. \r\nProblem sets should be reevaluated. \r\n20+ hours per week is not reasonable for a course.",
                "Yes if they have time. It is extremely time-comsuming.",
                "Yes!\r\nFor people with no prior experience in programming, like me, this course will be a great first step to see what's happen in the world of programming.",
                "I would recommend CS50 to another student. Though it's known for it's hefty workload, you also receive a hefty breadth of computing skills, so the work is worth it. Also, office hours make the work very feasible. Whether another student is interested in studying CS as a major or simply wants to learn CS skills (they're good to have no matter what your interests are), this is a great class.",

The course makes things like setting up a codespace and reading the documentation for languages, things that would have definitely deterred me early on, seamless.\r\nYou learn so much in the space of the course and you will be so incredibly impressed by how far youve come from the start and all you are able to do at the end!",
                "Yes if you are willing to put in the time/effort; I will probably never take another coding class (decided against CS major), but I definitely do not regret taking the course",
                "Absolutely. This course will tell you if Computer Science is for you, and even if not, it's still a very interesting class to learn more about important topics that are relevant even outside of programming. Do not let the high workload deter you, CS50 is quite challenging and helps you adjust to the high workload of upper level CS classes, but it is absolutely worth it. Would take it in place of 201 and then skip to 223.",

                "Yes, a nice intro to programming.",

                "Yes, absolutely. The level of teaching and learning support for this course is unmatched.",
                "Yes. It will give you a thorough grounding and set you up for exploring computer science or related avenues in the future.",

                "Definitely. Especially if youre debating between this and cpsc 112. You will learn so much more in this course and even though the workload is high, it is not at all hard to do wel in the course. There are always office hours and the Ed Stem is super helpful. Your question is often answered in just a few minutes.",
                "Yes, just be aware that the course has high workload. It's a great course, with a wonderful professor, and good introduction to computer science (coming from someone who did not take a CS course in high school but had a little exposure to the material).",
                "Yes. I had no coding experience, but after taking CS50, I feel like Ive learned a lot. I would recommend taking it with a friend though if you have no experience. The friend doesnt need experience either, but struggling together makes the course a lot more fun and your relationship a lot closer.",
                "Yes! CS 100 is a course that will allow even beginners to become programming experts in an encouraging and exciting environment.",
                "Depends. You learn a lot, so I don't regret taking it. But the workload is just absurd. 3 hour weekly lectures that must be watched in one day and a quiz on the lecture due noon the day after plus a 2 hour section is ridiculous. It wouldn't be that bad if the lectures actually connected to the PSets, which they really often don't.",

                "They aren't joking when they say this course if time consuming. Seriously. Do not take this course with a 5 credit semester unless you're god, or something. I learned a lot and I'm glad that I have the experience in so many different computer languages now, but by jove be ready for a rough ride.",
                "Yes but be aware it's a big time commitment.",
                "Absolutely, especially for non CS majors like me. I thought the skills and critical thinking practice was crucial and I am looking forward to bringing this knowledge into non-CS fields.",

                "No, I would not recommend this course. If you are looking for a survey course, CS50 is just that, however it is extremely, extremely more rigorous than what it's worth. Sure, the class has its fun events and other quirks, but it is simply not worth the time commitment (easily more than 10-15 hours a week). If you are not interested in pursuing computer science, or if you are a non-STEM person, pass on this class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who desires an extensive and intensive introduction to computer science and programming. It is quite demanding in order to actually immerse you into the experience of being a programmer, and for that reason, it is an introductory course that will require quite a bit of time and dedication, and time spent outside of class going to office hours and working on the problem sets (in my experience, about 10-17 hours outside of class and section time).",
                "Yes. This course is a good intro to CS class. In  addition it teaches you how to code which has become a useful skill in the real world.",
                "Yes if they are a CS major",
                "Not unless they truly think they love coding.",
                "Yes. It is a great introduction to CS if you have the time for it in your schedule. It is a rewarding class and it has an abundance of resources that blew me away.",
                "I would totally recommend it if you have never programmed and want to get into it.",
                "Yes, introduces you to many programming languages at once",
                "Taking this course should be a well-thought-out decision. The workload is really heavy, and you end up planning most of your semester around cs50, because you have assignments due on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays, and the pace is insane. You end up learning so much though. It actually made me comfortable with the idea of learning new concepts fast, in computer science at least. I would recommend it.",
                "I would reccomend if you really want to know how to code, and if you can dedicate times during the week to get work done. Theres plenty of office hours to get help, and you learn so much!",
                "Yes, absolutely!! People say the workload for this course is overwhelming, but I didn't find that to be the case. As long as you're willing to put in the time to carefully think about and do the psets (start early!) and you watch the lectures on time, you'll be okay.",
                "Highly recommend. This class not only introduces highly relevant skills of computer science programming in a very understandable and feasible way, but it also facilitates development in overall problem-solving and thinking skills.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in programming. It is a huge workload but extremely rewarding and you'll learn a lot.",
                "I would probably not recommend this course. It's marketed as an introduction to computer science, but it was very fast paced and seemed to be a more adequate challenge for students who had a background in CS already. For a true beginner, this class takes up a lot of time and is very difficult. I would only recommend this to students with a very strong interest in CS, not someone just testing the waters.",
                "No, absolutely not. The workload is too immense for anybody who just wants to try out CS.",
                "If you want a general introduction to CS, yes.",
                "I would only recommend this course if someone was willing to put in the work or already had a foundation in CS. It is very hard to just jump in, and while I did learn information, it was not learned in a particularly enjoyable way.",
                "yes, you learn how to code well",
                "Yes, I would. Great introduction to programming, my favorite course this semester.",
                "I would. It was a lot of work, even for someone who had a bit of programming experience, but I learned a lot in this course.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. It is a wonderful survey of computer programming languages for beginners. Even if a student does not intend to continue with CS after this class, these are still extremely useful skills to have. I also utilized office hours to the fullest extent and learned some of helpful norms and skills of office hours and interactions with TAs and classmates, which could be useful for other students too.",
                "yes and no.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who really wants to think like a programmer; not a student who wants to learn how to code proficiently.",
                "Yes, computer science is a great skill for everyone to have.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, even if they think they are not necessarily interested in computer science. It was an enriching and thorough introduction to computer science that exposed me to a variety of coding techniques and useful applications. It surely was a lot of work and I personally struggled to get through it all, but I'd still highly recommend taking the course. David Malan and all the TAs all make the class very entertaining and engaging and I really appreciate all the effort they put into making the class what it is.",
                "I would only recommend if you're serious about being a coding major.",
                "Yes, this is a great course for anyone who is looking to gain an introduction to programming. Start problem sets and the final test EARLY and you will be fine. Office hours during the week are generally better than on the weekend since there are fewer people, but if you do have to wait until the weekend, make sure you know the most pertinent issue you're having to get help on.",
                "Yes, it helped me consolidate the little CS knowledge I had with practical applications.",
                "This course will certainly teach you a lot, especially if you do not have that much exposure to computer science.  If the workload was not very very demanding, I could easily recommend this course, but the fact of the matter is that you will be spending a lot of time coding if you sign up for this course.  If you are someone ready to spend a lot of time to understand how to approach coding and want to get a good overview of a lot of different coding languages, this class is for you.  But I would say that if your heart is not in or you are unsure, take time to think before taking this course.  I took this course uncertain of whether I would enjoy it and came out of it feeling very accomplished with the experience.  Some of the people I know, though, came out of it feeling miserable and cursing the course and struggled constantly.  Its a great course, but I find myself having a difficult time recommending it universally.",
                "I have a relatively hard time recommending this class to a complete beginner. I think if you have at least some level of experience in coding, I think you could really gain a lot from this class. But for a complete beginner, this class could be really overwhelming and discouraging. But if you are interested in CS, and are doing a light course load then I do think you can make this class work, but once again only if you can dedicate the necessary time to it."
