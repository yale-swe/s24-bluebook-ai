                "I learned a lot about American constitutional law as it relates to economic affairs, and about the different schools of thought on the subject. I gained experience in reading Supreme Court cases and briefs and legal scholarship. While it sometimes felt a bit forced, I spent time thinking about how to practically apply ethical theories to real-world issues.",
                "I learned how to approach supreme court cases and navigate the relationship between ethical and legal reasoning.",
                "We learned how to a wide array of legal theories and tools the Supreme Court uses, how to analyze Supreme Court cases, and how to apply several key ethical theories to these cases. I learned about how the court functions and thinks, the nature of rights, and how important economic and business rights are.",
                "The class gives you a deeper and more nuanced understanding of Constitutional provisions, legal reasoning underscoring Supreme Court decisions, ethical considerations and moral frameworks of key thinkers. Discussions were built around the paramount tenets of majority and dissenting opinions of some seminal, as some lesser known, Supreme Court cases that have proved instrumental in setting precedents on many Amendments; moreover, readings extend beyond these and into academic literature surrounding the cases.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the readings in this course are mostly excellent, and the professor did a really good job cultivating an arc of legal scholarship that proceeds nicely from one topic to the next. The class assignments are relatively spaced out, so the workload never gets too crazy. Class discussions were good, but some people had nothing to contribute. \r\nWeaknesses: my biggest qualm with this class is its conceptual framing. The connection between the \"pure\" ethical theories the professor put forward and the legal texts we read is often strained and sometimes outright forced. This course should probably be two courses, and I would have liked to take the one about commercial constitutional law.",
                "Strengths: we read and gained a pretty deep understanding of landmark cases in business ethics. the reading was manageable and we usually discussed all the things we read. Professor Collins genuinely cares about his students and goes out of his way to accommodate their requests, if you ask in reasonable time. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found the discussion quality to be fairly low, as it was mostly limited to surface-level ethical analysis of cases. If you're looking to do ethical analysis that goes deeper than applying a one-sentence description of a few ethical theories to court cases, this course will not feel rigorous at all. Professor Collins also grades papers quite harshly and somewhat arbitrarily; several students reported that he took points off because they did not elaborate enough on certain concepts, but when asked what they should cut from the paper to remain under the word limit, he could not give a solid answer. This course felt much more like a high school history course to me than a college seminar, except with harsher grading.",
                "Strengths: Absolutely loved this class. Very interesting syllabus and class discussions. Amazing feedback from professor on essay. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Decent amount of readings, but all are interesting. Collins is good at calling on everyone, but definitely a class for more outspoken people.",
                "learning about the cases/legal interpretation is super interesting. but the ethics stuff is not properly integrated into the material. having to reference all these thinkers all the time is just distracting from the legal analysis, and it means we cant even get to the bottom of what the thinkers would believe about these issues either. Its just legal analysis plus random maybe aristotle would think this, or maybe he would think this thrown in."

                "This is a seminar with a moderate workload. If you want to learn more about constitutional law (particularly commercial law) and don't mind getting bogged down in shallow conversation about first-order ethical principles, you should take this class. If you have a solid legal background or are searching for a class on ethics, look for something in the philosophical department.",
                "Yes absolutely. If you're interested at all in law or the Supreme Court, this is a great class with a low entry barrier. Every class was full on interesting debates and discussions, and the readings were great. Don't be scared about the business component, read the syllabus. It's all way more applicable than you think, and I guarantee you will learn so much more about the importance of property and economic rights (as well as speech, religion, etc).",
                "Yes, I would! Professor Collins is brilliant at fostering deep, academic discussion in class but also provides clear breakdowns of complex legal and ethical concepts: not sacrificing one for the other. Moreover, you learn a lot about the key tenets of modern, American society and the problems of Federalism we still face today. The skills gained from this course are applicable to any field, not just law!",
                "hmm probably not in its current form. doesnt allow enough focus on any issue to think deeply about it."
