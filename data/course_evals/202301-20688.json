                "We learned both physics concepts and their applications to technologies. As someone who took AP Physics C, the physics in this class wasn't too difficult, and learning about the applications was super cool. Professor Miller was a fantastic teacher, and I really enjoyed learning from him. The exams aren't too difficult if you pay attention in class (or rewatch the recorded lectures). The curve is very helpful as well. The problem sets can be completed relatively quickly with basic math (1-2 hours).",
                "I learned how everyday things such as cell phones, solar panels, MRI machines, and my eyeballs work. This class taught me the fundamental laws that govern basic function of an enormous range of things. I learned how basic physics applies to my life in an easy to understand way. I also learned about the Hairy Ball Theorem and how many right arms a salamander will grow if their left arm is moved to their right side. This class is amazing.",
                "I learned a lot about technology and applied physics, and learned an immense amount about how different technologies work.",
                "I learned a lot about how different technologies work and some important physics and chemistry concepts that improved my understanding of the world.",
                "I gained a better understanding of how technology around me works, as well as stronger scientific literacy in general.",
                "A in depth understanding of how basic electrical systems and electronics work.",
                "Basic physics- topics included: electricity and magnetism, waves, light, VR AR MR, information theory, quantum and solar, imaging. Twice a week lecture with two exams and a final video project.",
                "basics of physics",
                "This course provided a good high level background on a variety of topics, including electricity, light, and information theory",
                "A little bit of basic physics/ cursory knowledge as to how some technologies worked.",
                "As someone who had already taken PHYS 180 and PHYS 181, I found this course to be an interesting extension of my prior knowledge. While much of the content covered in the class was reminiscent of basic high school physics, I found it to be a valuable review that reinforced my understanding of the subject matter. In addition, I was able to expand my knowledge by learning about the workings of various devices and technologies, including my experience with polarization sheets, which gave me a greater understanding of how light behaves and how it can be manipulated for practical applications.\r\n\r\nHowever, what truly made this course worthwhile was the practical applications of physics that we explored. Through studying the workings of various devices and technologies, I gained a newfound appreciation for the role that physics plays in our everyday lives. Even though my knowledge of purely theoretical physics did not increase by much, I was able to apply what I learned to real-world situations, and that made all the difference.\r\n\r\nIn terms of skills, this course was a great opportunity to improve my iMovie video editing and PowerPoint preparation abilities. The final project in particular required us to combine these two skills in order to create an engaging and informative presentation. I found that this exercise not only improved my technical abilities, but also gave me valuable experience in presenting complex concepts to others.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about the practical applications of physics. While it may not be as theoretical as some other physics courses, the skills and knowledge gained here are directly applicable to real-world situations, making it a valuable addition to any student's education.",

I learned a lot about foundational physics, but from a very abstract perspective -- the higher-level mathematical concepts were largely ignored, especially in regards to material necessitating the use of calculus. Some of the more fascinating topics included how cameras work, how 3D images and films work, what fiber optic cables are, how our ID cards work to scan us into buildings, how our computers store data. Overall, the course invited us to more critically and concretely engage with the technologies that we use on a daily basis, and to understand more deeply and profoundly the world around us.",

As a history major, I hardly know how to save files as a PDF so it was fascinating to learn the way that things work in the real world. I also learned that I am not a good test taker.

                "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Support from Professor Miller and the TFs was abundant, and feedback was clear. The exams were fairno trick questions and we were allowed a single sheet of notes. The psets were both challenging and fun. This is a very well-run course.",
                "The class moved very quickly yet forgivingly. The grading scheme seems pretty lenient (knock on wood) but I honestly don't feel like I learned that much because of how quickly the class moved. I took AP Physics 1 and self-studied AP Physics C in high school but I still felt like I did not have a rigorous-enough understanding of basic Physics electricity and magnetism concepts before we jumped to more complicated technologies. The tests are very hard, and while the curve seems generous, I do think the tests worded the material in ways incongruent with the ways we learned them. Overall: the lectures are mildly engaging, the curve seems (again, I hope) forgiving, but I didn't learn that much in the class and it was very hard for me.",
                "This course was amazing! I learned so much and loved attending every lecture. This course did a really good job of simplifying complicated topics so everyone could understand. The pset were relevant and important to further understanding of the materials and while the exams were hard, I thought they were reasonable and good.",
                "Strengths: The lectures were interesting, and the midterms were fair (especially with the curve). I also think Professor Miller was always willing to help and the near daily office hours meant there were always places to turn if you were confused.\r\nWeaknesses: none!",

                "Strength: lectures were engaging\r\nWeakness: exams were typical physics department exams where the average was a crushing 50-60 each time, often felt like you knew course material well but could not translate it to the exam.",
                "good lecturing and resources",
                "Strengths: the course was able to get through many interesting topics and was generally quite intuitive; I liked the structure of participation (Pollev questions graded on completion), which encouraged class attendance and engagement without adding stress about having to get the right answer\r\nWeaknesses: because this class covers such a breadth of topics, the level of depth in each topic wasn't always enough to understand the finer details (which may or may not be important depending on what you're looking for)",
                "Extremely boring lectures, decently difficult exams. Owen Miller clearly knows his stuff and is a brilliant guy, just not the best lecturer. At least the curve is nice. Only take if you need a science credit.",
                "This course was a great experience, largely due to the strengths of the course, which were rooted in the professor, Owen Miller's teaching style. Miller is an engaging and informative instructor who is always willing to provide feedback to students, even on short notice. He responds quickly and with enthusiasm to any questions, which was greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nOne of the unique features of this course was the attendance criteria, which was enforced through the use of PollEverywhere. This approach encouraged students to attend each class and stay up to date with the course content, ensuring that everyone had a solid understanding of the material.\r\n\r\nThe live demonstrations were another strength of the class, particularly the use of 3D glasses, polarization sheets, and observing the formation of standing wave patterns on sand. These demonstrations helped to bring the material to life and made the class engaging and exciting.\r\n\r\nHowever, there were also a few weaknesses to the course that should be noted. For one, the class met early in the morning, which could be a challenge for some students who struggled to stay alert during lecture. Additionally, the problem sets and exams were extremely harshly graded, with even minor mistakes resulting in significant point deductions. While this may have been intended to challenge students and ensure a high level of understanding, it also made the course more stressful and difficult than it needed to be. \r\n\r\nFinally, there was a notable lack of coverage of the \"Hairy Ball\" Theorem :(\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the course as a whole was a valuable learning experience that provided practical skills and knowledge of the applications of physics. Overall, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in exploring physics in a practical and engaging way, with the caveat that the grading may be more challenging than expected and the early morning class time may be difficult for some.",
                "Wish there was more clarity on the exams, they were tougher than the sample exams and problem sets.",
                "although the subjects that are taught are intersting, its very boring and quite slow",
                "The strength is definitely Professor Owen, the material taught and the way it was taught. I really liked the structure of having two exams early on in the term and then giving time for a final video project that was a lot of fun to make. The only real weakness I would say is that sometimes it felt that the explanations required on exams and problem sets were way too specific, more than what is necessary.",
                "Weakness is that everyone does very, very bad on the exams and it is disheartening. If you think you'd be the one to do well just know that I've like never gotten below a B on an exam and got a 52 on the first exam hah. This is your warning now.",
                "Thought it was great, super organized and fair to the students",
                "I think the video project, nice as it is to have something short for the end of term, meant I was unengaged with the material in the lectures affer the second midterm and struggled to focus. \r\n\r\nA third exam, or two exams placed differently, would have been preferable.\r\n\r\nBut overall I'm pleased with this class -- it covers a lot of ground and the exams are such that you have to learn the material in order to do well. It isn't a gut.",
                "Content was great but problem sets and exams nothing like lecture",

                "It was not as engaging as I had hoped; I also wish that there was more of an emphasis on foundational topics in physics.",
                "Strengths: Professor Miller has a ton of passion for the material, and it's especially interesting when he drops pieces of knowledge about himself that tie into the material (his PhD research, his past research, his research that was funded by Meta, to name a few). I think the in-class demos are a wonderful addition the course, and really add to the novelty of much of the material. \r\nWeaknesses: unfortunately, the course is not really tailored to the humanities student fulfilling their science requirement. I come from a decent science background (although not a super strong physics background) and this was my fatal error. The first topic of the course, electricity/magnetism, is very difficult to understand, and I honestly think learning some of the calculus might've helped. \"Magnetic flux\" is a super conceptually challenging idea to wrap one's head around, and we spent an inadequately dearth of time on it in-class. The P-Sets, especially in the beginning of the course, were exceedingly difficult, and I along with my friends took very detailed, diligent notes on the material AND used Prof. Miller's course notes and slides to supplement. I found the TAs largely useless; one in particular wasn't very interested in actually helping the struggling students. I am the type of person who requires a lot of guidance when I go through complex topics and ideas, and I didn't get them, so I honestly lost the desire to go discuss with the TAs at all. Professor Miller told us that he creates and grades the exams based on \"mastery\" of the material; I have a fundamental issue with the notion that one must be assessing students for \"mastery\" and thus penalizing them on a grand level. For a course that is intended to be an introduction to higher-level science/math concepts for the non-STEM student, one need not 'master' the material to have learned something. And the grade, in my humble opinion, should reflect that. The exams were, frankly, very very challenging -- and not in a good way. One student actually scored 100% on the first exam, which speaks volumes as to the composition of the course: some people were coasting b/c they'd taken heavy duty physics previously. Others like me were on the struggle bus with no end in sight. The course generally tries to cover too much content in too little time -- we should sit with the material a little bit longer, go through more examples... and perhaps lower expectations in an introductory, general science course. I looked into the course that Prof. Miller claims to have modeled this off of (at Berkeley) and the approach to assessment is vastly different, and the conceptual challenge-level is slightly lower. That would have been a recipe for greater success. But if I have to pore over the p-sets for hours on end and not understand any of it... there's a problem.",

                "Strengths - attendance grade requires some level of engagement, TFs were super helpful, Professor Miller communicated often and clearly with us\r\nWeaknesses - definitely has silos of teams who do psets and study together which can make the class daunting if you do not have a group of peers to work with (find your own!)",

                "Strengths: Prof Miller really sets you up for success. There are a lot of resources and practice questions available, and a lot of additional material to help you study and get confident in the material. However, this class is really not a gut  while there's no math, it is very conceptual and you will have to really engage in order to do well.",
                "I have only good things to say about the instruction and content of this course. The option to watch the course via the media library is a great option, but I found myself coming to class the majority of the time. The one weakness that I will highlight is that the first few problem sets are pretty difficult to do on your own if you have little background in physics. I found that I had to rely on the teaching fellows to help me understand how to do the problem sets in the beginning of the semester. With that being said, you certainly gain an intuition and get better at them over time.",
                "The class was super interesting, but a little more mathematically rigorous than expected for a \"gut\" science class. Content was great, but teaching staff also was pretty eager to take off a lot of points for minor errors",
                "The course was well organized and expectations were clear and the material was interesting, even to someone without a strong science background. The only weakness is that sometimes Professor Miller was a bit overly ambitious with the topics he tried to explain."

                "Yes, I do recommend this course as your science credit for someone with or without a physics background. Everyone can learn something given the broad scope of this class and how knowledgeable the professor is.",
                "This is an incredible class. I think every student should learn the physics behind machines and their functions. It's remarkable how light the physics is in this course and how much Professor Miller can explain without crazy equations and computation. This class is exceptionally entertaining and educational.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It was very interesting and challenging, but in a good way.",
                "It seems like most people in this class had a fine time with it, so I may be an outlier; regardless, these are my thoughts:\r\nI took AP Physics 1 and self-studied AP Physics C in high school and found this class incredibly challenging. I didn't miss a single lecture yet was in office hours every week to complete the Psets. I did quantitatively poor on both midterms (though there is a curve). This class definitely was not a gut for me and I hope I'm not alone when I say that. I don't think this is the easiest SC/QR credit you can take and would not recommend it unless conceptual/theoretical physics is interesting to you. As someone with more of a math background/math-y brain, I found this class and the concepts we covered really hard to grasp and truly understand.",
                "Yes! I absolutely loved this class and think anyone who is interested in physics, chemistry, or technology should take it.",
                "Yes! As a non-STEM major, it's a class that is easily accessible but one that I feel like I learned a lot from.",
                "Yes, only if they are ready for a challenge and like physics. It is a very rewarding course but requires a lot of attention.",
                "Would recommend if you need a second science credit and are willing to put time in for both exams",
                "yes -- difficult exams, but pretty rewarding class",
                "Yes! I think it's a good science credit if you're looking for a class that won't be too stressful and still provides some level of practical knowledge",
                "No, only if you need a science credit. Felt like I was wasting my time.",
                "Based on the information provided, I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in physics and is willing to put in the effort required to succeed. However, I would also advise the student to be aware of the workload and early class time (I'm sorry, I'm a night owl so  you can't blame me, for not being awake by then), as well as the challenging grading on the problem sets and exams. If the student is prepared to attend every lecture, complete weekly problem sets, and study consistently for the midterms, then they could benefit from the practical applications of physics covered in this class. Ultimately, it depends on the individual student's interests, goals, and preferences, but overall, I believe this course could be a valuable learning experience for those willing to put in the effort.",
                "I would as you get to learn a lot new concepts in physics!",
                "Yes, pretty chill class to learn about physics.",
                "yes, you learn about some cool technologies",
                "I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in learning more about everyday technology and the physics behind it. As someone who has studied physics up to a decently high level throughout high school, I still left the course having learned new things. It is not gut, you will have to put in the work with PSETS and exams but it is totally manageable especially if you have previous experience with some form of Physics in high school. It's also a great way to get your science credit out of the way.",
                "Yes, definitely. If you are interested in technology at all, it is an awesome course. You will come away from it with a whole new appreciation for the physics that makes modern life possible.",
                "I would recommend this to someone who doesn't want to take a gut science but wants a science from non-STEM people.",
                "If you have taken physics in high school this will be a gut.  Most of the concepts will be a review to you.",
                "Yes, good science credit for non-scientists. You will have to work, but not excessively. You will learn lots.",
                "It's an interesting gut class you'll learn a lot in. Not a cakewalk, but not a humungous struggle, and you'll take away a lot of really interesting information.",
                "I would recommend to anyone who wants to refresh their high school/ AP physics while diving into how the theories connect to real world technology.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! It's not a gut by any measure, but it's the first time I've taken a physics course and really enjoyed it. We learned about how some really cool modern technology works, like phones, credit cards, fiber optics, and cryptography among others. The physics was not really too difficult, although you did have to follow along in lectures and do the summarizing technique that he recommends. Midterms took a couple hours of good study but the curve and questions were very fair. Super well taught -- Prof. Miller is funny, sardonic, and a true gem of Yale that cares about communicating science in a way that people understand. If you're a non-physics STEM major (CS, stats, etc) that's looking for a science credit that will help you learn more about the world and get you excited for science again, this is it. Just don't expect to glide through the class -- show up, and you'll do well.",
                "YES yes yes! As a non-STEM person, I loved how accessible and genuinely interesting the course content was. Such a well-structured and streamlined class made me grateful that Yale forced me to take a QR class (lol), as I would have never taken the class otherwise. I now have more respect for physics and for my fellow engineers!",
                "Yes, but be cautious and ready for the work. This is not a gut science credit.",
                "No, I would recommend a course that lays more foundational groundwork.",
                "No, not at all. Biggest regret I made in my Yale career was to take my science credit my second semester senior year. Thankfully I have plans for the next year that weren't contingent on my success in this course, but if I could do it over again I would have taken a different course. In theory, this should have been perfect for me. But my apparent previous science preparation was not adequate, and the challenge of the course was off the charts. I will admit that some of my struggles were probably my own misguided attempts at trying to understand the content, and maybe I could've spent more time with the material to really digest it. But the fact of the matter is that this course is intended for people exactly like me: a humanities student who had done decently well in science and math courses in the past, and wants to actually learn something novel about the latter, rather than take a gut and waste my money. I literally took ASTR 160, Frontiers and Controversies in Astrophysics, and got an A in the class. Clearly I can understand physics to a certain degree. But not in this class. I asked actual physics majors for some help with the p-sets, and they were floored and shocked that we were talking about flux and E/M in the first few weeks of an introductory course, as the knowledge required to even wrap your head around the material is insufficient at our level. So please, unless you really know physics, are willing to not get good grades, or like struggling, don't take this course for your science credit. Choose something else, it's not worth it.",
                "No, not engaging and not worth the QR or SC",
                "Yes!",
                "it's not much of a gut. i found this course to be very difficult. i only got through it because i had someone i could consistently rely on for outside help. i would not have survived the course on my own. it's interesting but it was not for me. if physics is not intuitively your thing, the concepts in this class can be super hard to grasp.",
                "Not really. This course is NOT a gut, and while you will learn some interesting things about some pieces of technology in our world, I don't think I learned enough to justify the stress that came with preparing for the ridiculously difficult exams and fairly uninteresting nature of the lectures.",
                "Yes, but it is definitely a commitment",
                "Yes, definitely",
                "YES YES YES!!!! I learned so much and it was so accessible for a Humanities major",
                "No",
                "Yes. Good intro physics class",
                "Yes. Its a great course for those maybe interested in Physics or who are just curious about the world.",
                "Yes, wholeheartedly. This class was at the perfect level for someone who wishes to learn broadly about different technologies.",
                "Yes! The material was challenging, but the course was well-structured and I walked away with a better understanding of the technologies we use everyday.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students at Yale - especially those looking to fulfill distributional requirements. Don't get me wrong, the exams are sneaky hard and a lot more conceptual than the psets. You can grind through the psets with the help of Google and a TF, but you will struggle on exams if you do not understand the \"bigger picture\" concepts. Even so, you can do well in the class and find the material interesting even if you aren't a STEM person.",
                "Yes, it's a great QR credit for people who aren't confident in math.",
                "Yes. I wouldn't consider this class a \"gut\" because you need to attend lecture to have any idea what's going on. If you attend lecture, you'll probably need 1-2 hours a week to do the problem sets and will do well in the class.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in the topics presented in this course. It takes a lot of time and effort to understand the concepts, so it should not be taken if you are looking for an easy class.",
                "Surprised I learned something from my science credit! This is a good class but not an easy A as many would assume. That being said, you will do well if you just actually do the work!",
                "Yes. I would highly recommend this class to students who might be interested in physics. The class is very interesting as you learn about real world applications of physics rather than just an intro physics class where you would just solve a bunch of physics equations.",
                "Yes! I loved it. I had a slight background in physics (from high school) and I that definitely helped even though it had been like 3 years since then. If youre comfortable with math and science then this course should be a breeze and rather enjoyable. And if not, it should still be doable and enjoyable if you put in the time to attend all the lectures and go to office hours weekly!",
                "Yes! The professor was super engaging and the material was super interesting.",
                "Yes if interested in the material. It was definitely cool to learn about the science behind things we use in everyday life, but this course requires significant time, effort, and engagement in order to succeed. So, if you are not invested in learning about the topics covered, it is probably not the best use of your time.",
                "No, its way too hard for what its worth and assumes background knowledge",
                "Yes great course",
                "Yes, it is an intriguing course intermingled with fun physics.",
                "Yes, if you're looking for an easy science class and have some sort of physics background. If you hate math, physics, and numbers, this probably isn't the class for you. If you took AP Physics C (especially E&M) in high school, this will be pretty straightforward.",
                "This course served my purpose well, which was to get a science or QR credit without too much hassle. It's not the guttiest gut, but it's manageable and its' interesting because it's relevant to tech we use in daily life."
