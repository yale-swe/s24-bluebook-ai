    "I learned a lot about writing about a lot of different sources, and being able to analyze more than just literature.",
    "In the course we approached descriptions of wilderness (generally through Westerns) through the lens of a wide range of secondary sources, typically involving some kind of critical theory.",
    "This class really pushed me to consider the nuances of argument and history. I developed the skill of crafting a more nuanced argument, but also thinking critically about the texts and materials provided to me.",

   "comments": [
    "They syllabus was FANTASTIC. each week was cohesive and had a clear and interesting theme, and all of the material was really interesting. all of the sources felt carefully selected, and I felt as though Faye put a lot of thought into the course design. I also found the cultural study a fascinating twist on this class, and all of the material was very, very interesting to read and discuss!\r\n\r\nWeaknessess--sometimes class was a little bit silent, so many planning more activities or small group discussions as we did with Brokeback Mountain? Also, the discussion questions were a little to broad at times.",
    "It was sometimes pretty unclear how the secondary sources connected to our texts, and instead of pulling them together we just kinda didn't make the connections.",
    "The strengths were definitely the interesting content and skills developed. I appreciated all of the cultural-focused readings that encouraged me to analyze the intersection of wilderness and privilege. The main weakness would be the somewhat ambiguity surrounding the class. I feel that we never arrived with any definitions or conclusions for the term and ideas we explored.",
    "strengths- new look at popular culture, good readings, multimedia\r\n\r\nweaknesses- too much of the first half of the class, not enough end of class, sometimes felt ungrounded in actual history",
    "Cool syllabus, some of the readings lead to fun conversations, there's a field trip, and the assignments are well spread out. The topics are significantly different week to week, which keeps it interesting, and I appreciated the focus on various social issues. I think the course depends a lot on the people in it. If everyone is willing to talk (and first of all do the readings, which are lengthy some weeks), then it'l be great, but if no one has anything to say, then there will be a lot of awkward silence following the prof's sometimes-confusing questions.\r\nThat said, I do think this class will continue to get better as the prof gets used to teaching it. Even throughout this semester alone, she changed up her tactics for encouraging conversation and it got much better."

   "comments": [
    "I would! The material is very interesting and the course is very well designed!",
    "It's taught by a different professor basically every year, so it'll probably be different in future years, but if you happen to take it with Faye, I definitely recommend it if you're ready for a very \"seminar-y\" seminar - students are expected to do a lot of the talking.",
    "Yes! This class was more cultural focused than previous classes (and then I expected it to be), but overall I enjoyed it. Cant say too much since the professor and class change every year.",
    "I would strongly recommend this courseits one of the best classes I have taken at yale.",
    "if you want a cultural studies class then sure",
    "Yea, it's worth it just for the syllabus honestly. But do make sure the other students in the class seem like they're actually going to have things to say during the year, otherwise there might be a lot of awkward silence. The prof is cool, there's a field trip, the assignments are well spread out. Fun class to be in. While I was taking the class, I couldn't have described to you what it was about or what I was really learning, but looking back I feel satisfied. You explore cool ideas from an interesting lens"
