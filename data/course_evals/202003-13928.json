                "The strengths of this course would be some of the professors, especially Professor Hall, and the midterm review content, which if used correctly could save you on the exams. The weaknesses of this course include some of the professors, the difficulty of the exams, an extremely unforgiving grade curve, and the final project, which was very difficult to complete and had relatively unclear expectations with no examples given.",
                "I enjoyed the course, I thought that its structure was good because the discussion sections weren't very large so we had the opportunity to ask questions and Professor Hall's videos were helpful as well.",
                "I think the lecture style is helpful, with breakout rooms, examples, and group problems. I liked that the problem sets were hard, so it forced me to work with other people, both students and peer tutors, and they prepared me well for the exams. I didn't like the pre-class lectures and quizzes. I thought they weren't very helpful, and yet took a lot of time.",
                "Strengths are definitely the difficulty and collaborative nature of the problem sets, as I loved brainstorming with friends on how to conceptualize a problem that required an extreme abstract thought process. A specific weakness is hard to pinpoint, as the class was carried out as advertised so I never felt like the course blindsided me or did anything that was unexpected.",
                "The strengths of this course were the layout of the course, which divides the students into smaller sections for more personalized attention from the professor, and the organization of the course, as past practice tests served as test prep and quizzes served to confirm our understanding of the new content.",
                "I enjoyed this class. It was fun and engaging and the material was digestible.  The one thing I would say that could be improved is the timeline for assignments. I really wish the recorded lectures were uploaded early so that I could better budget my time and be prepared for the quizzes as well as class; Sometimes the volume of videos was a lot for one class.",
                "The virtual lecture was as good and engaging of an experience as I could hope for from a virtual course.",
                "The strengths of this course was its thoroughness in explaining the material and the resources for help which were made available. I found one weakness to be that material introduced in pre-lecture videos was often repeated in class. Although this was sometimes helpful to clarify things and expand on topics, I sometimes found it to be redundant.",
                "This class's combination of asynchronous lectures and synchronous classes was very strong. I liked being able to learn something for the first time in the videos, then ask questions in class. Tests were also always very fair. One weakness was psets, as they sometimes felt more like busywork, with really long calculations, rather than an opportunity to practice and learn.",
                "The strengths of the course included John Halls recorded Unit topics following the James Stewart Multivariable calculus textbook and the in class lectures I and with Ian Adelstein who would cover the same information as the Unit Video recordings.\r\n\r\nProfessor Adelstein did a great job facilitating close to an in- class environment by asking students to answer and give questions frequently on the material. Furthermore, there would constantly be break out rooms and live true or false question polls that were answered.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe length of the class over zoom and the engagement of students during lectures",
                "I like how each class is smaller in size, because it made it a bit easier to connect with the class being online.",
                "I love the format it translated really nicely online",
                "I think one of the course's strengths was that it was very organized, which made it much easier to see connections between topics and between different dimensions of the same ideas\/theorems. Peer tutor hours were also very widely accessible.",
                "I absolutely loved the videos from John hall teaching the subjects before the lectures.",
                "There were lots of office hours and peer tutoring hours each week, which was helpful.\r\n\r\nI felt that a weakness of the course was the way workload was structured. Before each class, students were required to watch 30-45 minute recorded clips and complete a pre-class quiz. In addition, there were weekly p-sets, three exams for the course, and a final project. I found this workload to be extremely heavy and wish there was a better balance. Also, I wish that class sessions were recorded, so that students could go back and re-watch class content."

                "The virtual review sessions for midterms were very helpful, and every extra recorded video from Professor Hall from the individual lessons all the way to the final project were much appreciated. The biggest flaw of this course was that the lessons were not recorded, which made it extremely difficult to keep up with this course if we ever fell behind in a lecture. Another learning practice that should be abolished is the group breakout rooms. I was rarely in a breakout room that benefitted my knowledge in any way, and generally they were the most dreaded part of class for me.",

                "Recording of lectures may have been useful, as the notes from class were nice to review examples as practice but no clear recording was provided for the thought process that accompanied them. I absolutely loved watching the recorded review sessions as they were always at very inconvenient times (personally) but were made very easy to use for practice when viewed later on.",
                "I understand that dividing us into smaller groups is the normal layout for MATH120, and I believe that this is the best method to each math; however, I still felt a bit disjointed and unengaged. I believe that the use of breakout rooms, JamBoard, and Zoom quizzes did increase the engagement of the course greatly, I still noticed myself zoning out at times.",

I especially liked the final project as it was a lot of fun and helped me understand some innovative ways to apply multivariate calculus.",
                "The polls and group work during lectures were very helpful, as they helped solidify the concepts of the lecture. The peer tutor office hours were helpful for the problem sets, but I do wish that some effort had been made to help students form study groups.",
                "I think the use of breakout rooms in class made it easier to get to know students in the class. I would have liked a little more guidance on and facilitation of the group project at the end of the semester. I found it difficult at times to complete this project while only able to work virtually for most of its duration.",
                "As mentioned, I think the two-pronged teaching method worked well.",
                "The breakout rooms with individual students worked as well as the videos and pre class quizzes posted by John Hall regularly. Furthermore, the Ximera website resources also helped expand my knowledge on the topics.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were the lack of practice of certain topics during class even though there were break out rooms usually designed for us to solve problems.",
                "I liked how we did breakout rooms almost every class. It was a good way to talk to classmates, switch it up, and practice problems.",

                "The videos were amazing, although I never used Ximera. I found the examples too easy.",
                "The course had three exams and a final project. I personally felt this was an extremely heavy workload, given that students were expected to also complete weekly psets and do three sit-down exams. I would have preferred if there were two exams and a final project."
