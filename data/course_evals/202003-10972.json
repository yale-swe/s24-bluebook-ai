                "Strengths: The course required you to be constantly engaged. Staying on top of the content was important in successfully completing the assignments.  I liked how we had open discussions in Korean in class.",
                "This course is amazing and Lee seonsaengnim is super helpful and welcoming. I don't have any suggestions for improvements.",
                "Strengths: The biggest strength for me was my professor. Lee SSN is a delight, as always. She is incredible at making class engaging and fun I was practically never stressed about this class despite having class, homework, and projects every day. She is so encouraging and really makes you want to become a better Korean speaker. Although this has been a very difficult semester and I struggle to learn as much virtually as I would in person, I still feel that I have made progress and am still excited about the Korean language. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is very nitpicky, I seriously thought this was a great class, but here goes: Although I absolutely loved having a projects-based class rather than exams, I think the occasional low-stakes quiz would be good to learn some new words or force myself to really internalize and memorize the new grammar structures (of which there were a lot!). I think even maybe a kahoot with this kind of stuff would be fun and use people's competitive nature to their own advantage when it comes to learning.",
                "This course is really well-balanced; there are a lot of assignments and work for the different skill areas (speaking, reading, writing, etc.) and Professor Lee is incredibly supportive and makes you feel like you are capable of more than you may believe you are initially.",
                "Strengths: amazing, thoughtful, kind professor who really cares about each student; engaged students; fun and interesting projects\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "Language classes are always better in-person but Lee really made it work! Honestly shes the biggest strength of the course.",
                "This course was taught extremely well in terms of one-on-one student engagement (even in lecture settings) and the usage of breakout rooms to continue language practice. Additionally the language table also allowed us to have a space to practice and clarify topics.",
                "It's awesome! Issn is the best teacher ever",
                "This course, although more difficult due to it being a language course taken virtually, was still always engaging. The weaknesses only are due to it being difficult to properly hear pronunciation due to virtual lessons. Still, it was overall a very strong class with an amazing professor.",
                "Given the circumstances of this semester, the course was well-suited to engaging students virtually. In particular, the focus on projects with drafts and feedback was helpful for making and maintaining progress.",
                "Our professor really took into account the circumstances around us and she curated the class to help us adjust to everything while still learning what we needed.",
                "Strengths: Lee ssn! Professor Lee is incredibly kind and encouraging, and she explains things very clearly. Professor Lee truly cares about her students and their progress, and she creates an open class environment. Weaknesses: The only weakness of the course was the pacing of larger assignments; sometimes we would have two or three large assignments in a row and then a week or two without any. I would have preferred spacing them out more evenly."

                "The focus on projects, both for writing and presentation, were the most useful for making progress both in class and as homework. Use of breakout rooms to practice was also helpful. It might be an improvement to randomize group members for projects, but there are definitely some in the class who enjoyed working with the same people repeatedly.",
                "Tests were removed and we only had projects and in class discussions in breakout rooms. They honestly helped remove a source of stress and everyone was still able to progress and learn throughout the class. The podcasts we did were especially helpful because it was done with peers and friends in the class and helped improve listening and speaking comprehension.",

I wish that we could have done more reading comprehension practice, though, since it felt like we focused mostly on speaking, listening, and writing."

Professor Lee is one of the few professors who teaches beyond the scope of the class as per its syllabus, but it doesnt feel like shes cramming information it - it simply follows a logical flow of development. Professor Lee fixes your mistakes without chastising or scolding you, as she realizes mistakes are as much a part of learning a language as speaking the language. Its a very warm and positive environment, and its made my time at Yale exponentially better.",
