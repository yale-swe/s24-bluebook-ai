                "A foundational understanding of close reading and academic writing.",

                "I learned how to become a strong close reader and how to properly analyze a work of text.",
                "I LOVED this class! It was literally one of those classes where after every single one I would feel happier than I did before. Like I could be feeling totally tired and sad going in and would always come out smiling  usually rushing back to my dorm to tell my friends or roommates what we had discussed! This class understood me, and I understood it, and it cemented the feeling that yes this is what I want to do!! First and foremost, the class taught me how to close read, something I had never really done before. At first, hearing my other friends talking about close reading I was like omg this sounds stupid, but Professor Howard from day one taught it in a way that was so engaging and easy to understand.  I immediately was like omg I love to close read!! I had so much fun with each one of his assignments, it was a joy to do work for his class. Close reading became a way I was able to truly dive into a literary text, going deeper than I had every done before  languishing in the beauty of language, and being able to synthesize my own understanding from it. I learned how to read like a close reader, and it is such a satisfying experience. Now I simply cannot get through a text without a pencil in hand, looking for the hidden meanings, patterns, symbols, and shifts. I have trouble now just reading without letting myself fully fall into the pages as a close reader. I think my essay writing skills also rapidly grew, and I was able to practice close reading through the passages, and then take it to another level with the essays. Although I had never written a close read essay before, it quickly became something I became better and better at, and something I enjoyed more and more. This was by far my favorite class, and one where I grew SO much as a reader and writer!!"

This is not because the workload was too much, but because at times discussions felt a little rushed; there were a few books that I believe deserved an extra class worth of discussion. That said, all the books were so good it would be hard to choose which one to cut.",
                "Strengths - organized, engaging, discussion-based\r\nWeaknesses - would like to read American texts from a broader range of time periods (so we can potentially compare them and discuss how temporal context affects the writing)",

One weakness was that I felt like the readings were a bit rushed, but understand that the timing of the semester does not allow for us to slow down.",
                "Strengths: The reading list is great, Professor Howard is enthusiastic about the material, reasonable course policies, and the workload is very manageable\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it was difficult to stay engaged for the full 75 minutes of class,",
                "Strengths: I loved the reading list and class discussions were always very interesting and insightfulthey made me look forward to every class!\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "This was an amazing class. I think how close reading was introduced was great, and the strategy of doing it together in class, then practicing on our own and receiving feedback for the passages, and then using that to help us with the essays was perfect! Class discussions were always so so fun, and I think the passages we chose to focus on in class was always spot on. Conversation was always incredibly rich and thought provoking, and I really really appreciated that we would always re-read the passages we would focus on again in class. Professor Howard did a phenomenal job of engaging the whole class, so no one felt left out or behind. I liked how we were able to practice close reading, share our own thoughts, opinions, and passages, and engage in fun activities  like when we split up between the Brotherhood and Ras the Destroyer when we were reading The Invisible Man. I also think how American literature was introduced and taught was incredibly incredibly important and amazing. When I first signed up for this class I was honestly dreading it, in that I thought it would be made up of the white man American classics, but this class went so far beyond that in a way I could have only dreamed. The texts we read made clear that American literature includes Black voices, queer voices, women's voices. Even the white man classic Moby Dick was taught in a way that went so far beyond the surface - it was a book about race, sexuality, internationality too! I do wish we read more texts by women though. We read The Color Purple, but that was about it, and all the other texts were pretty male heavy. So, if I had any one big suggestion it would definitely be that there were more texts by women, that would have meant a lot to me. Also, I do think there could have been more time for student discussion, as often Professor Howard would talk a lot during class. I don't think this is a bad thing, for he always said really really interesting and enlightening things that helped deepen class discussion (!!), but sometimes I wish there was more time to talk and hear from fellow students!"
