                "Strengths: Even though signals are not intuitive at all, it's not a very hard class, the professors give a ton of hints about the exam and psets\r\nWeaknesses: It is pretty boring at times, the lectures are not very engaging",
                "Great professors -- they really care about their students and teaching the material.",
                "the course was great but I wish the profs had set office hours instead of asking us to email them for availability. I am shy and never got round to doing that so I didnt really develop a relationship with the profs even though it was a relatively small class.",
                "Examples in problem sets and class did not translate to material tested sometimes",
                "Strength: Amazing professors, they really cared about our learning, made it easy to do so. TAs were also very accessible. Problem sets were long / challenging, but reasonable. The answer keys were always clear and posted in a timely fashion\r\n\r\nWeakness: Poor audio quality on Professor Staib's mic :(",
                "It was very hard to focus over zoom, this was a very hard class and it took me a while to focus in the class.",

Also, the TAs are wonderful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSometimes the lectures get dull and feel disconnected from anything applicable to bme. It would be nice to get a broader view of the material and why certain computational concepts are applicable/important.",
