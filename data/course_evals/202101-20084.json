                "Sometimes it was hard to keep up in class when notes were pre-written. Would be nice to have those pre-written slides before class too so that we can write on them along with the prof instead of starting out behind. Good examples and demos in class!",
                "Strengths: Even though signals are not intuitive at all, it's not a very hard class, the professors give a ton of hints about the exam and psets\r\nWeaknesses: It is pretty boring at times, the lectures are not very engaging",
                "Great professors -- they really care about their students and teaching the material.",
                "the course was great but I wish the profs had set office hours instead of asking us to email them for availability. I am shy and never got round to doing that so I didnt really develop a relationship with the profs even though it was a relatively small class.",

                "Strength: Amazing professors, they really cared about our learning, made it easy to do so. TAs were also very accessible. Problem sets were long \/ challenging, but reasonable. The answer keys were always clear and posted in a timely fashion\r\n\r\nWeakness: Poor audio quality on Professor Staib's mic :(",
                "It was very hard to focus over zoom, this was a very hard class and it took me a while to focus in the class.",

Also, the TAs are wonderful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSometimes the lectures get dull and feel disconnected from anything applicable to bme. It would be nice to get a broader view of the material and why certain computational concepts are applicable\/important.",
                "The material is more on the dry side, which can make it hard to follow. Prof. Staib's lecture is mainly PowerPoints while Prof. Duncan's lecture is mainly written out notes. Having more examples on the material before the midterm would had been very helpful."
