There are challenging but doable deadlines, there's space at the beginning of the semester to figure out exactly what your project will look like, there's flexibility and accountability on completing the projects. \r\nAs someone who did a 2-part creative project, I found it frustrating that I was told to do all of the research/writing first and then to do the creative project. I found a lot of direction and clarity through doing the creative project and ended up having to write more of the paper after that anyway, so I wish there had been more flexibility in that sense. But otherwise, I found that there was a lot of support available from my peers and professors.",
                "They need a better teacher for the class because it is unstructured and poorly run.",
                "strengths - the fact that this class exists and we're able to devote a year to a project!\r\n\r\nweaknesses - we didn't meet much in the spring semester. it would've been nice to get to know more people in my cohort. also would have been nice to receive more in-depth feedback from instructors on my writing",
                "Strength and weakness - most peoples experience was influenced significantly by who their mentor was. Ed Studies should probably aim to increase the range of mentors to avoid conflicting feedback and opinions. Choose wisely!!!!!",
                "I think there needs to be clearer expectations for the capstone. My capstone experience was one where I had to constantly explain/defend myself and the things I am passionate about in ways that felt really horrible, unaffirming, and racialized. I was told that this project was my own but over and over again I walked away from my conversations with Dr. Debs and TZB feeling like it wasnt. In all honestly almost all my challenges pursuing my project came from the emotions, extreme stress, and demoralized feelings that came from this. Especially before the capstone, Ed studies was such a beautiful space for me, specifically because of the students that make it up. This program attracts such intentional, creative, passionate and critical students. I dont think its fair for ed studies to attract these students and present itself to be a certain way if it is not willing to wholeheartedly affirm students. This means supporting students in pursing whatever project they want, and in whatever form it takes, in a way that makes the process easier not harder.",

                "If you want to work in education, then I think this course is a valuable process worth going through (separately from a thesis in another major). However, it is a lot to balance doing two big senior projects/theses, so I would approach it cautiously and discuss with your advisors what your motivations and goals are, and if they and you think it would be constructive for you to do this big project. This class offers a space to do meaningful, independent work in a group of scholars, and that's a great experience that is worth having, especially if you're not getting that elsewhere. But be prepared for the stress of always having more you could be doing.",
                "Nope",
                "No. I love education studies but after doing the capstone class I honestly can't say I would recommend it to another student. It was needlessly stressful and the teacher was rude and unprofessional. They overshared in a completely inappropriate way and blatantly picked favorites based on who would share the most personal details about their life. They desperately wanted students to trauma dump to them so they could have this unprofessional inappropriate bond. If you weren't comfortable or willing to needlessly share your personal trauma, you wouldn't be one of her favorites. If you aren't one of the favorites of this professor you are going to have a terrible experience in this class. I wish I could have just written my capstone with out this class because it was such an awful experience.",
                "yes, if they're good at managing themselves and are excited about executing a project like this. I especially recommend it to people who can think of a good advisor to rope inn.",
                "Yes, but be prepared for an unpredictable experience and go in with a firm idea of what you want to get out of this. Be aware that you may experience major disagreements and different opinion/feedback between Ed Studies faculty members and learn how to avoid getting caught in the crossfire. Set boundaries early on and do what brings you joy and fulfilment. I worry that Ed Studies is increasingly sacrificing what makes it special in pursuit of institutional credibility at Yale.",
