This course focuses on honing students' ability to hold longer conversations and write more sophisticated essays in Chinese. It covers many different topics and teaches Chinese culture along with a lot of new vocabulary.",

                "Strength: You definitely improve at Chinese\r\nWeakness: Lot and lot of work. Sometimes the work feels like it doesnt help and is just busy work. Classes can sometimes be lackluster.",
                "The strength is having Chinese practice every day and a lot of speaking and listening. The weakness is that some of the assignments were useless. In-class presentations had little educational value, as we just memorized our essays and wasted a class every week on listening to others' presentations. Handwriting a pre-written essay was annoying and didn't help with studying characters because I was just automatically copying characters from the digital version. Friday's session assignments weren't helpful as well. I'd love to have more listening\/reading assignments instead of the three types of assignments above.",
                "Weakness: The material needs to be updated for modern Chinese conversations.\r\nStrength: The constant class time forces your Chinese to develop.",
                "The course is very rigorous, and I think it could use more speaking practice.  Sometimes I found there was too much focus on reading\/writing, which I think is less important than speaking practice."

                "I would recommend this course to any student that seriously wants to pursue their studies in Chinese. The workload is quite a lot with homework assigned every night but it is a very organized course and you learn a lot while making a big step towards speaking Chinese at an advanced level.",
                "I would recommend, but with caution.  Chinese is a very difficult language, and getting a good grade in this class requires a lot of time and energy."
