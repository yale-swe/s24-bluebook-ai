It covers many different topics and teaches Chinese culture along with a lot of new vocabulary.",

                "The strength is having Chinese practice every day and a lot of speaking and listening. The weakness is that some of the assignments were useless. In-class presentations had little educational value, as we just memorized our essays and wasted a class every week on listening to others' presentations. Handwriting a pre-written essay was annoying and didn't help with studying characters because I was just automatically copying characters from the digital version. Friday's session assignments weren't helpful as well. I'd love to have more listening/reading assignments instead of the three types of assignments above.",
                "Weakness: The material needs to be updated for modern Chinese conversations.\r\nStrength: The constant class time forces your Chinese to develop.",

The workload is quite a lot with homework assigned every night but it is a very organized course and you learn a lot while making a big step towards speaking Chinese at an advanced level.",
