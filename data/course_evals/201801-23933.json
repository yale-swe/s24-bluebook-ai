    "Although I had already studied the Second World War extensively out of a personal interest, I learned so much more about the war and its impacts on society today through this class.",
    "The course provided a good introduction to World War II, from its inception to its aftermath. The course also provided feedback on general writing skills, which were helpful.",
    "I learned so much about world war 2, specifically the global perspective, which I hadnt fully appreciated or learned about before.",
    "I learned a lot about military history of the second world war - but I learned the most from my research paper.",
    "Research paper writing, primary source examination",
    "I learned a great deal about the way that World War Two engaged world powers on multiple levels.  The course covered the military side of the conflict, of course, but I learned a great deal from the looks at the trials and tribulations of occupied nations and civilian populations that the course took time to delve into.  This is one of the two most enjoyable courses I have taken at Yale, and I found myself learning new things about how and why different factions fought WWII every day."

   "comments": [
    "This course was my favorite course since coming to Yale. I have no complaints.",
    "The course really tried to provide an introduction to the entirety of World War II, which was really amazing but also somewhat ambitious. Sometimes I felt that we were skimming through some very important topics that deserved more time than what we spent on them. The course also focused much more on military history than what I expected it to be, and I hope that we had more time spent on the non-military influence of the war. I sometimes felt that we can talk less on the specific details of certain battles and instead focus more on, say, how women experienced the war, or how society behind the front were affected by the war efforts. Perhaps a more diverse selection of students might have helped, since what it seemed like was that most of the students were either in the military or had military history as their primary academic interest. I also wish we had more time spent on discussions, since I feel like sometimes we would spend so much time trying to make sure we know certain facts, instead of really discussing what we thought about he readings.",
    "Strengths are subject matter and diversity of readings.\r\nWeakness is the emphasis on military aspects.",
    "Course doesn't actually focus on the 'hard questions' it claims to, with the exception of one or two class sessions - would be great if it focused more on women and some more of the social issues the war brought up."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is a comprehensive exploration into WWII leaving you with a sense of the conflict from a variety of perspectives. Professor Johnson is a masterful instructor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about World War II.",
    "The course was a nice introduction to World War II, and I would definitely recommend it. Professor Johnson provides a lot of personal feedback which is very helpful for improving ones writing skills and critical thinking. The course may be more military history-heavy than what the syllabus might suggest, though, if it continues to be like what it was this year.",
    "Wonderful course. Prof Johnson is a wonderful seminar leader.",
    "Yes, but be warned that this is more of a lecture course than a seminar.  It is also strictly a military history course, and covers all details and events of military campaigns but neglects to discuss women, minorities, domestic situations, etc. thoroughly enough.",
    "As an avid WWII amateur historian I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, even someone not that interested in WWII. The course did an outstanding job bringing in multiple viewpoints and little-known history to develop students' deep understanding of the conflict. Additionally, Professor Johnson is an outstanding instructor and is very engaging in class. 10\/10 my favorite class in my 3 years here at Yale.",
    "Yes if you're interested in WWII",
    "I would, for anyone interested in WWII.  I went into the course with a good starting knowledge of the War but I learned a great deal and found myself eagerly awaiting class every week.  The class was a fantastic experience."
