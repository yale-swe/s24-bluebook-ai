    "I absolutely loved taking this course. I learned a lot about media and how the media has shaped sports. There was a lot of incorporated discussion about recent ideas in race and gender inequality.",
    "I enjoyed this course because I got to engage in conversations regarding sports culture in America and how it impacts society."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - interesting films and the readings provided a lot of context that helped the viewing process, group discussions were very engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- did not know where you stood in regards to grades throughout the course",
    "strengths were good movies and good convos but weaknesses were maybe that the class is kind of intimidating when all together to speak and the class time is long",
    "I think that it is time for the film selection to be updated to incorporate more voices and points of view. Women and people of color, in particular, deserve to be heard more than this selection provided. The readings were interesting, but many were written by the same few authors. Once again, hearing from many perspectives helps to round out the reality of what is going on. For example, a reading about women in sports was written by a man. That doesn't seem right to me. \r\n\r\nThe strengths of this course were the open times that we were able to discuss our thoughts without input from the professor or the TF. I found that their questions squandered our learning and thinking. \r\n\r\nMy favorite part of the course was the student presentations. It was interesting to learn about 'fringe' sports and do some research myself.",
    "It could be improved by being more structured however the strengths of the course include Professor Musser's attention to helping us. He took the time for individual improvement and reflection on how to improve class performance."

    "yes it was fun and interesting and engaging",
    "No, I would not. Even though it was relaxed, I didn't find myself wanting to participate like I do in other courses. Maybe this is because the discussion style is different from what I am accustomed to, but it wasn't as fulfilling as I hoped it would be.",
    "Absolutely, I think this is a useful and interesting course."
