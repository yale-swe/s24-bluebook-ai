                "I learned how to evaluate, interpret, and create meaningful arguments about U.S history, imperialism, and its relationships to gender and sexuality.",

I also believe that this course improved my writing skills and my ability to come up with effective theses.",

                "I developed many writing skills such as comparing historical events/movements to current events/movements, how to analyze primary sources, and how to examine themes in sources such as a movie."

                "Strengths - readings and discussions are VERY interesting. I looked forward every week to coming to this class and discussing the readings with the professor and other students. The essays, though difficult, were also enjoyable and thought-provoking. Overall, the atmosphere of the class was friendly and very collaborative. The class was kind of what you made of it - you could put a lot of effort into the class in terms of discussions, readings, and essays, and they you also got a lot out of it, but there were also ways to do less work and still succeed academically. \r\nWeaknesses - There were a lot of readings, and it was sometimes difficult to understand what was important to sink time into understanding versus what was less important and could be skimmed for the sake of time. It did often feel like the whole of the class held the same opinion on the subjects we were talking about, which made discussions feel a little one-sided, but that wasnt the professors fault and Im not sure what could be done about that - and I would want to sacrifice the way the discussions felt safe for everyone to participate.",
                "This class was fun to take part in, and I loved the class environment that was created. As well, you are given a lot of intellectual freedom in this class, which I enjoyed. However, sometimes the instructions were a bit unclear, so that made some of the essays slightly difficult.",
                "Strengths of the course were the content and the instructor. The content was by far some of the most interesting stuff Ive ever studied in school, and TZB made every lecture super engaging and interactive. I always felt like our insights were welcome and contributed meaningfully to the material.",
                "The syllabus was fantastic; I found all of the readings very interesting and we were given a nice combination of assignments throughout the semester. I appreciated the opportunity to do a presentation related to the readings and I thought the essay prompts were amazing. I also liked the opportunity for class and small-group discussions. I think that the discussions could have benefitted at times from more structure to ensure that more voices could be heard equally.",
                "I think the strengths are the amount of detail we are given with each assignment, so you feel prepared to write/read because you know what is expected of you. I also think TZB is a great lecturer and knows how to balance between instructive and interactive classroom styles which was really nice.",
                "Strengths of this course is that it is well organized and very entertaining. All the materials and readings were very insightful. This class changed my perspective by teaching me how to view things with a historical and critical lens. A weakness is that the readings could be pretty long but this allowed for the developing of reading skills."

I came out of the class with a lot more knowledge about US history from the lens of American ideas of gender and sexuality, which has helped me better understand pop-culture better and has helped me see the roots of some issues that are impacting us today. If you are lucky enough to get into this class, please take it!",

It is a fairly easy workload in comparison to other Yale courses, but it is great enough that I wouldn't take this class if you simply want a gut.",
                "Yes, definitely. It was my favorite class of the semester.",
                "Absolutely! It was so interesting and unlike anything I had ever taken. I think about the world differently after taking this course and would highly recommend it to others!",

                "Yes I would, this course was very interesting and the workload was manageable. I enjoyed the smaller class of first years."
