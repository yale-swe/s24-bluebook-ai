I learned a lot about the ecological, political, and socioeconomic aspects of coastal development in the Caribbean and came away with a rich understanding of the vast subject at hand. My one caveat is that the workload is pretty high, due to students each leading a lecture and completing a final original research project over the course of the semester on top of weekly readings. If you're up to it, it's totally worth it for the learning experience you come away with!"
