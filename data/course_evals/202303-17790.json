                "The course was well organized and included an important practical element: The Stirling Engine. This is extremely important since the course is designed for engineering majors. I do wish that we could have worked on the Stirling Engine together or had practical work done as a class lead by the lecturer in a lab to prepare for this final project.",
                "The material in this course is very dense and there's a lot to cover, but it was well-organized and taught in as interesting a way as possible. I think more example problems in class would be helpful, as a lot of time was spent on derivations which we sometimes used but often did not, but I think this is a trade off of Cong's emphasis on understanding rather than problem solving.",
                "Lectures were pretty clear, but lacked examples of the concepts being taught, making the homeworks fairly difficult."

                "Yes, particularly with Professor Cong Su. The course is extremely interesting and leads an engineering-approach to thermodynamic studies.",
                "Yes. You probably need to take this if you are taking it, but especially with Cong as a professor, it's taught interestingly and with a lot of care.",
                "This course was one of the best I have taken as a mechanical engineering major here at Yale. There is definitely a lot of material covered, but it feels organized, and it is relatively easy to absorb it, and it feels like you have learnt a ton by the end of the semester. Only problem was the stirling engine contest that was part of the grade, and almost no one could make it work. Definitely suggest this class.",
