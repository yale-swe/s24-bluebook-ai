I understood how one's neighborhood, social policies, stress and health disparities could influence health.\r\nI learnt how to apply the knowledge acquired in class to addressing a major health issue in Ghana in an op-ed, which I had written for the first time.\r\nThe structure of the class allowed for a lot of interaction with classmates from different racial, ethnic and continental backgrounds.",
                "I learned foundational concepts on Social and Behavioral Science in the public health setting.",
                "I learned how to think more critically about the different social determinants of health. I also had never done an oped and this class provided the opportunity to do so. This allowed me to get back into writing and think about problems that are important to me.",

                "I learned the various principles of behavioural sciences.",
                "Great foundational knowledge on SBS. How to think of a subject like SBS through a structural lens and breaking down issues from multiple perspectives. Understanding more about causal diagrams, mediators, topics like stigma, neighbourhoods and their impact on health was great. The course allowed me to think about these topics in a more structured manner.",
                "(1) I developed a sense of how much of the inequities in our healthcare system have their foundations in structural, social, and behavioral systems.\r\n(2) I learned about some of the generalizable models that are used to describe and test many of the hypotheses about how certain determinants play a role in public health.\r\n(3) I gained greater knowledge of many social existing inequities and what their root causes might be.\r\n(4) I gained some sense of how to bridge the gap between having knowledge of these systemic inequities and putting this knowledge into action as a public health professional in implementation solutions and influencing political, economic, and social change."

It was an enriching experience to hear people from different parts of the world discuss issues of stigma, neighborhoods, socio-economic status, and their impact on health. So I would say active listening and peer engagement were actions that helped me in my learning in this course.",
