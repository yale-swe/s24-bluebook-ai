                "I found the class to be quite excellent and to have very few weaknesses.\r\nIf I had to recommend improvements, the class might be better served by having more theory covered either in lecture or section. Oftentimes we had great discussions about policy and real-world applications (which I greatly enjoyed), but then did the same in section, leaving little time to study the logical underpinnings behind a lot of the theoretical material. Again, that's just nitpicking. There's very little I would like to see changed in this course!",
                "Strengths: lectures structured clearly, learned a tremendous amount, professor/TFs very diligent and committed to teaching\r\nWeaknesses: mostly these -- class very disorganized as first time being taught - professor and TFs often not aligned, workload was unreasonable, grading expectations were consistently unclear and expectations for writing were arbitrary and unreasonable for undergraduates, consistently did not get assignments back within a reasonable time frame",
                "Strengths: well-organized, interesting content, professor was open to some feedback / changing the syllabus in response to student concerns. Weaknesses: the readings were 100% academic papers, which made it a bit dry / overly theoretical at times. The grading was also very frustrating - I felt like it was very arbitrary, and I never quite knew what I needed to do to raise my grade despite doing my absolute best to incorporate feedback from previous papers and following the syllabus directions exactly. It also felt like there were implicit guidelines that we were meant to follow when writing our essays that were never mentioned in the syllabus - we just lost points for when we would not follow them, which was extremely demoralizing by the end of the semester.",
                "Strength: the material is interesting and the TFs genuinely want to help you.\r\nWeakness: While I recognize this was Prof. Brancati's first semester teaching a new course, GLBL 275 was not organized at all. The class expectations were difficult to understand and the grading was inconsistent.",
                "Strengths: Covered wide range of material using interesting mix of theories and examples; professor was very available to meet with students and incorporated feedback, made strong effort to get to know everyone; assignments aligned well with course material; \r\nWeaknesses: Professor was disorganized, making it hard to follow some lectures; grading was pretty harsh",
                "strengths - interesting assignments, great TFs, guest lecture with Rory Stewart\r\nweaknesses - lectures were dull and the professor was reputed for odd and often inconsiderate statements - we were lied to about how Prof Monteiro did the course to make the new assignment workload seem fair - when the professor was called out on it, the schedule was changed",
                "Strengths - Prof and students are engaging, which is impressive for a lecture. I will give DB credit for adapting the course to our needs and reducing the paper workload. \r\nWeaknesses - papers aren't interesting to read (unless you're VERY interested in 1) theory and 2) security). Felt like there was so much background on current/recent conflicts that we're assumed to know but don't know - it's like the expectation is that we read on international affairs every day; so lecture was hard to follow. Expectations of papers (esp. wrt outside research) is not always clear.\r\nDB's teaching style may have been great for some people, but not for me. Her ego is palpable and she will often mention her awards/accomplishments/things she's been invited to. She finds odd (at best) ways to demonstrate interests in her students, such as labeling people with the country they're from and looking students up online. If you aspire to be a self-centered academic DB's teaching style will be a great match... but most people in this class don't.",
                "Strengths:\r\nInteresting guest speakers, structured, interesting topics. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nMany, long readings that are hard to complete each week.",
                "Strength: I liked the reflection essay prompts/process. It really forced me to critically approach scholars texts that I usually take for granted!",
                "Strengths: readings were mostly interesting and well-selected, with some informative pieces that cover less discussed topics such as womens role in terrorism and negotiations. I also enjoyed the discussion of how IR theory can apply to current affairs. Weaknesses: The class and Professor Brancatis style have made myself and others uncomfortable plenty of times this semester: from using [insert country of origin] guy to call on students, to its pretty ugly anyways when referring to a religious building, to using screenshots from questionable not-even-mainstream Chinese media as examples of Chinese propaganda (mainstream media offers a different narrative, but alas that didnt help the point the Balance of Power lectures were trying to prove), to the numerous times Professor Monteiros name and other words were misspelled on the lecture slides. I was surprised by how US-centric the course was, and how the US is always referred to as us, even though a third of the class was probably international students. The prompts of the final paper felt somewhat disconnected from our readings. Grades are never given to us when theyre supposed to be. And there were considerable grading discrepancies across sections and between the professor and the TFs.",
                "I found the material itself very interesting, but I thought we could have done more case studies to complement the theory we were learning about. It was hard to apply the theory for me especially because I can't rattle historical examples off-hand like many of my peers since my interest in in global health. Prof. Brancati said she acknowledged that this was a difficulty and didn't know how to fix it, but I think it could be easily fixed by doing more case studies in lecture and in section. I appreciated that she sought our feedback so consistently.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Brancati was accessible to students via email/office hours, and she made an effort to incorporate student feedback into the course. The conversations with the senior fellows at the end of the semester were also very interesting. Weaknesses: Lectures moved quickly and were difficult to absorb. There was little guidance on how to approach written assignments, and the workload (especially in the original version of the syllabus) was way too heavy. The feedback I received on my assignments was very unhelpful. The comments on one of my reflection papers very uniformly positive and just said \"good job,\" but several points had been docked from each section, and I had no idea why they were taken off or what to improve on next time. Discussion sections were pretty much useless  we rarely talked about the readings, and our discussions of real-world events, while interesting, did not improve my understanding of the course material.",
                "Strengths: I had a good TA, Professor was very flexible at times \r\nWeaknesses: grading is really difficult, lecture style is scrambled so hard to retain information, lack of sensitivity at times, Professor makes a lot of microaggressions",
                "While the course is well organized, the lectures can be bland. It is expected given the nature of the content.",
                "Weaknesses: PowerPoint slides very difficult to follow",
                "There is a lot of support (TFs, Prof Brancati) available for writing help, and I feel that we covered a wide range of relevant security topics. The writing assignments (three reflection papers plus the two take-home essays) were reasonable. However, the course was very focused on theory, and I would have liked to see some more time devoted to case studies or current events. Although the readings were overall interesting, there is a lot and this can be overwhelming.",
                "The course covered interesting topics and sections were very engaging. However, students seemed to come to the course with varying levels of background knowledge. Perhaps conceptual theories could have been taught with more context and specific historical examples. That being said, by the end of the semester, Professor Brancati did incorporate many more examples to explain the theories we were learning. \r\nFinally, I don't think that lecture participation should factor into the grade as its own categories. This encouraged some students to participate all the time, leaving the students who don't feel comfortable raising their hand in a large lecture in a difficult position and having the class dominated by a few voices. I would prefer the participation grade to reflect sections instead/alone.",
                "A strength of this course is the breadth of material covered; it was well-planned in that it taught all the major components of international security in a manner that gave sufficient dedication to each. A weakness of the course might be the contextualization in terms of historical events (although it improved throughout the term) in that I think students would have benefitted from diving a bit deeper into case studies of historical examples with which they likely were not familiar prior to the course.",
                "Strengths: ____\r\nWeaknesses: terrible instruction, lectures were reductive and almost offensive, readings were unconvincing and dull, participation was superficial, and assignments were not engaging.\r\nHonestly, I only learned that I do not buy International Relations (and perhaps all social science) as a field of study. The literature we studied and the entire premise of the course is to understand how different factors affect \"the likelihood for conflict,\" but the course only left me feeling that it makes no sense to quantify the effect of such factors as political regime because everything is so contextual in reality.\r\nThe lessons felt so simplistic and reductive, and I was frustrated by the lack of attention to the particularities of individual cases--an inherent flaw of the field of study.\r\nThe assignments didn't encourage me to learn anything either because they explicitly did not require us to research cases, but instead asked that we just cite examples and repeat some of the half-baked ideas we glossed over in class.",
                "Needs to be taught by a different professor",
                "The course's introduction of many parts of security theory was great and the response papers stretched us to understand the papers we read and be able to critique them. The feedback we got (a half page covering each of our arguments) was quite helpful. The midterm/final papers, while we were left to do them without that much support, were an interesting exercise in applying theory to real world, important situations (e.g. a nuclear Iran's effect on world peace). Bringing in McChrystal and De Mistura for us to ask questions of for our final paper was also great.\r\n\r\nDawn's teaching of the course started out questionable (e.g. not releasing slides due to a \"patent lawyer\" telling her about copyright infringement until she got called out on the YDN, fighting for multiple weeks with the microphone, comments towards some students/TAs). That said, Dawn improved over the semester, actively asked for feedback and responded to it (e.g. cutting down our workload from 4 response papers to 3 with the ability to drop one, giving us extensions, creating a group students to give her input, etc.).",
                "I thought that the professor did a good job with incorporating feedback into the class. However, I do think there could have been a variety of improvements. The organization of the professor and the TAs could have been much better. Moreover, receiving clear guidance about how are work was being graded should have been included from the beginning. It was changed as the course went on which I found frustrating. Also, the TAs were absolutely not uniform in their grading. Without ever providing much substance in section, they would take off so many points on assignments and just find random things that were wrong with the paper.",
                "Strengths: discussion section\r\n\r\nWeakness: class felt disorganized/jumbled at times. High workload, lots of reading.",
                "We never seemed to talk about theories that really worked and spent a lot of time on talking about theories that were there but really didnt hold under the evidence",
                "It could have been more real life based. \r\nIt provided a good theoretical foundation for understanding the complexities of the Global Affairs major.",
                "I feel like this class did a good job covering the theoretical principles, but it was somewhat lacking in showing how those theories are actually applied. There was a degree of \"loseness\" in the way we talked about different conceptual understandings -- there didn't seemed to be a fixed idea about what particular concept we were actually talking about. In that way, it seemed to be more about our own a priori understandings of international relations than the textual material we were trying to learn.",
                "The lectures were very interesting and the material was very good but I think there could have been other ways to involve students such as case studies etc. Having conversations with senior fellows was a very interesting way to learn, and I wish we could have done more of that.",
                "Strengths: the professor really cares about the students and has really committed to listening to student feedback \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: material often redundant w/ the readings",
                "I thought this course was structured great and Professor Brancati had a clear dedication to teaching it. The course had four Reflection Papers and a midterm / final paper. They are all a lot of work, so this class is no easy A, but assignments push you to seriously think through the material and evaluate theories we read in class. Professor Brancati is extremely committed to the course too and sent out multiple surveys to understand our perspective on where the course can improve.\r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, the course has a big focus on theory but often left out practical comparisons or background knowledge that could help. We had some guest speakers that helped with this weakness, but otherwise, be ready to do a lot of Wikipedia searching if you dont already know about past conflicts in Kosovo, Turkey, etc. I also wish we focused more on international conflicts in South America or Africa. We briefly touched on some issues in South Africa, but mainly focused on the Middle East.",
                "More interactive elements during lectures such as break-out groups",
                "Strengths: Interesting course content, clear feedback on assignments, professor responsive to feedback",
                "Strengths - Lots of exposure to interesting practitioners and IR literature  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Class is all over the place and lacks substance; you learn more about how to write concisely then the topics covered in class",
                "There are several weaknesses to this course, mostly pertaining to its format. This year Prof. Brancati noted how she made a shift in the course from having a historical approach to having a social science approach. However, this approach assumes that students have adequate background knowledge both of historical and current events that reflect themes in the course. As a result, it seemed that the structure of the course favored students who had the most background knowledge. \r\nAnother weakness of this course is the paper format. The \"reflection papers\" were formatted in a way that asked students to find fault in the author's logic, again, using counterexamples pulled out of their own pocket. The format of these papers is unlike any other paper I have written in a Yale course. Every time I wrote a reflection paper I felt that I was grasping at straws about what my critique was actually supposed to be. I didn't feel like the reflection papers actually taught me anything about critically analyzing scholarly literature. \r\nOne strength of this course is that Prof. Brancati brought in senior lecturers from Jackson as a component of the final paper process, which I found to be very interesting.",
                "Strengths: highly organized, well facilitated for learning and the readings were not overwhelming\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: assignments and due dates shifted around a little bit and I like what we ended up with but nevertheless I wish we would have started with that."

                "no. terrible class, only take for major",
                "This was probably the most mentally tormenting course I've taken at Yale. It is a global requirement, but the first time being taught by a new professor and so much of it felt off. The content is valuable and I think presented pretty well, but expectations for assignments were consistently unclear and left the majority of students very frustrated throughout the semester. It didn't feel like you could properly understand what was needed to succeed, and it felt incredibly theoretical and that we were being graded on a graduate level vs undergrad level. Conversations with the professor and TF about the issues were often unhelpful and was often made to feel my concerns were not valid when I knew that the majority of the class felt the same way. So no I would not recommend it, unfortunately it is a requirement, so hopefully the course will change. I also think the concept of a security class should not be forced on those in the major for development and vice versa.",
                "No, unless you are a Global major. It's quite well-organized, the material is interesting overall and the guest speaker discussions were enjoyable. However, I wish the readings (+ the content generally) were a bit more connected to current events. The grading is also confusing and quite discouraging, since there seem to be very specific requirements for what the professor considers an \"A-level\" essay, and many of these requirements were never mentioned in the syllabus. I found myself trying to conform to what I imagined would be a \"good essay\" in this class rather than actually engaging with the material. +\r\nThe slides don't contain much content, which makes it more difficult for people who are primarily visual learners / those trying to make up a missed class or review.",
                "If you're a global major, you obviously have to take this course. I wish the department would restructure its requirements. I got so much more out of a different global lecture this semester which was not required and was only taken by a handful of other kids in my global cohort. I don't feel that I got much out of this class except maybe the ability to read academic papers more efficiently.",
                "If you are a Global major, you have to take this class and I think it is important to gain foundational knowledge.  If you are not a Global major, you would probably be better off taking a seminar that hones in on something that interests you",
                "sadly, this is a rec - change the prof and you have a good course!",
                "If you're a global major, you don't have a choice. Otherwise, do not take this class. Other global/poli sci classes will serve you much better.",
                "Its required sadly",
                "If you're GLBL you have to take it. :(",
                "No. But the class does provide a good bonding experience through collective suffering.",
                "Only if you have to take the class. There might be a more engaging electives out there.",
                "No. I had been looking forward to taking this course for a while and was disappointed by it. I ended the semester with a much less positive impression of international security (and of the global affairs major) than when I had started. The syllabus jumped around between different topics without covering certain key theories (realism/liberalism/constructivism, causes of war, deterrence, etc). Lectures centered around detailed accounts of academic/theoretical debates -- these were hard for me to absorb, and at times the course felt overly focused on academic argumentation for the sake of argumentation. I left the class feeling that I had learned little and still needed to study core ideas and thinkers in the field of international security on my own. The class was poorly designed as an introductory survey -- topics rarely built on each other or fit together into one cohesive course of study. Assignments and expectations were not explained well, and the feedback/grading was arbitrary and unhelpful.",
                "Not unless you need it for the major",
                "Yes if majoring in Global Affairs as it is required. Otherwise, no.",
                "Yes, even though it's a GLBL requirement, the material is interesting and fairly broad.",
                "This course is excellent for students looking to take a step back and examine conflict through a broad lens of theory. It is less of a fit for those who want to understand the causes and intricacies of specific past conflicts. Global majors who are required to take this course will come away with a lot of new conceptual knowledge to use as they dive into more area/region specific global classes. I do believe that this class is what you make of it - you could get by without doing much work, or you could put in more effort and get a tremendous amount out of it. If you were to do all the readings in full every single week, this course would a very high workload.",
                "Global students will be required to take it anyways, but I would recommend it for anyone interested in a top-down, high level review of international security.",
                "No, the department really needs to improve the course before it can require all students to take it.",
                "You have to take it for the major so whether I recommend it or not won't make a difference",
                "If you're taking this class, it's probably because you're a global major so my recommendation doesn't really matter. That said, despite the shortcomings of the class especially at the beginning, I found the class a good overview of theories on security. The midterm/final papers, wherein we applied the theory to modern issues were interesting, though difficult. The workload (especially for readings, which are long and dense) is high, however. If you're not interested in security, as many are not, it is likely that the lectures will not resonate with you nor will the class.",
                "No. It is required for the Global Major so you have to take it. I do think though they need to overhaul the entire course.",
                "Only for GLBL majors as its required.",
                "Its required, but not really",
                "If youre not a global student required to take it, dont take it.",
                "Yes, if you need to take it for the major.",
                "Yes. I thought it as very good, and while there were some problems, it will get better each year.",
                "It is a global requirement",
                "Yes, if you are interested in international relations",
                "Yes: Interesting course content and manageable workload",
                "Not unless you need to take it for the global affairs major.",
                "This course is a major requirement so yes. However, it is likely not going to be very enjoyable. It is a \"keep your head down\" course.",
                "In the way that this current course is being taught, I wouldn't recommend it to another student. That being said, it is a major requirement.",
                "Yes! It is a requirement for Global Affairs but the subject material is relevant to everyone."
