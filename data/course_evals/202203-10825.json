                "Strengths: Pablo is a great teacher who explained concepts extremely well.  Furthermore, the small class sizes allowed us to do practice problems in class, which was very engaging and helped facilitate learning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the required textbook readings, required videos, and then class lectures covered a lot of the same materials, and it got a repetetive.  I found that skipping the required videos saved time without detracting from my knowledge, and I guess this weakness doesn't matter since no one checks whether you've done the readings/videos.",
                "Weakness: There is not enough of an effort made to teach students how to have an intuition for the theorems.\r\nStrength: Strong support framework",
                "The subject matter was organized in a logical fashion (i.e subsequent lessons built upon previous ones). The small class size facilitates students working together and asking questions more actively. The additional resources given, including the peer tutor office hours and Ximera, are pretty helpful at guiding people towards the right process and answers (the pre-class quizzes didn't offer much value, since they could be completed without watching the video and vice versa). However, the overall course was organized in a way that showed a considerable lack of consideration for students' schedules: whereas other courses would not have a pset due on the week of a midterm/final so that students can focus on preparing, this class would assign an additional pset with an earlier due date. The workload and pace of the course is not impossible to keep up with (and the material itself is not too difficult, if perhaps initially confusing) but does cause more stress than is necessary. The quality of feedback is inconsistent: at times, TAs would indicate that there was a certain type of mistake, but stop short of specifying how it should be corrected.",
                "I dont think there's much more to improve - it's already a clearly organized and set course.",
                "I wish we were explained concepts for in depth within this class",
                "The review sessions at the beginning were hosted on Wednesday and Thursday( most people can't  make it because the assignment is due on Thursday so people are at OH)",
                "I enjoy the idea of having both the lectures and the videos but sometimes I found it extremely cumbersome, especially during busy weeks. Prof. Boixeda Alvarez did a good job of making sure to teach as if students had not watched the videos at the beginning to ensure every student was on the same page. The small class size was also a big strength. One weakness I would say is that the instructors dont release information in advance for exam review sessions",
                "I like how we are introduced to concepts remotely first and then go over them in-person. This reinforcement of knowledge makes concepts easier to remember.",
                "Strengths was it was very organized but cons was it moved very fast, leaving students behind.",
                "I thought the course was very well taught. My professor (Prof. Alvarez) did a very good job at explaining things and answering questions from students about ideas that were less intuitive. He also allowed plenty of time to work practice problems and assisted students during class. I didnt think there were any weaknesses.",
                "I think the course was fine as is.",
                "Lots of available office hours for doing homework and asking questions. Weakness is mainly how some of the homework was more focused on computational skills that arent really assessed on the exams instead of main concepts",
                "I think that the strengths of this course are that it is very well organized, and there were always practice exams which were very helpful for studying. I do not have any suggestions as my experience was fantastic in this class.",

Maybe I was just bad at taking exams ( but exam grades were never representative  of how much work I had to put into this class, which left me always frustrated and stressed).",

Youll have to put in a bit of work, sure, but the class isnt impossible and as long as you go to office hours youll be able to get this course done with an A or A- easily. I would only recommend this course if its necessary for the major, though.",
