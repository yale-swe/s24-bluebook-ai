                "Strengths: Our class was very small and close-knit (about seven people), so we all had plenty of time in the two-hour seminar to ask questions and share our insights. The readings are also a strength--thought-provoking and intellectually challenging pieces. Weaknesses: The professor often posted readings 1 day before class, not giving us much time to prepare. He also cold-calls students.",
                "The strength of this course was the readings. They were all incredibly engaging and they offered insights that I now see in my own life. I don't recall there being any weaknesses.",

For example, we got feedback on our first two papers pretty late in the semester and the readings were posted a day or two before class but he is really cool and this class was edifying nonetheless."

Not a ton of diversity in terms of types of readings (almost all of them were published in the late 90s and early 00s in a prestigious U.S. publication) but they are pretty fascinating, albeit long.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in journalism or who's interested in learning how to write to inform an audience. Surowiecki offers great feedback, and the readings are fantastic models.",
                "Yes, great course. The majority of people in the class weren't English majors, so definitely apply to this class even if you are a little nervous about it."
