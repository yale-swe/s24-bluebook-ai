    "Basic biological principles and their social implications",
    "This is a great class for non-majors and a good fifth class. I learned a lot about infectious diseases, the environment and the climate crisis, and the human brain. I thought the course was genuinely interesting and would recommend it to anyone looking to fulfill a science credit, or to those who may enjoy hard science but are not able to study it extensively at Yale.",
    "I learned a great deal about modern science and problems facing our world. I especially learned how to delve into the scientific literature.",
    "Learned about important and current biological and scientific processes and issues.",
    "I learned about the scientific issues that affect society...AIDS, genetic testing, the opioid crisis. I liked that what I was learning felt immediately relevant to the world around me.",
    "I have a better understanding of the mainstream science issues in today's world. Having this understanding will help me have a more well rounded knowledge.",
    "Learned about some interesting topics in science (gene editing, climate change, malaria).",
    "I learned fundamental biological knowledge and its relationship to social issues.",
    "I learned plenty of new information in this course and the lectures were engaging enough to allow me to actually understand the applications of all of the knowledge, rather than just having too much information thrown at me. Partaking in the Discover Science section also exposed me to so many new experiences as a non-science major, and I feel so much more knowledgable overall after participating in this class and that section.",
    "I learned a lot about biology in relation to humans and our activity. We covered topics such as climate change, disease, agriculture, and genetics.",
    "I learned about Biology and Neurochemistry",
    "learning about biology on a scientific & sociopolitical level. engaged with the material really well. thinking about ethical & societal implications about technological advancements in biology.",
    "Basic skills in connecting scientific principles and broader social issues. Some skills gained in writing about science.",
    "I learned about a broad set of topics in biology, from diseases to plants to the brain, from a biological focus as well as a sociological\/political\/more qualitative point of view.",
    "I learned a lot about things that are very prevalent in our world, in a way that is super applicable to my future. I was hesitant to take this class because it feels like a waste of my time to take a Sc credit because I have taken science in high school but this class actually focused on real social issues and not just the basics of biology without any context.",
    "I learned a lot about particular aspects of science and how they interact with social sciences! I also learned how to think scientifically a little better.",
    "An understanding of basic biology.",
    "Learn a lot about plants, diseases, and overall understanding of some of the scientific issues affecting the world",
    "This class is basically a survey on 3 branches of biology taught by 3 different professors. I learned fun facts more than anything! I think it was still a good class just did not leave with anything too different than another Yale survey class.",
    "To be completely honest I cannot recall much of the hard science lectures because I was just focused on quick memorization for the exams and I was not truly retaining much of the information. In regards to the unit on environmental issues this stuck with me more because of its relevance to local, national, and global politics.",
    "I got a good overview of relevant topics in biology and learned a lot of new things about disease and climate change.",
    "I learned a lot about basic biology in various fields: diseases, plants and climate change as well as the human brain, mental health disorders and the impact of drugs. The course is well done as it partners this with social aspects and policy changes that have already been implemented and that should be implemented.",

    "basic knowledge of some biology concepts",
    "It was an amazing overview of current issues related to biology, both from the social and scientific side.",
    "I learned to look at the world around me in a different way and to question things I previously assumed correct or right.",
    "Several cases where biology relates to politics and ethics",
    "Survey information about infectious diseases, plants (reproduction, GMOs, heredity), and brain functioning. In general, we learned the scientific basis of a lot of big, hot topic issues.",
    "I learned the fundamental principles of biology and how to apply them to social issues in the real world.",
    "I learned about the biological basis for a bunch of hot-topic social issues (the opioid epidemic, climate change, vaccines, etc.) The science itself was fairly general (pretty much a recap of AP Bio) but it was nice to engage with lots of different subjects.",
    "I learned a broad survey of topics in biology accompanied by discussions of recent issues, such as gene editing, the climate crisis, and the opioid epidemic.",
    "basics of genetics, drug addictions, environmental collapse.",
    "that science is lowkey hard",
    "Brushed up on AP bio material, became more comfortable reading scientific papers, enjoyed the class!",
    "I learned science.",
    "I think i gained a greater awareness about the seriousness of the climate crisis",
    "The only thing I learned from this class is how to regurgitate useless information (not even biology-related sometimes) from a slideshow for the exams, and not even the main themes of the slideshow. Tiny font from graphics on the slideshow. I learned zero skills from this class and the only insight I gained was that I made a serious mistake by taking this class.",
    "We learned about genetics, plants, climate change, renewable energy, mutations, the brain and various diseases, and their relevance to current events and society.",
    "The three parts of this course taught me about the body, climate change and agricultural biotechnology, and the brain. I gained a basic understanding of each of these areas and it strengthened knowledge I already had acquired from AP Bio.",
    "I got a lot of general information about biology, which was what was advertised",
    "I gained a much deeper appreciation for biology and the way it effects our world.",
    "learned a great deal about bio",

    "This course helped me in my note taking abilities and in understanding how\/ what to study. I also learned some foundations of biology.",
    "The most beneficial aspect of the course for me was learning about biological issues that we face today. A broad variety of topics made each lecture new and interesting.",
    "Learned a little bit more about biology as a whole. learned how to apply knowledge learned to real life situations through the discussions in section.",

    "I like bio now",
    "Relevant bio info",
    "The course is divided into 3 sections, each taught by a different professor. It starts off with a few weeks on infectious agents, then we transition into talking about plants and genetics, and finally we close out with a few weeks on the brain and mental disorders. Several themes also crossed the boundaries, such as climate emergency, which applies to the first two main topics we discussed. We also talked about how these different topics were relevant to a greater societal and political context!",

   "comments": [
    "The structure is pretty solid as it is, I felt like the class was what it said it was.",
    "The course was great and I have nothing bad to say about it. All three professors are fantastic, the material is interesting, and the course is just fun.",
    "The exams were inconsistent with lecture material. Trying to prepare for them was like shooting in the dark. I had entire lecture slides memorized word for word, but when it came to the exam there were questions that were obscure and even though I had spent hours on end preparing, and had fully comprehended lecture material the exams were incongruent with the big and main ideas that had been discussed in lecture.\r\n\r\nGrading of the exams was also inconsistent.",
    "This is the only science class I've ever taken that I actually somewhat enjoyed.",
    "The exams did not reflect the focus of the section topics or what we spent the majority of the lectures on. \r\n\r\nSection was my favorite aspect of this class. It was interesting to discuss social issues with peers.",
    "The last module was too short maybe? We finished before we'd even started",
    "Strengths are the minimal work outside of class, professors are quite good, and material is interesting. A weakness is the exams which are just unnecessarily specific and stressful.",
    "Strengths: The professors are great, and their lectures are engaging. The material is also very straightforward. \r\nWeaknesses: None.",
    "Lectures are engaging and the material is well spread out. The discover science section was great. The exams required understanding of the material and encouraged learning but did not try to trick you and make your life difficult. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "Strengths were great lectures given by 3 different professors in their respective areas of study. It was cool to have a different prof 3 times in a semester, especially when they were passionate about their topics.\r\nWeakness: we didn't really have a clear idea of how the final grades would turn out because of how the class is curved. It was never clear how much it would be curved or how the reflections from our sections factored in.",
    "Well designed for non-stem majors!",
    "strengths: sections were helpful\r\nweaknesses: some review session unhelpful",
    "This course is fairly easy if you attend lecture, skim the readings, and actually study. Depending on the kind of student you are, this could be the course's greatest strength or the greatest weakness.",
    "The strengths are mostly the entire class -- the professors are amazing and super invested in the learning of the students, as well as super accessible for conversation and really want to get to know the students, despite the fact that this is one of the most popular lecture courses for students of all majors. The material is taught in a super accessible way, and the broad range of information is super interesting to learn and important for all to know!",
    "I believe the biggest strength of this course is the professors. They were very invested in the course and obviously cared about their work and genuinely wanted to be teaching us, instead of just teaching as a side job of their research. I really loved all three professors. I believed that it would be better to prepare students much better for the exams with more practice questions. Also, I enjoyed section but did not really see the point of it.",
    "Section was a weakness...it should have been for review\/extensions of concepts from lecture. Instead, it felt disjointed and separate.",
    "The strength was the professors and their fun and interesting lectures. I often laughed frequently through them and still learned a lot along the way. A real weakness was the sections which in my view were a complete waste of time for everyone in them, at least in mine.",
    "The course is great as it is.",
    "Strengths - great TAs, fun sections, engaging lectures\r\nWeaknesses - exams difficult in the sense you really need to memorize the slides to remember some nitty gritty details",
    "Strengths: Ronit is great! Take the experience science section if you want to be a little more engaged. The professors were also fairly funny and brought enough jokes to keep me entertained.",
    "This class is supposed to accommodate non science majors so test question should really focus more on the connections we draw between biological processes and social, political and economic issues. Sometimes the test questions were so science specific that I didn't feel I was learning anything that would be relevant to my major or any of my future academic endeavors.",
    "The course is very well structured and the expectations are straightforward, which is great.",
    "Strengths - The Experiential Section is great!! Lots of fun and made section every week so much more engaging\r\nWeaknesses - It can be hard to understand what to study for and which aspects of the lectures to concentrate on, especially for the first test",
    "The greatest strength was professor Gendron who was a joy to learn from. The rest of the course was mostly weak. The pointless section (which literally did not correlate with the course material or the exams) was definitely a low-point.",
    "I liked the Class however the exams were way harder than the lectures would have made them out to be.",
    "Strengths: The lectures were interesting for the most part, and I appreciate the real-world application. Nothing is too jargon-heavy, and I believe most non-STEM people would be able to manage this course.\r\nWeaknesses: The exams were unnecessarily hard in that many of the questions were hyperspecific. There will be a curve, though, but the fundamental problem is that we have received ZERO grades even at this point in the semester, so it's very hard to gauge where we all stand in the class. Sections were also hit-or-miss, depending on your TA. Sometimes sections felt supplementary, and therefore unnecessary.",
    "the material was really interesting and I enjoyed the professors, but the exam were much harder than they should of been",
    "Be more clear about what will be on exam.",
    "I think that it wouldve been cool if the class went over more about future biotech. I thought that going over the pandemics and epidemics was interesting.",
    "All three professors do an amazing job of presenting relevant topics in science to non-science majors. They explain the scientific facts behind each topic and relate it to ethical and social issues of our time. \r\n\r\nSection is mandatory yet not very relevant in the context of the class.",
    "Professors are incredible, they make you wish you loved science as much as they did. Julie Cheung also an excellent TA. \r\n\r\nToo much rote memorization of 9th grade bio-y facts, should have been more social\/econ\/politically oriented\r\n\r\nVery good science gut\r\n\r\ngendron is amazing but the plants section is definitely the most boring",
    "I think the topics for the course were chosen well, and the workload was definitely not too much. I definitely was interested in the topics of most lectures and gained a strong understanding of these issues. However, I do think we could be better prepared for the tests, at least the first one. While we learn about scientific and social issues, the tests are very science-heavy, and a lot of people didn't know this going in, so I think that needs to be made more clear.",
    "I thought it was well run, maybe exam review sheets a bit earlier, but other than that it was a well structured and engaging course. However, the sections are unnecessary and did not contribute anything to the course.",
    "The strengths of this course were that it was very interesting to learn. The material of the lectures made me want to go to every class. What can be improved are the sections. I feel like when comparing different sections to each other, some had far more reading than others.",
    "The course content was engaging and the lectures were somewhat lively. However, the exams were often quite specific and the sections did not correlate with the lectures.",
    "I was in the experience section which was a major strength of the course. It felt like a very special opportunity, and its something that most large science lectures dont offer.",
    "tests were too arcane\r\nProfessors were engaging",
    "I couldn't think of any weaknesses. If you're not a science major, and feel rusty on your biology, this class is a must. I feel like it's a highlight of my experience at Yale. Loved the Experience Science section!",
    "Strengths: all 3 professors, and the experience section",
    "Strengths: Professors. All three professors were well prepared and passionate about what they taught. I want to especially commend Professor Carlson on just how passionate he was. Structure. The class was clearly structured and easy to navigate.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Section. Section felt a bit forced and less than useful at times. Perhaps expand the \"experience science\" section, since I will admit I was a bit jealous of them.",
    "I would like it if the discussion sections and readings coincided with the week's lecture a bit more, as it would be nice to talk about the lecture readings \/ feel as if the lecture readings were necessary to the course. I think the course material was very accessible to non-STEM majors and sparked some interesting discussions, but the tests were very much regurgitation and could be difficult to do well on.",
    "Strengths - well-organized lectures, good variety of subject material, good variety of assignments, equal engagement with biological and social sides of the issues\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - maybe too much time spent recapping basic bio things (what is a protein, what is DNA, etc.)",
    "It was an interesting survey of different relevant topics in biology, good for someone who isnt that into STEM. Great professors.\r\nIt sounded like the teaching styles and expectations of TAs were hugely varied, though, with some asking for more work each week than others.\r\nIt would be helpful to have more guidance on studying for the midterms. Tons of people failed the first one just because we didnt know what to expect (it was surprisingly specific).",
    "The professors were amazing. The section was essentially useless.",
    "review sessions were not great",
    "The class is very easy to understand and follow, though exams proved oddly specific with respect to class material. Section performance seemed to vary greatly by TF - a more universal curriculum might have helped.",
    "It is very easy to not go to lecture.",
    "i think the variability of discussion sections could be improved. i enjoyed the depth of the topics we learned.",
    "Strengths: literally none. Maybe a strength could be that you didn't need to attend lectures to do well on the exams if you just studied slideshows. Plus there wasn't homework on a weekly basis. But these strengths are not nearly worth the pain and absolute boringness of this class. Weaknesses: too many to list. Exams that didn't align with taught material, sections that were a HUGE waste of time because they didn't even help you learn the material that would be tested - the TFs would choose a 'current topic' in science to discuss during weekly sections, which yields literally no productive discussion because again, none of us knows anything about biology - and an overall workload that was WAY too much for what you'd gain from the course. Aka, you have three exams, a final paper, weekly mandatory sections, and two reflection papers. For a class that teaches you nothing useful.\r\n\r\nI would improve this course by 1. making the mandatory sections actually related to the course content 2. making better exams 3. better lecturers...",
    "All of the professors were good lecturers and classes for the most part were enjoyable and fairly engaging. On the other hand, I often questioned the point of section since we wouldn't do much and we were not learning anything new. Also, the tests required a lot of memorization and they were very nit-picky with answers - you had to remember really specific points to get credit.",
    "The professors by far are the strength of this course. I looked forward to going to class every day because Professors Carlson, Gendron, and Koleske were such amazing teachers and made learning so enjoyable! However, because these professors are professional scientists, they sometimes explained concepts a little too quickly but luckily all of the lecture slides and notes were online so it was easy to reread their notes and understand what they'd meant.",
    "I think the course was good for what it was, if people are expecting an in-depth look at biology, they should take an actual bio class. This was great for non-science majors.",
    "Strong engaging lectures and preparation for the exams. Would have liked more structure for the paper.",
    "Good overview of a lot of major concepts.  I kind of feel like we were talked down to leading up to some concepts but I suppose thus is the way of STEM courses for non-STEM majors... I do wish we had gone more into issues of bioethics in class but this was also a topic of many of the discussions in section.  Overall I think the combo of lecture, section, tests, two small reflections, and one small paper is a good model to facilitate learning without being overwhelming. I wish there were some sort of feedback on the reflections\/paper.",
    "low work load hard tests",
    "Good lectures by good professors and diverse material are this courses strengths",
    "Strengths are the subject areas and the Professors. To improve the course, I'd make the exam grading more structured and let students see updated grades on Canvas.",
    "The exam questions seem to not match what was emphasized in lecture. The workload is manageable.",
    "Strengths were a good compilation of biology as a whole, good engaging professors who were passionate about their topics. Weakness was preparation for the first test.",
    "The current systems of power were never directly challenged when it came to discussing the problems of disease, medication, climate change, and such.",
    "Lectures and sections are engaging and the workload is not heavy at all.",
    "I liked the different teachers",
    "A strength is that the teachers were engaged and cared a lot about what they were teaching. A weakness is that the reflection papers for section were unnecessary and busy work.",
    "This course is PHENOMENAL!!! As a CS\/non-biology major, I honestly really enjoyed it! Also, as a senior, I think this is definitely one of the top 3 classes I've taken at Yale. The three professors are all so amazing--they are great lecturers and really know how to keep you engaged for 50 mins, 2 times a week. The level of biology we learned was perfect--not too specific, but also not too surface level (so be prepared to memorize cycles and processes!). A lot of the things we talked about also had a real-life application\/sense of urgency that I definitely shared with my friends after lecture because I just found it so pertinent and interesting to know. I am so happy I took this as one of my science credits--so worth the wait for this class!",
    "I loved this course! Only recommendation for improvement is having the disease unit have a more organized structure.",
    "Good communication, information limited to what is important and in grasp",
    "Designed for non-science concentrated students, strengths are definitely found in the teaching faculty. Every professor was excited to engage with any and all students wanting to learn more. They created a very welcoming space for anyone doubtful of their prior knowledge of science. They are great lecturers and all the slides are in consistent formatting from prof to prof.",
    "Sections should either not be required or they should directly interact with course material. It would have benefited us more to discuss the lecture and our questions than a topic not related to the course. The discussion sections were honestly a waste of time.",
    "I took the more engaged section, and I thoroughly enjoyed all the projects and discussions we had!",
    "The lectures were very engaging and readings were interesting"

    "Yes, if you're a non-stem major looking for an okay science credit",
    "Absolutely. It's a great way to be informed about modern scientific issues and just a nice class to have in order to achieve a diverse schedule.",
    "No, the exams made it such that it was demoralizing, because they did not correspond to lecture, even though students spend hours preparing, we felt unable to demonstrate properly our knowledge and comprehension because of the nature of the exam.",
    "If you still need your science credit, this is a painless one to take.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. The teaching fellows were interesting and fun. I think everyone should be more aware of the social\/science related issues going on right now.",
    "Yeah. Genuinely engaging for those that don't typically gravitate towards science",
    "Yes for a interesting SC credit. Basically no work outside of class. Exams are pure memorization so take time but aren't hard.",
    "I would totally recommend this course to anyone who wants a relatively easy science credit. There is very little work outside of studying for tests and doing the final paper. The material is like AP Bio, but easier and connected more to social issues.",
    "Absolutely, as a non-science major, this is the perfect science class. You learn about tons of science information you wouldn't otherwise be exposed to, but in the sense of real world problems that we can all understand. Tests will challenge you, but if you put in the proper amount of work, they will be easy.",
    "Yes, especially if you need a science credit and want the class to be fun and engaging. You do have to study for the exams, but overall the workload isn't bad.",
    "If you need a science gut this is the course for you. The only thing to be aware of is that the midterms can absolutely delete you if you don't put in the necessary time studying.",
    "yes! i feel like i learned a lot, but be warned it may be a lot of ppl who don't have a science background.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interesting in having a basic scientific background in important social issues like climate change, mental health, and food security.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE. The professors are incredibly, incredibly amazing  they're all so kind, clearly passionate about what they do AND teaching, and have so much knowledge and passion to share. They are so accessible and explain the course concepts in incredibly salient, easy to follow ways. Each lecture talks about something new, keeping it constantly interesting. Just an amazing course for anyone who needs a science credit. The fact that this course is geared toward people who have limited exposure to the sciences gives an incredibly clear sign that these professors want you to learn and know these things for the sake of learning, and they know how to keep it interesting!",
    "Yes! It is an amazing Sc credit for non-STEM majors. It is very engaging and the professors are extremely funny and engaged.",
    "Relatively painless science credit! Especially if you don't mind memorization. I learned a lot of interesting information about science in current events.",
    "Yes! For those looking for an easy science class it's interesting, valuable and fun. And the very low workload is great, even though the section is annoying.",
    "Yes, for students in need of a science credit but are non-science majors.",
    "YES! Great gut science that actual makes you aware of some issues. Sometimes it is a little boring (like who doesn't know that) but overall much more engaging than other courses at Yale.",
    "Yes, if you need a science credit. That being said, you do need to go to class and take notes and study for the exam. Cant really BS the questions on the tests.",
    "If you have a strong high school science background this class will be a breeze. If not be prepared to study more than you thought.",
    "Yes, especially a student looking for a science credit! The level of science in this course is definitely manageable as someone who never got to take AP science courses in high school.",
    "Yes, if you need a science credit and are a humanities\/ social sciences major.",
    "Not really - this course is poorly designed.",
    "Yes, it was an interesting science",
    "Yes. But prepare to not know where you stand in the class.",
    "yes but the exams are really hard and ambiguous, even if you study you're likely not to know things on the test because it just specific stuff",
    "I think students who are interested in science and dont want a ton of crazy hard things to remember, this is your class.",
    "Yes. Great science class for non-science majors that will actually prove helpful in life. Teaches relevant and interesting topics that everyone should know about.",
    "excellent science gut, very memorization heavy",
    "I would recommend this course to another student looking to fulfill a science credit. I think it's a good way to learn about important topics in science and how they might relate to other fields of study, without a super overwhelming workload.",
    "Yes, especially if they don't specialize in STEM.",
    "Yes. Any student looking for a science credit who does not know if they are truly interested in science should take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student seeking to fulfill the science requirement.",
    "such a great class if youre looking for an interesting science credit!! learned a lot and workload is extremely manageable",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! This was a great science class for non-science majors.",
    "There are better science classes to take",
    "Yes, great science credit for non science major. Also take the Explore science section!",
    "If you are a student at Yale College, this is probably one of the best classes to take as your Sc credit.",
    "Yes if you are looking for a gut, though, Im not sure this is it. To do well on the exams, you must attend lecture and really study.",
    "Yes",
    "Sure, I would recommend it. This class is for someone who is decently interested in biology, but may lack some background in the subject. It does a good job teaching you the fundamental science behind a lot of important issues. That said, if you are looking to learned a lot of pure science, this may not be for you (it's more of a blend of science and social issues).",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in social issues that is looking for a science credit.",
    "Yes! Gut but actually interesting. Profs are v wholesome.",
    "Yes, if you are looking for a course that you can just study the slides for exams and write the reflections\/paper.",
    "Yes! This is a science course that does a good job of owning its humanities focus and just aims to give you enough understanding of biology to enrich your knowledge of social issues. They're teaching with intention, instead of just throwing around a bunch of concepts for the sake of teaching English majors basic science.",
    "Take it for an interesting and not too demanding lecture on current topics in biology and some history of biology. I learned a bit of everything, and some of the topics we learned about come up in conversation all the time and are good to know (the opioid crisis, climate change, gene editing).",
    "yes! You learn so much!",
    "YES! Fun and interesting - you'll look forward to class.",
    "Yes, it was pretty cool.",
    "yes because I think it was both enjoyable and not too stressful",
    "ABSOLUTELY NOT. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. This is easily the worst class I've ever taken at Yale and I walked away from this semester wishing that I had chosen another class to fulfill my Sc requirement. The vast majority of people in this class took it expecting it to be a science gut. IT IS NOT A GUT. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND ENERGY. TAKE SOMETHING THAT YOU ACTUALLY GAIN SOMETHING FROM. Lectures were painfully boring (if you went). The exams were RIDICULOUSLY hard because they didn't even align with what was taught in class! I took this class because the Coursetable reviews from previous years said that you could breeze by in this course  if you'd taken AP Bio in high school. NOT TRUE BECAUSE THE MATERIAL ON EXAMS WASN'T ALWAYS EVEN RELATED TO BIOLOGY. Just useless small details and facts. On top of this all, the lecturers are NOT good at conveying the main themes of material. The exams were ALWAYS misgraded. You gain NOTHING useful from this class. And you have three exams, a final paper, mandatory weekly sections, and two reflection papers. Way too much work for a class that gives you nothing in return. Take a class with a more generous curve, too. There are so many science guts you could succeed in AND learn something interesting from.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to people who need a science credit. There is little work to do outside of class (3 in class midterms and a 6 page paper) and if you've taken AP Bio a lot of the content is already covered. There were some interesting applications of biology to society that I did not know about before. If you're looking for an intellectually challenging science course though, this class is not for you. Also tests required extensive memorization of minute details.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course. I loved learning from the professors and the only assignments were 3 exams, 2 reflections, and 1 paper, none of which took up too much time in my opinion.",
    "Yes, if you're not pursuing a natural science degree.",
    "yes 100% it is genuinely interesting and engaging and i use the knowledge i gained in other classes, great science credit",
    "Absolutely to all non-STEM majors.  Gut city right here and actually quite interesting.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, overall very interesting and excellent approach to bio relate science",
    "I would if you are a non-STEM student looking for an less stressful science credit.",
    "Yes! Great for non-science majors who need a science credit. The material is interesting and all the professors make it very engaging. Topics switch frequently enough that you dont get bored of learning the same things.",
    "I would recommend the course because the amount of information is manageable as well as the workload.",
    "Yes. This is an excellent course for a student that wants to learn a bit about biology but does not want to be a bio major.",
    "Yes I would if you are looking for a class with low workload but an interesting topic with good professors!",
    "Yes, but not entirely. The class doesn't really challenge people to be free-thinkers, especially when it came to policy proposal or calls for alternative ways of living. The exams were a bit difficult, but section and lecture were fairly straightforward. Just be prepared to actually set aside time to study for the exams, which isn't exactly ideal for people just seeking a science credit.",
    "100%, one of the most interesting classes I have taken in my life",
    "Yes because it is very interesting",
    "Yes, it's interesting and relevant",
    "ABSOLUTELY!!! One of the best classes I've taken, especially a SC credit :) The lectures are so interesting and relevant to real-life. It includes really interesting historical backgrounds\/social implications. I think it's important to know about your body and brain, and this course will definitely help with that! ALSO, the professors are so so amazing! Great lecturers and REALLY really care a lot about the students! The course also has a course coordinator, Ronit, who is super organized and awesome too!",
    "I would recommend it because it is a very light workload and the lectures are interesting and engaging.",
    "Yes for any non-STEM majors looking for not just science, but social implications as well.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. An amazing way to get your Science credit and not die of boredom. It was challenging enough to keep me engaged but not impossible.",
    "Yes information is clear, streamlined, useful",
    "yes",
    "Yes, especially a non-science student. The content was engaging and accessible.",
    "Yes, great course. You come out of the class feeling good :)",
    "Yes! This course provides a sampling of the biggest current events related to biology. It places equal emphasis on the biological workings and the social implications. I took AP Biology and AP Psychology in high school and found the biological workings aspect to be easy.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend the \"Experience Science\" section. Instead of sitting in a room every week, as a class you'll get to visit different labs and museums and interview a schizophrenic patient. This section showed me real-world impacts of the current events we discussed during lecture.\r\n\r\nWorkload is low and comes in spurts. Besides the weekly section, the only major commitments are 3 non-cumulative exams and one 6-page final paper on any topic of your choice. Even without attending any lectures, it's certainly feasible to do well on the exams by studying for them starting just 2 days beforehand. That said, the lectures are fantastic and enjoyable. All the profs are experts in their fields and are entertaining.",
    "Yes. The lecture style is very good and the course material is diverse enough that everyone will find something that peaks their interests.",
    "Yes, this was a great course on connecting biology to real-time events.",
    "Yes. If you are a non-science major looking for an easy science credit I would highly recommend this course. The professors are very nice and the workload is light."
