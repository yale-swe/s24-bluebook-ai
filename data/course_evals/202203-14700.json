                "This course teaches you very well how to write basic philosophy essays and how to analyse arguments and honestly I can't recommend it enough if you have any interest in philosophy!",
                "I learnt about philosophical thinking, and I also learnt how to properly present complex ideas to other interested people",
                "This course was a wonderful introduction to the history of philosophy and a great way to start gaining skills in philosophical analysis, discussion, and writing.",
                "I got much better at engaging with philosophical arguments (using the premises & conclusions format) after taking this course.",
                "I learned how to reconstruct philosophical arguments and evaluate them. I also learned how to read philosophical texts and think analytically about them. Also, I learned about many interesting philosophical schools of thought from the western tradition.",
                "This course introduced me to the skills of reconstructing and evaluating philosophical arguments in a way that is fair and comprehensive. Our seminar discussions also stimulated my growth, and there, I was able to think faster about complex ideas--some of my most creative workarounds to philosophical difficulties were the result of in-the-moment thinking during discussions.",
                "This, like most DS philosophy classes, was a very accessible and solid introductory philosophy course. In particular, Professor Winkler provided clear instruction into concepts like how a syllogism works, how reconstructing an argument works, and how to write a philosophical analysis. I found that Professor Winkler's explanations about concepts like freedom of indifference or Aquinas' 5 ways for proving God's existence were simple, straightforward, and easy to understand; in general, I found I grasped difficult philosophical concepts better through Professor Winkler's discussion sections than when the concepts were explained in lecture because of the care Professor Winkler takes in explaining them.",
                "Starting from nothing, I gained immense understanding of a breadth of philosophical doctrines, and depth into quite a few of them. I developed the skill of writing philosophical reconstructions and critiques (and quite enjoyed the process). I quickly began to apply the philosophies we studied to my own life, whether ideas about religion, mortality, or physics."

            "comments": [
                "The course does a fantastic job of moving you through the central philosophical texts of the Western canon, but it could do better at connecting the different schools of thought and helping the students compare and contrast them.",
                "Strengths: the syllabus is very ecumenical and you get a great broad overview of the main schools of thought; Weaknesses: it feels rushed at some points",
                "I think we go through too many texts at a time, but the discussions around it are extremely fun",
                "Strengths: incredible professor, engaging readings and thought-provoking discussions.\r\nI cannot think of any weaknesses other than that it only lasted for one semester!",
                "I think some of the readings were a bit difficult to parse and having a reconstruction of the writer's argument might've been helpful in untangling the text.",
                "Professor Winkler is definitely a strength. He was highly engaging and amazing at explaining philosophical ideas. I always felt like I left class with a much better understanding of the week's reading. He also left extremely detailed comments on papers (over 1 page long) that were very helpful for improving my writing. One weakness was that there is so much material to cover in the reading that often we would not get through all the main points in seminar discussions. However, we definitely had interesting and detailed discussions about the points we did get to.",
                "I appreciate the small seminar layout of the course, and Professor Winkler facilitated discussion such that everyone had a chance to share their thoughts. As with other Directed Studies courses, I think the curriculum could stand to be diversified--I found the Arabic philosophy we read to be quite compelling, and I can't help but to wonder if there were woman philosophers or philosophers outside of the ancient Greek and Christian traditions from the same time period that could similarly enrich our understanding of the Western Canon.",
                "Strengths: DS philosophy in general is a good intro philosophy course, Professor Winkler's teaching and feedback is excellent, robust discussion sections. Weaknesses: although there is an informative handout on how to write a philosophical analysis, how to write philosophy essays in general could have been taught more (although this is likely a DS issue in general). As a student without a background in philosophy, I found myself googling \"how to write a philosophy paper\" and reading a guide from...an unnamed school in Cambridge the night before our third paper was due because I had never been consciously trying to generate my own philosophical ideas before beyond reconstructing and criticizing those of the authors we read. DS does have a philosophy tutor available; however, she was never mentioned again after a brief announcement at the beginning of the semester, so I don't know how many students actually received help from her. The other writing support available are the Poorvu center tutors, but these range from DS-specific residential college tutors to other students and all have varying levels of familiarity with philosophy. Your best bet for help is probably your professor's office hours;  Professor Winkler was wonderful about offering many of these sessions, but general instruction for philosophy papers probably would have still been helpful.",
                "It is generally a very strong course. It teaches well, about interesting subjects, builds upon previous knowledge and within the course builds on each previous text. Its two weaknesses are: lack of diversity in the philosophers (though I'm not sure this is possible to remedy given extant materials from ancient times, and perhaps this is more of a concern in the second half of DS) and the speed of the course. Since we covered so much, if I had an off day I felt like I completely missed a huge chunk of each philosopher; however, it did allow me to gain tons of knowledge quickly."

                "I would definitely recommend this course! I found that learning how to write philosophical essays helped my overall writing in general because I learned how to make my arguments more logical and powerful. The reading is almost always interesting and I often found myself discussing the philosophical ideas outside of class. Also, if you have the opportunity to take the course with Professor Winkler I would take it immediately!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in the Western Canon and wants to build a strong foundation in western philosophical texts.",
                "For a student who is sure that DS is a good fit for them, absolutely, and especially if Professor Winkler is teaching. For a student who is interested in DS but is wary of philosophy, I would still recommend this course because ancient/medieval philosophy (i.e. Plato's Cave, Stoicism vs Epicureanism, arguments on free will) remains very relevant in modern conversations; also, DS philosophy functions as a broad intro to the subject that most humanities/social science-oriented students will benefit from.",
                "Absolutely, and especially if taught by Professor Winkler. I did not expect to enjoy philosophy as much as I did, and have genuinely found a new passion. I love the applicability of these ancient philosophies to modern times, the fascinating thought processes, the new ways I have for critiquing arguments and building my own. Fantastic."
