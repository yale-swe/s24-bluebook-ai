    "I learned a lot about how to do research, refine my ideas and the work that goes into creating a safe and diverse environment.",
    "This was one of my first experiences doing archival research.",
    "In addition to gaining a wealth of knowledge I really value about the social movements involved in coeducation at Yale, I developed a much deeper appreciation of the importance of historyhow we can learn from historical sources, how we can marshal historical evidence in making arguments, etc.through this course.",
    "This class focused on both the Yale transition to coeducation in 1969 and more broadly transitions in history. I thought learning about Yale itself through the archives and readings was interesting, and Wexler worked to incorporate some theory and guest speakers as well. Overall, I felt I understood the topic of coeducation (at least through a feminist and WGSS lens) much better after the course."

   "comments": [
    "The syllabus was a little unclear at times. The course engaged the topic of coeducation from multiple lenses, archives, and media, which made the subject very interesting.",
    "This course was great in theory - great premise for a course and it was exciting to have a chance to use library resources and work with archivists during class. The only problem was that the course was incredibly unstructured, and it made it very difficult to learn. The syllabus changed almost every week, and we would have to wait until Sunday night to receive the assignment (which readings, and whether or not we were expected to write a reading response) for a class that met on Mondays! Really disappointing, as it could have been a great class but the logistical issues made it really difficult to learn.",
    "I thought the classes were very enjoyable and interesting. I liked writing the papers and delving into one subject in a lot of depth. I had the opportunity to do extensive interviews and archival research myself as a result of the one topic but multiple papers structure, which was a big strength. My only suggestion is to incorporate the theory earlier in the course. I ended up adding a lot of it into my final paper itself and discussing some of those ideas in class would have been fun. For example, the Perkins dissertation was my favorite text and I think we could have delved a little deeper into it."

   "comments": [
    "YESSS! Prof Wexler is one of the professors at Yale who actually cares about her students!",
    "Yes, Laura Wexler is a very knowledgeable professor and the course addressed a topic that should continue to be discussed.",
    "I would highly recommend any course taught by Professor Wexler.  She is so invested in students' learning and so passionate about the topics she chooses to teach.  Any of her courses will almost definitely be a transformative experience, as Constructing Coeducation has been for me.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are interested in Yale's history (and that of elite old colleges in general) or you want to learn how to do archival and personal research. I knew a little bit about coeducation prior to the course but I think it definitely broadened my understanding. Wexler is great and very thought provoking during discussions and in her feedback. The only caveat is the class sometimes felt a little disorganized."
