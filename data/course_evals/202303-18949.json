                "This course was a great introduction to the Arabic language. In the course, I learned how to read and write in Arabic script, form basic sentences, introduce myself and hold a simple conversation in Arabic, and about other crucial grammatical foundations of the language.",
                "I developed the beginner level skills in the language Modern Standard Arabic. This includes the ability to have basic conversation and understand some spoken arabic, understand the alphabet and the noises each letter makes, read arabic, write arabic, a large amount of arabic vocabulary, and many of the rules that come with understanding the arabic language. Through this course I also learned some foundational knowledge about the Middle East and its culture, and how each region differs.",
                "The ability to read and understand arabic",
                "I learned about the arabic language, including the letters of the arabic alphabet, vowelling, connecting letters, reading, writing, dictation, speaking, vocabulary, sentence structure, grammar, and the culture of arab countries."

            "comments": [
                "I think there was a bit of disconnect between the professor and the TA which led to lots of confusion around homework and deadlines, but other than that this class was amazing. I went from knowing almost no Arabic to being able to write and feel competent in conversation.",
                "strengths: good pace (the right amount of hard & challenging), professor is super supportive, you learn a ton\r\nweaknesses: unorganized. assigned homeworks on canvas don't match what we're doing in class, no set submission policy for homework, very chaotic. office hours are a total waste of time. and hard to get proper feedback on my homeworks\r\nI wish there was in person class on fridays instead of asynchronous!!!! I barely learn anything from the virtual assignments. Face to face time with elbousty is precious. I also wish there was a much easier way to get feedback on your assignments. I would submit them, but never really knew what I got wrong, so never really improved from that. \r\nOffice hours are super disappointing. Yazan had no idea what we were doing in class so we went over things at completely different paces, often going way over our head. If they were optional, I never would have gone.",
                "This course's strengths include meeting everyday, as it was crucial to my language learning, utilizing not only the book to learn, but also everyday writing that we would encounter in the language, as well as a strong sense of community in the smaller-sized, tight-knit class. At some points, the material went by a bit quick, but regardless I was still able to understand it.",
                "The strengths of this course were many. To start, I felt very informed always about when the next test was and what would be on it, and I always knew what I had to do in order to raise my grade or perform better. The way in which the course was taught was very fun also, and I always felt engaged in class and excited to learn arabic. The one weakness was that the homework often contradicted in the syllabus and what was actually assigned, and often some of the homework assigned would be at a higher level than we had actually progressed to. I think also it would have been helpful to have more opportunities for individual feedback, especially since many of the students did so well and didn't need any so that those who did need the feedback to improve were out of place. Still, there was plenty of opportunities for that.",
                "Strengths: great class overall and the professor is great and engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Too fast paced",
                "This was an amazing introductory Modern Standard Arabic course. The content was very engaging and challenging, but also very fun and enjoyable to learn. The workload was manageable, but also always kept us on our toes and allowed us to learn so much about the arabic langauge in a short period of time. The actual time spent in class was also very engaging, as we'd cover a lot of different exercises and drills in a class period, and also explored different mediums such as reading activities, listening, speaking, and dictation activities, and even watching videos and listening to music of people from different Arabic-speaking countries."

                "100% yes. Elbousty cares about his students, LOVES teaching Arabic, & the fact that he is passionate and energetic makes a huge difference. Office hours were a disappointment, and if you want feedback on your work you should just go to Elbousty directly. This course is very much what you make of it. You can definitely get by with a good grade and put in minimal effort if that's what you care about, but if you genuinely want to learn arabic, you will learn a lot. You can put in many extra hours of your own work & learn a lot more overall.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, especially taught under Professor Elbousty, as it truly helped me learn the basic foundations of Arabic.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone with a modicum of interest in Arabic, or even some interest in learning a new leanguage. I seriously had no idea how I would take to learning such a beautiful and difficult language, but Dr. Elbousty is such an amazing professor and really encourages students to continue with Arabic by making his class very fun, not exceedingly difficult but enough to where you really feel you need to put in work and learn.",
                "Yes I would, just eb prepared for the amount of time and effort spent on the class if you are a non-Arab student",
                "I highly recommend this course!! If you want to learn a rich language with a different alphabet and learn about different cultures, go for it. It can definitely be a challenging language, but it's very rewarding as well."
