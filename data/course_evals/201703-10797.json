    "I learned a lot about Chinese culture through our discussions and the articles that we were assigned to read. I love how Professor Zhou was so knowledgeable on the topics and was able to really direct our conversation.",
    "I learned a lot about formal Chinese and idioms, which is great if you want to learn how to sound and to speak in a \"prettier\" way. The course is entirely based on articles, which is extremely useful for getting used to reading modern Chinese. Zhou Laoshi is an excellent professor and guided conversations on the various topics (homosexuality in China, wealth gap, etc) very well.",
    "Formal vocabulary used in Chinese media and the many facets to societal issues in modern China.",
    "This course allowed me to make huge strides in my reading comprehension. The newspaper articles that we read were informative, relevant, and full of great vocabulary.",
    "A discussion based class where you get to read many articles on the various societal issues that China faces today. Through this class, you definitely become much faster at reading formal Chinese, much better at speaking and more knowledgeable about these issues."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "During the class, many students just listened to the professor talk and then said a few words here and there. I really loved listening to the professor's insights, but it also made it less engaging for the students because they didn't have to necessarily contribute that much. The presentations were kind of dry too because students said the same things during them and the students who weren't presenting didn't pay a lot of attention. I think instead of presentations, we should have more active discussions about China.",
    "Strengths of the course: not too high effort and fairly pleasant, since you learn Chinese without all of the difficult memorization of lower level classes; super interesting; class is structured and organized very well; there is essentially no stress if you just keep up with the readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses of the course: basically none.",
    "The course struck a good balance between teaching about Chinese society and maintaining my Chinese language ability. It includes a lot of reading of Chinese news articles, but the reading are mostly very interesting and engaging, and the Chrome extension introduced by Zhou Laoshi makes them much easier. However, since there was a lot of information to cover in terms of new structures and vocabulary, I found that my language was not improved very much. I think it might have been more beneficial if vocab lists were assigned and a 5 minute written quiz was given at the beginning of class.",
    "This course was fabulous- Zhou Laoshi is flexible and understands the needs of individual students very well. I love the emphasis on speaking and the ability to choose our own vocabulary. We performed a wide range of activities--readings, essay writing, and presentations--that built our Chinese in various ways."

   "comments": [
    "yes if interested in improving chinese speaking... greater focus on practice rather than repetition in learning vocab",
    "Yes! It's a very great class in terms of the amount of knowledge you gain about China and different aspects of its culture. It also deals a lot with the problems that we're facing today in modern China which makes it very relatable.",
    "Take this class if you want to improve your Chinese but also not be too stressed by a huge workload. You will definitely learn a lot, and enjoy it all too.",
    "Good course for maintaining your Chinese. Interesting topics, pretty relaxed classroom environment, and a really good teacher.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who speaks Chinese at near fluency, and is looking to improve their writing skills. I also think it would be helpful to have spent time in China in the past to get the most out of this class.",
    "Yes, it was fun and educational.",
    "This course offers a wide range of activities that help to maintain and improve on your Mandarin while not being an overwhelming workload. Zhou Laoshi is fantastic and felxible, and I only have good things to say about this class.",
    "Probably the best Chinese elective at Yale. Highly recommended!"
