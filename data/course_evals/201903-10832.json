    "Didn't know anything about econ coming in, but learned basic terms and concepts!",

    "As economics was a new course to me, everything I learned was new. Furthermore, I learned a lot about my study habits and time management.",
    "I thought the content taught in this course was relevant and meaningful. Insights gained included quantitative and qualitative analysis on how consumers and firms make decisions based on the environment around them. Found it extremely interesting, glad I took the course.",
    "You are able to learn the basic of microeconomics. Nothing more and nothing less. Its exactly what you expect out of an intro Econ class",
    "I learned how to apply mathematical concepts that I learned in high school to real world situations.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of microeconomics. Concepts covered supply, demand, varied markets, game theory, externalities, etc.",
    "I learned the intricacies of supply and demand, as well as many other interesting topics.",
    "Introduction to mirco econ",
    "Standard topics in microeconomics, including supply and demand, price elasticity, marginal utility, pareto efficiency, Nash equilibria, etc"

   "comments": [
    "It's hard and moves fast. It also doesn't track with the other two seminar teachers' courses, so it's harder to study together, and there's only one midterm which makes grading tough. No review sessions.",
    "The course moves fast and covers lots of material. Sometimes I felt oversaturated by details and theoretical understandings to figure out how to quickly and easy model and solve a problem. I think the course would benefit from more example problems and modeling in class.",
    "The class is interesting, but it is difficult to understand",
    "Strengths: The course was very well structured and Professor Saez Marti was extremely supportive in extending office hours and review sessions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Though I don't believe there were any weaknesses of consequence, in terms of reviewing for exams I think sometimes the slides and materials online were insufficient in providing exam-sufficient descriptions for certain concepts. Perhaps recordings of lectures would be beneficial in the future.",
    "Weakness at times was the being able to understand the content. The professor would sometimes go too fast and the test are usually much harder than her problem sets and her slides. Strength is that you could tell the professor does care about her students and tries to help through lots of office hours opportunities",
    "Very fast on the lectures with very little student interaction.",
    "Strengths were that it made me think about economics in a very mathematical and logical way. Weaknesses were that all of the jumps from the concept to the math which described the concepts were not explained well or explicitly enough.",
    "Strengths: Material was covered thoroughly and quickly, instructor was very knowledgeable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Course moved a bit fast at times"

    "If you want to learn econ! Not just for fun.",
    "Yes, if you need to take a micro class. Maybe considering taking the lecture though.",
    "No, I would recommend taking the lecture instead",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, as I wholeheartedly believe everyone should have a basic understanding of economics.\r\nI think Professor Saez Marti's teaching of Econ 110 is an excellent way to be exposed to economic concepts.",
    "Only if you are willing to put in the extra work. After each lecture, it would probably be smart to both read the textbook and her slides over. The lectures alone are not enough. Also, this class is a little more math related with regards to economics so be prepared for that if you want to take it.",
    "No. Much greater difficulty compared to the larger lecture class.",
    "Yes because it did teach me the fundamentals of microeconomics.",
    "Yes. I dont think this section was bad relative to other sections and the lecture version of this class for fall of 2019.",
    "The professor is nice, but she is hard to follow. It is hard to learn the course material in her class.",
    "Yes, but get a different professor",
    "No, much rather recommend not taking this course unless it is a requirement for the students major",
    "I would recommend if the student has been economics beforehand",
    "Yes, if they want to get a taste of what microeconomics is all about."
