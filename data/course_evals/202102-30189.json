                "Help is very accessible",
                "A strength of this class was its foundational teachings about a wide array of statistical tools. This course covered a lot of material in a relatively short period and left me feeling prepared to move forward with what I learned. Another great strength of the class was the accessibility of the TAs and professor, as the office hours were very frequent and super helpful. One weakness of the course was the speed, though that was a symptom of the timing. I felt that the pace of this class prevented me from developing a deeper understanding of any of the material.",
                "Every lecture is prerecorded, this is fine if you are motivated to actually watch the recordings, it's also super convenient because you can watch them in your own time, get ahead if you want to and it's easy to catch up if you fall behind. If you're not motivated enough to watch them, too bad, but at the same time there are office hours throughout the week more often than not so you can ask questions.",
                "The website was very accessible and helpful. The homework and lectures also prepared me very well for the exams and quizzes.",
                "The strengths is that you have all the classes at your reach, which was also a limitation to go to office hours.",
                "Strengths: great structure of online class -- I could always receive live help from any TA's or the professor while lectures were all asynchronous.",
                "The class was fast moving but fair, there could have been more breaks and reviews such as before each midterm, not just at the half way point. The pace and teacher were certainly the best points, you are always learning a lot.",
                "There were a few times where the homework piled up with quizzes and class work and spreading it out more would be better.  Other than that it was a very good course and I learned a lot.",
                "Disclaimer: I took this course over the summer, 100% online and asynchronous. \r\nStrengths: Office Hours flexibility, TA flexibility, organization, asynchronous\r\nWeaknesses: Asynchronous, fully online, while the professor is engaging in online lectures it is hard to stay focused as you are essentially watching a youtube video about stats.",
                "Very well organized. Personable instructor. clear feedback on homework.",
                "Office hours were very helpful at clarifying concepts and most of the lectures were well paced and easy to follow. However, at times the amount of content covered in lectures during a daily module was a bit much and it was hard to stay focused. Feedback on Gradescope and quizzes were also not as clear as I would have preferred, but otherwise everything went well.",
                "Professor and TA's were great, p-sets were straightforward and consolidated information taught in class",
                "Strengths of this course were that it felt comprehensive and well organized. Since it was all self-paced, it requires personal motivation and diligence.",
                "The strengths of this course were the accessibility of the professor, TAs, and other instructional support and the quality of the lectures. The lectures were moving at a faster pace than I could take notes, which is fine when I can pause the lecture videos but I imagine would be difficult in person. Maybe posting recordings of lectures could be helpful in the future too.",
                "This is a great course. The only weakness is that it moved very fast which led to many problem sets each week. It was a bit hard to keep up but this is to expected in the timeframe. Overall I enjoyed the class and thought everything was well done.",
                "The professor was extremely engaging and the amount of office hours was great. I think the only thing that could be improved is the length of the lectures (some were a little long)",
                "A strength of this course was the level of teacher-student interaction available outside of class hours. A weakness was the sometimes confusing quizzes and homework questions which were not clearly connected to the content covered.",
                "JDRS is a FANTASTIC professor, even with recorded lectures! He was super engaging and explained things in an incredibly clear way, and was very accessible for questions! The course was also very well organized!",
                "I think the format of the course worked really well. Having asynchronous lectures with lots of office hours made it easier for me to fit the class into my schedule but didn't make me feel like I was being left to fend for myself. The only weakness that I noticed is that it was difficult to engage with or work with my classmates since we didn't get a chance to meet each other in a classroom environment.",
                "It was a little difficult to remain engaged with the completely asynchronous lectures but that also gave me flexibility and the office hours were very helpful.",
                "The strengths was definitely the vast amount of office hours available and the overall flexibility the class had in order for students to adjust to their best needs.",
                "Strength: Easy to find all the information and homework - set up well\r\nWeaknesses: No fault of the teacher or anyone just online lectures are tough",
                "The professor was incredible  knowledgeable, passionate, light-hearted. I wish we would've spent more time applying the material to real life social science \/ political science cases but I understand that this is not possible within the summer session time frame.",
                "The course was great and could be improved by a quicker answer response time and better explanation of the assignments from the start of the course.",
                "Great explanations by professor and TA availability",
                "Most important strength is JDRS; no weaknesses",

                "Potentially. I think the course during a regular semester would be great-- the professor is awesome. Also, the material wouldn't be jammed into a 5 week period, making it much more digestible and easier to retain concepts. This said, I wouldn't recommend taking it online during the summer-- it is hard to retain the information when watching an asynchronous lecture every day, and the class is really fast-paced.",

I had not taken a formal introductory course in my academic career, and I was really pleased with the amount I had learned in five weeks. My main piece of advice is to make sure you get help ahead of time and not fall behind.",
                "It is a little dull but provides a good overview of basic statistics. Good if you need it as a prerequisite, probably would not take it for fun.",
                "This course moves very quickly. I would recommend that students take this class during a regular semester.",
                "This class is a pretty ideal QR and a solid intro to stats. It's not outstanding\/incredible\/amazing, but the professor is really nice, the TAs are available, and the material doesn't move to fast. JDRS does talk fast and has some weird quirks that take some getting used to, but I would definitely still recommend this course.",

This class gives you the ability to read those kinds of analyses, which is a super useful skill even if you don't remember some of the specific details from the class.",
