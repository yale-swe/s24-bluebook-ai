                "I chose to make my semester-long project using Logic this semester, so I learned a lot about working in a DAW and using different virtual instruments. I also learned about composing for mezzo-soprano voice, musique concrte, and writing for a piano-violin duo through smaller assignments.",
                "I got practice composing for a variety of configurations -- solo piano, trio, and sound collage! I had wonderful composition lessons with Matiss focusing on form, texure, energy. And I gained a lot from in-person workshops with musicians playing my music and guest lectures.",
                "I improved my composition, learnt valuable production techniques, and got to discover great music presented by award-winning composers and my peers. This is a really fun class and a great way to improve at composition.",
                "I developed my expertise in orchestra writing significantly this year. The course offers great freedom, which allowed me to delve into the sound world of the late Romantic Era."

            "comments": [
                "The biggest strength *and* weakness of this course is that it's incredibly self-directed - you can do pretty much whatever you want with your semester project. You get what you put into the course! Also, free weekly private composition lessons are amazing :)",
                "The expectations for the course are very clear, and the workload is fairly consistent and predictable (with the exception of Portfolio Exercises, which I wish had deadlines that were announced on the syllabus at the beginning of the semester, but that's a minor point). Composition lessons, opportunities to work with the musicians in the Contemporary Music Ensemble class, and guest lectures are awesome. I have no complaints.",
                "Incredibly instructors, fun assignments. I think one improvement could be more support in learning new harmonic or compositional techniques, which can be hard to discover by yourself. A fantastic class and a great community!",
                "Comp seminar as a concept is great! I love that a bunch of composers get to come together and share our work and get inspired by others. And I absolutely loved the lessons -- Jack Frerer is an amazing teacher. There are some aspects of the class that I would change\/improve. I liked the concept of the 10-20-second pieces for the portfolio assignment, but it was frustrating when they weren't read by the chamber music students. I think maybe they were ultimately read, but it was at a time when I had class, so that was a bit frustrating. In general, I think if comp seminar had more of a performance aspect, I would love that. For example, we could collaborate with YUCO and do some sort of end-of-semester concert where they play one piece by everyone. I know this would be hard to coordinate with the semester projects, since everyone is writing for different ensembles, but maybe we could have portfolio projects like \"ok, during these two weeks, everyone is going to write a piano solo piece\/string trio\/wind duo\" etc, and a selection of these smaller pieces could be performed in an end-of-semester concert. I think forcing people to write pieces quickly is not necessarily a bad thing. I took Composing for Musical Theater this semester, and we had to write a new song every week, which helped me improve a lot. AND we had an end-of-semester concert that was a culmination of songs we had written, which was very rewarding and exciting after a semester of hard work. To me, the portfolio projects this semester felt a bit random, and I think if they were more directed and everyone had to write for the same ensemble, and then they were performed, this would be a very useful experience. (Like for example when we did the prepared piano pieces last year, those were cool.) \r\nOne final thing I'll say is pertains to the DAW portfolio projects: I really wish there were more instruction on DAWS before sending us off to write the pieces.  A lot of people are already experienced with DAWs, but I am not really, so it would've been helpful to me to have a basic lesson in a DAW. I think last semester there was an instructional session on sampling, for example, which was really helpful. I just wish there was a little less focus on DAWs, or if there was still focus on them, that we were properly instructed on how to use them."

                "Yes, it's worth taking maybe once or twice to get to know other people's work and it's definitely worth it for the lessons.",
                "I would recommend for sure. We had a lot more creative freedom in comp sem III compared to I and II. We had one long semester project, which in theory could be any kind of composition; we had people do film scoring projects, and choral pieces, and even singer\/songwriter stuff. We also had 2 smaller portfolio pieces which were fun to make. Weekly 1v1 lessons were really helpful and it keeps you in check for your final project. Class is usually just composition presentations which are often very enjoyable."
