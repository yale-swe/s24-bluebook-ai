Sometimes, though, the content could get pendantic and muddled when just talking through spectra on the slide; more direction/signage and basic examples could be helpful instead. The homeworks were sometime very challenging, especially since we had not learned the content/approach directly in class but instead had to learn it on our own; examples in class similar to the homework problems would have helped greatly."
