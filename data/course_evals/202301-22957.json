Much of this course focuses on learning how to write scientific proposals and papers without a ton of guidance, which was intimidating at first but helped me greatly in learning this kind of writing.

            "comments": [
                "One strength of this course is that, being the second semester continuation of SCIE 020, it creates strong relationships between each student, their classmates, and the professor. This is reinforced by one-on-one check-ins with Professor Bailyn and a trip to a museum in New York in the spring. Another benefit of the course is that it included discussion of various facets of scientific research, including social and historical aspects that showcase how science has changed over time. Also, the presentations were nice because they allowed students to hear from their peers about topics they were interested in.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion for improving the course would be to spread the work more evenly between the two semesters. In the fall, the weekly readings, two presentations, and one paper made the workload very manageable. However, during the spring, there were three or four major writing assignments, including a group project and full research proposal, as well as multiple presentations. Additionally, the grading scheme for assignments was somewhat confusing and made it difficult for students to gauge how well they were doing in the course.",
                "The course was great in that it was an intimate setting where there were lots of discussions. Sometimes the topics were not of interest of every student though.",
                "Strengths were that it's paced very nicely and the assignments are all engaging and helpful to cover the goals of the topics. Weakness would be that there were times where it felt as if there wasn't much purpose in the lessons.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bailyn is wonderful! He is so helpful, and he understands everything you are going through as a first year. Having a small year-long seminar is also great because you get to know your classmates really well by the end of the year. Weaknesses: Some of the assignments were vauge (on purpose), so it was at times hard to know where to start with some things. We also went from having to write one response or a couple paragraphs a week in the fall to having a large assignment due each week at the end of the spring, which was a very strong unbalance.",
                "Not enough community building/class conversation",
                "Strengths- Professor Bailyn is great, the workload is manageable, the discussions are fun \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Firstly, this was the first time the class has been taught and I can tell. At times, the assignments seemed random and not very well-thought out. Professor Bailyn is sometimes bad at explaining assignments. This is ultimately a writing class. I wish we spent sometime discussing the structure of scientific papers and articles more rather than just the content."

                "The first half of the semester is super light work; just a paragraph a week and everything is not graded. Be prepared for the second semester though, the course quickly becomes 7 page paper a week. It would be nice if professor could restructure the course to balance",
                "10/10 would recommend, especially if you are in STARS. Not only is this a fantastic course to teach you about scientific research, but if you take SCIE 020/021 (or 010/011 for Bio students), you are guaranteed a spot in the First Year summer fellowship for physical science and engineering research. All you have to do is find a faculty mentor and write a research proposal, and you will be set for your first summer, assuming research is something you want to get into.",
                "I would recommend this course to other STARS students who plan to pursue research, since the background research, communication, and presentation components have direct applications to real world professional scientific research.",
                "Yes, awesome class to meet new students and foster a relationship with the professor.",
                "YES, 100%. Not only do you get guaranteed summer funding for research, but you receive so much useful information on how to do scientific writing and communication to different audiences! There's also sort of a community that builds up over the year of SCIE 020/021.",
                "Yes! anyone interested in research or writing on a scientific level should strongly consider this class as it'll provide a lot of help in that sense.",
                "If you are considering going into research or majoring in a physical/mathematical science, then this course is so helpful! It will help you decide if you actually want to go down that path. I would not recommend this course if you think there is a strong probability that you will NOT become a STEM major though.",
                "Yeah I enjoyed",
                "Yes, definitely! This is the perfect course for you to take if you are on STARS.",
                "Don't take this class if you are only looking for the funding. First of all, you are not a STARS student and your are barred from applying. Instead, you will be part of the First-Year Research summer research fellowship cohort which only gives you 4,300 dollars and has a 70% acceptance rate anyway. You also don't get much guidance on even the proposal for that fellowship and it is still mostly up to you. However, if you are looking for a manageable writing credit, feel free."
