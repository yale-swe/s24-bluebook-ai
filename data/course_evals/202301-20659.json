                "Through taking this class I learned about solving first order quasilinear partial differential equations (PDEs) using the method of characteristics, the three major types of second order PDEs and how to solve them in full space, boundary value problems and the method of separation of variables for Laplace's equation and the multidimensional wave equation, how to solve Burger's equation and its qualitative properties, and general problem solving skills that helped me tackle difficult PDEs problems in the course and in other courses that utilize partial differential equations.",

We also covered many approaches from method of characteristics to separation of variables involving change of coordinates to Fourier tricks. A lot of the second half of the course was focused on Fourier series (finding eigenvalues, eigenvectors, Fourier coefficients) and waves in higher dimensions.",

I feel like I learned a lot about how to solve first- and second-order linear partial differential equations, understand and classify boundary conditions, and visualize and classify different phenomena into the three main types of PDEs: parabolic, elliptic, and hyperbolic; or heat, wave, and laplace."

                "Strength: Very clear clarification from Prof Hiltunen and very nice homework load. The textbook it uses is also well written.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hiltunen is very nice! I really the discussion atmosphere in class. However, the difficulty is a bit too low.",
                "This class was a very strong class overall! We ran out of time to discuss numerical methods to solve PDEs, and so if given more time I would've loved to learn this topic, but overall this class was taught in a comprehensive way that also felt manageable. I don't really have any complaints!",
                "Small class size made the lectures feel very engaging and interactive. This course did a great job not only giving you a lot of tools to solve a wide variety of PDEs but really explained things at an intuitive or conceptual level before diving into mathematical notation. The professor hosts multiple OH sessions weekly which really helped for psets! I do wish there were only two (albeit longer) lectures per week rather than 3, but the pacing was completely manageable (not too slow, not too fast). Overall, I loved this class!",
                "The strengths are the amazing professor that teaches the class in a clear and clean manner. Some of the weaknesses are the course weightings with the exams being worth a lot more than the assignments despite the level of work required on the two being the opposite.",
                "About the most engaging a math lecture could get! Professor Hiltunen really made sure to make the class engaging and talk about meaningful applications.",
                "The organization of this course was a major strength. Everything was clear in how it connected to what we had already learned, as well as how it would be used to develop that which we were going to learn next. The lectures and homeworks did not get stuck in the weeds of proofs, but rather, the course seemed to have a nice balance, where it primarily felt like a rigorous applications course, and we would only go off on the theory tangents if they were short and fruitful. The exams were fair and followed the course material closely. Lectures were short (50 min 3x\/week) and engaging."

The course is focused on computation rather than proofs, which may be unappealing to some people, but I would encourage people to practice computation regardless as it is an important part of ones' mathematical development.",
                "Yes. This course is great for introductory level PDE study.",
                "Yes absolutely! You will learn so much about the theory of PDEs, how to solve them, and their applications to a wide variety of fields (there were physics, CS, and Econ majors in the class and all students could find ways to apply what we learned to their respective majors!) from physics to music. Professor Hiltunen is a fantastic professor who really cares about his students and wanted to see all of us succeed and understand the material as best we could. I would highly recommend taking this class if he is teaching!",
                "Yes!! Despite note taking ODEs prior to PDEs, I found this class challenging conceptually but completely manageable. Its taught super well, explains concepts\/equations both at a conceptual and mathematical level, and you come out of this class feeling youve learned so much: from deriving Fourier series of equations from scratch to thinking about waves propagating in higher dimensions. Definitely one of the top 3 math classes Ive taken as a math major so far!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, since it is foundational for opening up new avenues for understanding more complicated mathematics.",
                "I definitely recommend this course to anyone who is doing Applied Math. PDEs is useful and Professor Hiltunen teaches it in a very engaging way.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. What a great way to start to get familiar with PDEs, a notoriously tricky area of math. The introduction to boundary conditions through the context of this course seems extremely useful, not only in math, but in physics and engineering, and surely other disciplines. If Erik is teaching, I would recommend it just for the great experience of his fun lectures. The atmosphere of the class is great, with a focus on collaboration and a healthy dose of humanity to counter the all-too-common math-class imposter syndrome."
