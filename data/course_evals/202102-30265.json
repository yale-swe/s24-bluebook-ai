                "The strengths are the small class size, high student engagement, and great lectures and explanations of the material. I do not see any huge weaknesses in this course, everything was great and I learned a lot! Maybe it would be better to travel to Russia like in previous years before the Covid breakout to get more experience communicating with native speakers and get to know the authentic Russian culture.",
                "Strengths: Lots of engaging material, relevant grammar/vocabulary, many opportunities for cultural engagement/exploration\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of balance for students with more vs less Russian language ability; students more fluent in Russian tend to dominate class\r\n--> maybe have more advanced students be more aware of this?",
                "The professor is great and very helpful. I liked how the texts were utilized and integrated into the curriculum. It could be a bit repetitive, but this may have been exacerbated because the class was online.",
                "Strengths: vocabulary incorporated into Russian history\r\nWeakness: honestly not much-- always having to write a history summary felt a bit monotonous, though."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students since it helps to improve the language skill very efficiently in a short amount of time. It takes the language skill to a higher level and helps to learn the history of Russian in the 19th century in a very detailed and fun way.",
                "Yes! Given you have taken Russian classes up to L4 or have equivalent experience. Good class to improve reading and discussion skills.",
