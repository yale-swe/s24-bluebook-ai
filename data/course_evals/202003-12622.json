                "Strengths: The class was very engaging, very interactive, and the environment was well-suited towards learning. The class environment is very welcoming, especially with regard to different degrees of music backgrounds and familiarity. The material was very interesting, and the workload was more than reasonable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the narratives presented in the textbook were hard to follow. I don't think this is a problem with MUSI 175 specifically, but more likely has to do with the textbook itself. That said, I think it's pretty hard to deliver a history of music course that does not have confusing narratives here and there.",
                "The only weakness I can possibly think of is that I wish we could cover even more content! Obviously that is not realistic, but the world of music is so vast and I would love to keep exploring it further in the ways in which we did in this class.",
                "The course was excellent in facilitating interesting and engaging discussion coupled with great assignments. Sometimes there was some logistical ambiguity, but it was always remedied",
                "I really appreciated the study guides Professor Davis put together for the quizzes and final exam - they were very helpful for reducing stress and improving understanding, especially when I was trying to connect things at the end of the course.",
                "Very detailed feedback on assignments, really helpful study guides for the quizzes, easy and interesting readings."

                "Yes! Even if you are a musician, you still learn a lot about music history and appreciation by taking the course. Music is a very interesting topic, and we rarely have the opportunity to engage with music intellectually unless you major in it. However, any non-music majors would still find enjoyment in the class. The biweekly quizzes might be a deterrent, but honestly those were not too stressful.",
                "In a heartbeat. I learned so much without any anxiety of too great a workload. I think it really speaks to the engaging nature of the professor, who made the context easily understandable and accessible.",
