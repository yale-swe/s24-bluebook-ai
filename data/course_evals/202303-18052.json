            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The fun cultural activities that occurred throughout the semester whether it be watching a Hindi movie together as a class or having a cultural evening. \r\nWeaknesses: The course seemed disorganized. There should be more slides or an outline of what was expected from us more clearly. The writing on the board is hard to follow, so having more group work would be nice. The quizzes felt like they covered concepts that we just lightly touched on or never mentioned.",
                "Strengths:\r\nProfessor Sharma is incredibly kind and is very willing to work with you in office hours if you are confused about topics covered during class. She spends a great deal of time outside of preparing for classes with students in office hours and helps them get a better grasp of the language. If you are willing to put in the work, Professor Sharma is incredibly encouraging and helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe class was a bit disorganized and I wish it was more interactive. I understand since this is the first semester of Hindi that many classes would need to be focused on learning new grammar concepts / vocabulary, but I do wish we had more partner / group activities where we could practice speaking and writing with our peers. Additionally, homework was often posted without an announcement in Canvas or in class. These assignments were typically posted during the late afternoon / evening and we were expected to have them completed by 10AM the next day. If Professor Sharma or the TA could send out an announcement letting us know what was due when it was due, that would have helped me plan my schedule.",
                "I think the structure of the course was well organized, and the recursive learning of new tenses with old tenses was very helpful. I thought the number of homework assignments, while daunting, really helped with my grade and with my understanding of the course. I especially liked the writing assignments.\r\nI thought the midterms and final were fun while being very fair for our experience level.\r\n\r\nHowever, I wish that we had more speaking practice. I still can't speak Hindi that well unprompted.",
                "Strengths: 1) Swapna is a fun, charismatic, and very approachable professor. Our TA, Riddhi, was also extremely helpful and understanding  -- she was essential to my understanding of course material! 2) Projects and homework assignments generally fit well with what we were doing in class. The midterm group project also fostered a sense of class community. 3) In general, it is really rewarding to start learning a new language!!!!!!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) The class sometimes felt a bit disorganized. There were days when I wasn't sure exactly what I should be doing for homework, or how the homework should be completed. 2) The quizzes every Friday sometimes seemed excessive (though the weren't weighted very highly, which I appreciated). That said, I also think that these quizzes helped me learn new vocabulary and improve my grammar. 3) Perhaps my biggest suggestion is that I wished we focused more on vocab and less on grammar throughout the course. \r\n\r\nOverall, HNDI 110 was a wondeful/rewarding experience!",
                "strength: close-knit group of people, comfortable to grow with peers \r\n\r\nweakness: content could be streamlined better, I feel like there wasn't a coherent path in what I was learning as a beginner language learner"

                "My family is from south India, so while I've heard Hindi from movies and whatnot, I didn't really get that much of an advantage in terms of hearing Hindi or a similar language at home all the time. If you don't have a strong cultural association with Hindi, the class might be harder for you in some ways, especially speaking and remembering vocab. However, you will still learn, and the grading is fair. There is a lot of daily homework. But if you have any interest in learning Hindi, it is a pretty good language course with some fair expectations. Also class can be quite fun.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Despite its occasional disorganization, the Hindi professors and TAs are wonderful, and the opportunity to learn a new language is wonderful!"
