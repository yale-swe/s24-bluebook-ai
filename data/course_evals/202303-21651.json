                "So much!! Prof Giammei is an incredible humanitarian - I feel as though I learned what it meant to truly interpret and talk about a text through this class. I also think it transformed the way I approach my essay writing.",
                "This class is so much more about critical thinking than knights. Although I did learn lots of interesting facts about knighthood and its influence on modern media, this class of was so much more valuable for the out of the box way we approached the media. However, the writing lab felt like a very large waste of time.",
                "I learned more about how to approach analysis in college, how to take notes during readings, look analytically at different kinds of sources, use the resources of Yale like the Beinecke, and I generally gained insights about all of the sources we looked at from our seminar discussions",
                "Developing college level writing skills, learning to analyze multiple forms of media in relation to each other (books, films, TV shows, comic books, etc), visiting the YUAG and interacting with special objects from the Beinecke special collections were all things I took away from this course.",
                "Critical literary thinking, analysis of mixed media, writing, critical reading skills.",
                "A lot of insight into historic and modern chivalric figures, stronger writing skills, getting used to a college seminar environment",
                "Reading, writing, discussing, and a greater understanding of the Humanities discipline as a whole."

            "comments": [
                "It had so many strengths - the discussions were formatted effectively, and I enjoyed the course material. I do wish time on each text was distributed more equally.",
                "This course was strong due to the variety of texts, shows, and films that we watched. On the other hand, the writing lab was poorly structured and felt like a waste of time.",
                "The writing lab on Fridays were way too long and essentially useless. I did not really get work done during them, and they sort of waste your Fridays. The seminars were great, with an amazing professor who facilitates conversation very well",
                "Strengths: Professor Giammei and Karina were amazing, and really worked hard to create an inclusive seminar environment. They also gave very detailed feedback, and were always available to chat about the course and even life, which I think was especially valuable as a first year student. The diversity of texts covered in the course was also great, and allowed students to draw transhistorical connections between works that one would never even have fathomed of.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it felt like we were discussing the same cluster of themes for multiple weeks, which made some seminars feel less engaging and a bit repetitive at times. Also, the lab period can definitely be revamped to be more engaging, perhaps with more peer review sessions or collaborations with other 6PGx classes.",
                "The content of this course is fascinating, and I was engaged throughout the whole semester. The one weakness of this course is the writing lab component which doesn't add much, I think it should be removed.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting content, fantastic professor and TA\r\nCould be improved perhaps by modifying the weekly writing lab - sometimes seemed like an inefficient use of time, although it did help with allocating time for writing",
                "I think the strength of the course resides in the reading material. The multi-media nature of the readings kept everything fresh and interesting.",
                "Strengths: readings, discussions, class format, events\r\nWeaknesses: writing labs, grading policy"

                "Yes, if there is no writing lab.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking for a first year seminar. Professor Giammei creates an environment that not only encourages free discussion and advancement of thought, but also friendship and maturity. I personally found the time we spent talking during our seminars to be very fruitful, and Prof. Giammei's expertise on the topic of knights taught me things I didn't know were possible to learn about them. The writing lab is a pretty well-paced introduction to college writing and walks students through the process of writing an essay, so it's a good option for first years.",
                "Yes! Our whole class (as far as I can tell) loved the course, the professor, and the sources, and we bonded over the course of the semester as well",
                "Absolutely, for all of the strengths I outlined in my responses to questions 3 and 11.",
                "Yes, it is one of the most interesting classes I have ever taken.",
                "Would certainly recommend! This was a fascinating class taught by an amazing professor, would recommend any class taught by Prof Giammei",
                "I would enthusiastically recommend this class to anyone with an interest in the humanities. I think the class is fun, challenging, and interesting, and I genuinely feel that it has impacted the way that I consume all kinds of media.",
