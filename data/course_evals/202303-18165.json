                "This class taught me many introductory skills in stage combat! It was amazing how much groundwork we could cover in one semester! I now feel very comfortable doing a whole array of punches, kicks, slaps, blood, and knife work, and connecting it all in fight choreography.",
                "I learned about theatrical violence, about working with a partner, about being more aware of my movements in physical space. I was amazed that the entire class, regardless of starting skill level, was able to learn the moves and enjoy each other's company in a safe, welcoming environment.",
                "Black-belt level combat, situational awareness (near third-eye) and a deep knowledge of physical interaction between actors on the stage. A great deal of exercises informing the necessity of violence as pertains to storytelling and how to go about it respectfully and safely."

                "Mike and Kelsey are exceptional instructors. The material is always fun, engaging, well-explained, and exciting. Expectations are always clear, and there is plenty of support for you to creatively explore the subject safely. Every day is fresh, and this class was always the highlight of my day. Mike and Kelsey are always asking for and incorporating feedback on the pace of the course (which was excellent) and their instruction. They were very conscious of the physical and mental requirements of the material and always willing to accommodate any of our needs. There was an excellent balance of instruction and practice. I cannot think of any way to improve this class.",
                "All strengths, no weaknesses. Fun and fascinatingand a good workout in the middle of the day.",
                "This course is the perfect introduction to stage combat.  It took complete novices and led them to create fast paced and convincing works of theatrical violence by the end of the semester.  It also forged a community that will live outside of the class.  The profs were fun, engaged, and receptive.  They were supremely interested in the wellbeing of the class and I have immense respect for their ability to create a curriculum that it accessible to everyone.",
                "Strengths- EVERYTHING! It's such a fun course and Mike and Kelsey are the best part! They are so wonderful and helpful instructors.\r\nWeaknesses- The final project deadlines could have been a bit more organized. But other than some logistical communication improvements, everything about this class is incredible.",
                "Strengths: Mike and Kelsey are the best -- so knowledgeable, kind, and enthusiastic. Plus, they were excellent at facilitating class each week in an engaging, fun fashion. Mike and Kelsey were able to meet each student at the student's own level and help them flourish from there (for instance, a few of the kids had past martial arts training, but I never felt like I was at a disadvantage starting out as a complete beginner). Also, very little homework outside of class except for the Midterm and Final projects.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None, really.",
                "Truly no complaints. Its structure is incredibly empathetic and encouraging, and directly pertains to applying it to real world performance. I worked with Kelsey during the semester both in class and during a show, and found that both informed the other in a way that an experiential class very much should."

                "Absolutely. If you are interested in stage acting, this is good information to have. Even if you aren't choreographing violence, it is helpful for being aware of your body and how it moves with the others on stage. If you aren't interested in acting, it's just a great time.",
                "Absolutely. You need to have a sense of physical comfort with other people to do itevery day you go in and fake headlocks, chokes, etc.but it's a great time as a hobby or a novelty or whatever you want it to be.",
                "YES.  The most fun you will have in a class at Yale.",
                "YES YES YES YES YES! If you can get it, take it! If you come from the theater world, take it! If you DON'T have theater experience, TAKE IT EVEN MORE! This class is such a great way to meet people, de-stress, and learn from the best of the best such a wonderfully underrated aspect of acting theater performance.\r\nThe assessments are very chill and very structured. We had in-class practice time, which was REALLY GOOD because the instructors were there to help and guide us.\r\nThis class is among the best decisions I made at Yale. Only don't take it if you don't want to move around and be on your feet (but also they WILL accommodate people with different physical movement capabilities)",
                "ABSOLUTELY!! It's an awesome class -- you learn a ton about theatrical violence and improve your technical skills in a fun, low-stress environment. Plus, spending a few hours per week learning to move your body in new ways is a refreshing change of pace from more \"book-ish\" classes.",
                "Absolutely. Its hardly a class that will apply to all too much of your daily life, but its one that takes itself with exactly the right amount of seriousness and respect: enough to inform an excellent and safe learning environment, but a little enough amount that its a great time that produces excellent skills that dont lose the joy behind the art."
