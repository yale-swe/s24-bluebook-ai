                "The strength of this course was that because of the small class size, students were able to actively participate in class and get direct feedback from the professor and TA. Both the professor and TA were also extremely lenient with grading and deadlines- they were more focused on students learning through completing the assignments than on harshly grading the assignments. The weakness of this course was that because the professor and TA were so lax with deadlines, they often did not communicate with students regarding what exact assignments students needed to complete.",

While the homework can be tedious and repetitive, it is helpful in cementing our writing skills. The course could be improved through more structure, particularly with communicating when quizzes will be further in advance."
