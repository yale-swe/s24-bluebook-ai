The content in the lectures is reinforced through group case studies, which occur once a week during class time. At first, these were a bit intimidating because they are somewhat long. However, they are very doable, especially in a group! They consist of analyzing\/evaluating scientific papers, applying lecture concepts, and learning the program SPSS (which is also covered in lectures). By the end, I was surprised by how well I could work in a group, even on Zoom!",

I noticed this information changing how I view and perceive the COVID-19 pandemic in real-time. It gave insight as well into how to read and assess scientific papers\/studies and measure their validity or extract general understandings that will be helpful going forward. I learned so much about different types of studies and how to set one up in the way most conducive to testing the intended question and how to properly write and prepare surveys. I learned a lot about how as a future doctor, understanding public health can be helpful in properly explaining information, such as test sensitivity and specificity, to patients. Additionally, we were introduced to SPSS which is data analysis software and will be very helpful in the future regardless of if one is further pursuing public health. We learned as well how helpful taking care of ourselves in small ways can really help us be healthier and happier which was indescribably timely during COVID-19. The global health case competition group assignment also was a great opportunity to apply our learnings on a global scale which was especially rewarding for those really interested in global health.

                "No weaknessses! You can tell Prof. White enjoys teaching the class. I thought the way assignments were weighted and divided was fair and I enjoyed working on the variety of weekly cases with other people. I also loved her idea of the mental health pset  it actually made a huge difference in how I carried and maintained my health throughout the semester, and I thank her for that!",
                "This is a great courseDr. White is incredible, and one of those professors who genuinely cares about her students and her students' learning. She's the most important strength of this course. It's also generally thoughtfully designedit touches on public health\/epidemiology from lots of different angles, and there are a lot of different opportunities for learning (ie, time spent on SPSS, time spent working in groups on cases, reading, low-pressure quizzes, the health case competition group project, the daily health goals assignment). We engaged a lot on current issues (obviously...) and I also really appreciated that. \r\n\r\nHonestly, I think that one of the only ways this course could be improved were if it could meet in person, which will hopefully happen next year. Dr. White showed us a lecture or two of her teaching in person, and I really hope future students get to experience that energy.",
                "strengths- professor amazing, so sweet, loved her, so smart\r\nweakness- not really any, but i think an exam or something may have helped me retain the info a little better, because there was no active recall",
                "One of the greatest strengths of this class is the group case studies. They help reinforce the knowledge gained from lectures and also encourage collaboration, which is important in public health (or any field, actually)! They can be a bit long and sometimes challenging, but the TAs and the professor are always there to offer help at any moment. However, if you do not work well with groups, this may be a little stressful (but also helpful to sharpen your group skills!). \r\nAlso, Professor White made self care an assignment! This helped me actually put effort into my well-being throughout the semester, which was really important especially due to Zoom fatigue and all the stress from the pandemic. \r\nOne potential downside is learning SPSS. It's a little challenging, but Professor White walks you through everything that you have to know, so it's definitely doable (I had no coding experience going into the class and I was fine).",
                "Strengths: \r\nProfessor White and the TAs- They make the energy of the class so comfortable and fun which makes engaging in the class feel so natural and easy.  \r\nReal-world applications- everything in this class has a real-world application that immediately made my understanding of public health much more sophisticated and gives a general context to all of my future learning in public health and epidemiology. \r\n20% of our grade was dependent on us committing to wellness practices and taking care of ourselves... amazing\r\nStatistics!!! We learn some statistics which is super helpful to those who haven't taken statistics or want to soon. However, you absolutely do not need any stats background to do really well. \r\nThe days we worked on cases were really fun (even on zoom) and you learn a lot from your peers and make friends! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nA lot of information in the lectures! I came up with a system to take notes and return to lectures again later to understand them more deeply later OR I focused on understanding more information in lecture and returned to take brief notes later as it was a little difficult to do both because lectures moved quickly. Makes sense though because we had only one lecture a week with case studies on Wednesdays.",

                "I really like the format of the course which was a mixture of lectures and group work. Doing hands-on problems was the best way to learn the material. The only thing that could be improved is instructions for some of the questions. I felt that sometimes instructions for projects\/problem sets were a bit vague. But that is also consistent with the nature of public health where there are many correct answers.",
                "Strengths- case days were very engaging and hands-on, professor and TAs were always available to answer questions\r\nWeaknesses- lecture days were often dry; attendance not mandatory, so many students would not show up",
                "The course was organized in a way that allowed the material to build on itself, with the perfect amount of practice! I enjoyed Dr, White's ability to make the topics in the class enjoyable and relate them back to real-life examples.",
                "I liked that the course was focused more on discussions and applications of the material that we learn, instead of just the lectures. I also appreciated the focus on mental health in the course."

I appreciated how flexible she wasdoing weekly quizzes instead of a midterm (probably better to stay on track anyway), doing an open note final (that I actually kind of enjoyed taking). It mattered that she actually asked us how we were doing (and was prepared to hear more than \"OK.\" Incidentally, I feel like I learned more in this course than in others with higher workloads\/where professors were less accommodating. (This is totally unsurprising to me but may be to some in the Yale admin, who, beyond my HOC, seem driven to making this semester even more miserable than it needed to bewhy did we need to register and apply for courses, which is a notoriously complicated and time-consuming process, DURING finals??)

Additionally, two of the psets were part of a self-care assignment, which was awesome!",

The weekly quizzes, although I am not sure these were new to this semester, were helpful in keeping me engaged with the material consistently while learning virtually, but they were not very stressful!",

I feel like I have a very good baseline understanding of epidemiology now, and especially that I'm better prepared to understanding discussions of public health interventions\/vaccine discussions\/etc\/etc related to COVID. The workload is extremely manageableyou need to be prepared to really dig into and understand the material, but I felt that it required more quality time from me than quantity of time.
