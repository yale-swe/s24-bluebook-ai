            "comments": [
                "I think a strength is that you're really allowed to go as deep or not in the learning process as you want. You meet tons of grad students who are really good in the field. I think my TA was really supportive because the TA knew I didn't have a strong bio background .",
                "Strengths: The course is very informational and provides insights into diverse topics. \r\nWeakness: Topics might be too dispersed that limited time was spent on each topic and fully understanding the material was challenging.",
                "The course is very detailed and I learned a lot from lectures and the homework.",
                "This course covered many different topics which was both a strength and weakness. It was nice because you got to learn about a lot of different fields, but I felt like you couldn't learn much about them since the course was fast-paced.",
                "Strengths: Bigger picture project as a final project, overview of data science methods during class. Also, access to quiz material from previous years was very helpful. Instructors were generally friendly and motivated.\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion sections were useless, as there was no discussion involved. Exercises in homework and quizzes were not explained during class, and no methods were actually taught, but instead briefly mentioned. It would be highly beneficial to connect the discussion sections with contents taught in the lectures. For example, things like backpropagation, kernel functions, Smith-Waterman algorithms etc. could be explained in detail during discussion, rather than having presentations on papers that are not that deeply connected to class material. I had to contact professional computational scientists for help with the backpropagation homework, when really I should have been able to infer the methods for this exercise from class without having to ask professionals. Most students in this class do not have a background in physics or computational science, and so ordinary differential equations are not trivial to them. Therefore, a bit of guidance through approaches asked from us in homework and quizzes would be highly beneficial and I would have learned a lot more in class. Overall, the class tries to include too many topics in one course, and so none of the topics are actually discussed in enough detail to be helpful and understandable. Reducing the amount of content, spending more time on each topic and providing guidance for homework and projects would help this class tremendously.",
                "I think the first half of the course was much better taught and included more useful concepts for the field of computational biology. The second half was largely theoretical and focused on protein structure which was a big shift. I was trying to pay attention but most of the time there were just long derivatives being shown and it was very unclear when or why we would use these practically. I appreciate the diversity in faculty lectures but some of them are just not good teachers and it makes it very difficult to actually learn new concepts. I think I learned most of this course by googling and reading on my own outside of class. \r\nThe workload is also heavily concentrated at a few crucial dates. You have three major assignments in one week (exam 2, final project, and final presentation).",
                "-very good intuitive explanations \r\n-quizzes are fair and test on basic knowledge. Look at previous quizzes and youll be fine. Homeworks are also fair (bio version) but the second one had some weirdly tedious questions\r\n-guest lecturers are generally great. Personally as a bio major I didnt understand almost entirely the more advanced deep learning guest lecturer and Im wondering what his target audience was",
                "The first reading assignment was a bit tedious but all the others were very useful. The practice exams were great learning aides.",
                "Strengths of this course include the breadth of areas it covers, the professors of diverse backgrounds it facilitates interaction with and the opportunity to discuss relevant papers it provides. However, given the breadth of information, it is difficult to go in depth into any one subject. In the future, it would be helpful if there was more time devoted to fewer key topics, where students could gain practical experience and greater guidance on applying those techniques.",
                "This course NEEDS to have office hours. It covers too many topics too fast. They need to cut down on the number of topics and do a deeper dive for each.",
                "The lectures were difficult to understand for non-data science people.",
                "A little more structure between instructors, and a better system to provide biology background for non-biology students.",
                "I felt like this class assumed too much knowledge about biology/machine learning/statistics.",
                "Strengths: highly organized and able to find lectures and materials easily",
                "The course was well organized and structured. I could easily find all the material on the class website. However, at some points during the semester, there was a lack of communication between the teaching staff and the students. Additionally, the lack of a structured office hours schedule made it hard to find help when needed.",
                "The discussion session can reduce the papers each weak.",
                "The amount of guest lectures was both a strength and a weakness, as it just increased the variance of the course. Some guest lecturers were fantastic and clearly invested in the material, while it felt like others were simply going through the motions. The specific topics being covered are certainly important, but in a survey course like this it's also really important to have a charismatic speaker, as the long-term point is primarily for students to find a few areas of interest and continue to investigate those independently.",
                "lectures are too loose",
                "Strengths: Had a lot of content that was covered. Cons: I don't feel like I have a solid understanding of any particular concept very well unless I came into the class knowing it.",
                "As a large lecture, it does not offer much engagement. Also, the mention of methods is rather fleeting. It should discuss more in-depth about some of the topics.",
                "I think a strength of the course was generally the organization and the topics covered. The topics were interesting, important, and current in the field of computational biology. \r\n\r\nI think the main weakness of the course was how broad and shallow it was. We touched on so many topics that it was difficult to know what was important for the quizzes. I think it would benefit from having fewer topics per unit and focusing more on explaining those topics. I think the lectures could also be more interesting. Some of them lacked enthusiasm and personality which made it difficult to pay attention.",
                "A lot of the lectures in this course were not very engaging nor did they go in depth enough to properly cover the topics addressed during class and discussed on the quizzes.",
                "Too much material; everything was so cursory it felt like we didn't learn much",
                "Strenght: Analysis of real world data",
                "Strength is the breath, weakness is that there was limited background knowledge covered",
                "The course did a good job complementing the scientific course content with discussions of how biomedical data affects societal decisions and problems (for example, a discussion of how personal genomic data can be kept more privately or more securely) -- which conveyed the significance of what we were studying well."

                "No, I would not recommend this class without a strong background in computational sciences and math. The class is more of a general overview lecture, and does not teach how to apply methods for research. Rather, it asks you to perform tasks which were not explained in class, which ultimately leads to you learning more through googling and watching youtube videos than actual class content. The workload is disproportional to credits received, and the deadlines for final homework, project and quiz are too close to one another.",
                "Hmmm, it's one of the very few courses in computational biology that we have so I guess I would say yes. But I think if you don't have a baseline familiarity with certain concepts you will be quite lost - particularly the math foundation for the second half of the course.",
                "Definitely depends on what youre looking for. I personally loved it because as a bio major with very little computational experience I needed a nice broad overview of mining, modeling, learning. It was definitely very interesting for me. Comp people also get a good overview of the wet lab techniques that acquire the data.",

                "Make sure you're interested in details of the genome if you're more of a stats person. There's a decent amount of detail there. That said I did learn a decent amount with not that much work (although the weekly summaries added up).",
                "Yeah. An introduction to bioinformatics",
                "I'd recommend the course as an introduction to many topics in computational biology. That being said, due to the amount of topics being covered it's impossible to go super deeply into any one subfield.",
                "it's okay",
                "I would recommend this course - you get to learn a large range of topics in the field of biomedical data and read some pretty interesting papers. The knowledge was hard to process at times when coming from not a particularly strong biology background, but the class was overall intriguing.",
                "Unless you have a computational background, I would probably not recommend it to another graduate student in the biomedical sciences unless your research is going to be somehow bioinformatics based. It is a good overview of a LOT of different topics if you are looking to be introduced into the field of biomedical data science.",
                "If necessary, I would.",

There was little material to reinforce what was taught in class and often the lectures did not touch on the appropriate things at the appropriate depth to account for the varying backgrounds of the students.",
