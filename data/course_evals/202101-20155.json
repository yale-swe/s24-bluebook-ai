Professor Brisman does a fantastic job of asking complex, open-ended questions and facilitating active participation. \r\n\r\nThe conversation was always interesting, but I occasionally felt that the balance of topics within the conversation was uneven. We would either focus on one aspect of one question from one poem for way too long, or we would move on from a question without reaching a satisfactory conclusion.",

There were definitely periods throughout the semester where I felt disconnected from the class, or a little bored, but overall it was a great course for anyone looking to dip their toe into poetry.",
