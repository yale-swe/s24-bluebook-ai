I learned much more about comorbidity and the signs and diversity of autism spectrum disorders. We got to delve into the genetic signs and legal interactions regarding autism which I absolutely loved and I think it will help me think more critically and open minded going forward.",
                "I learned a lot about autism and issues surrounding it such as legal issues.",
                "I learned about autism, the potential causes of autism, its effect on family members, intervention methods, and the diagnosis of autism.",
                "I learned more about Autism in 5 weeks than I thought would be possible. I have a much better understanding of Autism and related disorders and want to focus my volunteer work around ASD.",
                "I gained a comprehensive understanding of the different aspects of autism, learning about the biological and environmental factors involved in this interesting disorder.",

                "I learned a lot more about a disorder that I had not previously known a lot about. Definitely a great intro course to Autism as it covers all aspects from diagnosis, prognosis, education, disability laws, families with disabilities, and more."

                "I loved this course. Dr. Volkmar was incredibly organized. Everything was very easily accessible, the guest speakers were fascinating and crucial to the course, and this course is very personalizable.",
                "The prerecorded lectures were recorded years ago and I wish they were more updated to be more engaging and current. The strengths were definitely the live discussion classes which were informative and engaging.",
                "The material was super interesting and I liked being able to ask questions during the synchronous classes.",
                "I really enjoyed the class- I thought it was incredibly engaging. I have had trouble in the past staying focused and remaining undistracted in classes via zoom but that was not the case for this course.",
                "The strength of this course lay in its excellent professor, wonderful guest speakers and well-planned syllabus.",
                "Strengths: Incredibly insightful and funny professor, interesting material, great guest speakers, and manageable workload\r\nWeaknesses: Many of the recorded lectures were outdated and could use an update. There is also a final paper worth more than fifty percent of your grade -- more transparency about grading and feedback on writing would have been appreciated.",
                "Loved having the outside speakers, the different perspectives were very valuable.",
                "Strengths: breadth of what we learned in such a short time; the guest lecturers; recorded lecture, readings, and class discussions\/ Q&A giving us 3 ways to receive information without feeling left behind or pressured to engage with one format that may not fit study\/learning habits better than another. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lack of diversity in autism perspectives we engaged (almost no people of color, autistic girls\/women, queer autistic folk)",
                "Strengths: Professor Volkmar is the leading expert in this field and an excellent resource for learning about autism. Weaknesses: This course could be improved if the lectures were updated. The lectures seem to have been recorded around 2010, making them over a decade old, and findings in neuroscience, as well as key texts such as the DSM, have changed drastically since then. We are essentially learning wrong information this way, which must be corrected in the discussion sections. I found this very problematic.",
                "I see no real weaknesses with this course except that the summer recorded lectures were very old. Strengths were the guest speakers.",
                "This course has students very engaged as it is mainly question and answer based during live class time. I like how broad of a spectrum we get with the knowledge. Perhaps class time could have been a little more structured, however."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student - a must take for anyone interested in autism or developmental disorders in general!",

                "Yes definitely! Great course, not too difficult, and certainly engaging. Professor Volkmar is SUPER knowledgeable on this topic and is very engaged himself, which always makes for a fun class."
