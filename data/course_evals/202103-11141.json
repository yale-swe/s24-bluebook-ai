                "Very engaging course with a wonderful teacher. She is very understanding and clearly puts the students first. She is also very professional in how she teaches and relates everyone to the course. She made sure to include students in daily conversation and language excercises.",
                "Prof. Alexandrov is amazing!!!! She's patient, understanding, and she creates a very close-knit, safe community within the classroom.",
                "I really loved to group work and the final project. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
                "I enjoyed the balance of casual conversation for practicing speaking skills alongside more structured grammar review and practice during class. Really manageable workload as well. It's also so clear that Professor Alexandrov cares about making the class interesting as well as the success of her students. I think the course could be improved by including more \"listening\" exercises into the homework, for vocab and grammar comprehension. Otherwise, no weaknesses.",
                "Our professor is a great strength. She always was open for feedback and helping us outside of class hours. The collaborative nature of the class was also great. I do wish there was a better understanding of what our grades were throughout the semester."
