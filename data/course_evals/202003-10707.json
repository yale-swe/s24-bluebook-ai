The class has a strong support system available (piazza, many office hour times, good ULAs). \r\nWeaknesses: The class was entirely self paced. While this is nice sometimes, it also got increasingly difficult to motivate myself to watch the lectures as the semester went on. Lectures were also occasionally posted 1-2 days after the scheduled class date.",
                "The course was very well presented and the lectures were engaging and informative. I felt that the quizzes for every lecture were the strongest points of this class as they really helped me retain the important info from each lecture and were an added incentive for me to pay attention and take notes, as well as highlighting the main takeaways from each lecture. I also felt that the option to retake the quizzes once was really great. Feedback on homeworks was also good. I didn't really like the external tool used to submit homework though because we had to individually select every page that corresponded to every part of every question, something I found just a bit tedious.",

The video lectures weren't too long and were actually very engaging and well-formated. I enjoyed how I could play the lectures at faster speeds or rewind when necessary. The class was completely asynchronous but there were many office hours at various times throughout the week.",
