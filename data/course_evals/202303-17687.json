                "I loved that we go to have every class in the YUAG. Through taking this class, I really feel like I know the collection well. Professor Suthor did a great job of presenting us with a variety of art, not only one art movement\/period of time\/artist. However, I thought that the readings did not greatly add to my understanding of the art each week. I also felt that I did not have much guidance in writing my final paper (ie no direction on format, how to structure the argument).",
