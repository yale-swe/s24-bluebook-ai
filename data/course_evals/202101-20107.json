                "Strengths: \r\nlove the engaging field trips and extra-text readings, the curriculum covers so much but each part is covered enough for a basic understanding, diversity of readings, engagement with all five senses, lectures are clear, concise, and organized, liberty given to students so they can pursue the specific avenue of P&Ppl they are most interested in\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nn\/a",
                "The course material was very interesting and applicable, and it was also a nice balance of science and social science material. The Kimmerer readings were also a strength of the course. \r\n\r\nOne way the course could be improved by putting more emphasis on relating the academic papers that we read for discussion sections to the lectures.",
                "Strengths: Low workload (without compromising depth of engagement with topics), a variety of virtual field trips to different places on and around campus to see the techniques and processes we were studying in action, an amazing TF (shout-out to Josh!) who deftly guided discussions of a variety of fascinating topics, readings (especially from Kimmerer's Braiding Sweetgrass) that added an enriching dimension to lecture topics, and a kind and accommodating professor.\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly not many; the only weakness I might cite is that sometimes the professor seemed a little unsure of herself and looked to the TF for expertise, but this didn't detract from the quality of the course.",
                "The lectures were really well done and I thought the field trips were really great. Section also was pretty engaging and I appreciated how much Professor Puth and out TA seemed invested in us as students and how passionate they were about the material. The creative project was fun and interesting. The only thing is the exam questions were worded in a way that was incredibly difficult to understand, and the grading was extremely difficult. It seemed like the Professor was looking for very specific words or phrasing to get points for questions, rather than demonstrating a clear understanding of the material, which felt unnecessarily convoluted and difficult. It also felt a little unnecessary to have both a final project and an exam.",
                "The main strength was that Prof. Puth and Josh were a really good teaching team, and their different areas of professional focus made them able to answer our full range of questions. The main weakness was the Zoom format field trips to greenhouses would have been a lot more instructional had we been able to see the plants up close.",
                "This class was very time intensive with three lectures per week plus discussion, so perhaps condensing the classes to 2x per week would make it more manageable. Otherwise, the lecture materials were interesting, reading assignments were very cool, and project was fun to do!",
                "I loved the online field trips and the discussion section was involved enough to matter while also low stakes enough to not overwhelm. No complaints.",
                "Very approachable content, yet lacking in specificity at times",
                "A lot of information but informative and connected",
                "I thought the lectures were for the most part very engaging and a lot of the readings (especially Braiding Sweetgrass) were interesting as well. However, considering the zoom format, meeting four times a week was way to much in my opinion. I wish either discussion sections were every other week or the field trips were every other week. Four zoom meetings a week was a lot, plus the three exams and big project\/paper. I would have gotten rid of the midterm, to ease the pace during what I believe was an overall difficult semester for a lot of people. However, I did really enjoy the class."

                "Lectures were adapted almost perfectly to the online format, engagement was always optionally high, and the virtual field trips succeeded more than I thought they might; use of breakout rooms was meaningful; recording the lectures was very helpful for review and scheduling. Honestly, this class was probably the best adapted to virtual learning of any class I took during the covid terms, so I don't think I have any negative feedback!",
                "The virtual field trips were an excellent way to keep us engaged during the remote learning, as were discussion sections. Of all the courses I've taken during this academic year, I think this one made the most effort to retain the authentic experience students get in a normal year and maintain student engagement during the pandemic.",

                "The online field trips were logistically difficult and likely could have been improved in terms of clarity for online learning, but the unscripted, live approach that caused an clarity issues was worth it since they really helped pierce the online barriers of covid in terms of interaction. I feel like the discussion sections succeeded in engaging with students who craved more interaction, and they lectures were well paced and accessible.",

It is a survey course, so topics are not covered in significant depth, but I found the entire curriculum to be engaging and worthwhile. Professor Puth is fantastic and our TA was very fun.",

This was easily my favorite course this semester, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in plants; such a wide range of topics are covered that you're guaranteed to find some of them interesting.",
                "Yes! This class was a joy to attend every week even with the awkwardness of Zoom, so I can't imagine how fun it would be in person. Take this course and enjoy all the in-person discussions, field trips, and the ability to really get to know your classmates for us who weren't able to engage in the same way this past year!",
