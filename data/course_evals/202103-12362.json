She is a constant support and a very caring and fascinating teacher.\r\n\r\nThe class size is also small, so it is a very nice space to develop language skills without having to feel embarrassed. HNDI 150 helps you develop all areas of the language and I would most definitely take it again.",

It is also a very good space to practice your skills in. The Professor is brilliant and I left this semester with an increased understanding of concepts beyond just Hindi, but also what we discussed in the language.",
