I leave the course feeling a lot better prepared to understand major economic debates of our time.",
                "Foundations of macroeconomicsGDP; growth; relationship between interest rates, economic cycles; and exchange rates; labor markets; banking system; trade, etc. I now find myself able to understand macroeconomic policy, mentions of the \"fed,\" articles on the economy, etc to some level.",
                "I built a backbone of understanding in the macroeconomy: how to measure economic growth, the proximal and fundamental causes of economic growth, as well as trade, financial markets, labor markets, business cycles, inflation, money, and trade deficits. I also learned to question certain trends, including identifying omitted variables and explaining reverse causality.",

Throughout the semester, we covered topics ranging from long-term growth to trade, monetary policy, and more.

                "Having the class in a seminar form was really nice as we got to have ask a lot of questions and have in depth discussions of the material. Also it was nice to have a final project and try to apply the theories we learned in class to the real world. \r\nThere are no weaknesses to the class.",
                "Strengths: Course is very well-organized, slides are clear and instructive; problem sets, practice worksheets, and previous exams are very helpful. The course is very straightforward - no surprises.\r\nWeaknesses: Despite what Dr. Hawkins said, based on my discussions with Econ 116 (macro lecture) students, the curricula are not standardized. Not sure why the lecture people and the seminar people are learning different things (ex: lecture did AD-AS model whereas seminar did IS-MP model) but keep that in mind when deciding between the two.\r\nAlso, at times, it can be hard to keep track of all the pre-class prep, post-class practice worksheets, and problem sets, but Dr. Hawkins does a good job putting everything on Canvas and sending weekly reminder emails. He is very organized and the onus is on you to read his messages.",
                "Strengths: Very engaging and interesting classes, relevant real-world applications are shown, homework/problem sets were helpful to our understanding of our class, helpful office hours/peer tutorung.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Problem set grading was a little slow and nit-picky.",
                "This class is wonderful in generating an environment where everyone can speak and ask the professor questions. In terms of weaknesses, I would say that there are basically none.",
                "Having class prep and post-class work was super beneficial to stay engaged.",
                "Very well taught but a little slow",
                "Strengths of this course was its small seminar vibe. You could ask questions at any point during class, which was great. Also, it was not like a normal intro-macro class as Professor Hawkins was able to put his own spin on a lot of the material and give a different perspective to teaching the material. So Professor Hawkins was a big strength. A weakness of the course was maybe it felt like we were not learning anything substantial at times, but this may just be the nature of macroeconomics (compared to learning microeconomics). By this I mean I did not know exactly what the questions on the midterm/final would be like sometimes because a lot of the class is learning about history/trends, but if this is what you like then the course is great.",
                "Strengths: very interesting and engaging professor, topics were applicable to current events.\r\nWeaknesses: none come to mind!",
                "I think the seminar format is remarkably helpful for a course like this -- there are just so many topics that could easily be misunderstood without the space to discuss and ask questions about them. Professor Hawkins was remarkably willing to create the space and energy for student engagement and interaction, and that brought up the energy in what has been a hard term for many to teach and to learn.",
                "Strengths : well organized syllabus, super knowledgeable professor, good balance of class assignments \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the lectures fell into mini rabbit holes. it seemed like Professor hawkins would sometimes decide to provide context for more nuanced topics (on the spot), and it could make the rest of the class feel rushed",
                "Seminar format works well, helpful to ask questions. Problem sets were effective at understanding content deeply. Practice worksheets were a great low stakes format for that as well. Prep exercises were short and very interesting. Group project was good for understanding the real world applications of the content as well as its limitations. This may be a complaint about macroeconomics more generally, but there are so many overlapping models that do or don't work in certain cases which was often confusing and challenging to see how they applied to the real world. Class did at times move very quickly.",
                "This course was taught very well. The only downside was that for about half of the semester the professors office hours were online which made it hard to understand the content and receive help. When he was in person it was much better. This class was great",
                "Strengths:\r\n - Assessment: Assessments are fair and spaced out well. Grading is fair. \r\n - Resources: Prof. Hawkins prepares ample and relevant resources for exam preparation, including lists of relevant topics (basically your fourth grade science teacher's study guide) and practice worksheets. After reviewing these resources, I gained confidence and clarity. The lecture slides are also filled with in-depth explanations relevant for problem sets.\r\n - Extra help: the TFs and Prof. Hawkins are incredibly generous with their time. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n - Class format: a quarter of the class is spent listening to Prof. Hawkins' long-winded response to a classmate's far-too-advanced question. While I recognize that the purpose of the seminar class is to provide students the opportunity to ask questions, several questions are irrelevant and not only fail to further, but may at times hobble, collective learning. I would encourage Prof. Hawkins to be more selective with the questions he answers, and limit his responses when the information is not directly relevant to the course material.\r\n - Timeline: this class does operate at a very last-minute timeline. Incredibly helpful resources may not be provided until days before exams. Assignments are usually not graded before the next assignment is due.",
                "This course covered a wide range of topics, so it was consistently engaging as we worked with new material each class. I also appreciated that the course was actively taught by my professor, and that the slides only served as an extra resource (rather than the professor just reading off slides in class). I also greatly appreciated the opportunities we had to discuss and come up with our own answers in this class, instead of it just being entirely lecture-based.\r\nThe only weakness of this course is that it was sometimes difficult to tell which information being presented was crucial for the final exam, and which was simply supplementary knowledge. Therefore, I would have appreciated if a bigger emphasis was placed on the more important topics beforehand, so we knew what to focus our studying on in advance and could rule out topics that our professor deemed less important. Essentially, I wish that the review sheet (what to know/not to know) was circulated in advance, or that a similar version of that was present throughout the semester, not only at the end."

                "If you want to take Econ in a seminar form, this is a great class. Personally, I enjoy seminars much more than lectures so this was a really great class for me.",
                "Yes, but also consider the lecture format of intro macro if you are better at taking exams than, say, at preparing an end-of-semester group research presentation. Basically, the lecture format is less work but each aspect is worth more in the grade calculation; the seminar format is more work but each bit is worth less in the grade calculation.",
                "I regret not taking the lecture (ECON 116). If you took ECON 115 or know you prefer lectures, there is really no benefit to taking this version. It's not a seminar, but rather a lecture where you have to sit through a lot more questions from other students and you have to 'turn and talk to your partner.' The material is very lecturable, so I would definitely recommend ECON 116 instead. Also, the group project in this class is a pain and feels like high school all over again. Hawkins is quite an interesting professor, and not necessarily a good one. I did not find class awfully engaging and he was not at all communicative on posting study material for the final exam. If I were to rank all the classes I took during my first year, I would place this one at the very bottom.",
                "If interested in Economics, absolutely. If not, still yes. You learn a lot about the world.",
                "I think the lecture is definitely the way to go for macro - we end up having way more assignments in the seminar, and it's very easy to complete those without learning the material (so for those who hope the seminar will force them to keep up with the material...maybe not true). I didn't really appreciate Prof. Hawkins's teaching style or manner of interacting with students.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone considering taking intro macro but can't decide between the seminar or lecture. The seminar is worth it. You can ask questions, talk over problems with friends in-class, and get to craft a good relationship with your professor.",
                "if you have to or are interested... the class is exactly what you expect",
                "Yes, if you are looking to take further economics courses at Yale, you should definitely take this course. I recommend the small seminar too because I think it is taught better and it is more fun than the larger lecture. The professor is great so that is always an advantage.",
                "Yes, Hawkins was great. He really cares about the subject and his students. Great guy.",
                "Absolutely! Great way to get started with the Econ major and a nice way to follow intro Micro.",
                "Yes, I would! Many students take macro courses as pre-reqs or for major requirements, but having taken it \"for a prereq\" but then realizing I didn't actually need it (nor did I want to major in the subject is was a pre-req for!), it was still a valuable experience. I say this in part because I think the topics discussed in this class are just important things to learn about as human beings living in a hyper-politicized world. I gained a new perspective that has amplified and deepened my interest in major economic issues of the day, and my final project was quite a helpful way to explore the application of these issues in the context of a real-life political issue (for my group, the pension age debate).",
                "Yes",
                "YES",
                "Definitely. I think the seminar format requires more engagement than the lecture but its very fun and Hawkins is a great, engaging, funny teacher.",
                "yes this class is a great way to broaden your world view in terms of economics and can help you understand why certain politicians argue for specific economic policies. Its a great class and Hawkins teaches very well.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course for any student who wants to better understand the headlines on the newspaper; globally-focused, the class will teach you more than just the ins-and-outs of the macroeconomy but about how to challenge theories using a social scientific framework.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student wishing to get an introduction to the world of macroeconomics. It covers all necessary basic topics that one may need to then move on with their studies of Econ at Yale. After taking this course, I feel prepared to continue on with other facets of economics, as I now understand how economics works in relation to our world as we know it."
