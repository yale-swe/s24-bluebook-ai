We talked about French history, regions, the environment, the French language, immigration, secularism, politics, education, employment, and feminism/sexuality. My vocabulary and fluency in speaking improved enormously.",
                "I loved this class. We watched amazing films, always had really insightful discussions on the films and on the presentations we completed. The class improved my speaking skills immensely not only conversationally but also through presentations. I learned a lot about French politics and different regions in France as well as discovered new French directors that I now love.",
                "I learned a lot about French culture, history, politics, and society. I practiced speaking and delivering presentations in French. I also did a lot of writing.",
                "A much more nuanced knowledge of French culture/politics/history (even though we only briefly cover each topic). My confidence in speaking, writing skills, and vocabulary also improved!",
                "I learned so much about French culture and society in this class, from France's attachment to its regional identities to the nation's views on politics, religion, family, and the working world. In addition to all of the practical knowledge I gained, I learned how to speak about these topics spontaneously and at a high level with my classmates. My confidence in the language increased many times over during the semester, and I can confidently say that I love French even more than when I walked in the classroom on the first day.",
                "learned about France from many perspectives, like politics, immigration, culture, etc. improved French conversation, writing, and reading skills significantly.",
                "Improved conversation skills",
                "I developed my spoken and written French greatly. I was also exposed to many questions at the core of the French identity.",

                "My speaking skills increased tremendously but its a lot of work",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The class was very engaging. Mme Pinzka really facilitated the discussion and created an inclusive environment. My class composition was very diverse, and I felt extremely comfortable sharing my views with the class. We touched on a variety of topics, and Mme Pinzka put much effort into giving us the most up-to-date information on the constantly changing French society. We received timely feedback. Weaknesses: It was a high workload class, with lots of reading assignments, movies, written works (400-word essays ~once every other week), presentations, evaluations (2 written, 2 oral throughout the semester, and you need to memorize the lists of vocabulary). I would appreciate it if there was less work. Apart from that, this class is excellent!",
                "Strengths of the course include very interesting movies to watch, insightful and lively class discussions, and improving presentational skills immensly. Improvements could be lessening the reading as a lot of it was repetitive and maybe having some of the movies be watched in class as most were completed our own.",
                "A strength is how much a student can learn about France as a country and the way it functions. A weakness is, however, the fact that the course requires you to do a lot of external reading and learning unrelated to French fluency. It wasn't that focused on French fluency as it was focused on studying French politics and social system.",
                "Strengths: Madame Pinzka is so dedicated to this class, and the class material is truly engaging. \r\nWeaknesses: I don't think the class presentations are very effective because most people just read a pre-written script, so they took up a lot of class time without improving our speaking skills. I also think it would be beneficial to receive more corrections during class.",
                "This course had a great balance of in-class activities and open-ended discussions that forced us to think on our feet and improve our oral expression. I appreciate the opportunities to refine our writing as well. Even though this course is marketed as a speaking class, it touches upon much more than conversation. In terms of weaknesses, I wish there had been more speaking assignments out of class, such as prompts that require you to respond verbally in a set amount of time. I think this would have made for good practice leading up to the oral exams.",
                "strengths: interesting material and fun discussions, especially enjoyed the movies and other cultural materials. professor Pinzka is great!\r\nweaknesses: readings can sometimes be numerous and dense; first couple weeks we had a short presentation, an essay and reading due for the same class which was a bit stressful",
                "Interesting topics, great feedback, work was overwhelming at times",
                "In my opinion, there are too many assignments. We had a graded assignment every week, which took the fun out of the readings and the movies we watched. This is done to ensure students do the work. However, better to check students' engagement through class discussions.",
                "Strength: Exposure to many different aspects of French culture (politics, work culture, race)\r\nStrength: Focus on vocabulary development\r\nWeakness: would have liked more support in improving grammar / using more complex grammar",
                "This course is very hands-on and well-organized for student learning. It's also fun and Madame Pinzka is brilliant!",
                "Strengths - class engagement\r\nWeaknesses - the number of writing assignments",
                "The emphasis on class discussions and small conversations was valuable as it provided a lot of practice getting more comfortable speaking. I think one improvement could be spending a bit more class time reviewing common mistakes/confusions that come up while speaking and writing so students don't continue to make the same mistakes."

                "Yes, especially with Mme Pinzka, but I've loved the French department in general through various interactions!! Mme Pinzka is very dedicated, humorous, genuinely cares for her students... The topics she chose gave a comprehensive overview of the French community, and the readings are extremely up-to-date. My speaking skills improved so much through this course. But maybe think twice if you have a high workload, it's definitely not an easy class if you just hope to get the language requirement out of the way - that doesn't mean you shouldn't take it though!!",
                "Yes! If you want to challenge your French skills this is the perfect class. Your learn about very important topics including immigration, politics, the environment, French language, and education. You focus a lot on presentations so you get very comfortable with public speaking.",
                "I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a quite rigorous course in French.",
                "Yes!!! Madame Pinzka is phenomenal, and I always looked forward to the work for this class. Our homework was engaging (reading articles and watching documentaries), and the writing exercises really helped my written expression. This was the academic highlight of my fall semester!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if that student feels pretty comfortable with their writing and wants to improve their speaking. This was a rigorous class and one that I was nervous about at first, but I do not regret taking it for a second. My classmates and I developed great relationships, and we all enjoyed witnessing each other grow as French students over the course of the semester.",
                "yes! i improved my french greatly while also learning a lot about French culture.",
                "Yes, it helps improve writing and speaking",

                "Yes its a good course",

                "I would recommend this course - I found it fun, interesting and engaging. You learn a lot and it improves your speaking greatly",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The small seminar format and the focus on conversation related to a variety of current issues in France made it a very informative and engaging course that was much more enjoyable than previous courses I've taken that focused more on grammar and writing skills."
