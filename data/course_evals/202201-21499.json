We read Professor Sexton's book about different elements of craft (characterization, style and tone, plot, etc), and at the same time read a lot of short stories that utilized these elements. Throughout the course, we worked on utilizing the techniques we had learned in very short stories, and in the second half of the semester, we wrote and workshopped a longer short story.",

I absolutely love reading short stories because they pack in so much in a small space, and I think writing is really fun too so for me this class was a really great mix of the two. I would say this class is a bit geared towards newer writers/readers, so sometimes I felt a bit frustrated and wished we had interrogated and examined the material we were working with more deeply, but at the same time it was a very judgement-free zone which is always welcome when you're writing fiction.",

                "I really enjoyed the discussions!  Every class we shared so many ideas that changed the way I approached works like Beloved and As I Lay Dying.  It was great to share our thoughts about books and discuss what made them so great.  The writing exercises were engaging and helpful, as were the peer workshops."

                "Yes!  Anyone interested in creative writing should take this course.  Professor Sexton does such a great job of walking you through the basic framework and features of a story.  He shares his knowledge and experience in a way that makes putting pen to paper--a task which has often felt so daunting for me--much more manageable.  You spend half the course studying great stories and the other half writing your own (workshopping your work with peers).  He can be a tough grader, but I felt like I grew a lot through this class!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student! ENGL 404 provided me with a wide range of short stories and authors and provided a strong foundation for my own short story brainstorming. I also loved the atmosphere of the class because my peers were extremely helpful during the workshop, and they were all very supportive."
