                "Professor Crockett was very kind and understanding of our circumstances. She also made class fun and enjoyable and included a much-needed break in the middle. The workload was not overwhelming. She also scheduled meetings throughout the semester to chat with her about our final project which kept us on track. I think the class could be improved by having some content each week prepared by the professor instead of only relying on student led presentations. Professor Crockett is a really great teacher so I wish we had a little more of that.",
                "Teacher and material was absolutely incredible. If lectures were recorded or class notes were provided, it would have been easier to synthesize material. Maybe a little more structure could be beneficial - otherwise discussions can be forgotten quite quickly.",
                "Dr. Crockett is a wonderful professor - very sweet and engaging. I liked that the format of the class was very consistent and that she always began class with a check-in. Overall it wasn't a very stressful course at all.",
                "The seminar structure worked really well for engagement! I liked the kickstarts and guided-discussion. Dr. Crockett did a great job of nudging discussion along but not dominating it.",
                "Amazing course.",
                "I enjoyed the open discussion format. I feel that the jumpstarts could use more guidance.",
                "This course is incredibly well-structured. The themes build on the prior weeks, with the topics getting more and more complex without being overwhelming."

                "We split into breakout rooms to discuss one of the assigned readings, then we came back and someone presented the info. Some people would share their screen and do a presentation on all of the papers. I think this system worked fairly well and we used it throughout the semester. It was up to the presenters to think of something engaging to do for their presentation - demo, game, Poll Everywhere, etc.",

                "The use of breakout rooms was helpful to foster relationships between students who, for the most part, have never met in person. Breakout rooms also created opportunities to hear from more students, who were less inclined to share with the whole group, and I enjoyed hearing their thoughts."

I will admit, however, there is not as much discussion on economic\/business concepts -- at least not really until the last week or so -- in case that's what you're hoping for out of the class. Nonetheless, would definitely recommend because Dr. Crockett is great and the class is not at all stressful (read the papers and write a response each week and that's really it until the final paper). She even gave us a ~15 minute break every class.",
