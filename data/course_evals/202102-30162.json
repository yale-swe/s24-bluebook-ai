I'd never considered classicism to have such diverse and complicated definitions, and it was a wonderful first art history course to take. I will take so many of the lessons on composition, style, history, and art-as-conversation with me into the future.",

                "This course was engaging, well planned, and well taught. I enjoyed out class discussions thoroughly and thought there was a good balance between learning about specific things that Professor Ferando wanted us to learn and exploring my own interests. That being said, this course kind of operated on the assumption that I had a decent amount of art knowledge and familiarity with classical art, which I didn't. We were often asked to find pieces of classical art as examples of topics or theories we had talked about it class, but that can be difficult when you have no familiarity with that kind of art to begin with. I think if we had done more of a groundwork establishing some of the basics of classical art, I could have engaged more with this course.",

Professor Ferando encourages group discussion and is always available to talk if you want extra help. I struggled a little bit to analyze at the highest level to return to best grades, but Professor Ferando emphasises the importance of learning over grades.",
                "Yes.",
