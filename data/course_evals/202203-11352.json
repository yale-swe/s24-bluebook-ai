                "Besides providing a community and family away from home for me as a Korean-American, KREN 152 taught me how to engage in both conversational and professional levels of the Korean language. I spoke to friends and classmates in Korean regularly, but also learned important career skills such as writing resumes and conducting interviews in Korean.",
                "Linguistic ability in Korean was greatly improved--for me the most helpful aspect of the course were the weekly worksheet assignments for the drama Misaeng. My listening comprehension also got a lot better, I feel."

                "Strength: Prof Lee!! She's such a wonderful person who cares about your well being. To give you one example, towards the finals week, I was so fatigued in class and when I had to stand up to stretch Prof Lee asked me if I'm doing okay and excused me so I can get more sleep in my dorm. She often brought snacks to class, which were pleasant surprise at 9:25am. The course material itself is really fun and gives you a chance to view Korean society and culture without boring readings. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I literally cannot think of any I would totally take another L5 course that is taught by Prof Lee.",
                "It was so cool how we got to use Korean directly in mock trials, presentations, and independent research. That was amazing! I didnt feel that there were any weaknesses really, but just as a heads up to future students, you will have to commit a lot of time to the class so that you can get the most out of the awesome classroom environment that  creates. Its more than worth it, but make sure to plan your schedule accordingly!",
                "The strengths were group discussions and other assignments. A weakness was the focus on the Misaeng drama-I felt it it took up too large a portion of the class.",
                "The curriculum itself was very diverse, with multimedia resources so we were never bored, and it covered everything from old Korean folk tales to modern-day socioeconomic inequalities in South Korea. I enjoyed being able to do something different almost every week in the class.\r\nI cannot think of any weaknesses at this time.",
                "This class was such a wonderful learning experience. One weakness would be that sometimes the deadlines wouldn't be as organized. Also, the mock trials had great intentions but I'm wondering if a discussion\/debate in small groups would be better than a mock trial where people are just reading off their scripts."

Now reflecting, I learned SO much more about Korean language and societal norms that I wasn't exposed to back at home. The course isn't overwhelming and fun, but still rewarding. Prof Lee is also a wonderful person and genuinely cares about you, which always makes the class more enjoyable. I feel like you also get what you put into the class. If you speak up in class, challenge yourself to use more difficult vocabs, and put more effort into writing assignments, you will get more out of the class.",
                "Yes!  is absolutely amazing! Do not miss out on taking a class with her.",
                "Yes, if they want to improve their Korean and have an interest in Korea!",
                "For either Korean heritage students who speak relatively fluently at home or non-Korean students who wish to pursue the language to a higher level, I definitely recommend this class. It is challenging at first but once you get used to the structure of the class and assignments, it isn't difficult to learn a lot of content at a steady pace.",
                "Yes--Angela Lee-Smith is a wonderful teacher!",
