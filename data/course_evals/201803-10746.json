    "Having CHNS 132 everyday made me better at Chinese whether I wanted it or not. Chinese pronunciation has improved without a doubt. Even my pinyin has gotten a little better, which I had thought was a lost cause. Made me further appreciate my Chinese heritage.",
    "Definitely developed my Chinese skills, in both reading, writing, speaking and listening",
    "I developed Chinese skills, in speaking, writing, grammar, vocabulary, and even knowledge about Chinese culture.",
    "How to speak, read, write, and understand Chinese language and culture",
    "I learned how to converse in Chinese and how to read and write in Mandarin. I also learned about Chinese culture through our daily conversations, and my pronunciation improved.",
    "Better understanding of Chinese reading, writing, and listening skills. Enlarged vocabulary, and more knowledge on Chinese cultural points."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths \r\n- meets every day\r\n- quiz every day\r\n- for heritage, you can choose when you want to meet with your TF \r\n- teachers are understanding \r\n- get to bond with class, since it's never too big\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- meets every day\r\n- quiz every day",
    "Strengths: small class size, high participation, develop close bond with your fellow classmates, learn a lot of new characters quickly, learn how to write (before this i was illiterate and couldn't string a single sentence together) and read well, become more confident in your speaking skills (lots of in-class presentations). Also, I absolutely adore my Chinese professor (Chan laoshi) and Liu laoshi is so amazing and sweet as well! Great feedback!! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the teaching structure. We essentially were taught from the textbook, like the characters and grammar points we learned are just from each chapter, so we didn't really get to learn characters that are important and common. We had to learn characters like \"walking your pet bird\" or names of a specific place\/tourist site rather than integral characters you need to know to read. We also didn't learn the basics of Chinese, like radicals, or tones, or character stroke order, which are so important. I feel like they assumed we know this, being in a L3 heritage class, but the truth is that most of us don't. As heritage learners, we mostly know how to speak, and not write or read.",
    "The strengths were how inclusive and engaged the professor was and how successful they were at engaging the students.",
    "For students who have never learned pinyin, maybe spend a few more weeks on it.",
    "Sometimes class feels monotonous because we do the same thing every day although I understand repetition is necessary for learning a language at a basic level",
    "The course offers a lot of practice in the form of going over grammar points daily, and the reading quizzes ensure that we are learning words. However, I wish that the course pacing could be better planned, since in the middle of the course they suddenly raise the bar without giving us much notice.",
    "The course is organized around a chapter a day, however, that pace progresses unevenly. Starting off with that pace is a steep learning curve and a struggle to keep up with. As the year continues however, it gets generally easier, until the pace is increased to two chapters a week. Overall, this means that there are two large jumps in difficulty, as opposed to a steady increase, which may be more manageable."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommend. As a heritage kid, Chinese will be much easier than other languages. Also, it makes you reconnect with your heritage and admire it more. Coming from a background where I didn't really want to be Chinese, this has helped me appreciate the richness of my culture and just how special it is.",
    "Yes, I highly enjoyed the class, not just because my Chinese skills improved vastly, but also because of the relationships I made with my professor and fellow classmates. One of the best class experiences I had.",
    "If they have a strong desire to improve their Chinese, I would. It is a lot of work and Chinese is a very tough language, but you do learn a lot of Chinese throughout the course in a fun manner.",
    "If you can speak Chinese but cant read or write it, this class will teach you both. However, I would be cautious of the lack of pinyin focus this particular level offers. Despite that, there are peer tutors available for pinyin. I would 100% recommend this class, especially with Chan Laoshi teaching it. Shes an incredible professor with great passion!",
    "Definitely! My classmates are some of my closest friends :)",
    "Yes, I would. If you are looking to get in touch with your heritage or to improve your China to communicate with family members\/work abroad, this course ensures that you learn a lot of Chinese in a short time frame.",
    "For anyone who wants to connect to a Chinese heritage, and wants to improve their language skills, especially reading and writing, definitely."
