   "comments": [
    "I improved my ability to close read texts, and was introduced to the use of archival and critical sources in making literary arguments.",
    "This survey of the American canon will leave you familiar with the great works of American Literature. The essays and class discussions focus around closer reading, synthesis, and archival analysis.",
    "I got more practice reading better and reading texts in conversation with each other and with a literary tradition, understanding how things fit in and broke from tradition while also working to establish some of the things we see as inherent to certain aspects of (American) literature.",
    "By taking this course, I developed a knowledge regarding American Literature and a skill at communicating that knowledge through literary criticism which I do not see myself as having been able to attain beforehand.",
    "I developed closer reading skills, writing skills, and conversation skills.",
    "I developed a much deeper understanding of American culture and identity as it is presented through its canon of great literature. I also strengthened my close reading\/ literary analysis and archival research skills significantly!",
    "Helped a lot with close readings, archival research, and other things helpful to English majors!",
    "I developed better skills in rigorous literary analysis, especially in close readings, was introduced to archival and literary journal research, and over the course of three essays, saw my writing skills improve dramatically. I feel I now have an insightful grasp on the sprawling themes of American literature and the main tensions underlying the diverse texts we read. I also developed a confidence in participating in in-class discussions.",
    "I improved on my close reading abilities, making sure to linger on certain lines and paragraphs in texts.",
    "The course syllabus explicitly highlighted three skills that was to be taught: close reading, archival research and critical analysis. I learned how to analyze literature at a deeper level and broadly, about how to apply these three skills to what we were reading. This class really showed me what was to be expected from an English seminar at a higher level."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think English 127 includes a great selection of readings and we made a lot of interesting connections between them throughout the course. I also had never worked with archival documents or literary criticism, so those essay assignments were new and challenging.",
    "Take this class if you want to read the books! It's a great motivator to read foundational works of American literature -- not too many people read Moby Dick for fun, but it's worth the ride. Sometimes, the discussions fell short, but there was always enough about every text for people to have something to say. Professor Smith is great to work with and very helpful during office hours.",
    "Discussions, sometimes, were less interesting or evocative than I would have liked. I didn't often feel like I was being challenged to think in novel ways. It was good that we got time to discuss, though. And we had ample time to read most of the works that were assigned, though it felt like some were rushed.",
    "The strengths of the course lie in the thoroughness and breadth with which the material was explored and contextualized as an extension of the country which produced it.",
    "Strengths: interesting reading material, great class discussion\r\nWeaknesses: class discussion made some class members feel intimated sometimes",
    "Strengths: great selected texts give a balanced walkthrough of the American literary canon, and the professor takes grading and feedback very seriously. \r\nWeaknesses: None, really! Essay prompts were tough and class discussions were sometimes hard to follow, but looking back, those were the moments of stretch that helped me learn the most!",
    "Strengths: Great instructor + conversation, great texts. Weaknesses: We touched on this in class a lot but perhaps not comprehensive enough of a survey of the diversity of American literature.",
    "I think the strength of this course was the fluidity and independence of discussionI always left class with a notebook full of revelations and feeling almost breathlessly productive. I enjoyed the few times we deviated from our normal open discussion (such as visiting the Beinecke), but appreciated our sit-down discussions and feel I learned the most listening to my peers. I can't think of any major improvements!",
    "The course had many strengthsthe caliber of seminar discussion, the quality of the syllabus, and the pacing of the class. I think only two things could be improved: first making sure to explicitly frame\/address works if they have problematic contexts or content. Second, it might be helpful to get feedback on a couple of reading responses, though this isn't pressing at all!",
    "I felt like a lot of the seminar was of students expressing convoluted ideas that only made sense to themselves, but perhaps not to everybody else. There doesn't seem to be a direction for the discussion to go in, rather it was a way for students to express ideas in order to garner commentary or validation. I'd wish that the discussion was more guided. In addition, the instructions for the essays were too vague for me and sometimes, I wasn't able to complete the task thoroughly because I wasn't aware of my instructor's expectations. I wished that perhaps there can be example essays posted for each assignment, or at least snippits of example essays."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I think this is a well-taught survey course in American Literature.",
    "If you enjoy reading and\/or may want to be an English major, this course would be great for you. It's accessible to anyone regardless of age or background. The class is pretty straightforward and manageable and reading novels is a nice break form other types of work.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as a means to learn not only about literature, but about America and the means by which it depicts itself in art.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. However, the student will have to enjoy participating, as this is a huge part of the class. Also, the reading material is very dense.",
    "Yes!!! Fantastic authors that I wouldn't have read outside of class, and interesting discussions in class help gain a much deeper understanding of the material than I thought possible!",
    "Yes! Prof. Smith is great!",
    "Yes! I enjoyed the texts we read and learned a lot from the discussions. The class never caused me stress but I still felt intellectually challenged and engaged.",
    "Yes! Whether or not you're looking at an English major, I think this course is fantastic and will give you such a deeper understanding of American Lit! (I mean the syllabus was incredible.)",
    "I would recommend this course to people who are interested in literature and the continuities in American literature. I don't think the content of the class is appealing to everyone, since it is pretty specific, but nonetheless, I would recommend this class to people who have interest towards American literature."
