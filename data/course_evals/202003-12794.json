                "Strengths: an incredible experience overall. I've never spent so much time on a class\/worked so hard on a class at Yale. Professor Adlparvar worked even harder than I did. He was always around to edit\/talk through research\/guide our process\/run rehearsals of presentations, etc. He was very hands on which could be overwhelming at times, but overall, meant that I learned a lot at every step in the process. I've never been in another class at Yale where I've received so much feedback.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: at times, this class could be an overwhelming amount of work. I understand that can be the case in a capstone project, but particularly over zoom, I often felt a bit fatigued. Perhaps this would have been less of a problem if my classmates and I would have been able to meet in person and there were more clearly boundaries on our time.",
                "Strengths - It's very hands-on and engaging. You get to work with a real client, and the work you do can have real impact. You can also pick up some new skills. And develop a close relationship with your advisor since each group is so small.\r\nWeaknesses - Since you get to basically plan the entire course and the work you want to do, it can often feel like the content is constantly changing, and this makes the class particularly difficult to navigate. It can also get VERY overwhelming at times, especially as particular deadlines get close and the report is due. Since it's a group project and you basically have no say in who gets to be in the group, it can get very frustrating when people don't pull their weight in the group. In terms of improvements to the course itself, I think only repeat advisors should be allowed to be advisors going forward - it's TOO complicated to organize and navigate expectations otherwise. In addition, there shouldn't just be 1 capstone prize. There should be at least a top 3 or something because it's VERY disheartening to put so much work into a project only to lose because of constraints your assigned capstone project came with e.g. topic, location, data, client, contacts.",
                "While I very much enjoyed working with my capstone group and learned a lot, the capstone program itself has much room for improvement. Mainly, theres a little coordination and communication, often last minute, throughout the semester in the program in terms of what the pedagogical objectives are and what is specifically being measured for student success. As a result, my team and I experienced a lot of ambiguity from what our progress was during the process to what we were being evaluated on for the final capstone presentation and prize."

                "It was an entirely virtual capstone, and I think that honestly ruined the experience. Since capstone is a group project (and the group is randomly put together), SO much of your work depends on the group dynamic. And if you never actually meet your group in person, don't travel together, don't talk to each other outside of the work, then the dynamic is inevitably going to suck. People are going to let work fall through the cracks and others will have to constantly pick up their slack. People won't feel accountable to the group either, and work will be painfully unevenly distributed. \r\nIn addition, in this course, there was honestly 0 regard given for time differences. We were having class at 7AM, at 5PM, at 8PM, or working till 12AM, 3AM, etc. There were also weeks where we were having 5 virtual meetings a week and it felt like we had to be available to do capstone work 24\/7. \r\nOverall, Jackson really should've changed the capstone project given the pandemic - we didn't deserve such a frustrating end to our experience in the major."
