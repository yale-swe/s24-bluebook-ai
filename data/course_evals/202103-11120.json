As an EECS major, this was an elective choice I decided to take to try and get a better sense of circuits and their inner workings. I believe I did leave this class with a better introduction to the circuit world, especially since the lectures were also filled with information about how we might see a certain configuration in industry.",

                "Prof Xia is very approachable and understanding, which I really appreciated. I think one thing that could be improved would be to more explicitly state what we should take away from lecture, since oftentimes they could be difficult to understand but we really only needed to solidly know the basic concepts. The labs were fun to do, but sometimes I felt like neither I nor other students/TAs fully understood certain questions in our lab reports. Some other strengths were that the workload, homework, and exams were very fair.",
                "Strengths - Prof Xia explains the concepts clearly in class\r\n\r\nWeakness - the labs dont always work and a bit hard to understand the underlying theory",

                "The lectures were packed with information and engaging which I appreciated. It made sure that I paid full attention to the material. Prof Xia would also make sure to include a lot of examples to clarify certain phenomenon. The structure of the course material was also very clear from the start, so it would help gauge which weeks would be busier. The TAs for this class were amazing in their feedback and lab help. \r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by providing feedback or solutions for the homeworks sooner, but with only two TAs its understandable why it would take while.",
                "The textbook is great. Regular quizzes that tested concepts rather than problem solving might help students better understand the material.",
                "The labs in the course were very well made. They extended on what we learned in class, were thought-provoking, and provided stimulating tasks for us to complete.",

                "I feel like the only people that are interested in taking this course are already majoring in/interested in electrical engineering, so to those people, I would say yes! Analog circuit design is not my favorite topic in EE, but I really wanted to make sure that I had a good foundation in circuits so I decided to take this class. I definitely do not regret it--I feel more comfortable with circuit analysis, and I also feel like I now somewhat understand the higher-level things we glossed over in EE 201 and EE 203. I thought this class was well-organized and had a classroom culture that was not super stressful.",
                "Good to have an in-depth understanding of circuits",

                "You get as much out of this course as you put into it. Most of my learning came from the textbook if thats cool with you",
                "I would recommend. I think this is a very well taught EE class with a manageable course load and interesting topic. Sometimes the frequency of the labs were difficult, but the Professor always seemed aware of our workload and made an effort to ensure the labs didnt take the full 3 hours! Otherwise, one of the best EE classes Ive taken while at Yale and think it would be good for any major/non-major student to take."
