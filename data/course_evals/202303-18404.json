This is a very minor complaint however because the course was very well organized on the whole",

                "Overall, a really strong class with clear expectations, challenging but fair problem sets, and engaging material! The final project is unique with very important applications for research success in general. My only suggestion would be one more check in with the professor and TA at the very beginning of the brainstorming period for the final project, just to ensure that students don't go too far down the wrong path with the final and then have to make a lot of changes right before the deadline, but that's a minor nitpick in a really wonderful class. The mock TAC panel at the end of class was a highlight for me.",
                "The course was structured very well",
                "Strengths: engaging lectures, helpful prof and TF, content is super applicable and useful, and the final project is such a great way to synthesize everything learned throughout the semester; no weaknesses I can think of!"

                "The course serves as an exceptional elective, attracting not only astrophysics majors but also those interested in computer science and exploring machine learning applications (an elective for ASTR 330). The assignments primarily focus on programming.",
                "Overall, I really loved this course, and I think it's one of the strongest courses in the astro major. I will say I would be wary of this class if you have no coding experience at all. I know its not required, but having a solid few years of Python experience, I think it would have been a significant (and potentially unmanageable) learning curve had I come in fresh. With some experience, problem sets were fair and well-balanced. Professor Rice is wonderful and engaging, and she went out of her way to help us inside and outside of the classshe informed us of REU opportunities, set up guest lectures with interesting professors, organized a YUAG visit and a grad student panel for us to ask questions, etc. The mock panel review was genuinely fun. Its a requirement for the astro major and is comprised of mostly major students, but it is a really great class with real-world applications.",
                "Yes. It's a great intro to astronomy research and scientific programming.",
                "If you're an astrophysics major it's required, but it was also a very enjoyable course",
                "Yes! A must-take for astro majors (or anyone else interested in the intersection of astronomy and data science) as it teaches you the building blocks for astronomy research from coding to reading literature to writing your own proposal"
