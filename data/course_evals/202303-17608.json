Especially because my high school did not offer APUSH, I never learned much of the content discussed in the second half of the class in an class environment. Even with the first half, I sort of re-learned U.S. history through a global perspective. Also, this course requires you to visit the Beinecke or Sterling Archives room for two short papers. As my fist history course at Yale, these visits gave me the chance to become acquainted with those two spaces for the rest of my time here!",

I have some background in some of the content covered in the course, but this class added on to my knowledge and broadened it to more parts of the world. I also learned how to write a historical analysis paper in this course.",

                "As an international student, I learned so much about the history of the US through the theme of its rising global power. The last week of the course dedicated to the history of post 9\/11 proved especially interesting as I'd never learned about the US involvement in the Middle East in the context of a history class. Additionally, Professor Engerman's required visits to the archives for the papers really helped me develop my research and citations skills and were overall incredibly enjoyable experiences.",

                "This course provided a good overview of the imperial history of the U.S., and I'd consider it a nice intro-level history course to find broad areas of interest in U.S. global affairs for further study. Personally, I've come out of the class with an interest in understanding more about the CIA's complicity in overturning Latin American governments during the end of the Cold War. For the two paper assignments, also, you need to go to either Sterling or Beinecke Archives to analyze primary sources from the time periods we're studying in classI found the paper assignments interesting, but a bit pigeon-holding, since there are only a select list of documents we could pull from. It was, however, really great getting to engage with archival material from prominent figures of the periods we were analyzing in lecture and section.",

I also learned how to be concise in my writing because the two essays were both only 3-4 pages, yet they required incorporation of the readings, class themes, and archival sources. I learned more about American foreign policy, namely American commercial and territorial expansion in the Pacific and the Caribbean, as well as modern (1970-present) interventions.",

It might be slightly redundant for someone who is well-versed in American history, but it is a great refresher if you haven't taken US history since high school. The class is very well taught so I could clearly understand the overall course themes in each of our lectures.",

                "My goal in taking this course was to establish a firm foundation of U.S. Global History that I was not all too familiar with, and I left the course not only with such foundation, but also with the desire to double in history.",
                "Rise of US global power.",
                "I learned to research at Sterling Library because of this course. This was the first time in my academic career where I got to hold and interact with primary sources instead of having to conduct research on computer. I loved connecting events of the class to current events and seeing the linear trajectory of history.",
                "I learned a lot in this class about different periods throughout US history abroad. The course titile posed a question about how the United States was able to gain its power, and really through common themes and and contrast, we explored so many examples that could be tools to argue an answer to that question. I also learned to use our University archives for research which was so valuable and interesting. I enjoyed the primary source focus of this course.",
                "I really enjoyed this class!! I walked away with a greater understanding of American history and with a wide range of knowledge about the changes and continuities within US history. Every single class had clear goals and simple themes. The professor always stressed the importance of forming our own opinion of history and encouraged us not to see the information as just facts. This was particularly shown through the essays we wrote for this class. I had to go to the library and actually look at the primary texts and analyze them for myself. The readings were always super interesting and the TA sessions really helped me understand the material. Office hours were great and super helpful.",
                "A broad overview of American foreign policy from Manifest Destiny to the present day. Great outline of how policy and national attitudes have shifted and evolved over time -- the class highlights repeating and diverging patterns. Lots of primary source material and assignments involving the archives."

                "Lectures were engaging and insightful.",
                "The topic and material are very interesting, especially if you are a history major or just interested in the U.S. in general. I would say lectures would be slightly hard to follow at points because Professor Engerman barely provides text on slides or additional handouts that supplement them. In essence, whatever you don't get from what he says you missed. I understand the logic behind not having text on slides but possibly not presenting those and posting them on Canvas for study material would be useful to students when trying to review course material.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is its content. I found much of what we learned to be very fascinating and focused. Professor Engerman did a great job of always outlining main themes of each lecture, while broadening it to the general themes of the course. The one thing that could be improved are the reading selections, specifically in the Bacevich reader. Many of the documents are long and are not always necessary in understanding that time period.",
                "The lectures were really engaging and my TF was definitely the high light of the class. I would say the one thing I would change is there was a lot of reading every week so I often found myself only doing one of the readings, but I think if there was less overall if would feel less overwhelming and I could focus on the more important ones.",
                "Better slides or lecture notes available to give an outline for final topics.",
                "I would love to have spent less time on the beginning (Washington farewell, address, founding of America) and more on the Cold War and post cold war. It felt like we glossed over the forever wars, detante etc. and I would have liked to have spent more time on that.",
                "n\/a. strengths are interesting reading materials.",
                "I really enjoyed the content of the course however the readings were often too long and not always helpful for understanding the course content.",
                "Strengths: interesting lectures, readings not overwhelming\r\nWeaknesses: a lack of content on the slides makes review difficult. Readings don't seem to have a purpose outside of discussion section.",
                "The readings were a lot sometimes, and the slideshows could have had more words on them so they are more helpful when time to review, but other than that I really enjoyed the course! Super interesting, well organized, great professor!",
                "Engerman's lectures really worked for me. I really enjoyed doing the archival research for the two papers  it's amazing what resources Yale has at its disposal  which I feel are well-explained assignments for which we are given appropriately timed notice. I wish there was less reading because it could get very overwhelming sometimes.",
                "I love that we have to go to the Beinecke or the Manuscripts and Archives to look at original documents related to the course and analyze them. The class was organized, the readings often were too much. Sections could be improved by making them less monotone.",
                "I loved the workload of the class. I thought that the themes introduced in class were interesting in how they applied to historical events",
                "A strength was the central themes helped direct discussion and formulate essay topics for the course. Also, working with primary sources was cool. A weakness was a focus on stuff that seemingly did not matter as much, and rushing through the 21st century.",
                "I thought that this course was a good survey for American foreign policy and did a great job of highlighting connections and continuities throughout history. The lectures were engaging, but the readings were often overwhelming. I also felt as though there were too many texts to manageI felt as though I could've gotten the same level of learning and engagement from this course by only engaging with 2-3 of the required course textbooks. In sections we would often only talk about 1-2 sources, making the rest of the readings not very relevant to the course.",
                "The course was unbelievably well organised and clearly formatted. Moreover, the readings supplemented the lecture material very well but weren't extremely essential to success in the class. Nevertheless, trying to complete them proved a bit taxing; one week an entire book was assigned for section discussion along with other readings. It would also be great if these materials were free; one wasn't available in Yale's library system. Nevertheless, I loved Professor Engerman's teaching, interaction with the teaching fellows, and his 2 paper assignments were really fun.",
                "Strengths are Professor Eingerman and the TFs! They do an amazing job keeping the class interesting.",
                "The class gives a good general overview of U.S. imperial history and global engagement. If you come to lectures and section as well, the midterm and final are fairly easy to get through. The structure and periodization of the course is the primary drawback, I'd saybecause the course charts the entire history of the U.S., there isn't a lot of opportunity to deeply critique U.S. imperialism in specific regions of the world (Latin America, the Pacific, Southeast Asia, East Asia, etc.), on top of the largely Euro-centric\/American\/Western perspective that dominated the narrative of the course. There's arguably a lot more room for rounded interpretations of U.S. empire through taking the perspective of the specific nation states or regions of the world the U.S. colonized or is imperially implicated in, which was acknowledged in our lesson on the Cuban Missile Crisis. Similarly, a linear periodization of U.S. imperial history inevitably centers the U.S. in ways that detract from the weight of those colonial legacies to begin withex: seeing the Cuban Missile Crisis as a product of the Cold War as opposed to a history of sustained American intrusions into Cuba following the War of 1898. I'd imagine there are a variety of ways to account for this when organizing the courselike looking at individual regions every few weeks, for exampleor simply making the course's historical perspective more clear during registration (like \"American Perspectives on U.S. Global Empire\"). That saidif you're largely unfamiliar with U.S. history or are looking for a thorough overview from the American perspective, I'd recommend taking this course.",
                "A strength of the course is the essay assignments which allow students to interact with interesting primary source material of their choice. A weakness of the course would be the supplemental readings, as they did not add to the course or be useful in class or section in a meaningful way. By incorporating readings into class more or decreasing the number of readings the class could be improved.",
                "great course overall, but poor slides",
                "I feel like the part of the syllabus that said \"We study events like wars, crises, treaties, and summitsbut also trade shows and movie openings. Our principal subjects include plenty of State Department officials, but also missionaries, business people, and journalists\" was a bit misleading. We could have spent more time on different treaties and summits; I often felt myself confused about what happened and who was at which conference. The \"principal subjects\" are more explored through independent archival research than in lecture. Also, America's cultural hegemony (\"trade shows and movie openings\") was only briefly explored. However, I still feel like I have a solid understanding of the history of American global power.",
                "A lot of review sections were during practice and unrecorded which hindered exam preparations for athletes.",
                "I think it's important to have a US history course that focuses solely on foreign policy, and this was a good overview. I enjoyed the primary source analyses and appreciate that the prof pushed us to visit the libraries and use the archives, which I hadn't done previously. My critique would be that we didn't really discuss US relations with Native American tribal nations of past or present, which I think would have enriched the course.",
                "Course was broad but papers were opportunity to delve deep into a specific topic\/time. I wish",
                "The reading can be quite heavy and some of the selected materials are rather out of date with obvious biases.",
                "The class was very well-laid out, not only in the sense that it was chronological but also in clearly detailing the course themes in every lecture. The TFs gave very interesting presentations during some of the classes. The writing assignments were very manageable and announced well in advance. Sections were also relaxed but productive. I do wish that the lectures were recorded. Additionally, I really wish that we had spent more time on current events (i.e., how the US's history connects to current events and the US's current role in these events).",
                "Strengths: Good survey of U.S. history\r\nWeaknesses: Doesn't pay much attention to ANY minority groups. And, yes, American history was mainly written by white, male men, but it would've been nice to include a little more history on the role of minorities (even women).... Keep in mind, however, this is a class that focuses on FOREIGN policy, as opposed to domestic policy. There is little historiography in this course, but that's to be expected since it is a survey lecture class.",
                "Very engaging and insightful lectures. I also loved the idea that the TFs guest lectured. For the exams, though, I would have appreciated if a rough list of concepts was published as a guidepost for concepts\/terms. Sometimes, the lists drafted by students at review sessions were misleading.",
                "Strengths: The readings are very insightful and discussions during section allowed for a greater understanding in the course material.\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures could have incorporated more student interaction with questions or surveys.",

                "Strengths: The professors and TA's are fantastic! If you love history, this is the class for you. This class does not have a heavy workload so it was easy to balance with my other classes. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We covered A LOT of US History. I think coming in as a freshman, it was just something I was not used to. However, with office hours and reaching out to the professor and TA, I learned how to study and better prepare for this class.",
                "Strengths: incredibly kind and understanding professor who is very knowledgeable about US history; the lectures are clearly organized around themes, which is helpful for studying for exams and understanding broader patterns; primary source research project is incredibly engaging and interesting! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very broad, little room for diving deep into certain periods\/topics\/trends except with the papers"

                "Yes, a really good and interesting begining history course.",
                "Yes. A good, relaxed humanities credit with interesting subject matter.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course! It provides really good background on U.S. and international history, which has a lot of implications on current events.",
                "Definitely take! Its really interesting, the professors care, the grading is fair, and the workload is light. Great 4th or 5th class for non-history majors looking to learn a little more about \"recent\" American history besides what we learned in APUSH.",
                "Yes, I thought it was very informative. We covered a sizable swath of American history with considerable depth, so I feel like a lot of that knowledge will be useful in future AMST\/HIST classes or just in general to speak educatedly on current events in a historical context. There is, however, a lot of required reading, but skimming should get you by in discussion section.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if you have a spare Credit\/D\/Fail option you want to use for a fun class. You'll learn a lot in this class, but the readings were sometimes too much.",
                "This course is a fantastic way to further ones knowledge of American history. This class isnt a huge time commitment and in many ways that actually made me want to commit more time to it.",
                "Yeah. It was cool to learn American history with a focus on the international rather than its internal issues.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in U.S. Imperialism and\/or foreign policy I would recommend this course.",
                "You can take this course for so many different reasons. It fulfils many history requirements, is triple cross listed in terms of majors, and is just a very fun class. Therefore, it's unsurprising such a variety of student take it, and this adds to its enjoyment. It's really one of those classes that's open and appealing to absolutely anyone, unless you really dislike or have an extremely strong background in US history.",
                "10000%, it makes you think about how the US interacts with the rest of world which can vary.",
                "If you're largely unfamiliar with U.S. history or are looking for a thorough overview of it from the American perspective, I'd recommend taking this course.",
                "If you are interested in US History and particularly foreign policy and engagements throughout its history then I would recommend this class as you learn a lot and it has a low workload with no assignments other than the two essays.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in History, Political Science, or Global Affairs. I would also recommend this course to a student who has not taken AP US History and needs a humanities and arts credit.",
                "Sure, I think it is a solid substitute for a regular US history class with more of a globalist perspective.",
                "Would highly recommend to anyone who wants an overview of the history of US foreign policy, along with experience in historical research skills (analyzing primary source documents and events, etc.).",
                "Yes, it was a straightforward overview of US foreign policy.",
                "This course should be required for all Yale College students. The lectures were extremely engaging and I always looked forward to section. I learned a lot of information in a very short amount of time, but it rarely felt like work.",
                "I would recommend this course for anyone who wants a refresher on US history or is interesting in global affairs. Given the world we live in, it was generally very interesting to take a history course on the US's role in shaping the world as it currently stands.",
                "Yes, if you want a chill class (you can certainly get more out of the class than I did, but there are limits). For a 5-credit semester, definitely. I didn't feel that the standards were super high for this class. There is a lot of reading assigned each week, but I didn't do any of it. I went to lecture, section, and occasionally read Herring to catch up on the material and was perfectly fine.",
                "I would recommend this course to any and all students at Yale. No matter what corner of the school you come from. Origins of U.S. Global Power will teach you something.",
                "No. The course was basically just a high school US history class.",
                "Yes! This course would be especially good for international students who want to have a more American-centered perspective to global conflicts and issues. Even for those who took APUSH or like history, the class is a good survey in American foreign policy. The class is very primary source-centered and allows students to conduct their own research using primary sources in Yale's reserves.",
                "Yes! Even as a student who hates reading, everything you learn in this course tells a clear narrative about how the United States turned into one of if not the most powerful countries on the globe from a political and economic perspective. This may be valuable if this is what you're looking for. However, aside from the TA lecture arguments, this class does limited critical analysis on racial impacts of its trajectory toward power, so if that is what you are looking for this might not be the course for you.",
                "Absolutely! This is a great class.",
                "Yes absolutely! It is very useful in understanding US history and its relationships with other countries, as well as patterns of America's isolationist\/interventionist tendencies and how they evolved. Great survey course."
