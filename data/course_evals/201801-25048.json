   "comments": [
    "I learned how to better read older texts and talk about them\/their themes.",
    "I learned about a diverse group of historical, mythological, and biblical women. I don't have a strong religious background, so I gained a lot of knowledge and insight about early and medieval Christianity. I learned a little bit of everything: history, classics, religion, Italian literature, women's studies, etc.",
    "Women actually were doing cool things in the Middle Ages! A female saint talked back to the Pope and convinced him to change his mind because she had THAT MUCH SWAY! There was a woman whose followers considered her the incarnation of the Holy Ghost and thus the equal of Jesus. She almost became Pope. Female doctors wrote medical books and suggested birth control methods! Before I took this class, I thought that medieval women just cooked mutton stews and died in childbirth, but no!",
    "Course thesis: the middle ages, especially the Church, weren't as bad for women as people think. That said, they weren't great. The Renaissance was a lot worse though."

   "comments": [
    "Excellent reading selections and discussions",
    "The course was interesting, but at time the discussion was disorganized. I liked the lecture\/seminar hybrid but wish that it was more consistent. Perhaps lecture one day and seminar the other?",
    "The course isn't a lecture, but Professor Purdy Moudarres does provide some context and commentary at the beginning of each class. I found these lecturers engaging, informative, and helpful in making sense of the more dense or obscure readings. Discussion in the seminar can be a little freewheeling,  but I consider this a strength because the discussions were so interesting. \r\n\r\nI don't have much in the way of weaknesses. Sometimes, it was difficult to get a sense of a work or author just from reading excerpts, but it's probably impossible to read the entire Divine Comedy or Decameron in a week.",
    "The readings are great, Christiana is amazing, and discussions are fun. The papers and test are not burdensome but you do have to try. The best way to improve the course would be to keep the discussions a bit more focused. Perhaps this could be done by restricting the class size so that fewer people are bringing up new topics of conversation.",
    "The class is really only worth taking if you're really invested in the question driving it how bad\/good were the middle ages for women? It's not an investigation of constructions of masculinity\/femininity or if it is, it's really not intersectional in its approach. It's really about Christian cis white women in the European middle ages (with a bit about Jewish women in the Old Testament). The class loses something by failing to explore the experiences of  women of color, non-Christians, non-Europeans, and ignoring queer readings and theory. The discussion of feminism was way off the mark as well. If you're going to open up the question \"what is feminism,\" it seems better to focus that discussion around a particular text. Assigning a bit of theory on analyzing pre-modern texts as feminist or \"\"\"\"\"proto-feminist\"\"\"\"\" and critiquing the article would go a long way. The conversation felt nebulous and deeply gender essentialist a critique I have of the class as a whole as well.  Thinking carefully about the intersections of AND the distinctions between sex and gender would help a lot as would reading up on some feminist, gender, and queer theory before you raise the question to a class. Starting a conversation with the disclaimer \"I don't know a lot about feminism\" doesn't inspire confidence at the start of a discussion that can be really emotionally draining and discomfiting. To be clear, I'm not saying don't have the conversation. But you have to structure it to succeed. Also, don't assume you know your students gender-- it just makes everything that much more uncomfortable. Despite these critiques, I did really enjoy the Dante and Boccaccio readings. The class is at its strongest when focusing on a piece of literature."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! It was wonderfully taught and we always had great class discussions. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about this topic and would recommend to anyone.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Prof. Purdy Moudarres is an amazing professor and the material is extremely interesting.  I was excited every week to go to class.",
    "Excellent course! I looked forward to doing the readings weekly and having great discussion with peers. If you are interested in the authors on the syllabus take the course.",
    "Yes! It's a really interesting course, and unlike anything else I've taken at Yale. The readings are engaging, Professor Purdy Moudarres is fantastic, and if you have a good group of people in the seminar, the discussions are great.",
    "This class rocks! You should totally take it!",
    "Yes",
    "Unless you're deeply invested in the question \"were the middle ages as bad for women as everyone seems to think?\" or are super into medieval Italian lit, I'd skip this class. And if you're queer or worried about being misgendered, carefully consider how much emotional energy you want to invest. Not worth it as a religious studies credit unless you're a medievalist; maybe more worth it as an Italian major?"
