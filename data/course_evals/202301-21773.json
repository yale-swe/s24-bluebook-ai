                "I learned so much about 17th and 18th-century comedy, and the 1600s and 1700s in general. I also became better at reading and understanding plays and pre-19th-century language.",
                "This course covered so many themes - from representations of gender, sexual relations, sexual violence, and class dynamics. We discussed wit and humor often - what makes something\/someone witty or funny? What provokes audiences to laugh? I also read so many plays that I had never even heard of before taking this course. As a prospective history major, I also enjoyed learning about how the politics and state of British society of the time influenced the theatre that was being made in the 17th and 18th centuries. Through this class, I gained more experience with textual analysis, and I think my writing skills developed."

                "Strengths: Jill Campbell. Professor Campbell is one of the smartest, sweetest professors at Yale. She genuinely cares about each and every student in her class. She also has an incredible wealth of knowledge about this subject. The plays that we read were fascinating, and texts I absolutely never would have stumbled upon without taking this class. 17th and 18th-century comedy really has a bearing on so much that we read and watch today. And the workload in this class was never overwhelming.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses",
                "There are so many strengths to this course. I loved all of the plays that we read, including the contemporary counterpoint plays. Although most of our readings are from centuries ago, I still found them to be hilarious. Our class discussions were always engaging and illuminating, and I thoroughly enjoyed our readings and mini performances of scenes from the plays. I can't think of any weaknesses!"

                "Take this class!! It's a hidden gem. Even if you are only remotely interested in theater or the 18th century, there is something here for everyone! In our class, we often discussed race, gender, and power, but Professor Campbell is the sort of excellent teacher who will guide the conversations in whatever direction she feels her students are most interested in. There is so much to discover here! The plays are extremely interesting and Professor Campbell leads wonderful class discussions. You will come to understand the 17th and 18th centuries in an entirely new light--they will come alive for you.",
                "10000% yes! this is perhaps my favorite class i've ever taken at yale! professor campbell is truly a treasure. i was psyched to go to class every day. despite the age of the material, our classes always felt current, relevant, and energized.",
                "Yes! Honestly, I recommend taking any course with Professor Campbell. She assigns such interesting readings (I loved all of the plays we read in this class) and leads truly engaging discussions in our seminars. She is obviously passionate and extremely knowledgable about English Restoration theatre, and she makes class fun by encouraging us to read scenes aloud and perform them too. She is a great resource to talk to during the writing process for the papers. She leaves amazing feedback on our finished essays as well, and I feel like my writing developed a lot during this course.",
