            "comments": [
                "This class was great! It's exactly what a lab class should be like. Many STEM students' experience with a lab class may previously come from the gen chem lab, but this one is much more fair and enriching! This class did a great job of following the topics we were learning in lecture, and I feel that I genuinely gained a better understanding of the topics in lecture from doing the experiments.",
                "It is well structured and well adapted from the online version from last year.",
                "Strengths: Most of the labs were interesting and helped facilitate my learning for PHYS 180. I also appreciated the brevity of the lab reports which allowed me to focus on the more important aspects of the course. Weaknesses: some of the labs (like the coin toss generator) seemed pointless. In addition, we would often begin a lab and then find out half way through that we received incorrect directions from our TA and then have to start over.",
                "A good portion of the labs we are just given data and told to analyze it instead of being more hands on. It would be nice to actually do an experiment for each of the labs instead of just being given information. The grading of the lab reports and notebooks, especially the insight points (just write about a real world application and one form of systematic error and how the experiment could be redesigned to minimize that) were not well explained and should be before the first lab is due.",
                "Strengths include the consistent support from the professors and TAs. It's a very warm and welcoming environment for learning",
                "Strengths: TA's are very helpful providing guidance\r\nWeaknesses: Lab practical exam is very high stress for lot of work in short amount of time",
                "Should be worth more than half a credit.",
                "This is the worst course I have taken at Yale. It is terribly designed and teaches you no physics. The experiments are incredibly boring, and many labs are just analyzing data that the lab team gives you. The teaching team is bad at explaining things and will leave you more confused than you were before. The grading scheme for the lab reports is inane and inconsistent. The final practical exam was silly, and the messaging around how to prepare for it was just straight up incorrect. The only strength is that labs never lasted the full three hours.",
                "Some of the labs were conceptually difficult while taking PHYS 170 and not 180, but overall there wasnt too much work and grading was fair. The lab practical was really stressful and could easily tank an A that youve earned from the lab reports if you are not good at working under time constraints (as in, it is basically the work of 3 labs during the same amount of time as 1 lab section, with very little time to think through your approach, perform calculations, and check your work).",
                "Strengths: instructions are always clear. The course is very well organized. Grading is fair and consistent. Labs teach concepts well and are not too difficult. Lab Practical Exam is not too hard if you've been engaged in lab. Regular schedule and unchanging rhythm of work throughout the semester.\r\nWeakness: Lab H was way too long and expected us to do an unfair amount in 3 hours. We stayed late and then were expected to complete the rest at home from videos. It would have been fine if it were 60% as long.",
                "The strengths are that some of the material is actually so cool! Getting to see precession and gyroscopes in action, learning about radioactivity, and thinking about the real world applications of the material was really interesting. The course was well facilitated in terms of the straightforwardness of the handouts and the use of Logger Pro, etc.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were that a significant amount of time spent in lab and in writing the reports feels like tedious busywork. The \"insight points\" were often really unclear and could lead one to get a less-than-ideal grade on lab reports. Sometimes the math behind some of the topics could've been better explained by the hand outs - even if you read them really closely, it felt like there were weeks where every other question, you had to ask your TA to explain something because it was just unnecessarily convoluted. \r\n\r\nLastly, the practical was awful. So, so unnecessarily stressful given the strict guidelines. Why were the rest of the quiz and lab notebook grades not enough? The practical didn't really mirror the rest of the labs given the restrictions and it was also so time pressured (which felt totally dissimilar to how one should conduct scientific research in real life, i.e. not rushed!), which just led everyone to be miserable. Please get rid of this part of the class - it feels completely unnecessary and I think it benefited no one.",
                "Strengths of the course: lab reports were fairly graded and TAs and professors were extremely helpful in explaining confusing concepts throughout the lab. The lab timing was perfect (not too long not too short) \r\nWeaknesses:  no improvements needed really. One of my favorite labs at Yale by far",
                "The lab handouts are well written and occasionally cool- it's clear that the instructor put a lot of thought into designing them. It doesn't always line up with 180 but when it did, it helped me understand the course concepts better. \r\n\r\nMany of the labs were overly long and tedious- lots of clicking around and multiple labs that didn't need to be in person. The practical really stressed me out and I didn't feel like it tested me on anything to do with physics- just the ins and outs of LoggerPro.",
                "I liked the hands on aspect of lab and the lab handouts did a good job of guiding us through the labs",
                "I think it's strange that the lab practical final was individual, while the work we had done so far in the semester was all partnered work. I think if the practical had to be individual, it would make sense to prepare us for it by having at least some of the labs being individual work, so that we at least have some experience with it.",
                "Great class and I learned a lot, although it required much review outside of class since it did not correspond/overlap with what we were learning during Physics lectures.",
                "weaknesses: final lab practical is unnecessary and difficult",
                "strengths- well-organized\r\nweakness- n/a",
                "Strengths: a very reasonable workload and low-stress environment. Extremely thankful for how this class is structured. Also fun instructional videos.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "This course is well-organized and minimal work outside of the lab time, which is very helpful for a lab course. Each lab is well-written and conducive to learning, while still being very manageable and understandable. Other than the gyroscope lab, which was very confusing, the rest of the course was a very positive experience.",
                "Lab write ups",
                "The instruction is clear. I feel like we needed more preparation for the final though. The jump between the weekly labs and the final was huge.",
                "eh",
                "STRENGTHS:\r\n-flexible/understanding profs and TAs that actually want to make the course as good as possible \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n-sometimes profs would post the lab handouts and quizzes very late\r\n-was hard to figure out what they wanted for the insight portion of the lab reports\r\n-unclear expectations of lab partners",
                "This course provided very clear instructions about how each experiment should be done. However, one thing that could be improved is that the torque experiment was conducted before we learned torque in physics class, and I had trouble understanding the concept of torque in that experiment. If it was conducted after introducing torque in physics 180, then I think the experiment would have been much more beneficial.",
                "Strengths: Not too much work. It's pretty easy to finish labs before the three-hour mark, and post-lab writeups are manageable. Definitely keep the workload the same! While 165-166 may not be as intellectually challenging as 205-206, that itself was a strength for me as 165 gave me breathing space during a tougher semester.\r\nWeaknesses: Just the gyroscope lab. There were too many experiments to run through in so little time, and I gained the least insight from that lab. If they reduced the number of experiments needed to be done, I think that lab and my overall experience of the course would be better. Less is more in that case!",
                "The weekly quizzes before labs each week were very useful for understanding the material.",
                "I wish there was a little more guidance on what the teaching staff was looking for in the lab reports. I would often get points off for \"insight\", and even now I still don't know exactly what they mean by that. However, I do appreciate how short and sometimes easy many of the labs were.",
                "Strengths: clear lab guides and good in-lab resources (professors, TAs). \r\nWeaknesses: the gyroscope lab was too extensive (maybe should be shortened so it's more maneageable)",
                "The LPE affected our grade too much for a 2-hour assignment. We worked the entire year on multiple labs that had less influence than a single assignment.",
                "I liked the material, the handouts, the timing, and the Professor and TF. No weaknesses!",
                "This was one of my least favorite lab courses that I have taken at Yale. Much of the focus of the course was figuring out how to use LoggerPro, or using pre-recorded data. This meant that we could have done most of the labs remotely, which did not make the in-person sessions very engaging. Additionally, in all other lab courses that I have taken (this being my 6th lab course at Yale), there have been periods of instruction or teaching of the material. This class had you read the pre-lab, but it was missing the teaching component within the lab period. I felt as though we were aimlessly reading instructions and performing experiments. It would be helpful to have a 15-20 minute session at the beginning of class where we talk about the experiment, ask questions, and discuss further applications of the lab. For labs such as the rotations, torque, and gyroscope lab, this approach would have been especially helpful because it was clear that no one understood the concepts in the lab. This concept had not been discussed in either 180 or 170 lectures before the lab, so more instruction was necessary.",
                "The course provides very detailed instructions and a good support system. However, the course material is not quite interesting and does not facilitate my learning.",
                "strengths: workload was appropriate for a 0.5 credit course--the first time I can say that for any lab. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: can't think of many, though the gyroscope lab could probably be improved",
                "All of the labs were great except the Gyroscope week, that lab took a lot longer than i think is necessary for the concepts to be understood.",
                "Strengths: Experiments are very clear as to what they want you to understand. All lab readings provide the necessary info for you to be successful in the course\r\n\r\nWeakness: The grading for the \"insight\" portion of the lab reports are a bit ambiguous and can be frustrating as it seems to be almost impossible to score a perfect score on this (at least with my TA)",
                "The strength of the course is that a lot of ground is covered and interesting physics experiments are done. A weakness of the course could arguably be too much of a focus on uncertainty and error propagation.",
                "The small one page lab reports after each lab were relatively easy to do but annoying to complete. Other than that, this was a well-structured course with a manageable workload.",
                "I thought this was a pretty solid course overall. We did a good range of experiments that were mostly in-line with the topics we learned in PHYS 180 lecture.",
                "Strengths: it is very well-organized\r\nWeaknesses: it is hard to see the applicability of the material to every day life (if there were connections in the labs to more phenomena we see outside lab, especially environmentally-related things, that would be great)",
                "This course is, without a doubt, the best lab course I have taken (having taken gen chem, orgo, and bio labs). It was so incredibly well designed and structured. You knew exactly what to expect; there were no curveballs to try to throw you off. The work was challenging but extremely rewarding. I loved how they designed the course to TRULY be equivalent to 0.5 credits worth of work. This is the only lab I have taken where I felt 0.5 credits was fair. For other labs, you can very easily spend more time on the lab than the lecture counterpart. I honestly looked forward to this course because I knew exactly what to expect with the quizzes and lab reports, and the labs themselves were genuinely fun! I would take this course again in a heartbeat. The only small weakness, which I know the teaching team has been improving upon, is the lab practical exam. The practice exam was much appreciated, but more preparation in advance of the exam would be greatly beneficial. That said, I felt the exams themselves were fair with some slightly more challenging questions than what we'd previously done.",
                "Weaknesses: it's 3 hours, and is another assignment you have to add to your to-do list. Strengths: you get to meet a lot of cool people that are your lab partners. By the end I felt as though our TA and class built a little community.",
                "The professors and TAs worked extremely hard to make the labs interesting and fun for all the students. It was a very well-organized lab, perhaps the best organized lab in the entire university.",
                "Honestly this is a very well-run class. Super organized and standardized so you know what to expect and what you need to do every week to be successful. Labs are long but generally doable, only one lab was way too complicated for the time given. One of the best lab courses I've taken. I learned more than most labs despite finding the material more difficult. It helped reinforce what we were learning in Phys 180.\r\n\r\nI thought the quizzes were a bit unclear/unfair at times, but they don't count as much as the lab reports, which were generally graded very fairly and instructions were clearly outlined. Some of the TAs are more helpful than others when it comes to needing assistance with the lab or questions.",
                "I thought this was a well structured lab course. I learned a lot.",
                "Weaknesses: dont take so many points off on the lap reports for random things",
                "Strength - well organized, knew expectations\r\nWeakness - Final exam was pretty hard for me since it was very much technical focused",
                "Strength: Practice for the LPE at the end, good TA Weakness: Actual LPE was a bit rough",
                "good.",
                "S:\r\nFantastic and fun lab, learned new material in an engaging way\r\nW:\r\ngrades took a while to get back, so could not quickly figure out how I was doing my labs right/wrong",
                "I think the labs where we would come in and just watch videos and not do anything hands on were pretty uninteresting. I feel also though gaining real physical experience in lab is more important and that those virtual labs could be changed.",
                "Great course! Professor Barrett was wonderful and the course was well organized",
                "the course is very hands-on which means that you learn a lot, however, the labs are so so long and in the end I am exhausted and can't even think of what I uust measured. the ta and the teacher are amazing, but i just think that it's crazy how long they are.",
                "Overall, the course covered a broad range of material that exposed students to a variety of relevant equations and LoggerPro protocols. I also got substantial value out of the weekly lab report assignment, which honed my organizational and analytical skills. The course could be improved in the future by ensuring that labs can be completed well within the 3-hour time frame (e.g., Lab H, the gyroscope lab, was far too lengthy and conceptually heavy for a single lab period).",
                "Some of the labs are a bit too time consuming and tedious. The lab practical exam was too short on time. I felt like I couldve done better if I was more comfortable and familiar with using the iMacs, especially the older ones. It took up time to figure out some functions, and I wasnt used to typing with the particular type of keyboard (so account for this). I definitely couldve done a lot better on the exam if we were given an additional 15-20 minutes for each. I was rushing through to finish and didnt have time to check and fix all the mistakes I made.",
                "The strengths of this course relate to its streamlined design, organization, and relatively short assignments. Having many assignments that must be succinct was extremely helpful, not only in preventing students from overwriting but also for instilling good habits in terms of scientific communication. The weaknesses of this course relate to the somewhat ambiguous guidelines for grading. Sometimes the \"insight points\" were worth more than other situations when I used similar examples.",
                "Strengths: clear organization, lots of context and extra information given in lab handouts, practice with many different techniques, teaching team was very passionate, labs were done in pairs so it promoted collaboration \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some parts of the lab handouts were phrased in a confusing so that even my TF often didn't know what was expected, lab practical is challenging",
                "reasonable workload, but limited support from professors and TFs.",
                "Strengths: the TFs and the professors Sean and  Sid. Also the lab report structure is great and helps you learn without being needlessly boring or long (like gen chem or orgo lab)\r\nWeaknesses: some of the labs really are just busy work and are needlessly tedious.",
                "Some strengths of the course was that it was very structured with good feedback for each assignment and that the assignments were engaging.",
                "Strengths- work load was manageable and the environment promotes student learning. \r\n\r\nWeakness- the final assignment was a bit unfair.",
                "Strengths: working in pairs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the final exam is difficult because you essentially have to do three experiments in one lab-allotted time",
                "Strengths: clear feedback, excellent TF, reasonable grading, organized course materials\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: basically none! I would probably advocate for going back to a handwritten Lab Practical exam, as it was very hard to show work on the Word Document form for all of the equations.",
                "strengths: labs were simple to follow and the lab notes + addendum were a great way to summarize what we did and see the bigger picture \r\n\r\nweakness: some of the labs were boring like the one with flipping a coin (but it did help with understanding the concept)",
                "THis is a very well organized course but sometimes the labs are really confusing and not even the TAs know what is going on.",
                "Weaknesses include the lab practical which serves basically to stress everyone out with a time crunch and a level of surprise that is not consistent with the rest of the course. It was not a useful nor constructive way to test our knowledge.",
                "The course was very well planned out and the material was presented in a matter that made sense. The only weakness I would comment on would be that I was sometimes a bit confused as to what was expected for us to include in the lab report.",
                "the final was much harder than the labs themselves and I did not feel prepared or feel like there was a way I could study for it, we didn't even get feedback from our practice final practicals",
                "Strengths: organized, consistent structure, fulfills lab requirement\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes experiments too long",
                "I appreciated how detailed the handouts were and the quizzes were good, however, having section on Monday, sometimes the handouts would be posted Sunday night which left me scrambling.",
                "I really liked the weekly lab reports instead of one big lab report",
                "strengths: efficient lab procedures\r\nWeakness: lengthy explanations of old labs no longer in use",
                "The lab notes and videos on Canvas were very helpful and provided comprehensive background information. Everything was super organized and easy to understand, even for someone who doesn't have a strong (or any) physics background. The TFs are very kind and always willing to help! The workload was very manageable, I'd say reasonable for a half-credit class.",
                "I thought the course was well structured, however it would be great if there were more options for time slots, especially time slots that accommodated with student athletes",
                "Strengths - update emails every week were great, handouts were super detailed and I learned a lot\r\nWeaknesses - could be a little more support during lab itself",
                "Good TA",
                "Strengths are that the course is extremely well organized and labs are very reasonable. No weaknesses!",
                "This course was really well designed and fun! The only challenging part was when there were labs on concepts that we had not covered yet in the intro physics course.",
                "Strengths: My TF (Yarone) was amazing!! Lab handouts were straightforward and well written. The torque lab especially was great. Grading was fair. Workload was low.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the labs that didn't have any hands on component (like the uncertainties lab) were not super interesting and I didn't feel I got a lot out of it.",
                "It took a long time to write up the reports.",
                "The course was great and went smoothly. The only issue was sometimes it was hard to match the pace of my lab partner.",
                "Strengths: Instructions are very clear and easy to follow. Lab materials clearly explain connection to physics concepts. The TF was very friendly and helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: If you're taking the course concurrently with PHYS 180, sometimes the courses get a little (~1 week) out of sync, i.e. new concepts are introduced in lab before they're introduced in the 180 lecture. But to be honest, this wasn't really such a bad thing for me because I found 180 really difficult and it was kind of nice to have a prior introduction.",
                "Strengths - the teaching team was amazing and the lab handouts were very thorough. After reading each, I felt very prepared coming into the lab and capable of performing experiments. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - lab handouts were posted late (often near the end of the weekend) which made it difficult for students with Monday or Tuesday labs to have adequate time to prepare for lab and study for the quizzes."

                "Definitely! It's probably a requirement for the students that are taking it, but I found it enjoyable. Even with the late lab section time, I never dreaded hiking up science hill for it.",
                "Yes, it is one of the better science lab requirements that I have taken since it gave the appropriate work for a half-credit course.",
                "I would recommend this if it's a requirement for your major but not really otherwise.",
                "Yes!",
                "If you have to take it",
                "No, the grading is poor, and the work to credit ratio is not worth it.",
                "No. It is such a shame that this is the only intro-level physics lab. I have to take 166 next semester and am concerned for my mental health. If you also have to take this as a premed requirement- good luck.",
                "Not unless you have to take it",
                "This course is not amazing, but is definitely the best lab I've taken or heard of. If you need to take a lab, definitely do this one, but if not, then don't unless you really want to.",
                "I would not because the grading is unnecessarily stressful and it often makes really cool topics pretty tedious.",
                "Yes, if needed as a prereq for med school or like on-hands experiments with self-supervised learning.",
                "Not unless you have to.",
                "only take it if you need it",
                "yes if needed",
                "I would recommend this course if it is a requirement to take a physics lab. Coming from someone who is pre-med, this lab is SIGNIFICANTLY less work and time than other labs (specifically chemistry labs... gen chem lab...), so it is not bad at all. You usually finish pretty quickly and there is minimal outside of lab work (only a 1 page summary lab report and then a pre-lab quiz).",
                "Yea it's fine. The lab practical exam was stressful, but the rest is fine.",
                "If you enjoy physics",
                "Yes.",
                "no one takes this course unless you have to",
                "take it-- workload is super manageable, especially if you've taken chem lab",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. We get partners for each experiment, and partners rotate each week, and it is very helpful as well as fun to be able to interact with everyone in the section!",
                "If you need to take it, sure. It's not too much work overall. Even if you're a physics major, I'd actually recommend this 165-166L sequence over 205-206L. Even though 165 is more mundane, and not that intellectually challenging, it will definitely give you breathing space during a tough semester. Additionally, the difficulty of labs does not heavily revolve around TAs. In 205-206L, it's a risky hit-or-miss since the TA will make or break the lab for you.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn about the experimental side of theoretical physics lectures.",
                "I would recommend it to students who would like to have a visual aid for the physics lecture courses. Certain concepts for me were easier to understand in this lab course than in the lecture course.",
                "Yes, it's a great introductory lab course.",
                "If it is required.",
                "Yes, definitely. I loved watching physics concepts come to life.",
                "I would only recommend this course if it is a requirement. If you're looking for a lab course where you will learn experimental methods and how to approach hypotheses, I would suggest looking for a different course. It is currently winter break and I am just receiving feedback from labs finished at the beginning of November. There are very few instances of specific feedback to help your learning. Additionally, there are so many students and computer problems during class that there are not many opportunities to get questions answered throughout lab.",
                "Yes if they need to take a physics lab, if there is an option between 165 and 205 definitely take 165 as its much more engaging with much less work.",
                "Yes, good physics lab (particularly for pre-med students). Well organized and run IMO.",
                "Yes definitely! Compared to other labs premeds have to take, the workload, expectations, and intellectual challenge of the course are very reasonable!",
                "I would recommend this course to students substantially interested in physics or students that want to fulfill 1 year of physics lab for premed.",
                "This is a good course to take to gain an understanding of physics lecture topics in a real-world application setting. The format of the course is good and the teaching team is super attentive and helpful- they are all really passionate about physics and are always eager to explain concepts.",
                "Only if they had to take it, not for fun\r\nI feel very neutrally about this course",
                "It depends. You are probably taking this because you're pre-med or a physics major. This is the only lab sequence I have to take as a physics major and I honestly really enjoyed it. Hopefully I feel the same way after 166L.",
                "Absolutely.",
                "Yes, I'd assume you'd probably only take if you needed to.. but as far as lab courses go it's one of the best. Much less stressful than Gen Chem or Orgo lab. Lab reports are due each week and if you complete them right after your lab while the info is still fresh then you really shouldn't have much stress associated with this class. There is a hands-on final that's done alone which is tough but we had a practice the week before which made it pretty manageable.",
                "Yes",
                "Yeah, its a pretty chill class, albeit boring",
                "Yes, I enjoyed it but I also had to take it.",
                "good.",
                "Yes, it's required. I think it's a nice introductory lab that can be challenging if you've never taken physics in high school.",
                "Yes!",
                "everyone takes it for the major, but it's actully fun. however, the fact that it meets every week drained me every single monday. i couldn't wait for monday to be over and for the lab to be over, becuase after the first hour I couldn't think and see and stand anymore.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student only if the student plans to pursue higher-level physics and/or physics lab courses (acknowledging that premedical students will need to take this course as well).  Otherwise, many of the skills gained in this course are not particularly transferrable, and those that are (such as general organization, time management, and scientific writing) can easily be acquired in a lab course more tailored to the student's unique interests.",
                "Not unless its required.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in performing basic physics experiments. However, I am not sure, given the class' size, that one would be able to maximize their experience. It is easy to get lost in the crowd. The TAs are very helpful, though, so it is all about taking advantage of the provided resources and asking questions.",
                "Yes its not nearly as bad as gen chem lab. The lab reports are very fair you just have to turn in your lab notebook and a one page summary. The lab days are really long and tiring but you don't have to spend a lot of time on PHYS 165L outside of lab hours. The labs are also pretty fun and interesting.",
                "Yes! The course was organized very clearly and although it felt tedious at times, I do think the labs were effective in illustrating very important physics concepts",
                "Yes, goes well with phys 180 and helped me see the physics concepts.",
                "Yes. Pretty low workload, understanding and helpful teaching staff, you probably need it for your major if youre considering taking it and its not bad",
                "Yes, its a required course for most students and its well organized.",
                "Yes. Only if you are taking physics though.",
                "Not really unless you need it for your major",
                "Yes! It's a great course to take alongside 180. You'll find that the lab workload is not too bad, and it reinforces the concepts that are taught in the lecture course.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. Its a easy lab that follows the content of physics 180 (note sure about 170). I think this course even made understanding the concepts taught in 180 easier to follow and provided a different explanation.",
                "It is required, but I would recommend taking it because it is interesting most of the time.",
                "Absolutely not unless you have to take it. This course is a waste of your credits at Yale unless you are a major or premed and youre stuck.",
                "Yes, it was very helpful to learn how a physics lab works and the techniques needed.",
                "yes, but beware that the final is hard and there is not really a way to study for it",
                "If you need the class",
                "It's a fun course.",
                "yes! It was really interesting to learn physics lab skills",
                "Very fun of the mill class",
                "Yes it was a good lab credit",
                "Definitely a better lab class than the Chem and orgo labs",
                "Yeah good lab",
                "Yes, especially if it is a prerequisite, but it is overall also a fun experience getting to explore hands-on some of the phenomena we observe in our lives.",
                "Yes, take this course if you need the physics lab!",
                "I think if you are interested in doing some simple experiments to get a better real world understanding of physics principles with a light workload then yes! I (like many other people) took it because of a requirement but it was a pretty decent class.",
                "Its fine.",
                "I would recommend it. I enjoyed it.",
                "I think mostly people take this lab because they're required to. With that said, it's really well-organized and some of the experiments are actually a little interesting. It can be a bit boring, but the workload is very light, just 1 one-page report per week.",
                "Yes - its required if youre in a science major but one of the more fun of required pre-Ned and engineering courses.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone, and if you are taking physics 170 or 180 this is a good addition in terms of better understanding the material. The TFs are all super sweet and make this course enjoyable. You also often get to work with a partner which makes working during a long lab more enjoyable."
