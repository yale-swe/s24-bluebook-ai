                "Great way to get credit for independent research but the end of term report seemed unnecessarily long. Writing 12-15 pages about one semester of work is difficult.",
                "Strengths: Very flexible and lenient. Since most experiments take at least 10 hours of a weekly time commitment, it is easy to meet the threshold for doing research 10-12 hours a week. There's also just a final paper we have to submit and a research proposal, so it is not that much of a workload (aside from conducting research in lab). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is P/F, and that doesn't really help the students much. There were no workshops where we learned how to keep a lab notebook, write a research journal etc. Honestly, the professors weren't really involved that much and so most of the responsibility fell on yourself and your lab mentor.",
                "This course really depends on the lab you are working in and I was luck to be with a lab mentor that was dedicated to mentoring me and teaching me the research methodologies as well general research practices for working in a lab",
                "It was a really cool opportunity to work in the lab I had wanted to work in last summer when COVID made that impossible. I learned methods of obtaining purified RNA and conducting my own experiments. I read research papers and worked with my mentor on developing research ideas. I had to work in my lab 10-12 hours per week, which was a lot of time for only getting one credit. It is 2x as much time as any class at Yale and we don't get as much credit, which I think is unfair.",
                "I think writing the proposal at the beginning of the semester and the research report at the end of the semester were extremely helpful for thinking in advance and consolidating results."

                "Not really. Unless this class is for a grade, I would recommend that you talk to your PI and get paid for your lab research or apply to a fellowship to conduct research in the school semester. It's not worth it to work in lab for a credit (especially when it's just P/F)",
