                "Sam is very understanding and generous, and his energy is great. You learn a lot. However, the grading structure is very strange. more than half of your grade come in the last few weeks of classes with a presentation, a paper, and a final exam. This class would be much better if the weekly submissions are worth more.",
                "Great course overall, professor was very engaged and friendly",
                "Strengths: Having weekly reading responses was great. The format of synchronous classes kept me engaged since half the class period was dedicated to lecture and half was dedicated to discussion. I enjoyed having that separation in every class. Not many standout strengthshuman skill learning is a standard but engaging psychology seminar. It was well organized for online learning for sure.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Since lecture time was only half the class period, it felt very rushed at times and it seemed like we were trying to fit too much material into a short period. We also talked in class about how the workload was heavily skewed towards the end of the semester, which wasn't a problem for me but could be a con for other schedules.",
                "Strengths: Papers and material in general are really interesting, manageable workload, Sam is a really good discussion leader and always available to help\/chat.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lectures felt a tad rushed, which made it occasionally challenging to follow exactly what was happening. Got better as the semester went on, though."

I wouldn't expect to be completely mind-blown or to develop a new world-view from this course, but it is a standard psychology seminar class. If you've taken the human brain, some of the neuroscience concepts we go over in class may be review. workload is also very manageable so would consider adding as 5th class.",
