   "comments": [
    "I learned about the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and the repercussions of those troubles which still affect youths today. I also learned about theories of civil conflict - how and why they occur and are sustained",
    "I gained a lot of insight into why different types of civil conflict and political violence occur, different theories for individual and group participation in such violence, legacies of conflict, and institutions for post-conflict peacebuilding and reconciliation. I learned about broad theories around civil conflict while specifically examining them in context of the conflict in Northern Ireland.",
    "Learned about Northern Ireland, different theories behind why conflicts start, last, and end, foreign actors and conflict, paramilitaries and the police, incorporating a lot of interviews \/ guest speakers mostly from Northern Ireland.",
    "I learned a great deal about the conflict in Northern Ireland through Professor Weir's expertise.  I also expanded on my knowledge of themes in political science and had an opportunity to apply these insights to my own choice of study."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: interesting readings and great in class discussions. I really like how we skype with guest speakers who have had hands on experience with the issues we are studying\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: we didnt receive a lot of our grades on assignments, and sometimes they would be assigned later than youd expect so its easy to miss one.",
    "The speakers were fascinating and provided us with incredible insight!",
    "I enjoyed the breadth of topics related to civil conflict covered in the course and having each week survey a variety of literature on a specific theme. Even though covering so many topics can sometimes feel disjointed, I appreciated that we focused on the conflict in Northern Ireland as a constant throughline in the course because I felt like that made the content feel more digestible and cohesive. I also really liked having the speakers, in particular those with direct experience with paramilitary activity, and thought that they provided a really great bridge between political theory and lived experiences. However, I wish we had fewer speakers because I oftentimes felt like we didn't have enough time to fully discuss the readings and found the student-led discussions very productive. I also wish that we had more context about the conflict in Northern Ireland earlier in the course because I felt like sometimes I had severe knowledge gaps and was grasping to learn more about the conflict as I was trying to apply different political theories to it.",
    "Professor Weir is phenomenal and knows (it seems) literally everyone in Northern Ireland, which was really useful for applying and putting a human face to the papers and theories that we were learning. Normally I don't like having as many guest speakers as we did in our class, but it worked just because Prof. Weir chose them really well - we heard from unionists, nationalists, academics, negotiators, working class people etc. so the variety of testimonials lent itself really well to comparison.",
    "I thought the greatest strength of this course was in-class discussion, I think it covered a wide variety of challenging topics well and in appropriate depth for me to feel I genuinely gained a better and more holistic appreciation for the study of civil conflict. The biggest weakness however was, in my opinion, an over reliance on guest speakers. While I certainly don't discount the expertise and value these individuals contributed, the frequency with which we heard from people, combined with the fact that these speakers typically consumed 1\/2 to 2\/3rds of the class time answering individual questions from students meant that the actual potential to engage in substantive discussion or drill down into particular topics. This left me feeling like the most enjoyable part of the class, discussion of the readings, was sacrificed simply to fit in more guest speakers.",
    "One of the major strengths was the breadth of incredibly interesting speakers that ranged from those involved in the Troubles to those who worked towards its resolution.  Both a strength and a weakness would be the course's focus on Northern Ireland, as it gives an in depth examination of a single instance.  The readings often addressed other conflicts, but it is important to note for prospective students that the course is centered around the conflict in Northern Ireland.  One weakness might also be that the expectations for many of the assignments are not well specified."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, she is immensely knowledgeable about the topic and certainly gives her best to break down the complexity of the topics in the most real and simple way possible.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in Northern Ireland, because we do end up discussing Northern Ireland a lot",
    "I absolutely would. The topic itself is very interesting and Professor Weir made it engaging and thought-provoking.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course if you're interested in learning more about civil conflict, specifically the conflict in Northern Ireland, having some really great speakers, and engaging in some interesting discussions about political violence and reconciliation.",
    "Yes! I learned a TON about political violence and Northern Ireland, which I recognize as one of the strangest and saddest places in the world.",
    "No. The course title is deceiving. Instead of learning about most of the civil conflicts going on in the world, we focused only on Northern Ireland. There were a handful of readings on outside conflicts, but we barely discussed them. All of our guest speakers were from Northern Ireland- NOTHING outside. The professor barely paid attention to us. She was late to most classes, and would often schedule in such an inefficient manner that our presentations (which were a large portion of our grade) would only last 5-10 minutes. Dont take it unless you want to be underwhelmed.",
    "Yes, it provided an interesting and in depth view into the roots, events, and aftermath of conflict, specifically in Northern Ireland.  It's an interesting and relatively low key seminar that helps you engage with the material and understand the realities and real affects of conflict by speaking with those who have experienced it."
