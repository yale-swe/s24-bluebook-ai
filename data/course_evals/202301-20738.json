More than learning how to edit, how to use a camera, etc. I learned about the film industry and, at a high level, how to create a documentary (e.g. ask interview questions, film and editing work stream, etc.) the insight from the Professor as a director was awesome and gave me significant insight into the field. More than learning how to create a documentary at the detailed level, this class in my opinion is more fit for the aspiring director/producer.",
                "I learned many aspects about how to create a documentary, from conception to execution.",
                "Learned the processes of video production specifically for documentary film making. Also on how to not only talk and reference it but also how to practice the skills talked about.",

                "The biggest weakness of the class is the classroom and the length of the class. 4 hours in a windowless room is a long time. \r\n\r\nProfessor Fisher was great and able to add her personal experience making documentary films to the class.",
                "In addition to high level information about the subject, learning more about how to film and edit more, especially given that class times are long, would be helpful.",
                "I think it was nicely structured but there was zero need for it to be a 4 hour block. We couldve just had more productive sessions in 2 hours even. By the time we passed two hours everyone was over it and feedback and discussion became stale.",
                "It was strong in the ways we had guest speakers and different classes dedicated to specific areas of documentary making.",
                "Strength:\r\n- the projects (especially the final film) take a lot of time but they are really rewarding. It feels good to do something creative and share it with your classmates\r\n- Professor Fisher is a successful filmmaker and she also brings in guests who are experts (e.g. a director and an editor) so you get a lot of exposure to the actual industry\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I wish the breadth of documentaries we talked about and watched was larger -- we mainly watched social/historical films. It would have been cool to watch a travel or culture documentary, for example.\r\n\r\n- I wish we hadn't been assigned QCQ (question, comment, quote) homeowork while we were also completing our final projects. It wasn't bad at all though.",
                "I think this course was really strong in applying theory and applying technical craft to an actual result, as well as connecting that result to an idea of what documentary film is supposed to achieve."
