                "Strengths: very kind professor, interesting topics. professor weaved in videos here and there which were interesting to watch and kept people engaged\r\nWeaknesses: 70% of your grade dependent on exam performance HUGE amount of memorization required for the exams. We had to memorize a lot of studies (methods and findings) which can become redundant. Engagement was generally not high throughout the course, so studying for the exams took a lot of effort. we only had 2 reading responses per exam, instead, I think at least one per week should be assigned (rather than 2/semester) to increase course engagement. Exams were very memorization-heavy and not very application-based I feel courses should have a greater emphasis on application rather than pure memorization generally. I would increase the amount of assignments throughout the semester generally and place a lower stake on exams to actually facilitate student learning and synthesis (rather than encourage cramming of content that will be forgotten).",
                "Strengths: material and lecture organization, Steph is an awesome lecturer, content was interesting. No real weaknesses, only suggestion is shifting the weights of the grading so that it's not as heavily skewed towards exams, as the bulk of our grade is based off of 2 exams and a paper.",
                "I think that the balance of depth and breadth is well struck. Additionally, the structure of the course makes a lot of sense and facilitates student learning and applying the various units to a larger picture.",
                "Strengths: Lazzaro is a really nice professor, some of the topics are interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A LOT of information is crammed into each lecture, the professor is talking so fast it sounds like she's on 2x speed, which makes it hard to digest during the lecture. Exams are very memorization heavy and pretty hard unless you are really good at memorizing every study and every brain region associated with every study. TAs were a bit nitpicky about the reading responses but they were overall fine. You also only have to do 4 over the semester and you can choose which ones, which is nice. Having the \"second midterm\" (aka final exam) and then a final paper is a bit annoying",
                "Class was a classic lecture format so not a lot of engagement during class until quizzes at the end. I think the quiz questions were a fair assessment of the content covered in class but I did not appreciate them being right at the end. Sometimes classes were a little disorganized / hard to follow the main points, especially without text on the slides, so an immediate assessment felt a little unfair since I had no time to process the information.\r\n\r\nThe grading was fair and assignments were reasonable. I appreciated the agency in deciding when to turn in reading responses.\r\n\r\nI think Prof Lazzaro is a great professor, super engaging and very knowledgeable. The primary weakness of the course is that it was her first time teaching it so the lectures felt a little disorganized at times.",
                "The syllabus was very organized with the topic of the lecture and assigned readings. There were only 4 readings responses throughout the semester, and the exams were not that bad if you paid attention in class and studied for them. The paper at the end of the course seemed a little disorganized and unnecessary. The lectures were also jam packed with information, so it sometimes felt like there was too much to process.",
                "Strengths: Steph provides great summary slides throughout the lecture to help students focus on key points and provides for a lot of flexiblity and choice in the reading responses and project to help students focus on their areas of interest\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is a LOT of content covered that sometimes feels rushed through. It would be more helpful to go over similar studies and ideas within a topic rather than trying to cover many topics and only partially covering them all",
                "Great content and instructor. A few of the slides could be a bit more easy to understand later, while studying. I liked how detailed the course was. I felt ike it gave us a great framework.",
                "Great class, well run, well instructed. I know that the Professor was considering not teaching again but I would highly recommend that she does!\r\nweakness - this was the first time it was taught, so at times it felt like there was an overload of information.",
                "Very communicative",
                "There is no main course textbook, this can be an issue as there is no central hub or framework to go to to reinforce learned information from lectures. At least there were scientific review and research readings that helped back up learned information.",
                "I thought it was structured well and adapted as the semester went on to better accommodate students, which was great.",
                "Awesome course overall! Stephanie is a great, energetic lecturer, and there were no surprises in terms of exam content and grading",
                "The class is huge so there was less discussion and more of just Stephanie presenting material for the whole semester, but as a lecture class, it was one of the most engaging Ive taken",
                "strengths: content. weakness: too many assignments (essays + exams + reading responses+ quizzes :( )",
                "strength: \r\n- an interesting course about social neuroscience \r\n- professor was good at explaining the studies and answering student's questions\r\n- I thought that the final essay was a good integration of the skills & content that we had discussed all semester, applied to the real-world scenario of social media\r\n\r\nweakness: \r\n- I think that too many studies were covered in each lecture. This made studying for the exams a very bizarre task of memorization of the gist of 50+ social neuroscience studies. I think that a more focused, in-depth discussion of a smaller number of studies would have made it easier to consolidate the information presented in this class and make studying both a more cohesive and more satisfying exercise.",
                "Strengths: Steph (one of the best professors I've had), readings that were relevant to course content, adaptability of course structure (changing quiz format and reading response requirements), wide-ranging and rich content, guest lectures \r\nWeaknesses: inclusion of 10-page paper in addition to exam the week before - the paper topic was fun, but doing it felt like a burden after studying for the test the week before and doing all my other finals at the same time",
                "The lecture slides were very detailed and that helped when studying. The lectures in class were often packed with too much information to completely understand everything, and it felt like we were rushing at the end to finish. Upon studying, this information became more clear. The guest lectures were very interesting. The reading responses were initially graded very harshly but that got better as the semester went on.",
                "It was a great course. Lecture slides were extremely well-made and informative, and lectures were very well-given. Professor Lazzaro  is a great lecturer and professor. Assignments were clear and interesting, and I feel like we covered a lot of material in this course.",
                "The strengths are the great professor and content. Professor Stephanie Lazzaro did an amazing job teaching this new class, and I really enjoyed her passionate explanations when covering questions that had answers related to curious/interesting tidbits that were not directly going to be on the exam. Those were, unexpectedly, a great fun fact section of the class that was really satisfying to learn about. I appreciate the willingness to answer every small question that we had about topics that may have not seemed important or directly related to understanding the lecture material. The three guest lecturers were also great inclusions to the course.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses are the exam and reading response requirements/ratios. I believe they deterred my learning in this class because I was unnecessarily stressed by the amount of work expected which is different from a typical biology (MCDB) or chemistry class. The timing of the final exam and final paper did not reflect the amount of learning, interest, and passion that I had for this topic because I was forced to prioritize one over the other. This can be improved by changing the due dates and time allotted for each item, ensuring we had an adequate and equal amount of time to work on each like having clear assignment instructions beforehand in the case of the final paper (more than seven days before the final paper was due).",
                "Amazing professor and TFs, interesting content, and fun final essay.",
                "A strength of this course is that Stephanie is a fantastic professor and lecturer, who really cares about students genuinely understanding the lecture material. If a point is unclear, she will immediately reexplain the concept (often in a different way) to ensure we understand. A weakness of the course is that the exams are much more detail-oriented than expected, and require extensive studying of mot just the lecture material, but also the readings. I found that one of the more difficult aspects of the exams was naming the specific brain areas implicated in a particular study, so it may be helpful to have a sheet that organizes the studies by relevant brain area. This is because I find that studies implicating the same brain region are often spread across multiple lectures, and thus students who study by going through lectures in chronological order may have a harder time with brain areas.",
                "I think Professor Lazzaro did an excellent job of providing structured lectures.",
                "The strength of the class was that the material was very engaging and interesting, and Professor Lazzaro was very available and responsive to questions and feedback. I also really liked the reading responses and the paper assignment which really encouraged students to go deep into the readings and other papers to understand the concepts themselves. \r\n\r\nHowever, I think the class moved a bit too fast with the material which made it hard to review for the exams. The exams also had very specific questions which required a high level of memorization which does not seem very useful for the future. Instead, I think some of the basic concepts could have been extracted or there could be more discussion based questions."

                "Yes! Its extremely well-taught and the lecture slides make it easy for you to go back and review. Professor Lazzaro is always happy to answer any questions you may have. The material is interesting and important to know if youre interested in psychology or neuroscience (and great to know even if not!) I went into this course as a psychology major without any real neuroscience background (I hadnt taken PSYC 160) and was able to keep up- be prepared to learn some brain anatomy and function! It was great to finally do that.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this class because the content is exactly what you would expect in a social neuroscience class. Plus, the professor and TAs are helpful and dedicated to a great teaching environment. They are open to questions and to clear up any confusion you may have.",
                "1000%, especially if they are psych/neuro/cog sci. Learning about human social behavior in other courses is interesting, but it is also very important to learn about the deeper neural mechanisms that are causing these behaviors. Also Steph is amazing and so sweet.",
