I feel as if I have all of these grammar rules floating in my head now, and currently it's up to me to instantiate them through habit by continuing to speak and write.",
                "I gained a deeper understanding of Spanish grammatical structures that I was already familiar with, while also learning a bunch of new ones. I strengthened my ability to express myself in the past tense.",
                "Through this course, I developed a deep and nuanced understanding of Spanish grammar, particularly in the context of writing and reading. My Spanish language fluency in these two areas. improved greatly during this course."

                "Strengths are that there are many opportunities to practice specific grammar concepts. Even if you don't get it on the first assignment, between the readings, textbook assignments, tarea calificadas, and preparacin escritas, it will eventually stick. If you are still stuck, Sra. Seymour offers office hours, which were helpful to clear up any lingering issues. Weaknesses were just the high workload. Not all of the tasks were particularly helpful in strengthening my skills, and I think I would eliminate the cultural conversations.",
                "This course is extremely challenging, both due to the pace of the content and the immense workload. However, Terry is an incredible and efficient instructor. In order to be successful, you have to make good use of Terry's office hours, do all of the readings as soon as they're assigned (including taking notes), and dedicate at least 2 hours three times a week to homework (not including exam preparation). Notwithstanding the workload, one of the strengths of the course is that, because there are so many assignments, each individual task does not factor too heavily into one's grade. There are also many opportunities to practice without being evaluated on correctness. I deeply appreciated Terry's feedback on these assignments. All in all, if the workload is not reduced, I suggest that this course be worth 1.5 credits rather than 1, especially because it meets three times a week (which is more than other L5 classes). \r\n\r\nOne important aspect of this course that was inaccessible to me as a low-income student was its cost. The online textbook, Supersite  which is required to complete around 5 - 15 online assignments each week costs about $250. In addition, during the first 5 weeks of the course, students must pay $60 to take 5 online conversational practice sessions with a native speaker. Although I valued these resources and found them to be pivotal to my learning, they are extremely expensive, and their costs are not covered by Safety Net. Yale College must must make an effort to cover the costs of these materials, or they should be replaced with more affordable resources.",
                "Falling behind in this course is dangerous. There is so much, all the time. The work itself isn't ecessarily hard, but it can be tedious (supersite). Especially when you have to do a LinguaMeeting every week."

                "If you were shunted into L5 Spanish by virtue of a questionable 5 on your Spanish AP test taken ages ago (as I was), this course might be a necessary evil to fill in grammatical gaps from high school. But if that isn't the case, then beware. This course has an obscenely, and I would ague unnecessarily high, workload. It sucks the joy out of Spanish class when you had only slept for four hours the night before (ok, part of that falls on my shoulders) because you had to, for single class's worth of homework, watch a movie, perform essay revisions, work on graded worksheets, etc. and then rinse and repeat three times a week. My evaluation would have likely been positive if the workload was slashed in half; and the unique thing is that I don't think it would have detracted very much, if at all, from my learning experience.",
                "If you want to develop your academic Spanish skills, especially in writing, I highly recommend this course. Though it is a heavy workload, it is worth it if you want to improve your Spanish skills. I am excited to use all of the skills that I have learned throughout this course in the future.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is dedicated to improving their Spanish fluency in reading and writing. This is an essential course for any non-native speakers looking to use their Spanish in a professional setting. Although there are opportunities to practice your speaking skills throughout the course (such as during each class), they are less frequent and (thankfully) not assessed. \r\n\r\nIf you don't do any extracurriculars, or don't have a part-time job, then it's alright to take this course with a credit-load of 5 or more. However, if you are involved in any outside time commitments, save this course for a semester when you know your workload will be more manageable. I have three part-time jobs and took this course alongside 4 others, and it was extremely challenging to manage among my other time commitments. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there was not much culture taught in this course, but this is expected of a course for which the focus is grammar. However, the readings were very interesting! I really enjoyed the combination of contemporary fiction, historical reports, and older literature."
