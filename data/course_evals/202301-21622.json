                "I think the strength of the class really comes out when your class is able to bond on a more personal level.",
                "Strengths: Matt and Estrella were a great teaching team. They really care about the students and want to get to know them beyond the classroom, which was nice. They did a good job facilitating discussions. Workload was manageable too. The retreat was a fun and meaningful, and I think the class grew close as a result. I liked the final paper and being able to read everyone else's final papers about our own visions of a life worth living. Weaknesses: I didn't always feel like we got to the crux of what different traditions identify as core tenets in their good life, and as a result it felt like a religious studies class at times. Grading was unnecessarily harsh. It was hard to stay engaged because the readings weren't the most captivating. Plenary was not super interesting or necessary either.",
                "I think it is in general a good class if you are in the right mindset to take it. As a graduating senior, being preoccupied with day-to-day struggles like looking for a job made it harder to engage with the higher-level takeaways from the course. The readings strike a good balance of being accessible while also giving the topics at hand proper coverage and discussion. I really, really enjoyed the opportunity to peer-review the final papers - part of me wishes that all of the papers followed the same peer review structure. I don't know if I got as much out of the plenary speakers - sometimes they felt somewhat disorganized and disconnected from the topics we covered during class.",
                "Literature was very interesting, but also very dense. I felt the amount of reading we were assigned did not match the depth of analysis in class.",

                "I'd recommend this course with some reservations. I would recommend the section with Matt and Estrella because they are great. Matt is also the course director so he knows what he's doing. This was one of the few classes where I felt close with the other students --- starting with sharing our experiences on retreat, people were really invested in the course and that made my experience a lot better. With regards to the curriculum, some units felt disjointed and like they did not relate to a life worth living. The grading was super tough for no apparent reason, too. I liked the three paper topics, but I felt that, since the grading was so harsh, I was writing the papers not as I would actually write them, but how Matt and Estrella would want them. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the semester.",
