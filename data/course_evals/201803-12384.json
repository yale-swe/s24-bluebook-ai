   "comments": [
    "The central distinction that Dr. T will expound upon throughout the course is the distinction between veracity and verisimilitude i.e. what exactly you should be looking for in travel accounts, and how to look at different texts through the lens of generic conventions. Going into this class, I had no idea how literary it was going to be, but beyond the first few weeks of historical context the vast majority of the course is about textual analysis. There are too many insights for me to list, however I must say that this course has not only changed my perspective on the medieval era and the meaning of travel, but how one reads any given document. As Dr. T is a first-rate medievalist, you are also able to glean a lot of interesting knowledge about how experts analyze manuscripts and draw conclusions from damaged text.",
    "I learned about different perspectives on travel writing throughout the ages.",
    "Learned a ton about travel writers I had never heard of before. Also learned a bunch of facts from a wide variety of class discussions.",
    "I learned how to read Medieval travel narratives effectively, namely how to understand the language and narrative structures. Additionally, due to the number of Arab travelers, I learned a lot about Medieval Arabia, which is often overlooked in traditional western curricula. I furthered my analytical skills trying to determine the purpose and biases of the writers as well as my writing skills through our response papers. Also, with the option to do creative responses, I was able to think about my coursework in a unique way compared to just written responses.",
    "Learning about the genre of Medieval Travel Literature, and the history\/customs\/world of the medieval middle east and europe.",
    "You read lots of translations of primary-source travel accounts from the middle east and Europe, which are super valuable in understanding how people of the medieval world understood their place in it and their perceptions of distant lands.",
    "This class made me familiar with medieval literature and ideas about travel and exploration in that era. It was less about the history of travel and modes of travel.",
    "I got a deep understanding about the motivations and explorations of medieval travellers, and I was able to become a much stronger writer in the prose of the authors that we read from."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the class are innumerable, however perhaps the greatest is the personality of Dr. Shawkat Toorawa himself. It is difficult for me to fully describe how awesome of a human being he is.\r\nThe critical weakness is that sometimes discussions would veer widely off topic, especially if few people did the reading. \r\n\r\nHowever, let it be known that the strengths dwarf the weakness in the same way that the Mongol Empire dwarfed the city-state of Venice.",
    "I would not have any critiques for this class. The only disappointing part of this course was the schedules of the students not matching well enough to go on a serious excursion.",
    "I wish that the reading was more focused (i.e. read chosen sections of a book rather than the whole book) so that our class conversations were more engaging. Dr. T is a gem.",
    "I think the course is structured and paced well.",
    "The strengths of this class were the engaging discussions and interesting topics. I was always excited to go to class and discuss our readings. Also, the discussions were allowed to shift to other related topics as well, giving room for further expansion of our ideas. This made for a very collaborative and relaxed setting where everyone was challenged to think inquisitively. The only weakness of this course was a sometimes too heavy reading load; this made it hard to finish or read thoroughly enough, making it difficult to discuss effectively in class.",
    "Strengths- the professor was incredibly knowledgeable and had shockingly-insightful responses to everything, the books we read were varied enough to stay interesting\r\nWeakness- Too much reading",
    "The class is a very open and free exploration of the themes of the course. It allowed for the seminar group to explore what we were curious about which was great. This form made the class very unique. I cant think of any changes that should be made.",
    "I truthfully do not think this course could be improved, Professor Toorawa is the best teacher I have ever had. He was constantly able to engage all of us, and I was always enthralled by every class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes absolutely. If you invest seriously in the course you will get a new perspective on how to read in general.",
    "This was a wonderful course! Its though provoking and explores a fascinating range of travel narratives. Even if this course is far from your majors focus, it would be beneficial to take and it is a break from the styles of other classes.",
    "Yes, I really enjoyed the seminar style of this course and Dr. T is an amazing teacher and cares about his students.",
    "Yes, I took this class and loved it. The professor is great.",
    "Yes Ive recommended it to several classmates. Ive also recommended the take a class taught by Professor Toorawa",
    "I would almost unconditionally recommend this course to another student. As long as they were somewhat interested in reading travel narratives and wanted a seminar discussion-based class, I think they would be very pleased with Medieval Travel with Professor Toorwawa. As long as they were prepared for some long readings, the discussions and fun environment are more than worth it.",
    "Yes! One of the classes that prove the idea of a liberal arts education, because it makes you think in a very abstract and analytical way.",
    "YES. Professor Toorawa is fantastic-- he is knowledgeable about the material and is such a great personality. Class was fun every seminar, a great balance between academic discussion of the texts and interesting tangents.",
    "Yes. This class was extremely fun and well worth it. Even if you are not interested in studying the subject long-term its a great experience.",
    "Yes. The content and the professor are both fantastic."
