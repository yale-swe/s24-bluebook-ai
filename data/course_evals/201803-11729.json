    "I thought the research journal was going to be a huge chafe but turns out it didn't take too long and was a great way to condense your previous knowledge about your research interest. Also gives you a reason to interact more with the PI so overall the course structure is pretty good",
    "Great",
    "The good thing about it is that you have a ton of freedom since you are basically just working in your own lab. It's not a traditional class in the sense that you don't interact with other students, but I would consider that one of the strengths of the class.",
    "I really feel like I spent much more than 20 hours a week in lab and wish the credits reflected that.",
    "There is a lot of freedom in how you budget your time and what you choose to do and when. It was hard to make a huge impact in the 10-12 hours per week, but it was still fulfilling."

    "Yup, I definitely would recommend to this someone else! It's super chill and as long as you're comfortable in the the particular lab you choose, everything is really fun",
    "Do it if you're doing research anyways during the semester.",
    "It is definitely a lot of time and hours. I dont spend 10-12 hours per week on any other course, so this definitely took up a lot of time but if you are doing worthwhile work then it is worth it."
