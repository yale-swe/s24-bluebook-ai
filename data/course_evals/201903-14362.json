   "comments": [
    "I think the course balanced depth and breadth very well as the lectures both built off of one another, but also covered new material regularly.\r\n\r\nI think the course could have implemented more casual roundtable discussion among students rather than just formal presentations.",
    "The course is a seminar, but is taught like a lecture. Student engagement is encouraged, but students oftentimes don't understand how exactly to engage.",
    "This course was interesting and the workload was manageable. We got to write our papers on topics of our choosing -- so this was super engaging and interesting.\r\nIt was really more a lecture than a seminar, which was fine because Professor Sergeyev has so many amazing life experiences that directly apply to the course.",
    "The class is a good overview of concepts in global governance. At times the slides can be confusing and wordy, it is best to just listen to lecture rather than reading the content after the fact.",
    "One strength of this course was how open-ended the papers were, which made it really easy to find a topic you were personally interested in. One weakness was that at times the class was poorly organized and not really conducive to discussions."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I think this course provides students with a lot of freedom to hone in on a specific aspect of global affairs and direct deep research in the direction of their choosing.",
    "Yes. The professor is very knowledgeable about Global Governance and provides astounding feedback.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in global governance and how countries should approach global issues! I learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student that is able to remain involved and engaged in seminar style discussion. This class is only as enjoyable as the students make it. If you ask questions and speak, you will do well and the 2 and a half hour meetings will go by shortly. But, if you are not engaged the lectures can last forever. Likewise, the grading schemes and due dates for the papers are not well articulated by Prof. Sergeyev. It is best to remain in contact with him and ask questions if you want to understand the assignments.",
    "Yes, especially if you're interested in the UN, international law, and the main challenges facing the world",
    "Yes! Prof is extremely knowledgeable, no busy work, learned a lot from presentations and research papers assigned."
