                "I think I learned how to connect my experiences in k12 education with broader ideas and systems. For example, rather than just questioning why my school had metal detectors at the doors and so many of my Yale peers home schools did not, I was able to point to specific systems of policing in schools.",
                "I took this course to explore my educational journey, but came out with a greater understanding of American education and educational theory as a whole. \r\n\r\nOne of my greatest takeaways is understanding the ways in which American education has not been designed for non-male, none-white individuals. As a woman and someone from a rural area, I have found it useful to know what strings are being pulled for others and not for me. Conversely, especially when talking about rural development, I learned how my background can be an asset to my academic\/professional development.  I think everyone should take some variation of this course, especially as many students at Yale were actively engaged in their school communities through extracurriculars and classes. School was\/is an especially crucial point of our development and understanding it would be beneficial for all.",
                "I am extremely glad I chose to enroll in this class and pursue education studies. Education studies is an extremely important subject area that is far too often overlooked at Yale. I really appreciated the wide variety of subjects relating to education policy that we explored in this class. I learned a lot about how schooling functions as a sorting machine, philosophies of the purpose of education, the impact of the school choice movement, and the imperative for further school desegregation (on a school, classroom, and track basis).",
                "I learned so much about education history in the United States, reform, different methods of teaching, etc. I was able to apply what I learned in class to my previous experience in different schooling systems. I feel like a developed a sense for detecting and analyzing schooling systems now. I feel more aware of how different systems operate and how privileged I am to be at Yale today.",
                "Some highlights of what I learned in this course: the purpose of education, educational policy, the landscape of education in New Haven, the role teachers play in education, and alternative education. By participating in the classroom observation, I also gained insight into what a New Haven public school classroom looks like and how to be a respectful observer as a Yale student.",
                "learned lots about education systems and barriers in education opportunities",
                "I learned a breadth of topics on how interdisciplinary studies of education are -- psychology, politics, erm, etc.",
                "I learned about the history of the education system in the United States through a lens that isnt usually used when learning about any type of US history. I learned about the overall structure of the system and where the control is, and I also learned about different types of schooling which I thought was really interesting!",
                "I learned a lot about the background of education in this course. I really enjoyed listening to other students' takes, especially when they came from different areas and school types than I did. It was a survey course that did very well to still be enlightening and actively want you to learn more.",
                "Key issues and features in the US education system, from teaching to policy and history.",
                "I learned about the structure of education in the U.S. through topics that felt relevant and pressing.",
                "I think this course put into specific words and backed up with data a lot of broad issues with the education system (ex. Campbells law)",
                "I learned more about the landscape of education in the US, particularly the sociology side of the topic.",
                "I learned about the ins and outs of the education landscape in the U.S., with special attention given to inequities and areas of improvement.",
                "Broad survey of education studies. Covered about every topic related to education that I could imagine, but didn't delve deep into any particular topic.",
                "I learned a great deal of American history in education and issues in education that are being discussed today. I learned how to engage with material in a receptive and critical way.",
                "Deeper understanding of the dynamics surrounding American education.",
                "The most important thing I learned was how to look critically at my own educational background and consider the ways in which I got to Yale based on my \"merit\" or based on the opportunities that were afforded to me growing up. I grappled with this question all semester, especially in my discussion section, where at the end of each session we all left a little conflicted about the state of higher education and our place within it, but also energized to tackle the problems we face head-on. Of course, I learned a lot about educational theory and pedagogy, but I most appreciate the chance for introspection.",
                "This course offered my first opportunity to actually think about my education and the mindset I have about the whole idea. Growing up in the same schooling district for the last ten years of my life, I started just accepting my learning conditions and community norms without much thought. This course taught me not only how to critique the systems I have been through, but also articulate these ideas in discussion with peers of very different backgrounds. Being able to hear about what other students have gone through during their academic experience has given me multiple lenses into different classrooms across the world. As silly as it seems, I did not realize that the only classrooms and learning experiences you know about are your own. Something as universal as education looks so vastly different as close as a few districts away. The emphasized control that local governments have to shape education makes the process of standardizing it very challenging and problematic. I was ultimately left with a better understanding of how complex the topic of pedagogy is.",
                "I gained a good understanding of how the education system in America works and current political issues in the field of education here.",
                "I learned many different perspectives. Our education system in America differs for every person, and it was good to learn of some of these differences.",
                "I gained experience observing a high school classroom and a general knowledge of American education systems.",
                "A survey of key topics and debates in the modern education landscape, how to conduct education observations and literature reviews.",
                "Basic information about a broad range of education topics and theories.",
                "I learned about so many views on education, which were really interesting to me because I would love to be a teacher.",
                "I learned a lot about the education system, and I got better at having discussions and writing lit reviews.",
                "I got a good overview of different education topics, and I learned different types of academic pieces!",
                "Understanding of the principles of education research, policy, teaching and pedagogy, and a general surface-level introduction to the field of education.",
                "Through this course, I was provided with countless opportunities to challenge my understanding of the multifaceted world of education. In addition to gaining fundamental knowledge about the history of education, the competing roles of education, international education, education policy, and the changing landscape of education, I also learned how to write a literature review and conduct classroom observation research.",
                "Learned how to do classroom observation and literature review.",
                "I learned a lot about education history in the US and how education systems work in different parts of the world like Singapore and Finland. The class really offers a broad overview of the education field.",
                "I learned about the history and sociology of the education system and pedagogy. It's a survey class so it doesn't go very deep into any particular topic but it covers a pretty broad range.",
                "I gained knowledge about the history of public education in the US as well as the evolution of education policy. We also touched on many common and some more forward-thinking methods of pedagogy.",
                "When thinking about how much Ive learned over the course of this semester, its amazing to consider that now, as the semester concludes, I feel like I have a much better understanding of how education works in the US, and abroad. I really knew very little about education when I first walked into this class, and now, I feel that I have gained a certain level of literacy in the world of education. Ive been able to participate in education-related discussions with my friends who are not taking this course, and thats been awesome. Whenever Ive told an advisor or friend that Im taking an education studies class, they always want to hear all about it. So much of what weve learned is relevant to the present day, and that has made this course all the more engaging. One of the main skills that I learned in this class came from the literature review assignment. Learning how to sift through a large amount of information and data was a daunting task at first, but now I know that Im capable of doing it!",
                "EDST110 being a survey course, I learned many, many things related to the study of education: the history of American schooling, what makes a \"good\" teacher, how the modern grading system was designed and by who, means of standardized testing and accountability, the roots of school funding disparities, the histories of American desegregation and integration, racial equity in schools, alternative modes of education, and a little on the international state of education. Some skills I gained related to observing the classroom environment, writing and then later translating field notes, and conducting readings for a literature review.",
                "A general understanding of education as understood through an American perspective.",
                "I learned how to write research papers and about general issues in education.",

I also learned about my peer's views on education and many of the systems we had to go through to get to Yale.",

                "It sounds silly but I think a huge strength is simply the content of the course. It is all very fascinating to me, and I really appreciate how it is rooted in the experiences of students in this class (For example, when there are often call out questions asking, Can students from rural backgrounds share what their experiences with community were?. That was wonderful. I think this was my favorite course of this semester. No weaknesses come to mind.",
                "The strengths of this course are definitely the kind and understanding instructor (Dr. Debs), the relaxed pacing of the assignments (frontloaded before Thanksgiving to reduce stress), and the wide variety of topics explored. When enrolling, I did not realize how broad of a survey class this would be, which was both a strength and a weakness. I learned a lot about general ideas in education, however, I would have preferred to use discussion section time as a way of honing in more on particular topics rather than continuing to just broadly discuss the concepts covered in the lecture.",
                "strengths: great readings, great engagement, CLASSROOM OBSERVATION WAS SUCH A GREAT EXPERIENCE \r\nweaknesses: a large portion of the class was just covering the readings- which we already did so it seemed somewhat repetitive.",
                "Strengths: I appreciated how the main writing assignment was due before Thanksgiving break because this decreased by stress coming back from break when I had other finals to think about; the classroom observation assignment was very rewarding and insightful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some readings could have been left out of the syllabus because some didnt contribute significantly to my learning",
                "strength: professor debs is awesome, loved being around her, engaging lecturer\r\n\r\nweakness: none",
                "Strengths: the professor and TAs! They really do care about the students learning and enjoying the class and it shows. They never tried to overwhelm you with papers or deadlines and were always open to feedback.\r\nWeaknesses: I dont have many except there were A LOT of readings. I think some of them could be shortened.",
                "A weakness is of course its survey course nature, as well as the timed essay. I feel that the timed essay midterm does not accurately portray engagement with the class, so that particular assignment is a little odd to me. A strength is that it's very easy to engage in conversation with other members of the class, the topics lend themselves to discussion so there's not much awkward silence in section.",
                "Strengths: discussion sections, use of Canvas, clear expectations, professor and TF support, material selections\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing major -- sometimes wished lectures were longer\/covered more",
                "This class was just what I had hoped for as someone taking it for a social science credit-- it was thought provoking without being too much work. I think the biggest weakness (and this might have been my fault for entering the class with the wrong expectations) was that there was very little about pedagogy. It felt often like the class was presenting us with fundamental problems in the education system without any application of this knowledge to solving the problems, a frustration compounded by the fact that the format of the class\/lecture style was not engaging, which felt almost purposefully ironic.",
                "I think a strength was the way the course went over a lot of major topics in the educational field with just enough depth to consider many aspects of the topic.",
                "I like that a broad variety of topics were covered and that some of the readings were outside of traditional textbook readings and very interesting. A weakness was that the grading for this course was entirely based on writing assignments, which were graded based on writing quality and organization, including the midterm. We were not learning those skills in class time, so it felt like a hidden curriculum as we learned about in class, which advantaged students with strong writing backgrounds. I wish there were more creative projects, such as maybe leading a short activity during section or creating something, like a worksheet or something visual.",
                "Strengths: topics covered - there was a wide range of great topics this class delved into that made it really engaging",
                "Strengths - Great intro for anyone interested in ed studies. Weaknesses - collaborative class format does not mesh well with lecture format. It's really hard to have productive discussions in a lecture hall.",
                "- [Strengths] The literature review assignment was an excellent opportunity to explore a topic in education you are interested in. Personally, I gained a lot of skills from it. I was able to deeply engage with a topic I care about and learn how to present the material in a literature review fashion.\r\n- [Weaknesses] Throughout the course, we tackled issues related to marginalized communities and identity-based discrimination. This lead a lot of the conversation to be comforting to the White and privileged students, and simultaneously made all the non-White students be patient in learning about this topics. This also reflected in the peer feedback assignment: I was given a paper to read about discrimination and disadvantages a racial minoritized group faces which was written by a White student. This essay was strenuous to read because it had a lot of prejudicial arguments, but I had to read it for a grade and felt that as a student of color I had to assist their learning in order to do well in the class.",
                "This course covered a lot of ground in a short period of time, but Dr. Debs considered each topic through a critical lens and encouraged us to seek out further information for ourselves. I really like how this course walked the walk in many ways. For example, we learned a lot about the downsides of high-stakes testing and also about renewed pushes for \"deeper learning\" in the classroom. I think the course requirements reflect this commitment to deeper learning by having us engage thoughtfully with course content rather than making us cram for an exam. I got so much more out of the take-home midterm than I would have gotten from an in-person exam. I enjoyed looking back through the texts and thinking through the scenarios presented. It was stress-free and allowed me to think creatively. I also enjoyed the literature review for both the freedom it gave me and the opportunity to learn a new form of writing. Reviewing and presenting the literature on a topic is a practical skill that I will use going forward. I appreciated the checkpoints that Dr. Debs gave to help us keep track of our progress. Lastly, the classroom observation was a fantastic way to engage with New Haven Public Schools and connect it to topics in the course. It was fun, rewarding, and should definitely be part of the course moving forward. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness that I can think of is that my engagement dipped during the second half of the semester when I completed my required reading responses. I think it is a nice thing not to have one due every week, but I definitely would have done the readings more closely had they been required throughout the whole semester.",
                "Strengths: The discussion sessions were extraordinary. The passionate and respectful discussion comparing experiences leaves you with a new view on education and a glimpse into the lives of new friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The structure of the lectures cause it to be a less engaging environment. I believe this is because the sheer size of the lecture and the arrangement of the seats in the lecture hall make discussion difficult.",
                "The course does lightly touch on teaching pedagogies outside the states, but all of it is viewed through a very American perspective. I really loved the engagement and community aspects that the teaching staff and professor worked hard to create. It would have been great to cover more practical in-class pedagogies and maybe get a broader overview of different ways that education has been approached beyond the few mentioned in the first lecture.",
                "Strengths: easygoing class that doesn't place too much stress on students. Interesting assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not always engaging",
                "This course should firstly be renamed \"An introduction to American Education\" or something along those lines to more accurately name what this class is aboutthere were only a couple readings about international education and had a heavy focus on American education, which wasn't a weakness necessarily just requires more precise language in the title of the course. The strengths of this class was the readings. I thought the readings themselves were super informative and were the most insightful part of the class. I also found sections to be productive discussions around these readings as well as full of meaningful personal connections that my classmates brought to the conversationand was guided by my lovely TF. The lectures themselves were a let down. After getting super excited by the readings, the lectures either were slow recaps of what we read, or disconnected completely. I wish the lectures were a site of synthesis with the readings that allowed for new insights or deeper understanding. Also, I know this class is a social science class so it makes sense that the readings reflect that, but I wish there was more of an emphasis on personal experience like the Suina piece we read at the beginning of the year. In addition, I thought the assignments were a bit half-cooked. Whether it was the lit review that was a bit confusing since it never actual resulted in a final research paper or the observation paper which I wish was more in depthwhether that was getting to observe more regularly or a greater page requirement that allowed for a more in depth analysis. Finally, this class studied many educational practices and the class employed none of them which felt like a let downhow in an education studies class are we restricted to outdated instructional practices?",
                "Strengths: Really amazing job with the content and execution. I think this course was a great balance of breadth and depth. Dr. Debs also does a great job of creating a sense of community within EDST 110, even though it's a large lecture. Go to lunch office hours and ed studies tea!\r\nWeaknesses: This is super nitpicky because I genuinely am having trouble thinking of things but I think the method of taking attendance spontaneously by google form wasn't super effective (for Campbell's law reasons). Like I could see people sending the form to their friends who weren't there that day, and when I ran into friends who had missed lecture that day the first question would always be \"Did they take attendance today?\" not \"What did I miss?\" So I think it might be better to either have an exit slip every day or have TFs manually take attendance.",
                "Strengths: Professor Debs is a great instructor and the TA team is great. Grading and course policies were fair! And the topics were interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked to see a little bit more value placed on completing the readings. I also wish we had spent more time on rural education and race in education.",
                "I loved the class and the content was very interesting, but I wish it could have been a smaller class or had lectures recorded. I completely understand why they were not, but I was sick and very sad to miss classes and not be able to watch them virtually because Dr. Debs is a great lecturer.",
                "I really liked this course; I enjoyed the material and spent a lot of time talking about it outside of class. I wish we had spent a bit more time on the goals of education, I felt like that section was really important and I didn't have enough time to fully think through the ideas. \r\n\r\nI didn't start working on my lit review until very close to the deadline; and I think this was pretty typical. I wasn't sure if this was intentional as a way of teaching us to manage our own time and start things early, or if you actually expected us to stick closely to the schedule provided. If your intention is that we stick to the schedule, having us turn in things along the way, even if they aren't graded or looked at, would have helped me stay on schedule. \r\n\r\nI really liked the readings. There are not too many of them. Most humanities courses I have taken had more reading than this course.",
                "Despite attempts to make the course more engaging, lecture still felt pretty disconnected, perhaps by virtue of the space. Still, I really enjoyed the different assignments, and section was really wonderful. The TFs were all so helpful and full of knowledge! I really liked the process of giving peer edits. It was really valuable and gratifying. I wish the lectures were less repetitive to the readings and that they instead went DEEPER into the material.",
                "Really well organized, enjoyed having the materials laid out in different accessible formats and loved it he flexibility and understanding in grading. Made it a stronger focus of learning which was wonderful",
                "Despite this course being a lecture and survey course, Professor Debs significantly changed my perspectives on the various issues of education. Most lectures were incredibly well-organized and very engaging, making me excited to come to lectures every week. While I was not entirely convinced about the purpose and benefit of the literature review, the classroom observation and the assigned readings were fascinating.",
                "Very interesting course, and the field trip to the local high school was amazing. But the lectures were incredibly slow and boring.",
                "In terms of strengths, the class provides an in-depth overview of the education field in the US. It provides opportunities for students to learn about how education appears around the world. The recordings of lectures are also often posted for review which helps with learning. In terms of weaknesses, I wish we had gotten to spend more than a week on each topic. I understand why we had to go at a quick pace, but it would have been nice to devote more time to particular topics.",
                "The structure of the course was good but sometimes there were too many readings and it wasn't clear what I should prioritize. The literature review was a great assignment -- I got to dive into a topic I cared about and I learned how to make use of Yale's incredible library resources.",
                "strengths: all of the assignments were really helpful for my learning, especially the classroom observation paper because it required me to apply the concepts we learned in lecture; the midterm was structured really well because it wasn't stressful but acted as a really helpful review of the first half of course material; the literature review was really interesting because we could each pick a topic that we were personally interested in; lectures were made more engaging with group work and lots of discussion; every concept we learned came with a few examples of how it applied in the real world\r\n\r\nweaknesses: It was a survey course which means it is very hard to look deeply into every concept, but there were some concepts I thought deserved a little more time; for example, one lecture combined special needs education and ELL education but those two topics probably deserved their own lectures or at least a little clearer link between why exactly they related",
                "One of the strengths of this course was that it included various types of readings and sources. I appreciated being introduced to Education and Society, Teacher Wars, news articles, academic papers, and more. The variety was great! I also felt that this course was organized really well, the expectations were crystal clear, and there were no surprises. Everything felt very reasonable. One of the weaknesses of this course was that sometimes, the content felt a little politically biased, specifically leaning towards the left. Its ok to include that, but then its important to also include a counter-argument from the other side.",
                "The strengths of this class was the sections and classroom observation. I feel like we were actually able to analyze the texts in sections, unlike in lecture were it was mainly just summaries of the readings. I likes listening to my TF's and peers' perspectives and felt like section is where I learned the most, however, sections are only 50 minutes so sometimes it felt rushed and we weren't able to go as deep as we wanted. The classroom observation was an amazing component where you were able to see the readings come to life. However, I wished we were able to go more than once and had a more in-depth writing assignment on it. I often felt this way in this course, that we never went deep enough for my liking.",
                "Strengths include a dynamic lecture and great section. At times the depth of study wasn't to my preference, but that is to be expected given it is a survey course.",
                "The readings were really interesting, and I appreciated being able to choose our own topics for the essays. And I liked the midterm format.",
                "Strengths: depth of content and the ability to observe a classroom in CT. \r\nWeaknesses: poorly run lecture. lack of feedback on assignments. \r\nImprovements: more one-on-one time with an instructor and more feedback on assignments would be helpful. This class, in my opinion, felt like it was trying to be run as a seminar but without the attention that students deserve and require when involved in a high-thinking seminar-type of class. I honestly think this class should be turned into a seminar class to facilitate adequate discussion if this would be in any way possible. It would make the class 100% better and more efficient.",
                "Its a survey course, theres a lot of breadth and not as much depth; if you want a broad understanding of education\/education topics, this is a good class for that. If you are hoping to focus on a more specific educational niche, perhaps an EDST seminar would be a better environment for that.",
                "Strengths: A strength of this course is its relative flexibility on deadlines and the resources that were offered throughout the process of writing the lit review. The timeline gave me a good amount of time\/opportunities to talk with my TF, who was very helpful throughout the process. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Though I understand that this course is a survey course, making it impossible to cover every subject deeply, I do think the class missed opportunities to interrogate the structures that have created and continue to create injustice and inequity in the classroom. While the class dedicated a significant amount of time to sociologically proving that inequities in education exist, critical conversations on the historical structures and government policies behind these inequities were scarce. In our final class, we discussed briefly acknowledging past injustices as a means of improving education. While this class acknowledged past injustices, I felt it sometimes ignored that many injustices are not a thing of the past. While some of our discussions addressed the connection between past injustices and the present state of American classrooms, such as our discussion on school segregation, other conversations missed the mark. Our classes on higher education especially seemed focused on historicizing Yales role in maintaining inequity, eliminating the opportunity for nuance. Professor Debs lectures echoed Dean Quinlans statement that Yale is not the Yale it was 50 years ago. While true, this framing papers over the many structural inequities that still exist within the university system (lack of socioeconomic diversity, lack of support for FLGI students and students of color). Ive taken survey classes, such as HSHM 206, that cover a wide variety of subjects like EDST 110 that are also able to address structural inequity in appropriate depth. I think this would be possible for EDST 110, though it would require effort, creativity and a willingness to change.\r\n\r\nIts also worth noting that the majority of this class focused specifically on education systems in America, making the more general course title a bit of a misnomer.",
                "strengths: very laid back environment, flexible deadlines, kind TFs and professor, shorter (50 min) lectures, engaging section, interesting assignments\r\nweaknesses: reading load can sometimes be overwhelming but just expected to know the gist"

            "comments": [
                "Yes! I think it will be captivating to any student who went to school, especially in the United States. The course is very focused on American education, something that I think should be more emphasized in the course description, name, etc. Because the course is very grounded in experiences, anyone can contribute. Definitely no prerequisites.",
                "I think everyone should take some variation of this course, especially as many students at Yale were actively engaged in their school communities through extracurriculars and classes. School was\/is an especially crucial point of our development and understanding it would be beneficial for all.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! If you are interested in education studies, political science, history, cognitive science, sociology, cultural studies, or even a STEM field, it is essential to understand how the education system works. Not only do you learn about contemporary debates in education, but you also learn a lot about the history of inequities in education, how education policy is made, and the impact of educational disparities on long-term outcomes. The pace of the course is very relaxed, with most of the work taking place before Thanksgiving. The only major assignment is the Literature Review  however, be sure to set aside a substantial amount of time to complete this assignment because although it is only 20% of your grade, it will take a very long time to complete. That said, Dr. Debs and the TFs are very understanding if you need an extension and provide a significant amount of support.",
                "YES. Everyone should take this course, regardless of your major or interests. It makes you reflect on yourself, your prior experience and your experience now in the education system. It is a very valuable course and I am so happy I took it.",
                "I would recommend this course to everyone, regardless of your major. The workload isnt overwhelming, and its spaced out throughout the semester in a way that isnt stressful. The topics covered are also really interesting, especially if you are interested in a career in education.",
                "YES, PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE",
                "I would recommend this course to every student! Many of the topics were super relevant, and you get to learn a lot about the history of Yale. Implicitly, it makes you question what you are looking for in a college experience and how that can be reflected in the way you spearhead the rest of Yale.",
                "Yes! Everyone should take this course! Not just students who want to become teachers or go into education policy. I am a STEM major and dont have interest in either of those fields but I still think this course will be useful in the future.",
                "Yes yes 100% yes! It's amazing if you're interested in education and\/or sociology and really takes you over everything so you can figure out what you want to pursue further if you are interested in that. Also, a lot of classes require 110 as a prerequisite so if you think you'll be interested in the future try to get into this class earlier so you can. I started this class not sure if I would do scholars and ended up a scholar, so just see where it takes you!",
                "If you are an FGLI student, really think long and hard about if you want to take this course. You will spend a lot of time talking about your experiences in this class, and it might get really tiring- it did for me. I somewhat regret taking this course personally. If you are not FGLI, go ahead. It would not say it was a huge gut.",
                "Yes! It covered a lot of relevant and important issues in U.S. education -- anyone interested in learning more about the education system should take it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone looking for a broad introduction to a social science field that feels close to home.",
                "I would recommend the course if they knew nothing about the educational system and wanted an overview. If they had prior knowledge, a lot of the stuff would probably be familiar to them.",
                "Excellent course! Can't recommend it enough",
                "I would recommend this class if they are interested in education. Unfortunately, its one of the only EDST courses that is easy to get into for non-EDST students. Its a big lecture, so Id caution someone from taking it if they learn best in an interactive environment.",
                "If you want to really get into thinking about education in the U.S., from so many different angles, and get a comprehensive overview survey of everything, this is definitely the class to do that! It certainly fits the bill, and even though it is an intro class, it really feels like you learn a lot and get a lot out of it.",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes! A great foundational course that covered a wide range of topics in EDST and inspired me to pursue a certificate in the discipline.",
                "Depending on your interest and exposure to education studies, this might be a good course to take, and you should definitely take it if you're considering the Ed Studies certificate! It helps you understand the educational landscape and gives you a couple of resources \/ helps you start thinking about how to find a potential career in education.",
                "Yes, to any student. Even if a student is not interested in pursuing education, it is a productive reflection on American education and university education. It made me look at my other classes differently.",
                "Yes I would because all of the topics were very interesting and helped me understand a lot about my own educational journey so far.",
                "I would recommend this class to any students: EDST scholar\/certificate, social science, humanities, stem. This class is informative and is structured to ensure that you leave having learned something, so it is an approachable and relevant topic for any course of topic.",
                "Absolutely. I wouldn't say education studies is my top academic interest, but I was somewhat interested in learning about history\/sociology\/theory of education, and this course was so fun and interesting even though I am not an education nut. In large part, I think, because of the teacher, TA, and course structure. Especially at Yale, where so many professors are researchers first and professors just because they have to be, taking a course with someone who cares about the teaching aspect of their job is such a wonderful experience. Even if you don't take this class, I recommend taking instruction quality and style into account when choosing classes (you can learn a lot from about how a teacher will teach a course from their syllabus!). But this class really is awesome. Even the discussion sections were really enjoyable, we developed a real feeling of closeness with each other, and we had great discussions about the course content, including how it related to our own lives.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Even if you are not looking to pursue education in the long term, I think you will benefit from the critical lens it gives you, looking at both the American education system and your place within it. Plus, as a student, the topics are all the more relevant and fun to consider.",
                "This is a great course to see the studies that validate one's educational experience. It is a good space to think critically about how your environment shaped you and can help you redefine your purpose for getting an education. This course made me more motivated to learn and gain value from my courses as opposed to simply memorizing and regurgitating information.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in going into education in America, either teaching or policy, this would be a great course to take.",
                "I would. It's an important class with not too much work. I'd definitely recommend other students to take it.",
                "If you want to do the education studies scholars program or certificate yes because it is required but other than that no.",
                "Yes! An absolute must take if you're interested in working in the education sector, going on to grad school, or just curious about how your own educational experiences stack up to the rest of the country (and world!)",
                "Yes! A must if you're interested in teaching.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It really gets you thinking about the education system and makes you reflect on \r\n your experiences.",
                "YES!! I loved this course. I talked about it all the time outside of class and it made me think about my life differently. The readings are all very interesting and there isn't that much writing.",
                "Sure! As an intro course, it can be a little boring, but it allows you to take more in-depth EDST classes later, which are phenomenal.",
                "10000% great teaching and a great topic to learn about",
                "If you are considering the Education Studies certificate and program, or even if you are just interested in education, I would highly recommend this course! Professor Debs is amazing and truly cares about her students.",
                "I would recommend it, as it is a gut, good for anyone.",
                "I would recommend the course to another student. You learn a lot about how education in the US works.",
                "Yes. It's not stressful or difficult if you do at least a little planning with the literature review. It's interesting and relevant for all of us since we're all participants in an education system.",
                "Yes; I thought it was a great course both for someone hoping to go into teaching and someone who is simply interested in education studies; there was a great mix of concepts and even though it was a survey course it was able to get a decent depth on a lot of really important ideas",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Even if the individual is not planning on pursuing education studies as a main field of study, I think its so worthwhile to gain a basic understanding of how education works. This course has gotten me to think about education, and social issues in general, in ways that I hadnt thought of before.",
                "Highly would recommend it! This class was a great chance to reflect on my educational experiences in the larger context of education research, practice, and methods. The workload did not feel impossible, and the TA-professor team was always available. The course's readings are a little more than on average, but I always found at least one interesting and so the reading felt less like work and more enjoyable. Moreover, I feel a lot more comfortable and confident with the idea of entering the field.",
                "I would if you want a solid understanding of our educational system.",
                "If the student is in any part interested in education, they must take this course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Especially if they just have a little bit of interest in education and want to dip their toes in the water, this class is a great way to learn about a broad span of topics. I really enjoyed it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I think the faculty creates an environment of engagement, compassion, and reflection, and finding all three of those things at Yale is rare.",
                "I would recommend this course because it is a prerequisite to most other ed studies classes.",
                "yes! EDST is a great community, kind staff and students",
                "Yes, for those interested in the education system I think it gives you a great introduction."
