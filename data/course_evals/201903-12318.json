   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about the Founders that I had never known. This seminar provides an opportunity to learn early American history through individuals rather than flashcards. One of my favorite Yale classes by far.",
    "How to interpret and use primary source documents in reading and speaking.",
    "I learned how to write an original work of historical research! I also gained more confidence in seminar discussions.",
    "Most obviously, writing a short thesis (20-page paper). Professor Freeman literally line edits the entire draft and meets with you multiple times, offering incredible guidance throughout the process. I had never written a paper of this length or even a research paper at Yale, and this class taught me how to use Yale's resources to do it. Also, dealing with primary sources like letters.",
    "I learned more about how to read primary source documents from this period, and primary source documents in general. The best and most important thing I learned though was how to write a huge research paper. Your main assignment in the class is to write a 20-page paper of original research, and Professor Freeman is IMMENSELY helpful throughout the process. She really helped me figure out how to write a research paper that wasn't just fluff, and actually said something original. She will notice if your argument is thin and help you flesh it out. I'm leaving the class with a better idea of how I work when tackling a big project, and how I like to structure and organize my research. The paper was definitely a challenge and sometimes I was really disorganized, so now I know how to structure my own thoughts and research as I head into my thesis.",
    "I gained great insight into both the nature of the late-18th\/early-19th century period of American (particularly, Northern) history and the relevance of the study of that era to the modern day.",
    "I learned how to evaluate primary sources, search through a period's historiography, develop a thesis, and construct a research paper.",
    "Huge insight into the ideas and lives of Hamilton, Jefferson, and their contemporaries. You will learn how to be fully engaged with primary source material and how to write a long (20 page) research paper.",
    "Learned a ton about early American history.",
    "American Letters of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The only weakness I can think of is that I wouldn't have minded a little more secondary source background on some of the material we were reading, but we are perfectly capable of looking it up for ourselves so that wasn't a big deal. Otherwise wouldn't change anything.",
    "Strengths: The discussions were very enriching. I didn't mind that they were at 9:25 AM on a Wednesday because they were so much fun!\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: When Professor Freeman cancelled class, I would have appreciated if she had offered some kind of make-up session. There also could have been more initial guidance about writing our rough drafts.",
    "STRENGTHS: Joanne Freeman is INCREDIBLE. Her knowledge is encyclopedic, ranging from weird fun facts about the snacks in the Senate to a macro understanding of the time. The letters are really fun to read. Excellent facilitator of discussion. \r\nWEAKNESSES: literally none. Woke up for a 9 am EXCITED.",
    "Professor Freeman is a huge strength of the course. She's incredibly knowledgeable and excited about the period you study. Her enthusiasm is totally infectious and always makes class discussion really fun and engaging, even at 9:25am. Her help with the research paper was also a huge strength of the course. The fact that she line edits a draft is something most professors would never do. I can't think of many weaknesses. I suppose it's important to note that virtually all of the course readings are primary sources (letters by Hamilton and Jefferson). I found it really interesting, but I think maybe I could have gotten a better understanding of the period in general if we'd also had some secondary readings each week. I left the class knowing a lot about Hamilton and Jefferson's personalities and politics, but I would've liked a little more secondary source reading so I could have understood some of the broader movements during the time period.",
    "The greatest strength of the course was Professor Freeman. She knows how to conduct a seminar and drive conversation in an accessible and democratic though intentional way. She also selects primary source readings that are genuinely informative and not too redundant. I will say, though, that although she claims the class is a study of the era through the lens of these two men, it really is more a study of the men themselves (and their particular affairs). I felt that the course really focused on upper-class American life in the late 18th and early 19th century. I would have liked a lot more about other parts of the ERA  the South, the non-elite, migrants, etc.",
    "This course allows you to delve into historical research, developing the skills necessary to become a better writer and historian.",
    "The discussion is always incredible and super stimulating. Professor Freeman lets students direct the discussion and always has something wise to say after every contribution. You feel like it's impossible to ask a dumb question, but also that the class is extremely challenging and thought-provoking. Also, Prof. Freeman isn't afraid to talk about current politics. She canceled class so we could watch the impeachment hearings.",
    "Strengths: Primary sources fill the majority of the syllabi; course was a lens into the political culture of early 19th century America, even though the title suggests the course was focused on two men.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nI wish the conversation of each seminar was a bit more structured and coherent. At times, it felt as if I was in a section discussing whatever I thought relevant, and the conversation would just bounce around from one topic to the next, which made it hard for me to jot down anything substantial\/that made sense. \r\n\r\nI'm also unsure if brining in modern politics is a good idea in an American history seminar. It's one thing to connect themes that are still relevant to today's political moment, but in my opinion is that these letters are timeless, whereas news surrenders to the moment. I like working with a text in front of me rather than having a normative conversation about politics."

    "100%. Professor Freeman is the most engaging and caring professor I've had at Yale, and the material is fascinating and fun.",
    "The singular best class I've ever taken at Yale; Absolutely. This might be the first history seminar I've taken in which I felt genuinely encouraged to participate and never felt intimidated to say something that might be stupid\/wrong. Professor Freeman is an absolute gem and should be considered in the upper echelon of teachers at Yale. She has the perfect combination of wicked smarts, world-class connections (ie Lyn Manuel-Miranda), and a genuine kindness that make her class genuinely, mind-blowingly fascinating\/fun. She is the best. You'd be lucky to take a class with her. Workload is manageable  tons of short primary documents per week and a final paper. She leads a very good discussion  really top notch.",
    "Overall, yes! Learned a LOT about the early national period.",
    "YES!!!!! SO WORTH IT!!! Hamilton and Jefferson are not niche at all and so emblematic of the time - don't worry about letters being boring or existing in a vacuum. No better way to prepare to write a thesis and being forced to hand in a draft in early November makes the workload very manageable. Any class with Joanne Freeman is a pleasure, could not recommend it more highly.",
    "Yes, definitely! It was seriously one of the coolest things ever to have my homework be reading Hamilton and Jefferson's mail. Like, you read their love letters! I can't think of other courses at Yale that let you engage with primary sources in such a meaningful and fun way. It's also really special how much Prof. Freeman clearly adores this period and the people. I left the class understanding some of the most intimate parts of these men's lives, so it really brought history alive for me in a super fun way.",
    "Yes! Professor Freeman gives great feedback on writing and is a wonderful person to know. Shes accessible and really roots for her students.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is intent upon becoming a better writer and who has a passion for early American history.",
    "Yes, TAKE IT!",
    "Yes."
