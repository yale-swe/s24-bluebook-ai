However, the lack of a set structure of assignment types for each module is something that could be fixed. One week there will be a debate, the next a presentation, or some other random thing -- so somewhat unpredictable.",
    "Could be more engaging as a seminar",
    "Its very well done.",

    "Yes - this class was quite fun, challenging at times, but you learn a lot about a huge range of topics.",
    "Highly recommended",
    "For a first-year looking for a nice science credit to round out a schedule, this class is pretty good. You'll learn a lot of interesting things, without all the pressure of 50% exams and 10 pages papers.",
    "Yes",
