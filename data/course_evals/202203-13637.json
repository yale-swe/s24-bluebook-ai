The Biennale is also one of those things only the wealthy usually really get to encountersomething worth considering."

However, the syllabus wasn't available for the first month or so of classes, and when it was it was inaccurate so you would have to listen to what she said was the reading at the end of the class to know what it was. Sometimes this still wouldn't be accurate. Oftentimes the readings were available at the Haas library, which was incredibly inconvenient and inaccessible. It wasn't conducive at all for a seminar style, reading based course."
