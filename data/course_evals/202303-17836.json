                "I got introduced to a lot of new content in theatre music and learned so much from the students whose work was presented in class every week. The guest lectures from theatre professionals were also very insightful. The feedback provided on my assignments was always very detailed and customized. I could take stock of these in the next assignments and so my composing skills have definitely improved. I'm able to think more creatively and understand what sounds good from a theatrical perspective.",
                "This class nurtures and constructively challenges the artistic voices of composers and songwriters. Through a series of weekly song assignments that all foster a new compositional capacity, students are introduced to a plethora of styles, components, and features of musical theatre composition. Listening to classmates' work is the best part of the class, because there is so much to learn from everyone and their unique musical voices and topics they choose to write about. I was also introduced to new musical theatre canon repertoire which was quite enjoyable. I deeply appreciated this course. There was never a day I wasn't thrilled to go to class.",
                "I had never had to notate my songs as sheet music before, and that was a skill that I really honed this semester. I also expanded the structures I use in my songs and the chords I work with.",
                "This course completely transformed me as a songwriter. Though I had some tools in my toolbox, this class is what showed me how to use them. I was pushed to expand my stylistic and harmonic vocabulary constructively and productively. Also, as part of such a talented and encouraging group, I was exposed to so many different songwriting styles which was fascinating and educational.",

            "comments": [
                "The assignments are engaging, the professor is genuinely interested in the development of his students, the collaborative sessions with the Lyrics class were great, the guest lectures were immensely helpful and the end of semester concert is a fantastic way to showcase the students' work. I think the course hits the right spots for anyone looking to learn how to compose for musical theatre. The size of the class is also just right to get the most out of this course.\r\nThe classes could have relatively lesser time spent on feedback on students' assignments and more time analyzing established pieces.",
                "Strengths: The structure of the class was remarkably helpful for facilitating compositional growth and endurance. A song a week is an achievable challenge, but novelty is preserved by the engaging and varying topic assignments. The final project, Shen Curriculum Concert, was an amazing collaborative experience. It was so touching to celebrate musical theatre and artistic expression with my classmates.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses.",
                "This class provided a really great opportunity to make songwriting a regular practice, and Josh gave really great and really specific feedback for every song. The class structure also lent itself to fostering relationships between the students and keeping everyone interested in each other's success. As someone with very little musical theater experience, I would have loved a little bit more of a focus on the overall process of choosing song concepts and developing the arc of a story and characterization. It was very music theory heavy, which was really helpful at times but also inaccessible at other times.",
                "The course was very well organized and set up in a way to help us challenge ourselves each week and improve drastically by the end of the course. One weakness was that it was a bit difficult to match the experience on sick/virtual days due to the technology. It may be helpful to find a way to display music onscreen while showing the performance.",
                "This course is formatted very well. The \"one song a week\" approach works great, pushing students to bring their songwriting to a new level. Also, the community aspect of this course is great. Joining a group of passionate songwriters is inspiring and educational. Weekly feedback was always encouraging yet constructive.",
                "This class is amazing. Josh is great. He gives great feedback. Getting to perform your song for the class and receive feedback is great motivation to write good songs.\r\n\r\nA thought: sometimes it felt like I received really insightful feedback, but because we were already moving onto the next song, only so much of it was actually useful. The one week our assignment was to revise the previous weeks song, I was actually able to implement that feedback and this resulted in a much better song. If the class had a few more weeks like that (and thus slightly fewer assignments), one might learn more and walk away from the class with a greater number of songs good enough to show off."

                "Absolutely! Whether or not you have composed before, you will learn much from this class. As an introduction to musical theatre composition, it is a vibrant, welcoming, and open environment (not hostile or teacher-pleasing, which I initially feared it would be), and as a continuing of your composition training, it helps you build composing endurance and style versatility.",
                "I would recommend this class, but I also would encourage potential students to look into the structure and aims of the class before signing up.",
                "Yes, it was very engaging and I learned a lot and improved at a rate I would not have expected. This was my favorite course this semester and it was just a lot of fun in general",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to a student interested in songwriting, though some background is essential. Professor Rosenblum is a great, super knowledgeable instructor who takes each student where they are and pushes them forward. Also, you get to join a great community of songwriters.",
                "Yes! The level of energy, enthusiasm, and hard work in the class is really remarkable. Writing a song almost every week is a lot of work, but so rewarding."
