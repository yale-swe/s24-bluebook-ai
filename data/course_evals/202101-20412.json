                "I learned about women in literature of the Middle Ages and also women of Greek and Roman mythology. I also learned about perceptions of women and their roles during the Middle Ages based on these and biblical women. I came to agree with the professor's thesis that the Middle Ages gets a bad rap, and that the Renaissance wasn't really the very beginning of women's liberation.",
                "This course provided an introduction to the experiences and writings of women during the Middle Ages. One of the main threads throughout the course was the breaking of negative stereotypes about the Middle Ages. Weekly reading responses, one take-home exam, one creative writing assignment, and a final paper allowed us to engage with the texts.",
                "I learned so much!! I came away from this course with a really strong understanding of both classical/canonical texts as well as very obscure texts from the Middle Ages that Professor Purdy Moudarres had translated herself. I learned to look at these texts critically and examine womens role in them.",
                "By the end of the course, your perception of the \"dark ages\" will totally change.  You will read works by and about women starting from the Old Testament through to Boccaccio and realize the status and characterization of women in the middle ages is a much more interesting and nuanced topic than it may initially appear.  I learnt something new every week and was constantly having my perceptions challenged."

                "Yes! The only people I wouldn't recommend this to are those who don't like interpreting subjective texts. Even if you're not interested in the Middle Ages, you'll get interested over the course of the class because the professor makes the case that the Middle Ages aren't some backward island in history, but a dynamic weaving together of the traditions that preceded them, and that's reflected in their famous women.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone. It was very different from anything I had taken before, but I enjoyed it a lot. You never learn much about what women were up to during the Middle Ages, and it's really interesting. Professor Purdy Moudarres also makes one-on-one meetings very accessible to students, so it was easy to get help if needed.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. While the title of the course might make it sound dark or heavy, I found this class to be anything but. Professor Purdy Moudarres made each class a great platform for discussion and I felt readily able to engage in these discussions even if I had no prior experience with the topics at hand.",
                "100%.  Even if you are not someone with a natural interest in the middle ages, if you want to learn about a new topic from an expert and read a range of interesting and challenging literature it is a great choice!"
