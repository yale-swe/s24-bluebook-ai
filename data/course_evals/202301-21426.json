                "I learned a lot about the feminist movement from different perspectives than I had normally learned. Fascinating and very engaging.",
                "This course offers an in-depth understanding of women's rights movement and the ways it intersects with the civil rights movement. It details the grassroots organizing that has gone into the movement and diversity of beliefs and leaders. By analyzing articles in Ms. Magazine, the course allows students to better understand how to analyze primary sources in their time period.",
                "learned about the different political arguments feminists made in the 1950-80s. course mostly focuses on womens lib movement from an intersectional lens",
                "I learned about the civil rights and feminist waves in conjunction with one another, and the early publications of Ms. Magazine.",
                "I learned how to construct a research paper longer than I have ever written. I also interrogated how my modern perspective informs the way I judge feminist movements of the past.",
                "I learned so so much about both the Civil Rights and Womens liberations movements. This class is largely focused on how the two interact in the latter half of the 20th century. The readings are super interesting, and Professor Feimster is absolutely brilliant and moves conversation in an extremely impressive way.",
                "Learned extensively about the feminist movement for the 1940s onwards. We explored how feminist groups (separatist, lesbian, Black, etc.) divided and converged. It was a great introduction into feminist theory and conversations in history.",
                "This course added so much important perspective to my understanding of the feminist and civil rights movements fundamentally changed how I view both!"

                "Strengths: the variety of sources assigned each week (documentaries, primary, secondary sources) was engaging; the primary document reviews were helpful in writing the final paper\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: content sometimes felt repetitive; class discussions weren't super engaging sometimes - because it was a large class it was hard to participate (small group discussions would have been helpful)",
                "Love Professor Feimster she was so great!! So thoughtful and engaging. I think the course could have a bit more strucutre.",
                "The readings were really interesting and progressed nicely throughout the semester. Professor Feimster is a kind and thoughtful professor. I do wish that discussions were a bit more directed. I think Professor Feimster could have led the discussion a bit more and gotten us to engage a little more deeply with the material. That being said, the material was very interesting and important for people to grapple with.",
                "strength: Prof Feimster! shes smart, supportive, and understanding. class discussions were great and so were the readings. weakness: not much critical feedback on assignments throughout the semester",
                "STRENGTHS: had the opportunity to take discussions with some of the most passionate and intelligent people at Yale who are interested in the topics! This course is also such great prep for long-term research, planning, and topical discussion, as you are essentially preparing each week for the final big assignment.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none! I wish there was a way for us to watch the documentary together or something just because I think that wouldve been a great class addition, but thats just a small, selfish thing.",
                "Strengths: Feimster created a lovely classroom environment where people felt comfortable talking and debating. We didn't shy away from tough topics, but Feimster moderated well so that people felt empowered by our conversations. \r\nWeaknesses: Feedback on the second primary review would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: Professor Feimster is one of those rare professors you come across at Yale who literally checks all of the boxes. While it was a discussion seminar, listening to her speak was always my favorite part. She is brilliant and very knowledgeable about this area of study. More importantly, she genuinely cares about her students and their well-being and makes that explicitly clear. She brought us pastries every class - a 9:25 AM seminar - and always checked in on not only matters concerning the class, but how each student was managing the work and Yale in general. You can tell that her main reason for working in academia is to interact with undergrads, and I could not recommend taking a class with any professor as strongly as I would for her. The only weakness of the class is that we did not receive much feedback in our work.",
                "Really great course--would highly recommend if this is taught under Professor Feimster. She's a lovely supportive prof. who holds space for insightful conversations. Readings could be a little heavy, but Professor Feimster is really understanding of that. As long as you commit yourself, you will do great in this class. I enjoyed the selection of readings offered. The course did an excellent job at introducing the diversity of the feminist movement.",
                "I thought that Professor Feimster did an amazing job creating a space that everyone was comfortable to participate in. The discussions were very insightful and open. Furthermore, because we were working on our papers throughout the semester, the workload felt very manageable and every piece of homework had a very clear connection to what we were doing in class.",
                "I wish we had directly read more Black feminist literature in place of or alongside histories of the broader movement."

                "Yes - if you are interested in the civil rights movement, the women's movement, or both! This class engages with different sources that are insightful and interesting. While the final paper may seem daunting, the assignments that lead up to it are helpful in breaking it down into something more manageable. I enjoyed how the second half of the semester we focused more on analyzing primary sources, such as Ms. Magazine. The professor is also amazing - she literally bought pastries to every class (since it was an early Monday class)!",
                "Yes!! Amazing professor!!",
                "This is a great course if, like me, you haven't spent enough time studying the women's liberation movement. It broadens your understanding of how movements work and form. It helps you gain a historical perspective and analyze primary sources more effectively. Professor Feimster is very kind and cares about her students!",

                "Absolutely! Professor Feimster is a gem.",
                "I would strongly recommend taking this class. Professor Feimster handles dealing with a rather difficult subject matter with grace and nuance. The readings are super interesting, and class was even better.",
                "Absolutely! Such an amazing course with one of the best professors at yale!",
                "Yes! Do take this if you wish to learn more about the history of the feminist movement. It's a lot more complex than I had originally imagined.",
                "Recommend to all AMST\/AFAM majors and those interested in grassroots movement and the foundations of feminist politics. You think you understand the women's movement of the 1970s but you are likely more acquainted with the caricature than the actual movement."
