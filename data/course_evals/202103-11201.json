            "comments": [
                "Professor Smooke just needs to write his own problem sets. The tests don't reflect the problem sets because he writes but takes problem sets from the book. Especially annoying because there are no practice tests. Also, he increased the number of exams to 4 this year and it was way too many; none for ~6 weeks then 1 every 2 or 3.",
                "Strenghts: You know whats coming up for exams. Smooke is not ambiguous like a lot of Yale professors. He is so very clear about the content of exams. His teaching is decent too.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: He kind of just reads everything off of slides. Not that because of that you dont understand the content. His presentations are actually quite good. But since he just uploads them, there is no point in coming to class ever.",
                "To me, the strength of the course was Professor Smooke. He was a genuinely good guy, and I certainly appreciate his efforts to get to know the students and have all of us engage with the course. But the course was pretty poorly organized. The problem sets didn't align with the lectures, which didn't align with the textbook, which didn't align with the exams. The whole semester all the students were in a general state of confusion as to the topic we were supposed to know. A lot of times the lectures dived into proofs we never really saw again and we didn't spend much time on problems that we would actually see on a future exam. The homework problems were often only tangentially related to the week's material. This led to a lot of students not even showing up to lecture as attendance provided a very marginal benefit to performance on psets and exams.",
                "This class was poorly taught. Everything was presented on powerpoint, and no examples were written on the board. I found the material extremely interesting, but was very unhappy with the way everything was taught. This class needs more examples, and things need to be written out for us to get a full understanding of the material. When we talk through examples, steps are missing and it leads to confusion.",
                "Professor Smooke would just repeat all the concepts in his slides that were in the pre-lecture videos, with no new information presented in class. It would have been helpful and a lot more engaging if he even did a few example problems on the board in class, but he would just go through slides pretty much word for word. The material covered on exams also did not really reflect the homework, so this class was a lot of self-studying and it felt like there was  little support because there was only one TA office hour in the week that took place with enough time before the psets were due/before the exams. However, I did like the format of 4 non-cumulative exams and ending the course slightly earlier.",
                "The course would likely benefit from a centrally synchronous structure.",
                "Strengths: Smooke lectures on exactly what he thinks is important and what he puts on the homework/exams. So, it's pretty straightforward to follow. I also appreciated being able to watch the pre-recorded lectures and recordings of the in-person lectures. The non-cumulative exams are nice. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of the homework was focused on finding the right equation in the textbook, which was more tedious than anything.",
                "You do a lot from the book and the slides are pretty useful. Nothing was particularly enlightening and there were some frustrating things that felt like they could be taught better but nothing horrible either. Pretty much what you would expect out of a Mechanical Engineering course.",
                "The course was very well-structured. The lessons were all given both in video form and then in-person. This technique was incredibly helpful for retaining the information before studying. The problem sets were all representative of exams. Both were of incredibly fair difficulty, and Professor Smooke's grading system is also fair. The workload was a great amount to facilitate learning without being a hinderance with respect to other courses. Professor Smooke is also an incredible professor. He is very informative, shows great videos, and genuinely funny.",
                "Your typical lecture-based engineering course. Overall, I thought the class was efficient and orderly. I thought the in-person lectures were solid, but too fast-paced if you wanted to take any notes. There wasn't much to be gained from going to class in-person because all the lectures were recorded and online. I liked the extra real-life application tidbits that were at the end of modules. Sometimes, we would be tested on things that were mentioned in lecture, but we never got the chance to practice on homework assignments. I would rather we had a few extra homework problems than hope that we had absorbed everything from lecture.",
                "The class was taught part asynchronously with recorded videos to watch before lecture and then the same material repeated during lecture. It was nice to see the material twice. However, often the material was gone through relatively quickly in the recording and then because we were seeing it again, it was gone over quickly in class. This made the material hard to understand sometimes since it felt like it was moving very quickly.",
                "The weakness of this course is that it was difficult to know what type of questions were going to be thrown on the exam because the pset do not really reflect the exams actually given.",
                "I did not like the combination of synchronous and asynchronous lectures. Would have preferred one of the other",
                "The structure is not helpful to learning. The problems on the homework did not correlate to what was taught in class and the exams were not always representative. The four midterm structure also was not helpful.",
                "Strengths: Material is interesting. Grading was fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I mean all criticism with the upmost respect, but I also want to be honest about my feelings. To be blunt, no one Ive talked to liked the teaching style. Theres a lot of frustration about it throughout the class, most of which is not talked about since no one wanted to severe relationships with Professor Smooke. Professor Smooke is talented, and we wish we would have been given an option to learn this material normally. The asynchronous style of teaching made it so students had to learn material on their own. Not a single problem was solved in real time on a white board or chalk board. Understanding concepts is one thing, learning how a professor approaches a problem in real time is so valuable. Additionally, there was material covered on homework which did not match with the slides we were told to review. This made it seem like there was a disconnect between what the professor thought we had learned that week. The teaching style felt like an avenue to minimize professors work. Yes, the slides are helpful to have, but cant we have normal lectures with slides posted as additional resources instead of the primary resource? There is a reason a lot of people did not go to class.",
                "Explaining the PowerPoint is preferable over reading the PowerPoint; at times, derivations were very difficult to conceptualize in class without explanation.",
                "Lots of resources in the forms of video lecture, Zoom lecture, in-person lectures, slide decks, textbook.\r\n\r\nNot a lot of in-person support in the form of office hours, review sessions etc.",
                "I wish things were taught more clearly and not just lectured off. Also wish the homework, lecture material, and tests had more in common with each other. It feels like we are learning different things with each method.",
                "I wish Professor Smooke worked out problems during class rather than going through a PowerPoint. I feel like that would keep students more engaged and it would slow the pace of the class which would also make taking notes easier. Its different taking notes on your own time as opposed to during class. Professor Smooke is a great lecturer, though, and hes very knowledgeable and skilled in fluid dynamics.",
                "This course was taught poorly. There was little engagement with students and nothing being written on the board during class. Powerpoint presentations do not seem like an effective way to teach a course like this one, but this is what was done.",
                "I personally found the dual format of the course, (the dual online recorded lectures and in person live lectures) to be critical to my learning, as it allowed me to be exposed to challenging content multiple times. By going through the lectures at my own pace before class, then attending class and having it all synthesized again, I was able to internalise and fully understand relatively challenging content.",
                "The slides give very clear derivations of equations, but the connections between lecture and problems could be clearer. There were only a few in class practice problems and they often were quite different from the types of problems on exams and homeworks.",
                "Strengths- having access to pre-recorded videos to continually reference. \r\nWeaknesses- in the synchronous class we would cover the exact same content as the pre-recorded lectures. I would have preferred to work out additional examples in class that we had not seen before. Also sometimes the homeworks did not align with what we were covering in class.",
                "Material was pretty hard and complicated, felt like pace was a little too fast so I ended up learning which situations to use each equation rather than understand how/why each equation worked."

                "Only take if it is a requirement",
                "I would recommend this course because it is interesting material for any STEM/engineering majors, but hopefully it will be taught differently next time. There seemed to be a disconnect between the professor and what the students actually understand, and the class could have been made much more engaging, given that it was in-person.",
                "Yes. The class could be a lot, lot worse, but Smooke keeps the concepts and workload manageable. Even though he literally just reads from the slides in class, it's exactly the material being tested. Plus, he's a really funny guy. The homework made to be great practice for the exams, so it's pretty straightfoward to study. If you're not an engineer but still interested in fluid mechanics, just know that this class is really focused on engineering problem-solving and using pre-derived equations, instead of developing concepts.",
                "Felt like your basic mechanical engineering course. Wouldn't recommend it to a non-engineering major and even for engineering majors, I feel there are likely better courses electives out there. If you need to take fluids, take this one and not the chemical engineering one, and definitely take it with Smooke if possible. Least bad it could be I guess.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Smooke is outstanding. The course material itself is interesting. It is a fun intertwinement of differential equations and physics. The workload is super manageable, and it is very clear how to prepare for tests. Also, the questions on the tests are never out of nowhere, and if you work hard, you can do incredibly well on the exams. The TA's were also very good.",
