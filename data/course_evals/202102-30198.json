                "The professor goes a little fast when explaining, but he will always stop to explain things!",
                "The strengths of the course is the professor. He cares about the students and the material, which makes it better to learn. The material itself is much harder than Physics 180, which makes it a lot more difficult to understand effectively. Furthermore, the pace of this course is definitely a weakness, there is not much you can do to prevent that; however, a suggestion would be to focus more specifically on the harder subjects and spend less time on the easier subjects like circuits. Also, I believe that the time in section is wasted. There is a disconnect between the TFs and the professor on the material, so it just makes the time spent in there before an exam kind of wasted because they do not really know what is going to be on the exam either or have problems that could be beneficial to the students.",
                "The course is extremely fast paced and if you don't understand something, it is really easy to get lost really fast. The professor is nice but the lectures could be confusing in their structure. Sometimes we would jump around to different chapters and other times the professor would start an example problem without saying what concept or idea we were covering and it was a bit confusing. The exams were difficult and there was a lot of time pressure.",
                "Some of the content from this course should be put into 180 so that the course load isn't such a big difference.",
                "Strengths: great professor, good organization of the material and assessments\r\nWeaknesses: so fast paced, and I thought the lectures were a little less organized for this half of the course (it was easier to follow along with the lectures from Session A...not sure if it's just harder material in Session B though)",
                "This course was really poorly organized and hard to follow. Especially with the rapid pace of the summer session, I wish this course were more structured and that the homework problems mimicked what we did in class. Also, the TAs were never on the same page with the instructor and did not know what we were learning in class at all. So, it became really difficult to know what we would be expected to know. For example, my TA kept doing double integrals or gradients, without us ever covering that material in class. A huge negative of this class was how poorly organized it was and that was a constant struggle.",
                "Strengths: It was great that the professor wrote out everything by hand rather than using slides.  The pace of the class was good, things never felt too rushed or too slow.  We didn't waste any time in class and packed a lot of content in, but I appreciate that the professor dedicated the last class of the session to review.  Exams were fair and the spacing between them was good.  Sample tests were a huge help in prepping for exams.\r\nWeaknesses: Homeworks greatly varied in level of difficulty from week to week.",
                "The sections could definitely be used more effectively and would be a tremendous help especially since it moves so fast. Out TA never had anything planned and always just asked us for questions which was not effective. It would also really help if the TAs sat in lecture so when we asked them questions about lecture that would know what we were talking about. Most of the time they didn't know what we had learned yet so it was frustrating to try and ask them questions.",
                "Strengths: Content was generally fairly interesting. Some lectures (particularly at the beginning) were well organized and presented. Manageable homework load. Weaknesses: Exams were all over the place - first exam was extremely difficult with the average being in the 70s, second was so easy that nearly half the class got over 100 and then the final exam had an entirely different format where multiple figures weren't labelled and had several mistakes. Final part of the course (magnetism and optics) felt very rushed. Pointless quizzes. The \"Oral exam\" aspect of the course was really silly - the questions my TA asked would have been much better if we had a pen and paper to think of them. Really had no place in the course.",
                "This course is fast! That is both a strength and a weakness because it means you need to work a lot for this class in order to succeed, but it also means that you do not have to dwell for a long time on material that you do not enjoy learning about. This course only had two tests and a final which was a good amount. However, there was an oral final which was stressful to prepare for. The quiz structure was much improved than in 180 because you had two attempts and more time (hopefully it will stay like this). The professor is a mixed bag. On one hand, he will work with every student to help them achieve a good foundational physics knowledge. But on the other, he decided to give every student who received above a 90 on the first exam (in which the average was in the low 70s) an automatic 100% and berated the other students. This is very unfair and made it seem like the grading was going to be pretty arbitrary as a result for the entirety of the course.",
                "The class covers a lot of material over a very short amount of time. For what it covered, Professor Ghiassi-Nejad did a fantastic job of giving a good overview of the chapters and not confusing us. Something that could be improved would be including more questions that are relevant to the exams on the problem sets.",
                "The strengths of this course lie in the instructor and TF's help and encouragement of practice. The weekly suggested problems alongside the homework allowed us to test our understanding and clear up any questions in office hours. The live lectures were a comprehensive overview of topics and gave a clear understanding of concepts, and covered almost all of the textbook content within the limited timeframe.",
                "The class was very organized but the tests were a bit long for the time available.",
                "A lot of material in very little time. It also felt less cumulative than mechanics. I wish some of it had been in the first semester course.",
                "Homework assignments were due on lots of different days of the week, which was confusing. Having the homework assignments due the same day every week would make it more clear.",
                "It just moves very quickly but there is a lot of help available if you need it."

                "Yes, I'd highly recommend as doing physics over the summer is a great choice.  I believe the class overall was easier than a normal semester class would have been.  Teaching staff is great and looking back I'm amazed at how much I learned in just 5 weeks.  Be warned- you MUST stay on top of the workload to do well.",
                "Probably not because the structure of the course is not great. If the structure is improved, I would recommend it.",
                "I would if Physics is simply a requirement for your major\/pre-professional school. It gets it out of the way. The condensed nature of the course really hinders your understanding and mastery of some topics though - I feel if you want to be a Physics or Engineering major it's much better to take this during the year where there is more time to let everything sink in.",
                "No, only take it if you have to (either as a phys major or as a pre-med student).",
                "Absolutely. I took PHYS 180 and 181 over the summer and because of the material and Professor Ghiassi-Nejad, I want to major in physics. This is a painless way to get a pre-med requirement out of the way for pre-med friends, and also a great way to immerse yourself into physics if you're thinking of the major. I'm so excited to take more classes in the major!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student hoping to cover concepts from Electricity and Magnetism. The summer class is fast-paced but gives a solid overview of topics, and improves upon foundations from high school physics. Keeping up with the homework assignments and suggested problems is great practice and gives you more confidence in your understanding. Given that the physics sequence is a pre-requisite for many majors, I would recommend these summer classes to anyone who needs the pre-reqs and is able to keep up with the pace over 5 weeks.",
                "Yes. It was a really great version of PHYS 181.",
                "I would recommend if you have a strong physics background, if not, just keep in mind that it is very fast paced.",
