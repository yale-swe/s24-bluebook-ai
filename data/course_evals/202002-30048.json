   "comments": [
    "I primarily learned what college-level academic writing means. Besides learning some basics like what a good introductory and conclusion paragraph look like, I also learned about how to construct a compelling claim, how evidence ties to analysis, the importance of a motive for writing and conveying to the reader a \"so what?\" \r\nI also got the opportunity to engage with a few life-writing pieces. Supported by these texts, I learned how to read closely, put texts into conversation with one another, and write a research paper.",
    "I learned how to build on the things that are crucial to the construction of an argument. I also learned how to understand the different ways in which authors share their life stories.",
    "Through this course, we have honed our academic writing skills and gained insights into the variety of life-writing texts."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths are foremost, the teacher. Ms. Galindo was wonderful, and she made the entire course a fun, meaningful experience.\r\n\r\nStrengths: ample feedback, and resources to help write essays. Balanced discussion time and lecture\/group work time. Engaging texts. An appropriate, manageable level of homework.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Few. If anytime, we read one book near the end of the course \"A Life's Work,\" in the span of 4 days, and I would've appreciated a little more time to read it.",
    "Strengths: the four assignments are well structured to strengthen a student's thinking and writing ability, regular feedback on drafts is very helpful, the readings had a wonderful variety (I loved how we had weekly themes), the assigned reading amount was very reasonable, the handouts are excellent, knowing the class structure (as described in modules) was very helpful, the small class size provided for meaningful discussion and made it easier to participate\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked to have more time to work on my papers (though I understand that given the duration of the course, the pace was inevitable)",
    "A key strength is the small size of the class. This is very conducive to a high level of student engagement. A weakness for me was the fact that it was taught over zoom. However, I realize that this is the case (and will be the case) for many classes going forward."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!!\r\n\r\nThis course has made me such a better writer and thinker. I'm going to use these skills for the rest of my college career, in any class where I have to write or discuss anything. It's so small that you really can know your instructor, and your TF. There is so much room to receive feedback and support.\r\n\r\nYou also get to work with and meet other students on a personal level, which I really appreciated.",
    "Yes, absolutely! I think this course is excellent, especially for people who have not had a lot of writing experience in the past because it helps to polish even the basics (while also coaching students on more complex writing techniques and expectations). It is an excellent introduction to academic writing in college and sets a student up for more confident and compelling writing in future courses. The course is well structured to hone different writing skills, the regular feedback is very valuable, and the small class size ensures meaningful discussion. I finished this course genuinely feeling like I grew tremendously as a writer and enhanced my thinking ability.",
    "Yes  would highly reccomend this course to others because of the strengths that I have previously mentioned.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student! This course is very well structured in terms of teaching students how to persuasively and succinctly write each part of a college-level argumentative essay. The course topic \"Life-Writing\" is also intriguing and thought-provoking. By analyzing different types of life-writing texts (memoir, academic article, movie, and interview, etc), we understand the variety of materials that can constitute life-writing works and how specific choices of medium can help advance the audience's understanding of the authors' life stories. I find this deepened understanding of the various tracks of lives that others have gone through highly meaningful, as it allows me to rethink how I want to live and define my own life."
