It is very clear what grammar points we are learning each day and we are given ample opportunities to practice. It's always a very fun, inclusive and affirmative learning environment which I feel is perfect for a beginner level class like this. \r\nWeakness: I would hope to have more actual speaking practice - possibly also hindered by our larger class size.",

I don't feel pressured to be perfect, which is perfect when learning a new language. Trying new things within the class that go outside of the learning is met with enthusiasm and warm encouragement and feedback!",
