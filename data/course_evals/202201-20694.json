            "comments": [
                "Weaknesses: Initial project assignment was a bit chaotic and should have been ordered as projects -> teams, not teams -> projects for more people to be satisfied with what they were working on. Accessibility of work spaces with more potentially dangerous equipment (saws, drill presses, etc) was difficult since a professor needed to attend the space while in operation - this was the biggest bottleneck for many of my projects at Yale. I'm not sure if there's any solution to this, but if it were possible to be trained on the use of such rooms so that students may work there in groups without professor supervision that would be incredible. \r\nStrengths: Such a wealth of knowledge across the various professors overseeing the course. They are all passionate about your learning and your projects and take time out of their busy schedules to chat one-on-one and be sure you're enjoying what you're doing and not getting stuck. Access to lab spaces was valuable to have locations to work with our teams. I felt there was a perfect balance of structured to de-structured class time across the year. A++ for slack as a class communication channel.",
                "It's too much work to only be worth half a credit!",
                "If you have a bad project which is decided for you a year in advance, your whole school year sucks. Strengths are that it lets you be totally independent. Also need a good group or you're screwed",
                "I think having some professional engineers on the team to consult with students would be really helpful, especially about DFM. Course organization with deadlines on Canvas, so that they're alongside those for my other classes. I appreciated the energy and support (empowering rather than making us feel stupid) from Dr. Booth and Vatsal. They were very available, and enthusiastic to provide help and ideas. I also appreciated the clarity from Dr. Booth about what was expected in terms of targets for where the project should be, week by week. I always felt like I knew exactly what my objectives were, and didn't have to wonder whether I was behind where I needed to be. I think there should be more regular scheduled team time, where teaching staff are in the lab and all teams are expected to convene.  Even 3 days a week would be better. I hate the fact that it's 0.5 credits, since everyone knows we need to be spending more hours on this than most of our other classes. But I'm sure people have been complaining about that for a while. It just practically affects how much work I could put into my project: it made it such that I needed a whole extra class to have enough credits, when I could have done only 3 classes and dedicated more time to this class.",
                "The course is a culmination of all of the material we've learned throughout the engineering curriculum, and it teaches you how to use all of those topics. It also teaches you how to work with a client and give concise and useful presentations. However, the course was a little disorganized and it wasn't always clear what was expected of us.",
                "Strengths: I had a lot of ownership over the project, which was nice I guess\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the instructor, the clients, the completely unreasonable workload and timelines",
                "Strengths: a year-long build project is undoubtedly a great experience for those interested in iterative design and industry. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lack of class organization, clear guidelines for any assignments, the disproportionate workload between this and basically any other majors senior thesis requirement (including those that give students 2 credits, not 1.5, over the year), and basically everything else.",
                "This course should be worth at least 1 credit.",
                "The lectures were probably necessary but did not add much. I think they could if more effort had been put in.\r\nA lot of the documentation requirements did not make sense for our project so we sometimes had to figure out ways to reverse-engineer them. \r\nThis second half of the course was only a half-credit, which I guess helps explain why basically nothing was ever posted on Canvas for it. We admittedly did eventually get grades for design review 4 (the first of two this semester) about a month later."

                "Look, if you are reading this review it isn't like you have much of a choice in taking this class since you need it to graduate. I will say that without fail this class is by far the worst I have taken at Yale. Starting out with the basics: this class is only half a credit. The workload does NOT even remotely look like a half credit course - it really should be 1.5-2 credits, but Yale admin doesn't like the idea of a thesis being that many credits. Try to minimize the number of classes you take outside of this course because it will take up a ridiculous amount of time. Outside of this: this class made my life a literal hell for the entire duration of the project. Professor Booth is a really petty person, and will hold it against you if you don't use his ideas (even when sometimes they aren't good ideas and the entire rest of the instructor team agrees). He also sometimes sets really unrealistic expectations in terms of timelines/when to get things done, causing team members to lose sleep so they can work on this class for an excessive amount of time. Professor Booth has a habit of completely disregarding and undermining the students in front of client teams; many times, my teammates and I literally could not get a word in edgewise during meetings with our clients because Booth was so eager to voice his opinion over ours. To give him some credit, when I spoke to him about this and how it made him look like he was in charge of the project to our clients, he changed some of his behavior. He also would sometimes belittle students in front of clients, and when this was presented to him he offered a non-apology and changed basically nothing about his behavior. He prioritizes his opinions and ideas over the students, and is completely unwilling to consider students ideas as being remotely equal to his.",
                "I think you should literally have an industry job lined up that forces you to stay in ABET (me). Other than that, think about it.",
                "Great hands on experience, and will take a fair chunk of your time. Make sure you enjoy your project!",
                "This class is a LOT of work. Your experience depends a lot on your project.",
                "If you aren't ABET, you're probably better off taking 471/472 and doing something you're personally passionate about."
