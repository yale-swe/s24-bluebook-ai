                "You really get over writer's block and become a better writer",
                "I learned how to set a daily writing routine of around 300 words per day, and in the process, learned about myself, the challenges and travails of writing and literature, and how the process of daily writing should not be romanticized. Most importantly, I learned that it was okay for writing to be unpolished, unfinished, or even unedited - the act of writing itself can be difficult and putting words down on the page is so, so crucial to improving as a writer. Throughout the semester, I learned so many tips and tricks from listening to the advice of Prof. Oppenheimer and the Daily Themes tutors, as well as simply reading and observing the world around me. I am incredibly grateful that during this tumultuous time in the world, I was able to sit down and write over 70 pages worth of content in 13 weeks, each of which could be the bud for a longer story that is waiting to be told. This class is not easy, and it is a challenge, but it is one that I have deeply learned from and appreciated. I know when I look back on my Yale experience, this class will be one that I am grateful to have taken.",
                "I wrote a page a day for the entire semester, which improved my writing ability, vocabulary, and storytelling.",
                "Became a much better writer. Almost all writings are creative, but I think the efficiency of my writing improved which has helped for all types of writing.",
                "I learned a lot about the craft of creative writing. Descriptive imagery, dialogue, character, and tone were all things I worked on.",
                "I learned how to push my writing style, to experiment more, and to think creatively when presented with a challenging prompt.",
                "I developed my creative skills through writing daily. I learned how to edit my work while also seeing my pieces through the audience. I learned how to write for others.",
                "I was exposed to fiction writing and was granted a much deeper insight into the art of writing, telling stories, and thinking about language.",
                "the discipline to write every day and a slight increased knowledge re the mechanics of writing but not enough to warrant the work",
                "I love to write creative nonfiction, so this was the first time I was able to work on my fiction writing and have individual feedback. I'm not sure how much I improved in this course (fiction maybe more-so, but I didn't feel I improved for creative nonfiction).",
                "My writing skills have vastly improved!",
                "I developed daily writing habits",
                "Honestly I did not learn that much in terms of the specific techniques or approaches to writing. Mainly the class gives more exposure to what good writers think about good writing, their opinions, and that allows you to form an informal intuition about things.",
                "I learned how to write creatively.",
                "I developed a much stronger practice of daily writing and am much less intimidated by short writing assignments now.",
                "writing, editing, taking criticism, public speaking, communication with professors, research, maintaining daily habits",
                "I greatly improved my writing, especially my fiction writing.",
                "How to write for fun and without scrutinizing or heavily editing while maintaining some decency and storyline",
                "This course changed the way I approached writing. The daily 300-word prompts challenged us to experiment with a variety of writing styles, voices, techniques, and topics. Reading other people's exemplary writings each week was very inspiring and provided new ideas. The podcasts were quite informative and the weekly sessions with tutors were invaluable. I gained so much insight from my tutor Donald Brown's comments.",
                "It was interesting to learn to hone one's writing skills by practicing writing out a piece regardless of how much you like it or not.",
                "I felt that I developed more of a strict writing ritual and become more comfortable with writing regularly, even on days when I wasn't feeling incredibly inspired.",
                "I improved my ability to write  sounds dumb, but as a student journalist, I had never focused so much on the craft of writing before. I found my tutor to be very helpful and knowledgable",
                "This class is wonderful as a way to practice your writing. If you don't have any experience with creative writing, this class is a great chance to push yourself to commit to a short writing practice every day.",
                "Great breadth of writing skills",
                "So much about writing and I got to practice, too",
                "How to become a better writer! Super applicable to any type of writing you want to do. And how to give up the preciousness of writing and just get in the habit of writing.",
                "Through repetition and quantity I became a more conscious and critical prose writer. I was able to set aside a part of my every day for writing, which was challenging at times but extremely rewarding.",
                "I learned a lot about myself as a writer, and it was very helpful hearing my peers' writing. I also learned a lot about being committed to something every day.",
                "I learnt how to communicate my ideas concisely in a short story with a clear structure. I learnt how to take an idea and make it into a coherent, full story, and how to edit it for concision so it is easy to read. I also learnt how to develop my writers voice, and edit it so it can be more clearly communicated.",
                "How to put words on a page and how to be comfortable with bad writing. Valuable skills for any career, in my opinion. I still don't think I want to become a capital-W-Writer, but I might try my hand at something creative again in the future."

            "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved? (Your anonymous response to this question may be viewed by Yale College students, faculty, and advisers to aid in course selection and evaluating teaching.) ",
            "comments": [
                "One of the strengths of this course is that students get meetings with one of the amazing tutors to receive feedback and discuss the themes produced each week. This is the only class I've taken at Yale so far that incorporates 1-on-1 meetings for feedback, which has been extremely helpful and provided deeper insight on my writing than could the normal mode of feedback for writing classes. Another great thing about Daily Themes is that it's taught by Mark Oppenheimer, who is not only an excellent lecturer but is also energetic and enthusiastic. His teaching never disappoints, and is one of the classes that I actually look forward to attending (and I took this class virtually, so that's quite impressive!).",
                "I really liked the podcast format, since it makes virtual learning a lot more interesting. In fact, I found the podcast format easier to pay attention to than any in-person English lecture I've had at Yale.",
                "Strengths: tutor relationship, podcast lectures (a great break from staring at screens), interesting conversation.\r\nWeaknesses: Wish that in-person lectures were a little more interactive, and, though most of the lectures felt relevant to the craft of writing, a few left me scratching my head about what I could take away from them.",
                "This was the most worthwhile class I took at Yale. I would definitely take during your junior or senior year - when you have more life experience to write a theme a day. The only suggestion I have for improvement would be for more themes to be revisions of prior themes",
                "The highlight of this course are the tutors. It is so special to be able to meet with your tutor and discuss your writing with them in-depth, every week, and to get to know them. There are so few classes at Yale that give you this level of individualized attention to help you improve. The tutors are all such interesting, engaging, and passionate people who genuinely wish to see you improve and offer such practical feedback to make you improve. The other strength of this course is the fact that the themes are not graded and the work is graded as a collective. This really reduces the academic pressure of this class and allows for experimentation and risk-taking that a strict grading regimen often prohibits. I really wish that all classes at Yale were graded and assessed this way, rather than putting the weight on particular assignments. And finally, the last strength of this course is the fact that it is daily themes - making us write daily, while can be stressful alongside other classes' work, really lets you get into the habit of not romanticizing writing as well as making sure you are practicing writing consistently. I really appreciated the opportunity to take our Daily Themes work and then translate that into a longer, two-week piece at the end of the semester as well. This was an experience that really made me ponder and reflect on the stories I wanted to write and craft.\r\n\r\nI would say the only weakness of this course is that sometimes, the prompts can be a bit repetitive or rather cliche, which makes them a bit boring to write about.",
                "The main strength of the course is simply writing once a day. It also benefits from great podcasts and tutors. The main weakness was the revamped lecture, which were mostly engaging and fun, but occasionally (especially towards the end of the semester) became professor Oppenheimer and the tutors discussing books that I think most students had never read/heard of.",
                "Great course! Would totally recommend if you like creative writing. I got slightly burned out at the end from churning out something everday, but I never stopped enjoying it.",
                "I thought the pre-recorded lectures were great, but the live virtual lectures were a bit dull. Working one on one with the tutors is a fantastic experience though because they really get to know your writing. I loved my tutor, and she helped me make significant improvements in my writing.",
                "The strength of the course is undoubtedly the weekly meetings with a tutor. This was an excellent way to reflect on my writing.",
                "Strengths: The weekly meetings with the writing tutor were so helpful. As someone with no workshop background, having a set time each week where someone gives feedback on your pieces gave me the opportunity to work on my writing style, without being overshadowed by others in a group setting. Also, the daily assignments keep you accountable; some days are worse than others, but everyday I tried to use the feedback from last week in my new pieces. I also thought the podcast lectures were a good way to split up the lectures online. \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the weekly lectures had less actionable advice than I would have liked; workshopping a specific piece (maybe with the Word Review tool) would have been nice.",
                "A strength was that the work was very flexible and could be as personal or impersonal as the writer saw fit; you made the class what you wanted it to be.\r\n\r\nA weakness is that we didn't get to spend as much time on the different aspects of writing each week than I think they deserved, but it was a nice introduction into them anyway.",
                "Strengths: the premise of writing every day, Mark, podcast lectures, final short story assignment (voluntary)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: tutor meetings are kinda useless because they address super micro aspects of your work without granting any advice on how to grow as a writer, live lectures offered little, prompts sometimes felt restrictive, I found the length of the pieces frustrating (would have preferred to work on longer pieces every day than create individual 300-word blurbs), workload",
                "I really struggled with the format of this coursewhich I recognize may be more a me problem than anything to do with the course. Basically, I found the lectures to be super thematic, but with little practical writing advice. My favorite lecture was from a guest lecturer who spoke about metaphor; I found it helpful because in addition to giving examples, which the normal podcast lectures were chock full of, it gave tips and tricks for implementing metaphor into your writing. I think the tutor idea was good in theory, but I felt that 30 minutes was too short for how much we wrote a week. I also often felt like I wasn't sure what I was supposed to say to my tutor after they gave their feedback, since there was a lack of continuity from theme to theme.",
                "I absolutely loved this course. Nothing to improve.",
                "The course was very engaging because there was a whole community of writers bonding together over daily writing, which enhanced the quality of learning.",
                "Professor Oppenheimer was not as accessible as one would like, granted there being constraints due to a global pandemic. Overall I think there was very little ability to engage in the material and rigorously analyze it. This felt more of Oppenheimer pontificating with only minimal student interjection",
                "This is a great class. Its a lot of work but worth taking for the learning process. Even though its heavy in terms of raw workload, its still not too difficult.",
                "all strengths. this is an amazing class and my only regret was not getting to take it in person",
                "More writing feedback from tutors: 1 hour per week with tutors as opposed to 30 minutes. Meetings with tutors always felt like a sprint against time. One needed to be selective about which writing pieces to talk about and how much detail to discuss the pieces in, because of the very limited time, which doesn't validate the amount of time students spend writing each individual theme, if some themes are never discussed due to time constraints.",
                "Strengths: INVALUABLE weekly one-on-one tutor sessions with experienced professional writers, being assigned daily prompts completely changes the way you approach writing and puts you in a completely different mindset, Mark is a very engaging lecturer and had fun podcasts!\r\n\r\nI wouldn't necessarily say there is any weakness but the workload is very high so don't take the course if you do not have the time. This is the equivalent of 2 or 3 classes in one. The podcasts were a little bit rambly at times but I enjoyed them for the most part and they were a nice change in our COVID year.",
                "I loved the podcast format of the class and think that Prof Oppenheimer did everything he could to engage us in such a strange year. I always looked forward to listening to the podcast and think it helped ease any Zoom fatigue that a 2 hour virtual lecture would create.",
                "Obviously it's tough to write a piece a day -- but that's the whole point. I would say sometimes after the podcast, the lecture didn't feel as engaging because the material was covered in the podcast itself and so the lecture was just more chatting with Mark and the tutors.",
                "If you're interested in trying your hand at creative writing, this is the class to take. Having a personal tutor who will only follow your writing for a semester is so helpful... it's like singing in front of a stranger: less nerve-wracking, fewer stakes. At the same time, my tutor was also extremely helpful as a sounding board / reaction gauge for the stuff I put out.\r\n\r\nI didn't like the prompts or X-themes (exemplary themes) chosen by Professor Oppenheimer at times (I thought they were sometimes a little cheesy), but that might just be a difference in writing style between us.",
                "Professor was great. Learning concepts and mentor component were good. \r\n\r\nAs the course went on, it felt like the professor was less prepared.\r\n\r\nSome way to indicate interests to align with mentors might help. Didn't feel like my mentor shared writing interests with me (nature writing).",
                "Writing 5 days a week can obviously become tiring some weeks, but overall it really works! Ive definitely become a better writer, and most of all, become better at overcoming writers block. The class gave me an opportunity to try lots of different types of writing and the weekly meetings with the tutor are amazing. When else are you going to have a personal editor giving you detailed feedback on every single thing you write?",
                "Strengths: Prof. Oppenheimer is a swell guy, tutor P. Franz is too; themes were well selected; lectures engaging; daily writing is a sound idea and this class is built to foster it\r\nweaknesses: There is a certain aloofness that accompanies this class and some other English department course at Yale. Though Prof. Oppenheimer tries hard to create an engaging environment, his insights and lecture discussions can at times give one the sense that too many Yale-affiliated individuals have never stepped outside elite/academic circles.",
                "This course was probably my favorite. I think the workload is very fair and the lectures are engaging. Writing a short amount every day is a highly personal, vulnerable, essential experience. Meeting individually with a writing tutor was a highlight of the class. One improvement is I wish the meetings with our writing tutors were longer! 30 minutes once a week is not enough.",
                "The podcast lectures were very engaging and interesting, and the writing tutor meetings were very effective at giving thorough feedback on the ways our writing and our writers voice can be developed. The course also exposed me to various writers and their ways of telling stories.",
                "Strengths: Professor Oppenheimer! And the tutors! Everyone involved in teaching this course was wonderful and so knowledgeable. It felt like a privilege to be in this class. The structure was also great and the prompts were mostly useful, too. I really appreciated that we had a choice about whether to do a lengthier final project and that the work was spread out evenly, instead of piled up around midterms and finals. In all of the ways that matter, this course was superb. I'm recommending to all of my friends.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: communication about grades. In a class like this, even mentioning the word 'grades' feels dirty. Professor Oppenheimer and the tutors all do a really good job of trying to get us to focus on the point of the class rather than just grubbing for a grade. But as much as I'd like to be free of my GPA, I'm not. Would have really appreciated a bit more clarity about where I stood at the mid-semester mark rather than just 'doing a pretty solid job'."

                "The weekend lecture podcasts were well made and meshed well with the course. For the virtual synchronous meetings on Monday, it might have been interesting to use breakout rooms or class polls for student engagement. Sometimes, I felt like I was just watching the professor and the tutors have a conversation.",
                "I honestly thought this course was really well-done in terms of the pandemic. We had a recorded podcast every weekall of these were really fascinating, and well-produced. Then we had a live lecture, which was also pretty interactive. Going through the X-Themes and then people's thoughts on lecture, was really good. And finally we had the 1:1 meetings with our tutors, which were definitely engaging. So, on the whole, I think this course did a really good job handling the pandemic.",
                "The podcast was a huge success in my opinion, I thought it made perfect use of the situation.",
                "I liked the podcasts",
                "I liked the weekly podcast but I wasn't obsessed with them. I actually struggle with auditory learning, so it was very easy for me to listen to without really listening.",
                "The podcasts were great!",
                "The podcast lectures before the real life lecture meeting was good since it enabled me to reduce screen time.",
                "Mark kept the online lectures short and substituted them with podcasts which was really helpful. I appreciated that.",
                "the podcast lecture was fantastic and also so great in a time when students really needed a reason to slow down",
                "The break days spread throughout the semester made it difficult to establish a rhythm of writing and the deadlines of the course were sometimes nebulous (for example it is implied but not stated in the syllabus that the long project is due when the final theme is - this makes sense, of course, but it would be helpful to have some explicit mention).",
                "The podcast was really engaging and exciting to listen to! I loved that the zoom lecture became more of a response to the podcast in a discussion-style format. The one-on-one tutor sessions were quite effective on zoom.",
                "I thought that the weekly podcasts were a great way of delivering the lecture material in a fun and condensed format.",
                "The professor made weekly podcasts to listen to before the virtual live lecture sessions, which was refreshing and engaging!",
                "Again, I think splitting time between a podcast and a Zoom lecture created some variance  in learning and kept the class exciting by ensuring the live class was for more interactive content, while the  podcast was for more lecture-like content.",
                "The podcast was a good alternative to a second zoom lecture. 1-on-1 zoom meetings with mentors were also good.",
                "",
                "Professor Oppenheimer recorded the lectures as podcasts that sounded so professional and were a joy to listen to. It was also nice because it gave our eyes a break from looking at the screen!",
                "The live virtual lectures were very effective but were difficult to implement the Weekly Happening which is an event that everyone in the class writes about. The tutor meetings were effective, although it was difficult to edit the writing side by side without being in person with a print of the daily theme being analyzed.",
                "The podcasts were a success; great way for me to destress on a Sunday night. Professor Oppenheimer is lovely to listen to and Robert The Editor does a fantastic job. Professor Oppenheimer also offered in-person coffee chats once vaccines starting coming out, and that was a great addition. \r\n\r\nNothing to improve, really. All of the sucky parts about being on Zoom were kind of unavoidable. The ways that Professor Oppenheimer tried to compensate did a better than average job of filling the gap between in-person and what we had to work with."

            "comments": [
                "Yes, if you enjoy writing you will definitely love this course! Be prepared that it is a big commitment due to the fact that you have to submit your work daily, but the writings are short (~300 words) and the prompts are fun and flexible, and usually leave you with a lot of room as far as what you choose to write about. The weekly 1-on-1 writing tutor meetings really provide a great way to get immediate, personalized feedback each week which was super helpful. The prompts were also very diverse, so weather you're interested in writing modern non-fiction, sci-fi, historical almost new-report style pieces, you name it, there will be an opportunity to write what you want to write. Also, there is an option at the end to write a longer pice (~1500 words) of your choosing, so you can definitely get really creative with that one and write whatever you want.",
                "Yes! Building a relationship with someone invested in your writing and developing regular writing habits is THE point of this class. Everything else is interesting, fun, but incidental. The point of the course is to spur yourself to write more, and think about how you can write better with your tutor.",
                "Yes! Even if you are not into creative writing, I think there is something so freeing about writing 300 words a day. Definitely take it during a semester when you have the time to dedicate to it",
                "Yes! Lots of work, but this course has changed my life (for the better)!",
                "If you take this class, you must take it knowing what you are getting into. There are no ifs, ands, or buts - you are committing to daily writing. If you are excited or even scared by that commitment, that is probably a good thing. But once you've made the commitment, there is no going back and there is no point in regretting that you made it, because that commitment opens the door to a course that is incredibly engaging, stimulating, and rewarding. That is why I would 100% recommend this course to anyone at Yale that is willing to put in the time and effort to really write and learn to write well.",
                "Yes, if you want structure and to improve your writing. A lot of work, though.",
                "Yes, definitely! If you like creative writing, take it.",
                "I'd definitely recommend Daily Themes to another student. It can be a grind sometimes because you're writing every day, but it really made a difference in my writing. Most of the prompts were fun to write about, and it provided a creative break from my other classes (I'm a STEM major).",
                "Absolutely! Its an excellent way to challenge and improve your writing.",
                "If you're looking for an introductory creative writing course, Daily Themes is for you. You don't need a lot of background knowledge to take this class, and the writing tutors do a great job at giving you feedback while not impeding your own writing style. The daily assignments seem daunting at first, but once you put less pressure on yourself they are easier to write. The class makes you examine your own writing for an outside audience, which I found helpful since I'd never done that before.",
                "Daily Themes comes with my highest recommendation. The class itself is a genius idea, and quite a lot of fun. Mark and all of the tutors are simply excellent. I didn't find the workload to be overly burdensome, and not having any quizzes, tests, problem sets, et cetera allowed me to really focus on my writing. This was probably my favorite class this semester.",
                "I recommend every single person, regardless of their experience in writing or English, to take this class. It will create a space where you learn to perceive the world differently.",
                "I don't know how to answer this. I think there are students who would enjoy this course. If you're comfortable with short pieces and strict prompts and you think you can fit this into your routine without getting overwhelmed, go for it.\r\n\r\nI personally found it very frustrating. Though I am proud of myself for writing every day and for amassing a body of work, I felt like daily themes kept me from fully engaging in my other classes because it sapped my creativity and energy to write. As the semester progressed, I felt like my quality of work declined because I was mechanically producing these meaningless short pieces that I didn't feel invested in because I had no higher goal to work toward. (With the exception of the final short story, an assignment I loved.) Of course, writing isn't always going to come out well which is a key theme of the course  but when it didn't, you never had to opportunity to revise.  Ultimately, I think the premise of writing every single day is super useful and that discipline was something I needed to work on, but at the same time, this class was the wrong way for me to go about cultivating that. \r\n\r\nTLDR: its complicated. Wouldnt universally recommend or not recommend. I think the value of the experience really depends on the person",
                "No. I really did not like the structure of this course. I felt that the podcast lectures were primarily thematic and that the in person lectures were a waste of time, as the only thing we really did was read others' X themes and then had some general questions answered. A large part of this is that the course is predicated on the belief that daily writing makes you better, but this course was not able to convince me as such. I think I got better at time management during this course after one too many nights of waking up at 2 and realizing I hadn't completed my daily theme, but for this reason, and the fact that I don't struggle to get words on the page, it felt very easy to write 300 uninspiring words and call it dayespecially since we weren't getting grades or working on revisionswhich is not beneficial to the writer. I knew some others in the course, and I think that the people who get the most out of it are non-English majors because there is that excitement of writing in this way for the first time. As an English major intending to complete the writing concentration, I think the practice of synthesizing a piece into 300 words could have been good, but the above reasons, I didn't gain from that stipulation.",
                "Yes, this was the best course I've ever taken at Yale. Not only do you improve as a writer, but you also just improve so much in all aspects: incorporating feedback, thinking about the world, and creating the discipline of just writing every day. It's really amazing seeing my growth throughout the semester, and the growth of all of my classmates. It was an incredible class even online, I can't imagine how great it would be in person!",
                "Yes! You will thrive as a writer. So much fun!",
                "Yes, it is a really good way to build writing discipline and connect with a community of writers who may not necessarily be Creative Writing majors.",
                "Yes but not because it's a good class per se, rather because you develop a meaningful 1:1 relationship with your tutor and that is something that doesn't happen so easily in other classes.",
                "I would, especially to a non-writer.",
                "Yes. This class is a lot of work, but if you're willing to put that in, it's worth taking.",
                "YES. such a great class for any and every student",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely!! Do not graduate if you have not taken this course!!",
                "Yes, everyone should take this course. It can be challenging at times to get the daily writing done, but it is a constant battle that reaps constant rewards because it feels great to write everyday and to keep routine.",
                "This course changed my life. The comments and attention you receive from professional tutors are invaluable. It is phenomenal but it is definitely a commitment. It requires hours of creative thought, and did lead to more than a few sleepless nights. Nevertheless, I would recommend it to anyone who would like to grow as a writer, and a human being.",
                "Yes, it's an awesome course",
                "I would highly recommend Daily Themes to any student who wants to work on their prose writing and develop a daily writing routine.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to any student that is looking to explore their creative side, whether they're a writer or not. I thought it was really valuable to have such a consistent writing routine this semester.",
                "Yes!!! But you must know what you are signing up for.",
                "Yes, absolutely, if you want to try your hand at creative writing and are really dedicated to it as a craft. I appreciated that the class was graded on effort  I didn't feel judged for my work, and I felt confident that since I spent a lot of thought and energy into each night's piece and didn't skip any, grades wouldn't be something to stress over. Plus, I agree with Professor Oppenheimer that there is really no other way to learn how to write except to do it repeatedly. This class is the perfect chance to do that under grading pressure. When else will you have a chance like this to practice your authorship for a non-judgmental grade?",
                "Absolutely. Everyone who would like to become a better writer should consider this course as a fun alternative to more technical writing courses.",
                "YES. Writing 5 days a week is actually not that bad, the pieces are fairly short. You learn a lot about what type of writer you are and getting feedback on every single thing you write is amazing.",
                "Yes, if they're willing to commit to writing everyday, and giving it their all, definitely. Definitely a class that can help one reconsider their relationship to writing and try out new styles, forms, and techniques day after day.",
                "Absolutely. One of the best classes at Yale.",
                "I highly recommend this course to any student that wants to learn how to be a better writer, and how to develop ideas into an interesting and engaging story. It also equips you with the necessary skills to develop your own unique writers voice, and how to be creative when developing a story.",
                "Yes!!! If three exclamation points didn't convince you, I'll say it again: yes!!! This course is a wonderful writing credit choice. Professor Oppenheimer is dedicated to his students and makes every effort to teach in an engaging way. The tutors are quirky, but each contributes something unique to the writing process. No matter who you get, by the end of the semester you will have learned from them about yourself, your writing style, and principles of writing in general.\r\n\r\nThe course was true to what Professor Oppenheimer laid out in the introductory lecture, so if you give that a listen you should be well-informed. Highly, highly recommend even if you don't consider yourself a writer. \r\n\r\nAlso recommend taking it with a friend if you can! Was a unique experience to be able to talk (and complain) about the class to someone who actually knows what it's like."
