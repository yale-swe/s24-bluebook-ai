                "Strengths were that Corey knows this stuff super well and even does research on some of the topics in class so the instruction is great. Some of the topics covered never seemed to build anywhere and there was no description of practical uses of things covered. For instance, discussion of uses in aeronautics of moment of inertia tensors would be super cool. Add videos like in fluid mechanics. There is MATLAB in the psets though and often those excercises are pretty useless.",
                "Despite being one of the core courses in mechanical engineering and being labeled a MENG class, the course is taught like a theoretical physics or math class. For engineers who are used to the more applied versions of their math\/physics counterparts (ENAS 151 multivariable calc, MENG 211 thermodynamics, etc.) this class will be very difficult and confusing. Just pages of derivations and confusing notation. Honestly felt more like a sequel to linear algebra than anything else. I did well in the course and understood the content but literally have no idea how any of this is applied to the real world or how I will use this knowledge as a practicing engineer. The course needs major restructuring. We were also supposed to be assigned a HW every two weeks, but only ended up receiving 4 homework assignments over the course of the semester???? When it came time for midterm 2, no one in the class had any real practice on the content we were being tested on or relevant feedback on our performance besides a few practice exams (which were always wildly different from the real exam material). Makes things pretty difficult and anxiety-inducing when each exam is worth 35% of your grade. Again, pretty disappointing.",
                "I'm not sure what I learned. Everything was very theoretical.",
                "This course was taught in a very abstract, math-based way. It was hard to understand the significance of a lot of what we were doing. As someone who doesn't have strong math skills in linear and generally does not perform well in classes that are very academic in nature, I struggled to follow. This course would benefit from providing real world applications of the concepts we go over and motivating why we're doing what we're doing.",
                "As odd as it sounds, this course didn't have enough homework. We did about 1 problem set every month with 2-3 multi step questions, but they never really focused on what material we were exactly learning, which meant that I spent significant time in the help sessions for every problem set to understand what I was trying to do. I think it would benefit the course to have more homework assignments with more but simpler questions so that we have a chance to apply the information we learn in lecture before we see it on the tests.",
                "Strengths - lectures were more interactive since this isn't too large of a class, I feel like Corey does a pretty good job of explaining concepts that are really difficult, TAs are super helpful and run homework sessions that break down complex proofs\/assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - not to be like 'we need more homework', but we would take exams with only one or two psets worth of problems (which was usually like 2 problems per pset) which was stressful because of just a lack of practice with problems. Practice exams were posted, which was helpful in remedying that, but it still was a concern. Also, the class is definitely very difficult if you haven't taken linear algebra, and there is a pretty steep learning curve for Matlab. In my opinion, just what you learn from ENAS 130 isn't really sufficient for this class, so in order to do the Matlab sections of the homework you probably need to either go to the TA help sessions or have some other experience with it.",
                "Incredibly theoretical material. The whole time it felt like a slightly advanced physics course rather than anything to do with engineering, which was concerning given that 'dynamics' is considered one of the most important fundamental concepts for Mechanical Engineering. Could be improved by showing us how any of these concepts could be applied in an actual engineering scenario. Sure, I know how to calculate the semilatus rectum of an orbiting object but is that what aerospace engineers actually do? What kind of programs and models do actual engineers use to apply dynamics concepts? Even just an overview of this stuff would be helpful to make us feel like we're not just doing math.",
                "TA's and ULA's are super helpful in-office hours.\r\nAttending review sessions are a must as these questions are similar to exam questions \r\nProfessor cares about student engagement but doesn't always explain this clearly and tends to rush \r\nOnly had 5 psets the whole semester which was great for me because it meant less weekly work but sometimes it was daunting having an exam on something you had not practiced but here review sessions become useful",
                "The infrequent PSets allowed me some rest in an otherwise hellish semester and allowed me to spend more time with the TAs actually learning the material. That being said, this course was VERY theory and math-heavy and I just struggled to connect with the material with the lack of real-world examples."

He wrote super quickly, never uploaded the notes, and when he needed to find something he would scroll around through basically an entire class worth page of notes. I see the necessity to write on the ipad due to virtual constraints but a bit more organization would have made the class easier to follow. After this class, I never want to see a grey notepad again.",
                "The lectures were transitioned to zoom lectures using an iPad instead of a chalkboard. I have seen other profs pull this off, but because of the way Prof. O'Hern organized his notes on the iPad, it was hard to keep up. He'd often scroll down before I got to finish writing what he wrote.",
                "Corey held in person lectures, which was a great way to maintain engagement. However, he utilized his iPad to record notes instead of setting up a camera for the blackboard, which led to some difficulty viewing some of his notes before they left the screen.",

I don't feel like I absorbed much of the material we went over and think we didn't really get to content that would be useful in applied settings. For instance, we needed to use dynamics to analyze a kinematic system in another class I was in, and looking back I think we may have learned the necessary info in this class, but we just focused on the more abstract math-y side of the concept, that I never would have connected what we did in the other class to the concepts we learned in this class. I feel like if we learned dynamics in a more application-based way, it still would have been hard, but I may have understood the content.",
                "It's obviously a requirement for MechE majors, but if anyone else is looking at this class for electives, don't. There are much more fun ones that will be worth your time.",
                "I mean you're probably not taking this course unless you're ABET MechE, or you're interested in a really niche area of applied math or physics, but I think the course is run well and you would get something out of it. That said, it is difficult content, and you need to be good at matlab and have taken linear algebra to start to understand what's going on, so I wouldn't recommend it unless you are interested and meet the prerequisites.",
                "If you're taking this course, you're probably ABET MechE. In which case my recommendation is irrelevant cause you don't have a choice. If you're BS 12 idk if you have to take this, if you don't then maybe skip this one. You're probably better off taking a hands-on elective or something that will teach you concepts you can more easily apply to engineering. Then again, many engineering jobs expect you to know dynamics.",
                "Yes, I would. If you're an applied math major this is one of the better mechanical engineering classes to take mostly because of how it is structured (optional final) and way more computational math and less emphasis on mechanical engineering applied to the real world.",
