                "Strengths: Professor Diaz was great and very helpful. He gave clear feedback that helped me improve my writing. The projects and assignments were interesting and explored a lot of different aspects of the culture of Spanish-speaking countries.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The organization of the course could have been improved. We were not able to access an accurate syllabus as the assignments for my section did not exactly match the assignments listed in the syllabus for all SPAN 130 classes. At times there is a lot of busy work (particularly the supersite assignments).",
                "The only significant weakness is disorganization. Sometimes, especially compared to my course last semester, it could be difficult to find which assignments were due at different points over the semester. The major strength was feedback. The instructor was always swift and abundant in the amount of feedback he gave, which helped my learning dramatically.",
                "I would appreciate a more clear\/coherent syllabus. The one we were given was reused from several semesters ago, and did not have accurate dates.",
                "Senor Diaz was a fantastic instructor. The strengths were his flexibility and emphasis on growth rather than just grades. I would say a weakness of the course was I don't know if I improved in my speaking abilities but for sure improved with my writing.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- all in Spanish, this gave lots of practice time!\r\n- there were plenty of reading materials to practice reading skills. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Assignments didnt usually didnt match up with what we were doing in class (on supersite). Sometimes had to read the book on my own to learn the grammar and then do the supersite",
                "Weaknesses- doesnt teach grammar in a practical way, all learned by yourself",
                "I think it's a little formulaic, and it's easy to not participate. However, it's a good time, and it helps you learn spanish",
                "strengths: lots of interacting with classes, a variety of assignments lows: high workload"

                "Yes I would. The course is very challenging, but I learned a lot. The way the course is set up also makes it possible for people of a fairly wide range of skill levels to learn.",
                "If needs be.",
                "Yes because it is 1.5 credits and it wasn't that hard and you learn spanish."
