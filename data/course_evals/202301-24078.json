                "So many skills! I had no prior experience with South Indian music before this class, and I learned so much. I also got better at rhythm in general from working through the complicated rhythms.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths - Performance aspect- being able to work through the rhythms yourself and actually internalize them rather than just studying them was so critical for this class. Loved that aspect! I also thought the contextualization we did at the beginning of the course was very good and much needed for the rhythms we were dealing with. Weakness - Sometimes the assignments felt like a lot in a given week and then not a lot the next, maybe evening them out would be helpful!",
                "The layout of the course is great. Starting with a conceptual discussion and then moving into solkattu in the second half is a very productive use of the class's time. In terms of the solkattu, I LOVED the choices of what rhythms we learned, and it was so satisfying to put them all together in the end. \r\nI think the class could be a LITTLE shorter - maybe 2 and a half hours instead of three - adjusting by making the historical conversations a bit more directional and fast-paced.\r\nI would have loved for the essay assignments to be due on Fridays instead of on Wednesdays to give us the whole week to work on them. I think having the video performances due on Wednesday made sense, though.\r\nI would have loved for the historical /cultural discussions and the solkattu to have a bit of a stronger connection. Obviously they are inherently tied, but sometimes they felt a bit in a vacuum and isolated from each other. Watching videos of performances helped a lot with making this tie, so watching more videos in class could be good--maybe we watch a performance that incorporates a composition that we are about to learn.\r\nI did not love Perusall because I prefer reading things on a flat surface or printed out. Maybe the one Perusall assignment we had could have been a discussion post instead.",
                "The material was very engaging, and I liked that our grade was mainly based on performance.\r\n\r\nFor some of the larger assignments, we would discuss on Friday and they would be due the following Wednesday, which sometimes wouldn't be enough time for me. If we were notified a bit sooner that would be helpful."

                "Yes! I hope it is offered again. It was a fantastic course that really opened me up to a new form of music and also allowed me to apply it to my own world. Being able to do the performance aspect is a game changer - makes the course totally worth it!",
                "Yes! Speaking from experience, it's a great way to learn about a different style of music for music majors who are perhaps not familiar with Carnatic music. This class is really special and intimate and one-of-a-kind at Yale.",
                "Yes! There aren't many practical courses in the music department that 1) cover non-western music or 2) focus on rhythms, so  to have one that does both is special."
