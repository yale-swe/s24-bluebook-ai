                "I practiced taking on different frameworks when considering various questions concerning diaspora, identity, and migration. I learned about historic migratory patterns between and within Asian societies and nation-states as well as the migration of Asian peoples beyond Asia. This course successfully exposed me to an incredible variety of Asian diasporic experiences, and we practiced taking on a viewpoint that seeks to examine these experiences without confining them epistemologically.",
                "As an ER&M major I became familiar with the history of Asian migration--the forces the push, connect, and stop the movement of people from place to place. More significantly, I became familiar with using \"diaspora\" as a framework of analysis--the emphasis on movement, mobility, and transformation of people, places, histories, and ideas. There was therefore both a content based knowledge expansion and a skills based one. During the COVID epidemic,  this class was instrumental in helping me recalibrate what is important to me, how to imagine a new manner of relating to my history and to the histories of others, in order to better society.",
                "I gained a rich understanding of diaspora that truly helped me understand history, geography, and politics of the Asian\/Asian-American identity. This class was incredible.",
                "Through this class I learned a lot about history, but also how to conceptualize global racial dynamics and migrations, as well as my own position within Asian diasporas.",
                "I developed a lot of knowledge about Asian diasporas, not just historically, but also theoretically in examining movement\/migration, border politics, and well as foundational texts to examining power structures and nuances in this class and ER&M subjects more broadly. The midterm\/final were not based in research as much as in-class texts, so I also learned a lot of critical reading and synthesizing skills.",
                "I learned different frameworks for analyzing historical archives, how to read between the lines, and also the complicated, nuanced bounds of \"Asian\" and \"diaspora\"."

                "I thought that the pacing and weekly themes of this class were organized wonderfully. I especially appreciated the inclusion of various guest speakers in the curriculum. Professor Tran really cares about her students and provided helpful feedback throughout the semester, as well as during office hours. The course's flexibility with the final project also allowed for many creative final projects, which I appreciated. Can't think of any specific weaknesses, but perhaps more small-group activities during class or having a few students present on a reading or text each week would help with encouraging participation, as there were some moments where the discussion moved a little slowly.",
                "Strengths: Professor Tran is incredible, interesting readings, guest speakers, and engaging events. No weaknesses.",
                "Professor Tran was very clear in her expectations for the course, something extra helpful given the online format during the pandemic. The course also was the strongest I've taken in terms of its syllabus. Professor Tran pulled together so many different readings that all worked together so well in exposing us to key tensions in the field of Asian diaspora studies while also continuing to expand our thinking about different Asian diasporas.",
                "The strength of this course are the diverse selection of readings, the pedagogy of Professor Tran and the opportunities to engage meaningfully with guest lecturers. Each week our reading workload was very heavy, though no text was ever superfluous. The diversity of texts both in content (1800s to the present day, all of Asia, is a lot of time and space to cover) and in style (we read graphic novels, watch films, in addition to history and theory) kept me engaged all semester. Discussions rarely ran dry. Professor Tran always connected student insights with each other, with her own meaningful reflections and with the overarching structure of the lesson and semester. The guest lecturers included a talk with comedian Hari Kondobolu, a performance by comedian Kristina Wong, and an intimate roundtable with children's book author Minh Le and filmmaker-academic Cindy Nguyen. I laughed a lot during the semester, and was meaningfully entertained and intellectually engaged by these cultural creators.\r\nStudent presentations, though important to adding additional content to the class, were difficult to stay focused on for 20 minutes of lecturing over Zoom. It may be beneficial to enforce a Zoom break (5 minutes off screen) after each student presentation.",
                "I loved how the seminar cultivated a sense of community. I found that all of our class discussions were deeply honest, and thought-provoking. The only suggestions I have to improve the class would be to include more central\/west Asian literatures and more fictional\/poetic texts.",
                "I really appreciated the breadth of literature we read in this class, covering Asian diasporas across the world. I especially liked the analysis of sources beyond the stereotypical academic non-fiction, such as documentary, comedy, art, literature, and my personal favorite - the graphic novels. The critical approach to diasporic studies was also very valuable, and I gained a lot from our discussions questioning the very definition of \"Asian diasporas\".",
                "The strengths in this class definitely came from class discussions as well as the outside of class engagements such as guest speakers! I think that this class pulled from a lot of different resources such as academic text\/data, artists, guests outside of class, personal experience, research, etc. that provided a well rounded and full mode of learning that was both fun and engaging.",
                "Prof. Tran is the strength! She created a community that worked hard to learn together. I especially loved the guest speakers she brought in. She is one of the best seminar leaders I've had  so great at responding to peoples' points and making sure all voices are heard. \r\n\r\nNot really any weaknesses, the syllabus is carefully curated and the assignments were all helpful. The class generally self-selects for students who consider themselves part of Asian diasporas, but genuinely anyone would benefit from understanding non-Eurocentric histories."

                "The communication of expectations for every assignment was clear. The only thing that could be improved is that sometimes readings not provided on Canvas were a bit tricky to find online\/using Yale online resource; I always found them eventually, but it could take a while.",
                "Professor Tran openly and consistently acknowledged the difficulties of the virtual learning format, the ongoing pandemic, the United States election and other personal crises. In doing so, she fostered a virtual classroom that was able to connect over difficult and often personal discussions of history and society. Professor Tran always made herself available over Zoom for office hours or staying after class. Without the pedagogical practices of transparency and flexibility, this semester of tremendous learning would not have been possible. Because of the online learning format, it would help to have an email-reply timeframe set up ahead of time (reply within 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours etc.) so that students are more comfortable following up on professor communications.\r\nIncorporating guest lecturers or, more specifically, guest artistic performances, helped keep students engaged online. It was especially important that Professor Tran assigned these performances in place of class time. The trade-off made the workload manageable for everyone.\r\nStudent presentations, though important to adding additional content to the class, were difficult to stay focused on for 20 minutes of lecturing over Zoom. It may be beneficial to enforce a Zoom break (5 minutes off screen) after each student presentation.",
                "This seminar worked really well in a virtual setting, especially since we were able to engage with guest speakers and attend online events that would have been inaccessible otherwise.",
                "I really appreciated the diversity in learning approaches outside of the traditional seminar format. For example, the live zoom comedy show with Kristina Wong was a very unique and engaging way to consider the position of Asian Americans in politics. However, sometimes the readings became a bit too much along with attending these events, especially with classes over zoom and all my readings on my computer I definitely felt a lot fatigue, and would have appreciated more condensed readings, especially in the first half of the semester.",
                "The class presentations were probably one of the more helpful modes of learning digitally, along with bringing in outside guests as class was engaging and not just one larger chunk of discussion.",
                "We were basically on zoom synchronously and also submitted reading responses. I think that deadlines could have been a bit more flexible, and perhaps recordings of classes would have been helpful for anyone that missed class."

                "Yes, definitely. Professor Tran is wonderful at creating a warm and collaborative learning environment in her seminars.

                "Yes! This course never allows you to settle comfortably into a singular understanding of any one concept. The constant expansion of thinking that results has been invaluable to me as a student and learner.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to students interested in their personal history, global histories, ERM, or discovering a new way of thinking. This class presented ideas in such refreshing manners that I think very few courses at Yale facilitate. Professor Tran is an insightful and well-organized instructor and a caring and gracious mentor. The conversations created by students in this class have unsettled so many of the ways in which I approach not only my academic studies but also my view on my personal life, familial history, and future contributions to society. This class will challenge you, but it is the type of challenge that pays out ten times over for years to come.",
                "Absolutely! This class meaningfully shaped my understanding of diaspora and my own identity. Some of the theories\/concepts in class were initially challenging to comprehend, but it was so rewarding to stick with the class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Every reading we did in this class was so interesting, and while some were challenging and dense, I don't think there has been another class at Yale that made me as excited to do the readings as this one. As an Asian American, this class was also very personally impactful and extremely engaging.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any ER&M student that is interested in learning more specifically about Asia, borders, and migration. I think that non-ER&M majors also can gain a lot from this course, especially as it covers a lot of broad topics within diaspora.",
                "Absolutely! You have to stay pretty engaged the whole time (weekly reading responses, class participation, presentation, midterm, final project) but Prof. Tran is a fair grader. I took this as a Credit-D so I could just worry about learning and it was very worth it (but to be honest, I couldn't really slack off on too much of the work since it's a fairly high engagement seminar). I came in wanting to know my place in Asian diasporas and left with such a deeper understanding of how to analyze histories, movement, and find confidence in my own story as valid, both shaping and being shaped by diaspora. The readings, events, and discussions were almost always interesting. I'd strongly recommend any course with Professor Tran. This class is one that has made my Yale experience feel worthwhile."
