I learned how to identify and \"parse\" different parts of a sentence and translate them into English, and was also exposed to training in translating from English to Latin. I gained skills in talking through and explaining elements of Latin grammar in addition to showing written understanding of material.\r\nOn a broader spectrum, this course taught me so much about language more generally, and has influenced how I think about other languages. It has also influenced other aspects of my studies, particularly Music, as I often sing in Latin. While it was normal even before taking this class to find a translation of the piece I would be singing, now I have the tools and training to at least work out a rough translation myself. This has really enriched my experiences as a musician."

                "Strengths: This course did cover a fairly substantial amount of material. It was fast-paced, and if you're a Classics major, I'm sure it's helpful for your knowledge of Latin.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course was somewhat disappointing in how formulaic and bland each in-person section was. We usually went over the homework and then did grammar exercises. However, most of the time it was one person working through something while the rest of the class sat back and watched them struggle through it. Perhaps it was the Zoom environment, but it seemed like we could have spent our time much better, working on something more challenging and engaging. Most of the time I left class feeling like I hadn't learned anything the textbook hadn't told me.",
                "It's very well-structured and systematic. No weaknesses at all.",
                "The course was well organized but relished very heavily on asynchronous lessons too much. The synchronous zoom session spent too much time covering and reviewing previous material and quizzing students on their knowledge of the asynchronous sessions.",
                "This course was an excellent intro to Latin!",
                "This course was usually very approachable but intermittently very challenging due to occasional oral exams. I would suggest that the level of rigor be more equally distributed.",
                "Strength: Pre-recorded lectures meant that I could go back and re-watch explanations if I didn't understand them right away, or re-watch them later as review for tests and exams. However...\r\nWeakness: Pre-recorded lectures are quite frankly just not very engaging as a medium in general, and I don't think there's really anything that can be done to make it more engaging."

Internet is sometimes unreliable and it was good to have some flexibility in scheduling for such a time demanding course. Going forward it would have been nice to have the ability to for the instructor to have a virtual chalk board of sorts. It would make lessons and discussions much easier to conceptualize with this form of visual aid.",
                "The instructor did a very good job of utilizing the time that we had live (virtually). It ran pretty much the way I would imagine an in-person course would, with people being called upon to answer questions and working in small groups, sight-reading passages, etc.\r\nThe Friday labs could have been improved. I felt that I never really knew what exactly to expect from those sessions (how to prepare adequately)."
