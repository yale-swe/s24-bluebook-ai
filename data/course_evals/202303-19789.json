            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Great introduction to the world of econometrics papers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Problem sets were poorly constructed, and most time was spent struggling on proofs (as someone who has never encountered proofs before in a class that did not expect students to have any experience with writing proofs) or debugging code (as most students used R even though the pset data files worked best in Stata) instead of engaging with the fundamental concepts of the course.",
                "The course material was interesting but the structure could have been improved a lot. There were only 5 homeworks and they were very long for no real reason. 70% of the exams asked questions about a single study (we learned one study per class) making it so that you did terrible if you forgot that particular study.",
                "This course needs more TAs and student hours. The lectures are very dependent on your ability to understand concepts at a high level and we only had one TA (bless her heart) for 40 students. The problem sets are quite difficult and they provide little to no resources to get them done. Smaller setting student hours would drastically improve the quality of this class.",
                "Strength: extensive coverage of key econometrics knowledge, clear lecture slides\r\nWeakness: no R support for Psets, especially considering how technical many of them are; mathematical notation in course is inconsistent, which can be confusing sometimes; needs more office hours because I have to fight with 20 people in line to get my pset checked",
                "Strengths: you learn how to read economic papers and truly understand the statistical models that they use which is somewhat rewarding if you plan on going into academia. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class was very disorganized in that the PSETs we had only assessed us on the first half of the class and there was not enough material to practice the second half of the class. The PSETs required significant amount of coding which would be very difficult for anyone to learn on the spot without having prior coding knowledge. Often times, the PSETs especially the last two were very tedious and had us replicate graphs from studies but the assignments would not give us sufficient information on how to replicate graphs nor were the datasets we received clear in any way about what data we should look at and how to clean the data.",
                "Bad organization and bad instruction. Minimal motivation to go to lecture. Overall not taught well.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting class. I liked how with each type of method, there was an associated paper so we could see its real life applications in economic literature. Great professor as well, you can tell that Prof Narita was an expert in the subject matter.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think the grading was very tough (barely any partial credit) and the exams focused a lot more on memorization than understanding the content in my opinion. Also, in many PSETs we were tasked to replicate tables or figures from economic papers which were quite tedious because the papers used Stata (paid software) and most students used python and R.",
                "There was a notable disconnect between the lecture and assignments as well as between the TA and professor. Lectures certainly covered interesting concepts, however the problem sets were rather tangential/unguided. Overall, expectations for problem sets and exams were unclear as I recall getting feedback and deductions for very minor/tangential issues. Perhaps having office hours directly with the professor would be helpful going forward.",
                "I enjoyed the content, especially during the sections on the course related to prediction. However, I felt the PSETs could have been organized better. Throughout the semester, there were several problems where I wasnt sure what was expected of me or how to do it. Going to office hours & section helped, but I wish there was a bit more clarity & guidance there.",
                "I found the structure of the course to be great. The real econometric papers we engaged with were also helpful. As someone from a less mathematical background, I would have appreciate a more thorough review and incorporation of statistical concepts.",
                "Strengths: Very wide and detailed coverage of different topics. Practical demonstration of all topics via academic papers, and their individual weaknesses. You'll definitely come out of this course a much stronger econometrician. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Course felt very poorly organized. Problem sets were especially confusing, as they often asked us to replicate results from academic papers, all while referencing topics taught in class. The issue here is that the given datasets were often incomplete or mismatched from what was used by the authors, resulting in it being \"impossible\" to replicate results. Furthermore, many papers used methods that were actually recommended AGAINST either in class or by the TA, further causing confusion. Especially for the latter PSETs, office hours mostly consisted of students trying to figure out the PSET TOGETHER with the TA, as even she was unsure about what the professor was asking for. Very very frustrating.",
                "The content was all very very engaging and practical. It was a difficult course because of the nature of the content but still fascinating.",
                "Strengths: Tra and Yusuke are exceptional, and the class material facilitates learning in a way I've never seen before. The use of well-put-together PowerPoint slides also makes it easy to learn and engage with the material, and I greatly enjoyed almost every aspect of the class. Tests were fair and representative of the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the PSets had fairly difficult and office hours was required to understand what code to use/ what answer would be accepted. With only one TA, it could be difficult to figure that out. Perhaps in the future, some footnotes in PSets would help us understand how to answer some of the more difficult questions (such as \"Recreate Figure X in this paper\" or \"Show the Proof that CATE = ATE). However, our TA was exceptional and this was not her fault whatsoever. She was incredibly helpful consistently.",
                "The strengths of the course are the lectures. The lectures are engaging and the material is very important to understand. There is a great mix of lecturing and discussion with the class that makes this a unique and enjoyable lecture. I think the only improvement on the class would be to make the problem sets more equal in terms of time.",
                "Strengths of this course would be the breadth of concepts that were covered, which I realized when preparing for the final exam and bringing all the different concepts together. We looked at over 20 different papers, and discussed many different methods of causal inference and ML. It gave a very decent introduction to different statistical methods that if one were interested in using later could draw upon this knowledge. \r\nHowever, I think there are a lot of ways in which this course could be improved. Firstly, the lectures were quite unstructured and very confusing, and I only understood what was going on much later and using a lot of online support. The problem sets, while drawing on material from the course, made the students spend countless hours coding without any guidance on how to do so from lectures, and while grading was generous to compensate for this, Im not sure this was the best way to test our knowledge. Perhaps more dedication to using R in lecture, or less focus on it in PSets (in favor of practicing the mathematical principles or discussing case studies that were later used in the exam etc). It felt like each component of the course was completely separate from one another.",
                "This course has the potential to be a great course content wise. Its biggest strength is that Professor Narita is a pretty strong lecturer and explains the content well. \r\n\r\nThat being said, this course has numerous major flaws. The biggest surrounding the problem sets. These problem sets were terribly written and deeply obnoxious. We would spend hours and hours \"replicating this table\" from economics papers with little to no instruction. This was clearly because Professor Narita did not want to have to write the code himself, so just looked to see if you could get the right numbers from the table. This also meant that there was virtually no support because Professor Narita and the TF had never actually written the matching code necessary to make the table. Multiple times asking for assistance I was met with: \"hmmm well I don't really know but you won't lose that many points.\" It was such an extreme pain and did not help me understand the course content at all. \r\n\r\nThe other issue with the problem sets is that they were nearly all about content from lectures 1-10, which made sense as it was also the central content on the exams. I do not understand why we did not spend more time with this content, because lectures 11-26 were essentially untested and we never learned how to put the skills into practice. \r\n\r\nI also did not like how the problem sets were so proof based and theoretical. If this class is supposed to prepare Econ students for their thesis, I think there should have been more focus on how to actually compute the math. \r\n\r\nLastly, this course used to have a project included in the syllabus. It didn't this semester and I really wish that it did. Many econ related jobs are looking for work students have completed in R and it seems kind of dumb to send in a problem set. That is why Econ 123 has had a project for so long (and also to prep for thesis work). It is a shame that we didn't get to do that and again I believe it to be because of Professor Narita's low engagement with the course.",
                "Strengths: Wide range of applications (including ML); interesting case studies and literature reviewed; relatively fair exams. Weaknesses: Overly rigorous problem sets, to the point where deadlines had to be extended more than once; often, many hours spent replicating a graph from a particular paper, with students struggling with the code more than the econometric lesson; paired with harsh, often ambiguous grading from TF; sometimes, overly theoretical and asked for students to provide rigorous proofs, which were not really taught.",
                "I thought the structure of the class in how it covered a lot of the mathematical concepts was very helpful and the case studies that were done made it very interesting to learn about.",
                "I think the lectures were interesting, but the PSets basically did not have much to do with the lectures. I already knew some coding, but I effectively had to teach myself how to code everything we learned in this class. The homework also required up to apply and prove mathematical proofs in ways we simply did not have the background to do. This ended up putting a lot of stress on the TA to teach us how to do it.",
                "Strengths: I liked how we studied applications of the concepts we were learning from real economics studies. Weaknesses: The set up of this course was not conducive to student learning. First, the problem sets were strangely focused on making us replicate economics studies. Not only was this incredibly tedious and time consuming, but I learned very little from these activities and the psets were not aligned with the material we were being taught in class. The psets also were incredibly unclear and did not specify what studies we should be looking at or which data/variables we needed to be using. Second, there were not enough resources for students. The professor did not host office hours, and there was only one TF who hosted a single hour of OH for us to ask questions. This was incredibly insufficient at allowing students to get help on psets or clarifications about class concepts. Third, the exams were focused of memorization of niche concepts. 120/180 points on the final exam came from our ability to recall hyper specific information about a single study that was discussed for half a lecture near the midterm (1 of 25 studies we looked at throughout the semester). This was a strange exam style that I felt did not give students the opportunity to showcase their knowledge from the class. To fix these issues, the psets for this class should be rewritten to focus more on the theoretical concepts from class and be aligned with the material from lectures to better reinforce student learning. Then, either the professor should have to host office hours or peer tutors/more TFs ought to be assigned to the class. An additional concern that I feel is worth mentioning is that I was a bit disturbed by tone of class discussions about certain economics papers. We had a class on suicide, racial bias in policing, gender bias in education, and clean water in Kenya which all could have been handled better."

                "Absolutely not unless you have to take it for the major. Lots of prior knowledge in coding was expected and many students struggled because they weren't fully prepared in one coding language to complete the PSETs. The course jump between ECON 117 and 123 was very big and unexpected for most students in the class, unless they came from a more math/engineering background. The assignments lacked clarity, especially in the latter half when we were replicating studies and the datasets we were given had no clear indication of what to use and how to use it. The course also presents a ton of mathematical definition and is highlighted as being very important but we get no avenues to practice this math and the final exam was purely on the first half of the class, which was incredibly unfair to students who had spent a significant amount of time learning how to understand and apply the more complicated concepts in ML and counterfactual predictions. Overall, the course was a headache because of its organization and misplaced emphasis on what students should takeaway from the class. I sincerely hope the department considers revamping this course because it is an inevitable class that students across many econ intersection majors have to take and it does not add value to most majors given the current format of the class.",
                "No.",
                "Take the class if you need it for major or thesis. If you want to take it for fun, it is a pretty difficult class but the content was very rewarding and interesting and the professor was amazing. The class is both theoretical and applied but the theory part can be pretty mathematically intensive (especially towards the end half).",
                "I would recommend this to a student that is willing to put in time on their own to explore the topics discussed in class, simply because the problem sets ended up with interesting results, but had less guidance than I had anticipated.",
                "Yes! For anyone interested in building on Econ 117. I had a chip on my shoulder from the intro class which this class helped me resolve. It's a lot more engaging and intellectually stimulating than 117.",
                "Yes, if you have some mathematical or statistical background, especially if taught by Professor Narita. Ultimately, I did gain a lot by taking this course, but it was definitely a slog at many points.",

                "I would recommend this course if you are willing to put in the time to learn econometrics. It will help strengthen your understanding of statistical coding (I used R, you could use Python, etc), and help you understand the intricacies of study design. I feel much more confident about the quantitative side of economics, and would certainly recommend the course as an economics elective that you will gain something tangible from.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It is my favorite course I have taken at Yale. I think it should honestly be required by the econ department but that may ruin the smaller group feel of the course. If you have any interest in statistics or econometrics at all then you need to take this class.",
                "Im not sure. It is definitely a useful course and content to learn, but Im not sure it is the most enjoyable, and perhaps you could get the same knowledge from other sources such as the internet or online MOOCs. I can see why it helps to have this knowledge for planning a thesis paper however, as it provides a good introduction to complementary statistical methods to an econ research paper.",
                "If you have to take this class, you won't hate it. If you are thinking about taking it for fun or as an elective, do not take it. Go take something in the stats department that will teach you the same things without the poor teaching.",
                "Sort of, but not really (I wouldn't want to take it again). ECON 117 will teach the important building blocks, and other S&DS courses may be better suited for further learning (and some can be substituted for the senior essay requirement for economics majors). More learning-focused problem sets or assignments (vs. needing to nail one graph or one proof exactly) might improve the course substantially; and, more connection between lectures and problem sets.",
                "I would recommend this course to any economics major because I felt like it greatly expanded what is learned in introductory econometrics. It is a difficult class, but it is also very clear to see how the concepts that are learned are used to identify causality and write papers.",
                "I would recommend it in the sense that I learned so much, but you must be very committed to the class.",
                "I took this course because it is required to write an Economics thesis. I did leave with some of the necessary skills to write a thesis, but otherwise, this is probably my least favorite class I have taken at Yale. The vast majority of my learning came from my fellow students and my own outside research, and I feel as though a lot of this class was wasted time on tedious activities without much benefit."
