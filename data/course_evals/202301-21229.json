                "Strength: recorded lecture that I can always go back and learn. Information is very easy to understand as an undergrad with limited experience to the science behind climate change. \r\n\r\nWeakness: can be less engaging since it is a lecture-based course.",
                "I think this class could go more in depth with having us actually do some climate modeling",

                "The assignments of this course are organized well, with the problem sets in the first half of the term helping you to learn the information that will be explored in the second half of the term. I enjoyed the literature critiques and how all the assignments are short and to the point.",
                "interesting lectures but a bit too many topics covered",
                "Strengths: knowledgeable professors. Weaknesses: unengaging lectures that are not clear. The lectures were also too long in my opinion.",
                "I felt like this course was a bit all over the place.  At the beginning of the class there was a great deal of material being thrown at us and nobody really seemed to be confident in the material as the psets were very misaligned from what we were learning in lecture. After the first midterm there was no reason to go to lecture besides from personal enjoyment as there was again no application of lecture material to the assignments.",
                "It was pretty boring and a lot of the content went over my head because the lectures were pretty stupidly put together in my opinion - as in the just threw stuff on the slides and kinda said that. Like the guest speakers were often much clearer and interesting.",
                "Lectures can be too information heavy sometimes",
                "The guest lecturers are engaging, and the course gives a comprehensive view of modern climate science. Sometimes the material feels repetitive, but this is a great course!",
                "I would say a strength is that the professors do have knowledge that is worth sharing in the field of climate change. That being said, the weakness of this course is that it is not engaging. If you do decide to take this course, do some research to find the best TF for you. Your success will be dependent on your ability to go to office hours, and work very hard for the first four weeks (when the problems sets end).",
                "A little more background info",
                "This course was not super engaging, so it was sometimes difficult to pay attention. This could probably be amended by engaging more with students in the course.",

                "TAs were helpful\r\nassignments were manageable\r\n\r\nlectures were sometimes too much material and very hard to follow and keep up",
                "This may just be because of me, but I found it hard to pay attention in 70 minute lectures. Each class period went on for really long, and by the end I could not stay focused, which definitely impacted my learning. For me, 50 minute lectures would be perfect. However, I still think that this class was thorough and for anyone genuinely interested in how climate change works, it would be helpful.",
                "strengths: diversity of the lectures and how the assignments are chronologically structured\r\nweaknesses: lack of engagement of the professors with the students",
                "The recorded lecture format makes it easy to disengage from the course, but I think it offers nice flexibility and the assignments (midterm, climate modeling) push students to reengage. Perhaps more assignments like that in future? Also I enjoyed having guest speakers and appreciated the way that no assignment was more than 25% of the grade."

                "I wouldn't recommend this course unless you are very interested in the topic at hand. The course itself is well paced, fairly graded, covers interesting topics, and bring in guest speakers that are very worthwhile to hear from. However, this course does not feel cohesive, in part due to the fact that there are two professors who take turns lecturing every day. They also alternate in who writes the problem sets, which gives a sense of whiplash. This alternation becomes hard to follow and becomes a slight nuisance. I've had a course with multiple professors before, and I think it works better for them to split teaching the course into a first and second half instead of passing the torch back and forth.",

                "Yes; it's a good general introduction to climate science.",
                "Overall a great science credit for anyone with an interest in climate change. There's definitely a LOT of content thrown at you in the lectures and it's sometimes hard to draw the connection between class and psets but the teaching staff are really helpful and kind, and you leave the semester with a significantly deeper understanding of the factors that shape the ecosystem + climate change as well as current literature and emerging fields in the area. The midterm is definitely to watch out for though, as it's essentially pure memorization.",
                "yes because its interesting",
                "I think the content of this course is really interesting, but its just so poorly taught. The class isnt fun or engaging at all. But again, the content is interesting so Id only recommend it if you are interested in getting a broad glimpse at climate change issues and the scientific ways that people are trying to solve these issues.",
                "If you are looking for a relatively easy science credit perhaps. Just don't expect to get much feedback on any of your work. We didn't even receive our midterms back beside the grade.",
                "Maybe, but Ive heard there are other better climate change courses that might be better.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. I think the information is very important for everyone to understand no matter what field of study they are in. The work requires a significant amount of time, but it is worthwhile because it helps you understand and think through the material.",
                "Yes, nice gut science",
                "Yes! This was a great way to develop fluency on modern climate issues and hear from leading researchers.",

                "Yes. Very good for learning about the different components of climate change",
                "The content is useful to know, but the course overall is not super engaging.",
                "Yes I would. It was a good intro to climate change science.",
                "I would recommend if they are interested in climate modeling",
                "Yes, if you're interested in climate science and want a class without too high of a workload.",
                "nice, interesting science gut",
                "Yes, pretty useful especially in understanding what constitutes climate change.",
                "Yes - it is a great introduction to climate studies especially for non-majors",
                "Solid science credit for non stem majors, but a little more challenging than I had anticipated. It had a little more math than I thought.",
                "No unless you have to take it",
                "yes if you need a science credit that does not require too much work. very doable assignments that are evenly spread out during the semester, and as long as you do the psets and study, the midterm was totally fine.",
                "Only if they feel comfortable doing word problems that are potentially unclear\/require some time thinking and\/or visits to office hours. Also, I think having a bit of a physical science background would be helpful and make things more understandable. And, if they think they can pay attention for 70-minute lectures.",
