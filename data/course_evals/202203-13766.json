We also studied the U.S. interagency process and its shortcomings in dealing with the Afghanistan and Vietnam Wars. Finally, I learned how to conduct interviews for the purposes of gathering qualitative data.",
                "Skills: reading a lot of material and condensing the most important points into concise writing \r\n\r\nKnowledge: 20 year war in Afghanistan, US foreign policy in Afghanistan, the role of different inter agencies and their failures",
                "Better knowledge of Afghanistan, political peace settlements, and the U.S. government",
                "This course provided first hand insight into the war in Afghanistan as well as Government workings and dynamics as a whole. I also improved the skill of being able to identify thematic key points from interviews. My knowledge of Government agencies, decision making processes, and the role of domestic politics was also improved tremendously.",
                "I learned a general overview of the history of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, specifically though looking at how decisions made within government agencies in the U.S. contributed to or diminished the chances of a political settlement. I also generally learned a lot about the coordination (or lack thereof) of various federal government agencies."

                "My capstone professors were very helpful throughout the semester and I learned a lot from them about working in the global affairs field, particularly on the topic of our capstone. I think the course would benefit greatly from better instruction from the Jackson Institute to ensure that the capstone course is run more similarly across the groups and to ensure that there is more structure throughout the semester. Nearly all the work was at the end of the semester, and the client deliverable was not made clear until weeks into the semester. Furthermore, there appeared to be little to no communication between the capstone professors and the Jackson Institute capstone organizers which made it difficult for student questions to be answered.",
                "The key strength of this course was that it gave students access to experts in the field, including U.S. ambassadors, diplomats and colonels, as well as high ranking former members of the Afghan government. These connections were invaluable in conducting research and better understanding our topic. It was also fabulous to work on a real life problem for a client. Professors Wilder and Worden were also very committed mentors. The main weaknesses of the capstone were the lack of structure and guidance, and the broad scope of our research question. Having more specific direction earlier on from our clients would have helped us get more out of some of our guest speakers and interviews.",
                "It could be improved with more specific deadlines \r\n\r\nStrengths are that it is really student run and that the professors are super accommodating",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Access to fascinating people, interviews, and a trip\r\n\r\nWeaknesses \r\n- Organization of the course could have been better",
                "The courses discussion based approach with experts concerning a complex issue was much appreciated.",
                "Since the project was heavily interview-based I would have liked some coaching on formal interview techniques, etc. \r\n\r\nMore generally, students got absolutely no guidance from Jackson school admin about the capstone presentation, due dates for final reports, or other requirements of the capstone project. In addition, it was incredibly difficult to arrange the capstone trip, with information not arriving for our group until the day before our departure. Since our mentors were visiting professors and didn't have much familiarity with how Yale bureaucracy works, Jackson school admin could have been more forthcoming with information to all the capstone groups in general.",
                "Strengths: Interesting material, expert professors, great practical policy experience. Weaknesses: The course did not have a cohesive structure. More guidance on the format of the final product would have been helpful."

However, if the client's question\/task is once again so broad, I would encourage students to narrow it down earlier on for the course to be more fulfilling and productive.",
                "Yes, it was a great experience and means of learning about the U.S. war in Afghanistan.",
                "yes! This is one of the best courses Ive taken at Yale. It meant so much that so many people took time out of their busy schedules to speak with students. It made Government seem much more accessible. The instructors also gave incredibly detailed feedback on written work and regularly advised throughout the drafting process.",
                "The capstone was an interesting policy project but it was not as intellectually rigorous as a thesis would have been."
