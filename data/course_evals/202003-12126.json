Regardless, it was freeing to stop thinking of art as \"right\" or \"wrong\" representation.",

                "I loved this course so much. Molly and Nathaniel are incredible people who will enrich your understanding of art and be ever so patient with your development as an artist, no matter what level you're on. The only weakness is that I never quite knew what the homework was and\/or when it was due! The course is a tad unorganized but well worth the scramble.",
                "I always enjoyed the drawing during class, since we were able to get feedback in real time, and the critiques were helpful, especially when Molly or Nathaniel gave us other artists for inspiration. However, I found that the class focused more on abstraction and making meaningful art than learning to observe and represent. Although I came to enjoy that focus, I struggled with it at first, since I had come into the class hoping to learn a concept of drawing I had imagined.",

The only thing I would have changed is that it might have been nice to have a little more idea what we were going to do ahead of time in a given class.",
                "I thought our discussions over Zoom worked well. It was sometimes challenging to see others' art clearly over Zoom, but this was mainly in cases where we made art during class, so we had not yet uploaded it to the shared class folder and couldn't screen share. The use of a shared Google Drive folder and screen sharing over Zoom allowed for critiques to occur virtually. Overall, I think the class adapted well to the online format.",

Specifically, for our critiques, I really liked that Molly and Nathaniel took the time to make another Zoom room and rotate us in and out of it to dedicate time and privacy to us growing our work.",
                "We could show our art by sharing the screen, and I loved how the virtual medium of the course allowed for an extra layer of artistic experimentation through how we photographed our drawings. We also were able to look at each others' portfolios at any time through Google Drive folders. The lecture slideshows did not always hold my attention and I would have hoped to have a more participatory type of lecture where questions were asked of us, but I also enjoyed learning about each lecture topic.",

                "Yes! Basic Drawing was a gift. The most important thing is not to go in with too many preconceived notions or expectations about what the class will be. Molly has her own way of teaching, and it can seem a little out there or disorganized but you just have to trust it. If you want to learn how to draw really realistically, you should choose a different section. If you want to expand your mind and learn about what makes art beautiful, you should take this one!",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course, but be aware that this section is geared towards those who have more intuitive learning styles. It didn't feel like we were formally \"taught\" a particular way of doing things (besides one-point perspective and basic watercolor technique), but rather we absorbed concepts through trying them out and through comments on our work from Prof. Z-H and Nathaniel. I took the course with a few friends, some of whom enjoyed this way of learning and some of whom felt frustrated. The course is also focused on the aesthetic dimension of art and abstraction. One comment from Prof. Z-H stuck in my head -- something along the lines of \"drawing isn't supposed to represent perfectly, since photography took that job -- rather, observational drawing is how you see the world, rather than how the world objectively is.\" This approach was not what I had expected when I signed up for a class called \"Basic Drawing,\" but I definitely enjoyed the freedom to experiment and be creative.",
