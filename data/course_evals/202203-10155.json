                "Following one text throughout the entire course would engage students more with the actual content of the translation and perhaps make it more interesting. The strengths are that everyone is involved in class and everyone must come prepared. The weaknesses are that the texts jump around too much and it could use slightly more structure.",
                "Weakness: The class could be repetitive at times. It was always translations for homework every class and quizzes on Wednesdays and Fridays.\r\n\r\nStrengths: The engagement by the teacher and the students was very solid. Everyone paid attention and answered thoughtfully. The teacher asked appropriate questions and was patient in explaining topics.",
                "I dont really know any weakness. I think I would somehow really try to force not common to class with a translation prepared.",
                "Strengths: the teacher was obviously very knowledgeable and put a lot of time into the class. Weaknesses: there was a quiz every Friday, and I think the class would have been much more enjoyable if they were any other day",
                "The course revolves around the latin texts studied for homework. However, this meant that the only reason to come to class was to get a final translation, which could be found online. there were a total of three five minute segments which covered grammar learning across the entire semester and the rest of the class was dominated by going through the texts. It was puzzling therefore when only 30% of the final was a translation of the text. The reason for this was to avoid students learning the texts off by heart, but this is simply the only way to do it, as the student is below the standard of the course at this level. The only way to improve the course is to focus more time on grammatical elements and site reading rather than have all lessons based on the site reading.  On top of this, lowering the difficulty of the texts.",
                "The course does a good job of training students to translate in Latin prose. However, the workload is just too high for it to be reasonable. Two quizzes a week, along with around 100 lines to be translated and secondary readings. The instructor also expects students to keep a master vocabulary list of all words they come across in their translations and to memorize their dictionary entries or principal parts. I was a STEM major with hard coursework and I simply did not have the time to do the secondary readings or sit with the Latin to memorize every part of the vocabulary list, simply due to the number of lines. As a result, I actually spent less time actually translating and working with the Latin and more time frantically memorizing long translations to regurgitate on the quizzes. The secondary readings were rarely brought up in class and there was no real consequence to not having this master list memorized luckily. It's a doable course with this workload and one can still do well, but it would be smarter to do smaller amounts of text if the focus was really honing a student's ability to translate.",

                "I recommend this class both to Latin students who have to take it after taking L1 and L2 here (though I have heard L4 counts as well and is graded more forgivingly, if you're willing to skip over a semester) and to students who are coming into Yale after taking quite a bit of Latin in high school, but who are anything short of extremely confident in their ability to translate Latin.\r\nI took this course my first semester at Yale after taking Latin in 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th grades previously. It still did a number on me, and it took a lot of work for me to stay afloat. I think it's a great course, and its intensity, while not always making me happy in the moment, gave me a much greater appreciation and understanding of the Latin language. I am not a classics major by any means, but this course reminded me what I loved so much about the language in early high school. When I took the class with Talia, the structure was that every class had assigned reading in Latin due, students were expected to prepare the text as much or as little they saw fit, and then in class students would be called on to translate about a sentence at a time, with Talia providing corrections or clarifications, until we had made it through the passage. Each Friday was a quiz containing translation and grammatical analysis of one of the passages assigned that week.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is very interested in ancient Roman civilization and classics. I would also recommend Latin 3 as a language credit since it has a manageable workload and there is no requirement to speak.",
                "Yes, it is a great stepping stone for anyone trying to get into more advanced Latin.",
                "Yes, its a great way to get good at reading latin. The texts are fun and engaging.",
                "no. this course did not involve latin learning. instead, the vast majority was based on simple wrote learning of a text. other inconvenient pieces of the course was loosing marks on quizzes for the numerous different types of ablatives or ut clauses, most of which are interchangeable and mean literally the same thing!",
                "Normally, this class is for a language requirement. So yes.",
