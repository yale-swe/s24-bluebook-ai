                "Apart from the most crucial grammatical structures of French, I also developed a good understanding of the Second World War in France, along with other cultural and historical events and phenomena. My oral and written skills improved.",
                "My overall speaking confidence, comprehension, and writing improved significantly in this class. The workload was definitely a challenge, but overall led to this much improvement in such a short time frame. I am excited to pursue French at subsequent levels in the near future.",
                "I learned more French, bien sr, and was immersed in the language and literature of many Fancophone countries. I was able to be exposed to good books like \"La symphonie pastorale\" and \"Un sac de billes\" among others, and I had the opportunity to practice my French speaking.",
                "I developed better french speaking, reading and writing skills. I learned how to analyze French literature and discuss historical French events.",

            "comments": [
                "The readings of the course, particularly in Diversit, seemed to repeat themselves; although immigration is one of the most important themes in understanding French culture, I wouldve loved to see a wider variety of texts, or even movies or other productions, portraying the phenomenon. Un sac de billes was by far the most interesting reading we had, and the Second World War presentations were a great addition.",
                "The course definitely compiled as much reading, grammar, and conversational practice into one semester as possible, which I think helped me improve in all ways, but sometimes the curriculum felt jumpy and disjointed as topics did not really relate to each other. Some of the course material also felt heavily outdated which we discussed in class. While I enjoyed La Symphonie Pastorale and some of the films we watched, I cannot help but think there is much more current, engaging, and enriching reading material to replace it with.",
                "Strengths was our absolutely amazing reading and the interesting discussions that could be brought from it. Weaknessvocabulary expansion was not emphasized much in class. There was a lot of self-study expected of you.",
                "We often ran out of time to correct or discuss assignments, and I think this was due to the fact that the homework workload was too high. I don't think that certain activities were necessary but we did them anyways because they were in the course packet. I think it may be better with less adherence to the course packet and more room to talk about other topics. This course could also benefit from a more diverse range of novels.",
                "I enjoyed the layout of the course. I thought the workload allowed me to keep my engagement with the language at a high level. I think the course could have incorporated more opportunity for students to discuss between one another.",
                "The group activities we performed in class worked very well for practicing the grammar concepts and vocabulary (provided that everyone arrived to class prepared having done the homework as a preview). The written grammar exercises were in general appropriate, but were at times repetitive, to where it sometimes felt like you were practicing the same sentence over and over again with only a few words changed in between. I think in general the array of difficulties (in terms of syntax and vocabulary) provided by our course readings was appropriate, but at times their subject matter were concerning. The composition prompts about the course readings were thought provoking, and it was usually possible to find at least one prompt that you would want to write about.",
                "The literature in the course was somewhat troubling. In past semesters, it can be concluded that dark or more difficult readings would be chosen as the course difficulty increased, however, some of the literature chosen did not seem the most appropriate as it did not make students want to participate. Also, there is a film that students must watch that does not contain a trigger warning. With the growing interest in mental health, the literature and film choices should be reviewed, and trigger warnings should be announced to accommodate."

Otherwise, for students who took French in high school but are not as passionate about it or have priority in other fields, I would probably recommend they take a new language to fulfill the requirement.",
                "Yes, continue French with French 4! It is the best French course I have takenpossibly because it was in-person and my previous 2 courses were over Zoombut still, the readings themselves were much more interesting and engaging. We really dived into the literary element of French, instead of making up stories about Robert and Mireille.",
                "Yes! I thought this course greatly improved my knowledge of the French language and thought the instruction was clear and concise.",
