I grew significantly as a musician, developed more effective practice habits, and learned to identify my strengths and weaknesses.",

                "This course was excellent in that it provided me substantial opportunities to hone my skills as a musician, and the final recital requirement gave me a tangible goal to work towards. In the future, I think the course would benefit from a more concrete lesson plan that is determined and presented at the beginning of the semester. This gives the student a better understanding of each lesson's importance and goal in a broader context.",

                "Strengths: The course is on a person-by-person basis so it was really whatever you made of it. As such, the music instruction was very strong and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWeakness: N/A",

The quality of the instruction, even on Zoom, is fantastic, and the resources that Yale provided (microphones and practice spaces in my case) really helped during the pandemic. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We're on the tail end (hopefully) of the pandemic now, but if virtual instruction continues, it would be helpful to have even more resources for students who cannot practice in their dorm rooms. In particular, it would have been helpful to have lockers in the School of Music in which I could store my instruments. Carrying two fairly large instruments across campus to practice every day was physically difficult and a disincentive to regular practicing."

This is a solution which I recommend in the strongest possible terms.",

The ability to play using USB microphones improved lesson quality significantly, and I found that my instructor and I were able to communicate well despite the difficulties of holding a lesson over Zoom. The greatest improvement would be, of course, in-person lessons. It is critical that they are reinstated.",
