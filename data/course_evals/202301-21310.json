I also think this was the first time I read almost everything for a class because the stories were always so interesting and I learned how to better my close reading and connect topics across books.",
                "I learned about what strengths I had with my writing. I learned a lot about the history of tragic literature and its evolution.",
                "I learned how to be more critical of different witnesses, texts, and sources when it comes to adaptation and translation. In addition, I learned that literary tragedy is not just a writing style, but a mode of thought that has evolved through time.",
                "An overview of ancient tragedy and its adaptations/manifestations in modernity. Skills for writing close passage analysis essays.",
                "This course taught me valuable skills in critical reading and abstracting texts to larger ideas. I gained exposure to various philosophies through the texts and I gained valuable experience in formulating my thoughts in in-class discussions."

                "I loved this class so much because of all the stories we read. I loved the way the Professor Ellermann guided our discussions in class because we were all forced to think more about the pages we had read and we learned what our peers got out of the readings too.",
                "One weakness is that I felt that there could have been more guidance about the annotating/ reading because most classes were entirely discussion but I didnt always know what information in the text to comment on. One strength was the content of the plays was interesting. Though dense at times, most plays had a compelling story so a lot of pages didnt feel as hard",
                "Strengths: amazing body of works and a professor that knows a lot about them. Weaknesses: it was hard to be totally engaged since it was an early class time.",
                "I really enjoyed the format of reading a text for homework then discussing it in class as it ensured that the discussions always had substance. Additionally, what made the course really fun was the wide variety of plays that were covered, giving a good sampling of tragedy in the European literary tradition. I did not feel that there were any weaknesses in the course."

                "Yes, it is extremely interesting and you will read an array of niche tragedies you might otherwise not read.",
                "I would definitely recommend, especially if you need a writing credit. I took this class on a whim because I needed one and it was so enjoyable. Take it also if you're just interested in tragedy because there is just so many stories and so many things you could connect it to.",
                "Absolutely lovely course, very approachable for both majors and non-majors. Prof. Ellermann is great at striking the balance between encouraging discussion and leading the conversation, and also has this amazing talent of rephrasing your thoughts in a way that makes them more clear to you. If you're at all interested in the Greek tragedies and their modern day legacies, this is the perfect, approachable course to look at them. The workload is also super manageable (only 3 4-5 page essays) and while you're not taught how to do close analysis, it's all we do in class. Even if you're a seasoned literature reader, you'll get something new out of the course for sure, like understanding textuality and materiality better. Definitely recommend!",
                "I would recommend this course to people who like reading, or like plays, or if you need a writing course that isnt too intense. I enjoyed the readings, but if reading a play or half a play for homework isnt something youre up for I would not recommend this.",
                "Yes! If you want to read these amazing works, Professor Ellermann is the professor to learn from. I really enjoyed that it was a small seminar style format and felt that my writing got specific feedback.",
                "Yes I definitely would! This course is a really fun English class and you leave the class feeling like you have pushed your mind to think in new directions."
