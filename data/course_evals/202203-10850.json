                "Professor Connolley is an incredible lecturer and provided a lot of insight on the different poets we discussed.  We discussed a poet a week, which was ample time to know the background of the poet, but I feel like we didn't delve too deeply on the poetry itself.  It is a great overview class to touch on the different \"mad poets\" and the exploration of the relation between madness and poetry was incredibly interesting.",
                "The lectures were always interesting and engaging. I especially loved the essay assignmentsthey were valuable opportunities to go more in-depth with particular poets.",
                "Strengths: the lectures were great and very well-structured. The way the assignments are designed leaves a lot of freedom for students, which I really liked. Sections allowed to dive deeper into the study of a specific poem and allows to vocalize thoughts that weren't mentioned in lecture (even though the format of lectures are made somewhat interactive by Prof Connolly). Weaknesses: I don't see any big weakness, apart maybe from the lecture hall the lecture was given in. Maybe one with a blackboard would be beneficial. I also wished that Prof Connolly would not read his lecture notes sometimes, and allow himself to maybe diverge from the initial plan.",
                "Classes and sections were engaging. I got a lot of feedback on my essay, which really improved my essay writing skills throughout the semester."

                "Yes! The content is quite interesting and the Professor and TAs are wonderful for feedback and learning. If you are interested in poetry or looking for a relatively easy writing credit, this is a great class.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone, even if they had no intention of studying poetry further. I think it's a wonderful glimpse into poetic potential, and is also great for learning to write better essays.",
