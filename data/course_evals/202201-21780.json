                "This was an excellent class! I developed a well-rounded knowledge of environmental policy and governance solutions, particularly at the local-level. We focused on specific programs as case studies and general principles that demonstrated success. Professor Klee was so lovely. He brought so much rich expertise and passion to the table, and despite the large seminar size, fostered very productive conversations. Through the memos, op-ed, and \"one-slide wonder\", we learned how to write and speak succinctly, clearly, and persuasively to capture different audiences.",
                "High-level knowledge of environmental and energy policy landscape, focused on the state-level in the US",
                "I learnt about a variety of policies centered around energy, waste management, and corporate sustainability. In class, we evaluated many of these policies with critical justice lenses and had engaging open discussions about them.",
                "I learnt how to write policy memos and op-eds, which are really important skills for me as I'm intending to pursue a career in environmental policy. The topics covered over this course are also super comprehensive, and Prof tries to bring in a variety of examples/case studies which were really helpful for contextualizing the environmental policy/issue. Definitely my favourite class this semester!",
                "amazing foundational course for evst majors interested in the clean energy transition! learned about an incredibly wide breadth of topics. and got a LOT of support for improving policy memo writing, a key skill, and i'm very grateful for this opportunity.",
                "Research and writing skills, particularly for writing op-eds and policy memos. And we gained so much knowledge about environmental and energy issues in the U.S. (although your choice of topic for the assignments is not limited to only US topics).",
                "I became a better writer in this class -- Professor Klee provides fantastic memo feedback and great advice for writing. \r\n\r\nI also became much more aware of the challenges that policymakers face in crafting environmental policy and legislation, even in a liberal state such as Connecticut. Professor Klee has a whole bunch of insightful and amusing stories to share about his experiences as DEEP Commissioner that themselves make the class worthwhile.\r\n\r\nThe reading list for the class is also pretty great -- I especially liked reading the \"Anti-Resilience\" paper from Shalanda Baker, which I used as a basis for papers in other classes. Generally, this class has a great focus on equity and justice, which I haven't seen in other environmental policy classes at Yale.",

                "Strengths: fascinating readings, super interesting discussion, policy memos are interesting to write, Klee is great!\r\n\r\nRooms for improvement: the class discussion was sometimes a bit off to me -- I think we just pack a bit too much material into a once a week seminar, so it would have been nice to either discuss fewer topics to a deeper level or have the seminar twice a week. This is also a small thing, but sometimes the readings did not explicate well the breadth of policy on any given topic -- it would be nice to have that be a bit more clear before diving into discussion.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Klee is a fantastic and impassioned teacher who makes the space accessible to all levels of knowledge and insight\r\n- readings are extremely interesting and relevant \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- none, honestly! It's been one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
                "Professor Klee is the biggest strength of this class! He brought us all together, and his clear passion for the material fueled our conversations. I learned so much from the assignments and very constructive feedback, and also learned from my classmates' perspectives and presentations. \r\n\r\nI think the only potential weakness is size. I think the class was slightly too big, which made it difficult to get to know the other students and for every student to participate. The balance between speaking too little and too much was hard to find. This one area of improvement has nothing to do with the actual structure and content of the class, which was all around excellent.",
                "I greatly enjoyed this class! It was really interesting to consider such a wide variety of policies and have open discussions about the,",
                "Strengths: as elaborated above + very interesting readings\r\nWeaknesses: we weren't able to cover everything in-depth because there were too many points of discussion (which is a good thing honestly!). I'd also appreciate more non-US examples, but I learnt about the US too so that isn't a big issue.",
                "while i loved getting a flavor of a lot of different topics, it was just that: a flavor. I would have loved to spend more than one class session on topics because it felt like we were playing catch up the whole time and i don't feel like i expanded my knowledge base for the long term because there was so much information to retain from weekly readings and not enough done in class on any one topic to retain it all. i also would have enjoyed an introductory unit covering some basics about energy policy maybe? or theory? and then moving into case studies. the absolute best strength of the course was the feedback and help i got on my writing. Prof. Klee's comments were so thorough and i could tell that my writing improved a lot from the beginning to the end.",
                "I think sometimes the topics (particularly on the modules focused on energy) were kind of complex, so I think it might be helpful to slow down a bit more in these modules but overall the class is paced well and I genuinely enjoyed it a lot! This course was wonderful and has soo many strengths! The way the class is structured makes the workload manageable (the blue and green teams being on call for particular weeks) and the big assignments (op ed and memos) are interesting and allow us to engage deeply with class topics. Class discussions were also really interesting and Professor Klee invited us into the discussion based on the comments from our reading response, making participation so much more accessible. The hybrid mode was also so appreciated, allowing students who could not be in person to be present virtually.",
                "Strengths:\r\nGreat readings, fantastic feedback on written assignments. I felt like the work that I produced in this class could also be useful to policymakers in the real world. Professor Klee is also fantastic and incredibly knowledgeable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nWe didn't quite have enough time for all topics, namely the role of the private sector in environmental action. I think that's a pretty big topic and I wish that we had spent more time discussing it. \r\n\r\nSmall suggestion for next year:\r\nIt would be great to have separate Canvas folders for each week's readings, or a consistent file naming convention for all the articles and papers. This would have definitely made it easier to find and download each week's readings.",
                "strengths: cool material, interesting discussions with cool peers, cool stories about legislative and policy processes from the instructor; weaknesses: we were always behind on the material (but I guess it's kind of inevitable when we want to stop and talk more in depth about everything)",
                "I enjoyed how class was structured, with every assignment matching information in the syllabus and a consistent pattern to the week's reading, responses, and discussion. Especially when I was not on-call and may not have read the readings as thoroughly, I would have  liked to have been able to read my classmates' responses to the readings before class; would it be possible to do a Canvas discussion post rather than assignment post for weekly responses?",
                "Professor Klee was an amazing facilitator in class. The use of short reading responses, which did not require too much time but helped facilitate our thinking when doing the readings, was very helpful in bringing different perspectives onto the table effectively during the class. The class was so packed with insights that I wish we had more time each week to explore each topic more deeply - perhaps 2 x 1.5 hour classes each week would be more suitable."

The workload is reasonable, and the professor is accommodating. The classroom environment was also great.",
