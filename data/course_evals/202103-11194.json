                "This course absolutely radicalized my love of Russian Literature. The insight it gave me into the lives of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and how similar yet different the two authors are amazed me. It also enabled me to understand religion and faith in a whole new perspective through the lens of love and connecting to others -- particularly those who are least like us.",
                "A chance to read some of the most influential writers in history. This is a real \"class you should take in college\" course.",
                "How to close read a text. How to tease out literary techniques/form to form an overarching thesis about a greater message. How to stay on top of dense readings!",
                "I had read some of the texts included in the syllabus for this class but nothing compares to the analysis and context we got in our lectures with Prof. Brunson. It was such an enjoyable experience to sit there and take in everything about Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. I learned how to do a close reading of passages and write better literary analyses.",
                "Read Brothers Karamazov, Anna Karenina, The Double, The Notes from Underground, Childhood by Tolstoy and other short stories. Learned how to close read and do college level literary analysis.",
                "I learned to critically analyze the major works of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, to think about major themes in their work and to closely read them for the spirit of the works. I learned to compare them and to write analytically regarding them.",
                "I learned so much about these two authors. I also refined my essay-writing skills.",
                "To say I learned how to think about life, the world and my place in it in this class is an understatement. The novels will teach you the meaning of a life well-lived and Professor's Brunson's lectures will teach you the very meaning of eloquence. For humanities majors, the balance between close reading and thematic readings of the text in each lecture teach you how to approach essays. Best class I have taken at Yale.",
                "This class taught me so much about how to interpret literature, but so much more about life itself. In our first class, Prof. Brunson said that these were books we would be returning to in different moments of our lives. I can already see myself revising them for spiritual guidance!"

            "comments": [
                "There is altogether too much reading for this course. I think it'd be impossible to teach a Tolstoy and Dostoevsky class without a killer reading load, but there's just way too much to give the time the texts deserve. I wonder whether it might be better to just have a class on Tolstoy and a class on Dostoevsky, but then you obviously also miss a lot of valuable comparison. As it stands right now, there's just way too much reading to really give the authors the space they deserve. Professor Brunson and the teaching fellows are all fantastic.",
                "The course was focused on the life lessons that could be gained from the texts and the deep philosophical questions that the authors posed. I see this as a tremendous strength to the course.",
                "As a stem person I had a hard time with the reading load (but that's on me), and I think we did not need a final  especially one with memorization  but in terms of the course itself no notes.",
                "Strengths: Professor Brunson is terrific, books are good\r\nWeaknesses: lectures are sometimes only tangentially related to the reading, reading load is massive",
                "This course is by far the best course I've taken at Yale ever. Strengths: Prof. Brunson and the TFs. They are incredibly passionate, intelligent, and warm-hearted people. I thought it was fascinating the blend of literary analysis, historical context, and author biographical details that the professor interwove in this class. No. weaknesses. Not a one. Only weakness: that I can't take this course all year long.",
                "The final paper plus the final made the last part of the semester way more stressful than necessary! Have one or the other OR shift the midterm paper and final paper to be earlier in the semester. I understand we had to finish reading Anna Karenina before the first paper but maybe make it so you dont have to and make the prompt more open?",
                "Well, unfortunately there are a lot of readings, but they are worth it. The class requires very high engagement which is why I think it is unncesasry to have both a final paper and a final exam. \r\nso strength is that the level of engagement is rewarding but weakness is that the level of engagement requires a lot of TIME",
                "Lecture and section were always super engaging and facilitated such interesting discussions because of how open the professor/TF were to new perspectives. They always encouraged us to think and say whatever made us feel a certain way and that theres no wrong answer, and that made me feel really comfortable sharing my opinions and digesting the text. The only weakness I can think of is that lecture was always too short. There were always things we wanted to discuss more but couldnt because of time.",
                "Every lecture by Professor Brunson was well-thought out and related to the previous lectures. It was like she was taking us on a journey through the lives of these authors. Some of the lectures brought me close to tears. Sections were more closely considering detailed strands within the work. However, I do think sections were too big (consisted of half the class) and the class could have benefited from smaller sections and more TAs. Overall this was my favorite class at Yale.",
                "I loved that we were able to read a variety of texts from each author, from early works to short stories to classic novels like Anna Karenina and Brothers Karamazov. Professor Brunson's lectures are brilliant, but I personally wish that she created more opportunities for student discussion during lecture in the second half of the class. I also wish that we could have shared our reading responses on some sort of discussion platformI know this wasn't a popular sentiment among students in the other section, but I think it would have helped foster a stronger sense of community.",
                "Prof. and TAs worked very well together and created a great class. Books were fantastic, though long at times. Writing assignments were stressful at times as well.",
                "Strengths - EVERYTHING. Every single lecture, every single novel we read and every single section with Liliya will remain in my mind the highlight of my academic journey at Yale. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - this class literally cannot be improved, except possibly by having a part 2 in which we read Crime and Punishment, War and Peace and more Tolstoevsky. If anything, I would include more Tolstoy in the second half of the semester (like Death of Ivan Ilyich as initially planned) to break up the monotony of Dostoevsky.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Brunson's immensely engaging lectures, the profoundly inspiring texts and the brilliant and extremely kind TF's!\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the reading was very fast-paced (especially for Anna K and Brothers K) so it could be a little overwhelming at times."

                "Yes, because it provided me with a body of literature that I will continue to reference for the rest of my life. Despite being a student from the school of architecture, I found ways to relate the works of these two authors to my own artistic endeavors.",
                "I never write these but this course deserves the full 4000 characters. This is one of those courses that make you glad you go to Yale because you have the opportunity to take something like this for fun. Words cannot express how much I loved this course. This has been such an enriching and enjoyable learning experience. This course is the definition of the benefits of a liberal arts education. I have come out of this course with so much cultural, emotional and philosophical baggage that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. Professor Brunson is one of the best lecturers I have ever had at Yale. Every glowing review of this course is not doing it justice. As a STEM major, I was scared of the depth of these writers, but Prof. Brunson breaks all of the concepts down so well you don't feel inept at all. If this course is listed, TAKE IT. Don't think twice. TAKE. IT. Move everything around to take this course, you won't regret it.",
                "I would recommend this course to everyone. Whether one enjoys Russian Literature or not, this course is the study of the human condition with a search to enter life's existential questions about meaning, love, death, and redemption. Any person can become more humane by taking this course, and discover the beauty of loving all humans beyond their sins.",
                "If you're willing to do the reading, you won't regret it. Professor Brunson is an expert and you'll be better for having read Tolstoy and Dostoevsky's works. Plus it's a pretty good brag.",
                "YES YES YES A MILLION TIMES YES. This is the best course I've ever taken at Yale. Reading Tolstoy & Dostoevsky literally changed my life. So many life revelations. I think that this class and Prof. Brunson have made me a better human, a better friend, a better sister, a better student.",
                "This course is an absolute gem; these works changed my life. No, not in the \"omg I studied abroad for a month and it CHANGED my LIFE\" kind of way, like \"I feel the literal hand of God in these books\" kind of way. Do yourself a favor and take this course.",
                "Yes, but only if you have TIME to actually DO THE READINGS! You wont get anything out of the class if you dont and thats the only way to truly enjoy the class and the wonderful literature.",
                "yes! if you are even slightly thinking about it, yes!",
                "Absolutely, this is undoubtedly my favorite course I have taken at Yale. The professor is the most engaging lecturer Ive had, my TF was outstanding, and the books we read throughout the semester were incredible. You cant stop thinking about them once you finish reading. Discussion section was also something I always looked forward to, since both the professor and the TF put a big emphasis on how theres really no wrong way to interpret literature and whatever you get from the reading is personal to you. It made reading and analyzing a lot less restrictive and I felt free to talk a lot in section, in lecture, and in my written assignments as well. I cant recommend this course enough.",
                "I will recommend this course to anyone I meet. Everyone should read Tolsoy and Dostoevsky, they are the absolute best. Professor Brunson and the TAs were so knowledgeable on the topic and really love these authors. They instill a passion for them in their students too.",
                "Yes! There is a lot of reading, but this class is so worth your time. Very accessible for humanities and non-humanities majors alike.",
                "I would if they are into Russian literature. Otherwise it is just too much work. It is a difficult class at times, so you really need to love what youre doing.",
                "Yes yes yes yes yes! If you don't take this class, you are making the biggest mistake of your academic career. This class was hands-down the best class I have ever taken at Yale, and the books gave me the courage to turn my life around.\r\n\r\nThe readings are manageable and wonderful. Trust me, when you get into Anna Karenina you cannot put it down.",
