                "I learned about the theoretical framework of international cooperation such as realism, hegemonic stability theory, how domestic politics factor into cooperation, etc., as well as how various international institutions facilitate cooperation.",
                "The first half of the course focused on political theories of international cooperation and states' competing interests. Readings tended to be quite theoretical, and offered interesting perspectives from a range of political scientists.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the course provided a survey of issue areas and how institutions seek to promote cooperation in each case. I developed a better understanding of the historical backgrounds and ongoing efforts in a wide variety of domains.\r\n\r\nOverall, the course also fostered a sense of awareness for current events and how international cooperation (or the lack thereof) play a role in shaping the global discussion today.",
                "I learned about international relations.",
                "I gained knowledge of basic IR theory and a survey of various cooperative problems.",

                "I learned a ton about international cooperation and relations theory, both through readings and in lecture. The second half of the course, when we focused on specific issues of international cooperation, also helped me understand a lot more about specific issues and institutions like the WTO, ICC, etc.",
                "I gained a theoretical understanding of international relations and the ability to apply these theories to real-world problems and issue areas.",
                "I learned about the theory behind international relations / cooperation for the first half of the class. This is what is says in the syllabus: political processes and institutions that facilitate cooperation, obstacles to cooperation in the international arena, reasons for the creation of international laws and institutions, and the extent to which such institutions actually affect state policy, etc. The second half of the class was more interesting. Each lecture we took a particular area of the international arena and learned about it. This includes global health, the international criminal court, the international court of justice, international conflict, the UN, etc. I came away with a really solid understanding of the theory behind international cooperation, as well as a solid understand of what each major international institution does, the challenges they face, etc",
                "theories of international law and cooperation, current and important intl issues (such as climate change and war), and tools to appropriately approach cooperation issues",

                "This course is an excellent introduction to international relations. The structure of the course made sense, with the first half dedicating to theory, and the second being more focused on applications. I came out of this course with a strong understanding of why cooperation problems are especially hard to solve in the international arena, learning about anarchy, hegemonic stability theory, reputation as a leading deterrent, etc. I have a strong appreciation for the role of international organizations in resolving conflict, and I am familiar with the main bodies of the UN.",
                "Great course, very accesible.",
                "I learned a LOT about how the international world cooperates or negotiates issues, how our global order works, and why some issue areas are way harder to address than others! I also learned how to critically examine a cooperation problem and write a memo critiquing laws regarding an issue. I genuinely did learn a lot in this class (but it wasn't the most engaging interesting class in the process)",
                "I learned about a lot of theories surrounding international cooperation, gained a basic understanding of how international law works, and learned about some real world applications of cooperation such as trade, finance, and nuclear nonproliferation.",
                "This is not an international relations course where you will learn about various nations and their interactions with one another (social, political, economic activities, etc.). Instead, this course focuses on how nations interact with one another, taking a much more theoretical teaching. A lot of time is also dedicated to understanding how international organizations and institutions operate",
                "I learned a lot about political science theory as it relates to international cooperation. I learned about the interactions between theory and the real world.",
                "I now have a much greater grasp on international cooperation ,organizations and institutions",
                "Exposed to fundamental ways of analyzing international cooperation and current international organizations.",

                "A good broad overview of International Cooperation through various lenses.",
                "It is a great intro to international relations class! Cooperation seems like one of the most basic and prevalent issues that nations face in the international context. Through my understanding of that, I am ready to learn more about how states interact.",
                "Learned basic concepts of International Relations Theory and how they apply to understanding patterns of international cooperation; also read many key foundational texts by influential economic/political theorists like Mearsheimer, Keohane, Guzman, Axelrod, Fearon, etc; used basic game theory concepts to illustrate how the prisoner's dilemma makes it very difficult to maintain international cooperation and discussed how institutions are created to overcome such problems",

                "This course provided an overview of theory in international relations related to cooperation problems. We also looked at real world cooperation problems and specific international organizations created to overcome these challenges."

            "comments": [
                "The lecture portion of the course was fantastic (interesting, engaging, personal), but the section was lacking. My TA tried his best to engage students, but participation and attendance were low. I do not think most students completed the weekly readings. In addition, the readings we discussed in section were typically from the previous week, and since reading those texts we had been assigned new texts. It was difficult to have a productive discussion about readings I barely remembered.",
                "Strengths: Really cool topic, Prof. Pratt is VERY good at making complicated details seem super straightforward\r\nWeaknesses: Reading list is long enough that students really don't bother, final memo assignment really wasn't that relevant to course material",
                "Strengths: Professor Pratt is a great lecturer, content is interesting and well-sequenced, workload is very manageable and everything is graded fairly. Weaknesses: Maybe slightly less focus on theory so there's more time for real-world applications, and slightly less time focusing on current events before every class as it ate up about 5-10 minutes of lecture.",
                "Strengths: The course was well-organized to facilitate learning. The objective or topic of each lecture was clear, and Professor Pratt presented the material clearly. The readings were really interesting, and relevant to understanding the course material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings were quite long or theoretical, making it easy to get lost in the weeds. Having guidelines as to which topics or pages to focus on in these readings would be more conducive to learning.",
                "I liked how short lectures were, but they could flow better and be better related to each other.",
                "Strengths: It was nice to have the option to view lectures remotely. The assignments were reasonable and clearly explained. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Having an exam and a paper due in the span of a week was kind of rough. I would recommend spacing it out in the future.",
                "Very strong organizationally (powerpoints, canvas modules, and announcements) as I never felt out of the loop even if I could not come to lecture or section. Lectures could possibly be condensed into one-day weekly with longer hours so as to improve attendance and engagement.",
                "Readings were good, lectures were excellent, and assessments were fair and manageable. Prof. Pratt is excellent and alone a great reason to take this course. The biggest downside to this course is the section (or at least mine), because no one else spoke very much and we mostly summarized the readings. A couple times we had interesting discussions but generally it was boring and not helpful, although this was not the TAs fault at all. The assignments for the course also piled up a little bit at the end, but it was not too bad.",
                "Professor Pratt is a terrific professor- his lectures were clear and organized, and he was always willing to make himself available to answer students' questions. The course material is very interested, and it is definitely manageable for someone who has not taken an international relations class before.",
                "The course was so well taught. Lectures were fun, engaging, and easy to follow. Readings were great. I really can't think of a way to improve the course.",
                "Strength: Prof. Pratt is a great lecturer, encourages questions, and answers them very graciously. On top of that, the course material is very interesting! \r\nWeakness: few to none!",
                "TPratt was a great lecturer and I think my section time was useful in clarifying points from lecture and the readings. This course covered a lot which definitely made it worth my time but I do wish we could've gone into more depth on some topics.",
                "Strenghts -- learn a lot! T Pratt does a good job of laying a foundation of knowledge and then building upon it to examine specific issue areas! It's also super applicable information for the world. Like I find myself thinking about what I learned while I read the news and such. \r\nWeakness -- kind of boring at times. Easy to zone out and even tho I was learning a lot it felt a little boring at times.",
                "This course was my favorite this semestrer! This was my first semester at Yale College but i would have expected nothing less from a Yale Global affairs course. It is very well organized and there is a natural coherence between the material taught in lectures. Professor Pratt is definitely among its strengths. This course covers a wide scope of issues and gives interesting real-world applications for everything we learn. I found the assignments to be to the point as they actually let us use what we learnt in theory and explain contemporary issues. I loved how the professor began every lecture with talking about significant international developments on the news- the attention of everyone (who is interested in global politics) was successfully drawn in the lecture. Regarding the weaknesses, I am not sure that the open-note exams actually helped me learn the material. For sure it is a way to focus on understanding and explaining the material rather than remembering them by heart, but personally, some in-class quizzes (without notes) would help me learn the material and be able to recall it.",
                "Professor Pratts lectures were incredibly interesting and engaging. Too much reading was assigned in my opinion, and there wasnt much reason to do it (aside from discussion section participation).",
                "The material is easy but not very engaging\r\nCourse material does not include enough \"real-world\" applications",
                "Strengths: Grading was very fair, Prof Pratt is a good lecturer, I liked looking at international cooperation from both the theory and real world sides. \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the theory was a little dry so the readings were a bit dull. But ultimately useful later on in the course.",
                "Some weeks there were way too many readings to be done throughly but the professor recognized this near the end \r\nSince I didnt take Econ some of those theories were harder to grasp at the beginning \r\nLoved having the slides in advance \r\nReally good integration of historical and current events",
                "Strengths: The content is fascinating and the course is structured in an engaging Independent variable - international cooperation (DV) structure.",
                "The sections were very good as were the lectures.",
                "I liked having section every week to recap the 2 lectures that happened in that week, that was this course's main strength. I also like how the lectures were recorded as it gave me the choice to re-watch the things I may have missed or need a recap on.",
                "Readings seemed repetitive",
                "The recorded lecture format was very helpful, especially for busy weeks.",
                "The lectures were engaging, and section really allowed us to dive deeper into the material.",
                "Strengths-Professor Pratt is a great lecturer. He really makes sure students understand the material and assigns interesting readings.",
                "Strengths: as long as you go to lecture/section and pay attention, this class is very easy (even for someone who has never taken a poly sci class before) and the concepts are all mostly very simple to grasp because Professor Pratt does a great job explaining them; my TF (Alasdair) was very helpful and knowledgeable; it is easy to see how the course material directly relates to the modern international sphere, and Professor Pratt does a great job of using real-world examples; you can probably get away with not doing 100% of the readings all the time, but they are all so interesting that I'd recommend completing them anyways; also all lectures are recorded, so that's a plus || Weaknesses: because there were only ever two exams and one final paper (and no smaller assignments or study guides), it was at times hard to gauge my understanding of the material before exams (though this did not end up being all that much of a problem, since the exams themselves were so easy); sometimes, the course material felt too simplified",
                "Very few grades. Take it as you will",
                "The lectures were engaging and my teaching fellow, Rick did a good job of summarizing and delving deeper into the topics discussed. I wish there had been more writing in the form of reading responses. Before midterm, there were no assignments other than reading. The readings were good, but the two exams were more just reading tests rather than opportunities to analyze the text. I think a midterm paper would be better at that.",
                "Course was well-taught and manageable. Lectures could have been a little bit longer to make sure we were able to cover each module completely without spilling over into other days. Integration of current events into the curriculum was a nice way to give context to theory we learned in class."

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in the subject matter. Anyone who wants to know a little bit more about various world issues would enjoy this course. However, I wouldn't recommend this course to a student who is looking for in-depth knowledge about a particular area/region/topic.",
                "Yes, definitely. Just don't take it purely because \"international law\" is in the name. Int'l law is mentioned tangentially a handful of times but this is essentially a political science class on cooperation (geared toward international cooperation in particular).",
                "Yes, definitely. I really enjoyed this course and learned all about international cooperation, international institutions, and current events surrounding these topics. Professor Pratt is a great, engaging lecturer and cares about his students. The workload was very manageable (2 hourlong midterms - on canvas + a final policy memo) and for the memo we received ample feedback from our TA and another student. Take this class, as it's super relevant to the world today and is well-organized.",

                "Yes!\r\nYou get out of it what you put in.",

Prof. Pratt is great, the material is really interesting and the course is designed well to help you think through it all. The assignments are reasonable and good chances to review. Other than section, it was really great.",
                "Yes! Professor Pratt is an excellent professor, the class is well-organized, and it gives you a broad understanding of the theory and practice of international cooperation.",
                "Absolutely I would recommend this course if you are interested in a great international relations overview course and want to learn both theory and about practical topics and current events too.",
                "Yes!! This is not a hard class, and all of the material is very interesting.",
                "Yes- this course is a really good intro if you are exploring the Poli Sci or Global Affairs majors. However, if you have a strong base of knowledge/theory in these areas, you may find this course to be a little basic.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Pratt is an excellent lecturer and he gets the job done! Obviously, some people might argue that there is too strong of a focus on IO's or that some topics were neglected, but this is first and foremost a survey course. I've been exposed to many important concepts in IR and have retained a lot of the vocabulary necessary to meaningfully conduct conversations in this subject. The workload was very fair, and the readings were extremely engaging in the first half. The second half is a lot of Hurd, who explains the structure and mechanisms of bodies such as the WTO and Security Council. This isn't the most riveting or intellectually stimulating material, but it is important in informing conclusions about international politics the essentials.",
                "yes",
                "yes if you want a gut, are okay with a more boring class, but want to learn a lot! It was definitely not the most engaging, dig in class I've had at Yale, but I learned a lot for a gut so yeah i guess! I wouldn't necessarily take it if I could do my semester over again but I didn't dislike the class.",
                "Yes, I think this course gives a lot of good things to think about and a good starting point for international relations even if you don't agree with many of the idealistic principles taught in this course. If you have already taken an IR course or Game Theory, a lot of the concepts will likely be review and may feel repetitive.",
                "Totally! If someone is thinking of majoring in global affairs or simply wants to understand how global politics work in detail, I would definitely recommend this course! I took it as a freshman with some background in international relations and it was absolutely manageable. Professor Pratt and TA Rick will do an amazing job engaging all students in the course with their engaging and interactive ways of teaching.",
                "Yes! A super interesting and fun introduction to international cooperation. A great first IR/poly sci class, but I imagine the class would still be interesting to a global affairs major.",
