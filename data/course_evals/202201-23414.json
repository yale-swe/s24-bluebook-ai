                "Learned a bit about digital preservation, how archives work, origins of the Internet, and early writing systems. As far as skills, I learned how to do an annotated bibliography, which I had never done before. I did learn better reading skills, too, since the readings were super long compared to what I'm used to, so I learned how to skim. I also learned a bit about how to use Yale's library system, which I had never really used before.",
                "This class changes the way you appreciate libraries. The readings can be tough, and you need to learn how to grab important information. While the seminar can be great and there were some interesting conversations, the best part of this class is the field trip: you explore the different libraries and collections at Yale like clay tablets and microfilms. You learn about the evolution of information and how we even get to the library. You meet librarians, archivists, and researchers and hear from them firsthand the role they play. The class also works as an introduction to navigating the libraries at Yale and how to use its resources during your next few years.",

                "Comprehend, analyze, and make connections between secondary sources on history. Learned a lot about book culture throughout the ages, especially early modern Europe.",
                "We studied the communication and transmission of information from the beginning of recorded civilization to the modern digital age. The course focused on ancient civilizations and writing, early forms of written information, the advent of printing, archiving and data retrieval systems, databases, and research.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of writing, language, and the culture of how information is stored, valued, and disseminated throughout western civilizations. Also developed research and writing skills."

                "Strengths: the idea of the course in general, of tracking how information is organized, disseminated, and passed down through the generations is cool. Also a strength is that the class is pretty easy.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: despite the premise of the course sounding really cool, the actual stuff we ended up learning about, reading about, etc. ended up being way less interesting to me than I expected. Not sure how to fix that, but maybe it could be improved by constantly tying in the specifics of what we're learning about (microfilm, printing presses, etc.) to large-scale themes of keeping information alive and having it better empower society. Actually I'm not totally sure that that would solve the problem but anyway it's an idea.\r\nAlso, the discussions generally were not that lively or interesting, partially because of low participation. I wonder if having people lower their laptop screens might have made the discussions better.",
                "This course is very strong in the amount of engagement as it contains numerous field trips that our very fun and eventful.",
                "Field trips, visits to archives, and visits from experts were extremely helpful in interacting with this knowledge and asking questions. Seeing actual examples of the stages of evolution of books was very helpful and super cool.",
                "The course is a nice overview of some interesting topics, although it was often hard to follow the flow of concepts from one class to the next. The format of the class, open discussion with a student discussion leader, did not lend itself well to engagement and enthusiastic understanding, and the guest lectures, while interesting, often felt too long or drawn out to fill the class time. The overall pacing of assignments felt frustratingly lopsided, and although we developed some surface understanding of the topics, the course itself felt too meta to come away with specific knowledge.",
                "A strength of the course is the structure of where we have classes, as students get to experience different famous collections that Yale has to offer. A weakness could be the readings selected for the class, as some are repetitive and do not facilitate great conversation."
