This course taught me to analyze short stories and literature in depth and read new pieces of classic Russian literature that I hadn't even heard of before.",

                "The class goes through the works of various famed Russian writers, and students have the opportunity to get exposed to Russian in literature. Since many Heritage speakers take the class, this is a great way as a non-Heritage speaker to get exposed to real conversations and discussions in Russian with Russians. I can't think of much ways to improve the class as it is great as it is.",
                "I honestly don't see any weaknesses of this course. Some strengths were that this class was very engaging and often was classroom discussions between the students and professor; the professor had a lot of experience and knew exactly how to teach the readings for the different levels of language students in the class might have had.",
                "The strengths of this course include the reading list, the discussions, and the supportive environment. One weakness of the course was that few students participated in discussion, which made some of the conversations a little dull. I am not sure how to improve the quality of the discussion, but encouraging greater participation would be great."

                "I would only recommend this class to people seriously studying Russian. The class significantly improved my knowledge and especially my listening skills in Russian as all the discussions were in Russian and with mostly Heritage speakers.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, but because this is a high level Russian language course, the student would have to have an appropriate background in Russian to take this course. However, this course is very engaging, interesting, and fun. So, I would recommend it to another student who wants to take this course.",
                "Yes, definitely! A great course to begin reading literature in Russian and to develop your academic writing skills."
