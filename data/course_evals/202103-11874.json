I have taken less advanced Calculus courses in high school, and this class built on those themes very nicely. I was always really confused when I learned about MacLaurin and Taylor series in the past, and I loved learning about them in this class-- I thought this topic in particular was really rewarding and interesting.",

            "comments": [
                "I feel that all sections, regardless of teacher, should be standardized. Some days we had substitutes and their class set-up was day-and-night different from our regular teacher's.",
                "Strengths: you learn calculus pretty well. You learn a lot, but never at an overwhelming pace.\r\nWeaknesses: it's calculus. I'm not really a big math guy. It's just a lot of math, which isn't totally my thing. But as far as math goes, it was a pretty good class.",
                "I greatly appreciated the explorations and concept checks for extra practice.",
                "The strengths of this course was that it offered support for students who needed extra help to learn the material. Weaknesses of this course were that the 90 minute time slots were almost too long to stay engaged for the entire time. I often found myself zoning out. Also, the material we learned in class seemed simply explained and easy to follow, but on the midterms and final they seemed to choose the most complex or complicated way to present these topics, or used complex applications that were much harder than in class. Because of this I, at times, found it difficult to study for the tests.",
                "I learned a lot during this course, but I dont think it was very well organized. I also think that there was some discrepancy in learning between classes because of the different professors. The problem sets helped me to understand the content better, and every class period was used well.",
                "The strengths would be the immense amount of office hours and homework sessions we could attend. I also loved the preparations offered when there's a midterm coming up. Some weaknesses would be how our Psets are due on Wednesday at midnight when some people still have class to attend on Thursday.",
                "I like the amount of review sessions and ease to get help. I wish the exams counted as a smaller portion of the grade and the homework was more.",
                "Could be improved through more involved teachers.",
                "The strength of the class is that the teachers tend to be pretty available after class for help. The weakness is that it's taught lecture style with minimal interaction with the students despite the class size being fairly small.",
                "This course was straightforward and well organized in terms of logistics. It was not a heavy workload and the exams were fair and clear. However, the course was poorly organized in terms of material (jumping between chapters in the textbook in a nonsensical manner). It also did not go beyond the mechanics of calculus  there was none of the \"why\"  only the \"how.\" Because of that, it did not foster any curiosity or inspire further study of mathematics.",
                "Strengths - the pre-class videos, problem sets, and assignments correlated well with what was on the exams. I never felt particularly overwhelmed with the course, and when I was stressed, it was usually when studying for exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - if there is anything that hinders a course like Math 115, its the variation between the section instructors that teach it. If you get a great teacher, congrats! If you get a less-great one, youre in for a lot of work on your part to understand the material. I think I got reasonably lucky with mine, but hearing feedback from others made me realize the large disparity between sections. Probably the biggest annoyance though was the exam gradingI understand were supposed to be able to apply the math with a certain degree of accuracy because messing up has repercussions in the real worldbut it was quite annoying to correctly apply the calculus principles we learned in the course, only to lose over half the points on some questions for something like notation or forgetting a negative sign somewhere.",
                "I think that one weakness of this course is that it isn't organized very efficiently. The way that Yale organizes the course is completely different from the way the material is structured in the textbook (for example, I found us jumping around from chapter to chapter, covering material from Chapter 11 before Chapter 6 but after Chapter 7). Handling the material in this way meant that I felt like I was sometimes lacking the basic foundations for the subject matter in each specific unit, or makes each unit seem like a totally separate topic (for example, it might have been helpful to learn about improper integrals and convergence/divergence while learning about integration in the first place). I think organizing the material in the order that the textbook did would have made the topics easier to understand. \r\n\r\nI also think the class would benefit from more time to go into the actual concepts behind the topics, rather than just learning the theorems at surface level. This might be an issue with timing and how much material is squeezed into a semester, but I sometimes found myself frustrated that we didn't have the time/chance to learn the actual concepts and proofs behind these ideas.\r\n\r\nI think one strength of the class is the problem sets-- I always felt like they were fair and interesting, challenging questions that really made me think about the material.",
                "Strengths: The review sessions were great recaps of course materials. In addition, the course seems like it's helpful for higher level math courses. \r\nWeaknesses: Weekly Explore Tasks were not necessary...I think the weekly PSETs would've been sufficient.",
                "the peer tutors are the backbone of the course. Without them I think I really would have suffered.",
                "It could be approved with section times where there are more practice problems to be reviewed.",
                "There are plenty of materials provided for review before the exams, and the workload is reasonable. However, the quality of teaching greatly depends on who you draw in the lottery."
