    "Extremely good breadth of commonly-used Chinese characters; I improved my reading and writing much more than I expected and further improved existing speaking\/understanding skills.",
    "Improved my reading and writing IMMENSELY. Coming into the semester I could read maybe 15 characters. In the final I felt great doing a reading comprehension passage and writing a 250 response on my own. I think that's incredible. Coming home, my first meal was with my grandparents who don't speak English. They immediately noticed my improvement in speaking as well - it flows better, sounds more natural. It blows my mind how much I've improved in just one semester.",
    "I learned a lot of Chinese, especially looking back and realizing how few characters I could read at the beginning of the year. I am definitely much better at reading and writing. Although I didn't like speaking in front of a whole class, I realize that now I am a lot more confident speaking Chinese. It feels good to have a class where you can see substantial progress.",
    "I learned how to improve my Chinese speaking much better with the help of my teachers and my classmates. Simultaneously, I learned advanced grammar and vocabulary that allowed my writing to improve as well.",
    "I've gotten so much better at speaking\/writing\/reading Chinese.",
    "Basic Chinese language skills, speaking writing"

   "comments": [
    "About 2\/3 of the way through the semester, the course picks up (two lessons per week instead of just one lesson per week). This was pretty jarring and I felt like it resulted in me having less mastery over the material covered in the latter 1\/3 of the class. I personally think it would have been more beneficial to me to have kept the same pace throughout the entirety of the course, as depth > breadth, especially because classes later in the Chinese language sequence build upon what has previously been learned.",
    "Strength: style and content of teaching catered towards heritage-learners\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The pace sometimes felt a little bit too fast to retain everything from certain lessons, but this could have been improved personally with more studying as well.",
    "Really no weaknesses I can think of. This was a hard course with decent workload but reasonable for 1.5 credits. Teaching was great, the textbook readings were interesting, and I learned a lot beyond just memorizing characters.",
    "A strength of the course is the style of teaching. The fact that it is more \"socratic seminar\"-y style allows us all to practice Chinese, and also get very close to the other students in the class. I also really liked the textbook, even if it felt a bit like it was propaganda or contrived, because at least most of the content was daily conversation and more casual style Chinese. I think I really was taking the class to improve my Chinese when I go home and to China, so that is a lot more helpful rather than literary, formal Chinese. \r\nUnfortunately, that also means I felt like the essays I wrote were really colloquial and it was frustrating that it felt like I was writing in such an elementary style. Another weakness was that oftentimes I didn't know how to take notes in class, because the teacher goes over constructions in the text but speaks too fast for you to write her additional examples down. I ended up never really taking notes, hoping my brain absorbed what she said, and just studying what was in the textbook.",
    "The course is rigorous, even for heritage learners. The course could be better paced by spacing out the workload, or daily quizzes."

    "This course is extremely time-intensive. If your other classes are very time-intensive, I would not recommend taking this course. If your other classes are not very time-intensive, however, I would recommend taking this course. It forces you to learn at a very quick (yet still manageable) rate, and I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I feel I've improved just through one semester. It definitely pays off if your other classes are not as time-intensive and you can actually devote yourself to improving your Chinese rather than just trying to complete the assignments.",
    "Definitely, this was by far my favorite class this semester and it's an amazing course to take for any heritage-learner looking to improve language skills or seek a stronger connection to their culture.",
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "I think this class was pretty well taught and organized, so I would recommend this course to another student. It was a lot of memorizing everyday, but I don't see how that could have been avoided if we were going to learn the characters. The teachers are really friendly and it's kind of nice to have a class where you automatically have something in common.",
    "YES!",
    "I would recommend this  course to other heritage learners if they want to continue to improve their Chinese skills.",
    "YES!",
    "Yes, students come in with varying Chinese proficiency. I came in basically illiterate but had a stronger speaking and listening ability and did not feel like I was behind. If you are also interested in learning traditional characters you can choose to do that as well! Liu  is super kind and friendly and is a great chinese teacher."
