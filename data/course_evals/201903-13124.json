    "This is the best course I have taken in my four years at Yale. I have no complaints nor suggestions for improvement. Seminar discussions were intellectually rigorous and well-guided with a gentle touch, and the syllabus was expertly constructed. In this course, we probed the depths of the human soul as expressed in great drama from Aeschylus and Shakespeare to modern-day dramatists. We appreciated works for their beauty and emotional, something that too often goes underappreciated in academia. And we also connected our insights from the study of these great works with modern-day  relevant policy issues, mostly mass incarceration. It is this leap between the beholding of art\/the human spirit and policy discussion that more Yale classes must make, the blending of the human and the systemic. It is what our times require.",
    "The most important skill I was able to hone in this seminar was that of close reading. Our professors encouraged us to root our writing in that type of analysis, and it added a really useful new dimension to my humanities scholarship. My close reading improved immensely over the course of the term, and that is a type of writing that is mostly absent from typical American Studies work, but one that will be quite useful. There were also myriad insights on the connection between criminal justice and humanities scholarship, the difference between justice and mercy, and the best way to engage in a judgement-free seminar--too many to name in this little box.",
    "You get the Renaissance credit AND get to learn about the modern-day criminal justice system.",
    "I gained significant skills in close reading, and in crafting thoughtful, persuasive structures for my analytical essays. Beyond that, I gained deeply valuable insights from both the professors and my peers about questions of justice, mercy, equity, and forgiveness that have transformed my worldview, and that  will continue to shape how I approach these issues.",
    "English 210 is a really wonderful course that has taught me so much in multiple ways - both expected and unexpected. First, I think the breadth of the reading in this class is really compelling; I learned so much about Shakespeare's dramas, contemporary plays, literary essays... and the conversations about these texts are also deeply instructive. From my classmates and from Professor Hyun and Professor Manley, I've learned so much about the implications of justice, the power and problems of forgiveness\/mercy, the complications of criminal justice, retribution\/restoration, accountability. Along the way, my close-reading skills and writing have improved - with the copious amount of feedback and support\/guidance from the professors - as well. This is all to say, the learning in this class is deep and worthwhile; this is a course that teaches its students with purpose that extends beyond the classroom.",
    "I really learned how to identify and think through the different aspects of the concepts of \"justice\" and \"mercy,\" both through classic literature and modern accounts of the U.S. criminal justice system. I questioned my own beliefs regarding justice and mercy, and learned how to integrate my beliefs with all of the material throughout the class. I learned how to see justice and mercy through a variety of perspectives, which has really helped to widen and deepen my understanding of all that justice and mercy entail.",
    "Learned how to close read a text\/film. Analyzed how themes of vengeance and forms of incarceration have changed over the centuries. Posed challenging questions about solutions to modern-day social issues.",
    "Reading literatures in conversation with each other across time periods and, more importantly, how to use these works (contemporary and very old) to discuss, understand, and respond to issues facing our nation and world today.",
    "I learned a lottt about the justice system in the United States. I also learned a lot about how art, especially theater and literature, interacts with the justice system. I gained the skill of talking about modern-day issues in the context of work that's hundreds of years old. We went through many different kinds of work and interacted with all kinds of different mediums. The questions asked in the class were incredibly deep and unique.",
    "I learned how to write much more effectively, and to analyze themes in the various texts that I read.",
    "This course reframed how I think about justice and mercy, and who deserves it, and what it means. It deepened my understanding of mass incarceration and the carceral state in America in a huge way, and reaffirmed my conviction that great change must be made in this country, while giving more specific and productive ways of understanding what that change means. It illuminated the ways in which dramatic literature, and more broadly, the arts, can be a catalyst or a means of enacting change in the world  in other words, how art has the power to move  which, as an artist, writer, and actor, was indescribably valuable. I learned so much from the students in the class!!! As well as the professors!!! Everyone was amazing!!! I cannot overstate how incredible this course was.",
    "SO MUCH! Such a great course. I learned how to apply the themes and ideas of Shakespeare to present, important, contemporary issues. I also learned how to take my close analysis and apply it to a larger point."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class was perfect. The only possible improvement I can think of is the possibility of integrating embodiment into the discussion of plays; maybe once or twice having people in the class actually play or do scenes rather than just read them.",
    "This course was strong! The subject matter is engaging, the professors are committed and worked wonderfully together, the group of students built something special. It attempted to make a connection--between literary drama and the ideals of justice--that I find to be critically important. I'd say the one of the only weaknesses was that the discussions sometimes felt a little stilted--people sometimes had trouble building off of what other students were saying, as opposed to just contributing another smart (but separate) idea. But this was really only true some of the time--many of our discussions were full of direct responses. I would have also made our Shakespeare portion slightly shorter and expanded on some of the later\/contemporary drama we read in the latter half of the term! And although I wouldn't have traded anyone in the group, there were probably just a few too many students. Some weaknesses had to do with the teaching team, but I'll elaborate on those below! Overall, this class was great.",
    "One strength of this course was that you apply the humanities to real-world issues.",
    "The syllabus was amazing! It was interdisciplinary and thoughtfully constructed. The assignments were structured to allow our ideas & writing to grow and develop over the course. Both professors created a wonderfully open and supportive classroom environment; and every discussion was truly engaging.",
    "This class really pushes you to think about hard-hitting social\/political issues as well as personal moral problems. It does a great job of encouraging open discussion\/debate, especially in areas where people disagree or find tension. I would say that a weakness is the fact that there are too many texts so you do not get to spend enough time thoroughly discussing each one, which can be frustrating if you find certain aspects particularly interesting but those don't get mentioned in class. I also found that the focus was so much often on justice and mercy that broader themes such as gender, sexuality, love, etc. got over looked.",
    "The strengths of this course cannot be overstated. For one, the roster of readings is really wonderful; we start with the Aeschylus, then go on to read Measure for Measure\/The Merchant of Venice\/King Lear\/Othello, and finish with contemporary literatures and re-imaginings of the Shakespearean\/Greek readings. The teaching is also STELLAR in this course. Both Prof. Hyun and Prof. Manley do so, so much work to design and execute this course in a way that lives up to the spirit of the material. I also loved that our discussions were always so well-directed and robust. The seminars are well-structured and dynamic. Themes are not repetitive at all; rather, I feel that I learn something new\/am presented with new questions after every class. Weaknesses are... nonexistent in my mind.",
    "I think that in the future, instructors should be wary of asking discussion questions like should drugs be legalized without allotting a significant period of time to discuss and assigning relevant texts. Incorporating real-world, modern-day questions into this literature course was its central strength, but its easy for this quest to go too far. These questions are too serious and too big and too complicated to be casually introduced for a moment's thought. This only happened a few times, but when it did, I think it significantly decreased the quality of discussion.",
    "I absolutely loved everything about this course! All of the works we read, the films we watched, and the discussions we had were so impactful in the ways we were able to engage with really complex ideas surrounding justice and mercy. Each week, I learned so much from what we read, and from what the professors and my peers had to say about the material. I also engaged with my own thoughts about justice, mercy, and our own criminal justice system in ways that I had never done before and never thought I would have the chance to through this class. This is by far the most important class that I've taken at Yale so far, because we discuss something that affects each and every one of us, and something that is such a massive problem in our society (and has been for a long time). I've always really cared about justice and the injustices that are present in our conception of justice, but this class really showed me that issues regarding justice and mercy are ones that I deeply care about and want to engage with beyond this class and beyond the classroom in general. It really showed me that I am passionate about fighting injustices and trying to achieve justice. Every single week, I had so many thoughts and feelings about what we were reading -- many of which I couldn't fully process at the time -- and I really felt how much I cared about these issues, and I don't think I would have realized the full extent of that without this class. It showed me the importance of art in addressing society's most prominent issues. It showed me that so much more needs to be done to fix our conceptions of justice in the U.S., and it really empowered me and my peers to continue engaging with these themes and ideas in our lives beyond this class. I can genuinely say that this class impacted my life more than most classes have, and it's impacted me in a way that will change the way I engage with justice and social issues in general from this point forward. I am grateful every single day that I got the chance to take this amazing class.",
    "I enjoyed all the readings and movies, but I would have liked spending more time with each one. It would have been interesting to read texts\/watch movies in conversation with each other in class. The weekly discussion posts were helpful to frame the readings.",
    "Essentially everything about this class (teaching, syllabus, structure of class and assignments) is a strength.",
    "I think the strengths of the course was really the intriguing syllabus. There were so many different kinds of works including Shakespeare, contemporary plays, drama from around the world, films, documentaries, talks, and non-fiction books that all covered so many different aspects of justice both historically and presently. The professors were great, and we also had many incredible opportunities like going to see a play about Othello in NYC and talking to someone who had experienced the incredible healing powers of Shakespeare being taught in prison.",
    "All of the course materials were amazing, and the teaching style was very engaging. The discussions were guided but open enough that the conversation would flow very naturally.",
    "Everything about this course was strong  the works we read were so well chosen and spanned such an enormous stretch of time without feeling overwhelming. The incorporation of ancient texts, modern texts, films, documentaries, and even a field trip to see live theater made for an always-engaging class atmosphere. I never once felt bored or uninterested in the course material. Trina and Professor Manley put so much of themselves into the course, and in turn, the students reciprocated, making for discussion that felt deeply rooted in our own lives and worlds as well as the worlds of the text. It was amazing to have professors so invested in the course curriculum and their students. A lot of courses in the English department fail to confront national and global issues in the way this course did  it succeeded in using old texts to address contemporary crises. I genuinely can't think of a weakness.",
    "Strength of the course was the diversity of students in the room and the richness this added to the conversation with bringing an array of perspectives. Also the range of time period in the readings really helped make the course more interesting. \r\nWeakness of the course was sometimes because there were so many people it was difficult to hear everyone's opinions, or we would not be able to stay on one topic long enough or we would spend too much time on a point of discussion and run out of time--- but I loved that time always flew by because it meant that were engaged."

    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Take this course. Not only was I exposed to so much theater and philosophy on the themes of justice and mercy, but this course changed me. I came to understand and articulate my own beliefs and  relationship with these deep moral questions that, really, are at the root of all human interaction. On the last day of this course, we went around in a circle and shared our takeaways from the course, and almost everyone teared up.",
    "Definitely! It offers intense, unique subject matter and will most likely be full of students who are bright and engaged and really ready to do the work--it's serious enough that those who choose to take it will know what they're getting into. I'd note the strengths and weaknesses listed above, but would definitely recommend taking! If you love reading books closely, discussing them passionately, and thinking about justice as a philosophical idea and practical objective, then you'll get a lot out of this course.",
    "YES! best class at yale",
    "Absolutely, the most insightful seminar Ive been in at Yale",
    "Absolutely! This class has truly helped me become a more critical, questioning, and open thinker, person, and citizen.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course, but it is not to be taken lightly. It is a decent amount of work\/reading and the grading is a bit hard.",
    "I STRONGLY, STRONGLY recommend this course to other students! In fact, I have already raved about this class to so many of my friends and peers (both in the English department and not!). This class is a gem; the readings, the discussions, the film screenings, the weekly discussion posts all make you feel something. I have felt that basically every assignment and every reading in this class was worthwhile, compelling, and challenging (ideologically, academically, civically) for me. Moreover, the questions of this course linger with you beyond the classroom. I have often found myself thinking, urgently, about the material in my everyday life. What are the consequences of justice, and why do we incline towards a \"equal\" justice? What is productive and what is destructive about anger? How is forgiveness powerful; but also, who do we expect forgiveness from and who do we expect it for? And so many other important thoughts to wrangle with.... I loved this class so much. If other students need a writing credit\/have space in their schedule\/are looking for a literature course with thoughtfully curated material\/care at all about the world we live in and the one we want to live in... absolutely take this class.",
    "This was the single most important class Ive ever taken. \r\n\r\nIm coming away from the semester with a fundamentally different understanding of justice. I didnt think that the answers questions like what is the purpose of the justice system and what is nature of mercy would be answered in the pages of Shakespeare, but they were. This course is such a testament to the importance of the Humanities. \r\n\r\nThe course was intellectually rigorous, but also exceedingly fun! I think that everyone genuinely looked forward to class each week. Discussions felt liberating and I truly cannot think of a time when I felt more moved by readings and hearing the thoughts of others about the readings. \r\n\r\nTrina in particular made this course a wonderful experience. She is a role model in truest sense of the term. She exudes thoughtfulness, dedication, curiosity, and insight. On the last day, she said that she teaches because she wants to learn, and I cant think of anyone who better embodies this philosophy. \r\n\r\nIf this course is taught again (and my goodness what a tragedy it would be if it isnt!), I think it is critical that prison abolitionist texts be incorporated. I dont think its responsible to discuss whether punishment has a purpose if we only read texts by individuals who are institutionalists (like Bryan Stevenson). \r\n\r\nAs a whole, this TRULY could not have been a better course. Everyone of every majorespecially folks who do policy-related workshould take it.",
    "I cannot recommend this course enough to any student at Yale! I took this as the only STEM major in the room, and it was the best decision that I could have made. The environment was very accepting of people from all kinds of backgrounds, academically and personally, and I never really felt like I couldn't share my opinions or analyses because I wasn't a humanities-oriented student. This class addresses such important issues that affect every single person, and it's just so well done. The materials that we used were fantastic, the discussions were so impactful for each of us on an academic and personal level, and the topics of justice and mercy are those that are not often talked about in such depth and complexity. I left every single class wishing that it was longer so we could keep discussing with each other. I have never felt so genuinely sad about a class ending, because I don't want to stop having the space and the outlet to work through all of my thoughts and the complexities around a topic that means so much to me. I don't want to stop doing truly important work in a classroom environment. I have raved about this class to all of my friends, and I don't think I'll ever stop talking about this class as one that honestly changed my life. Everyone who can take this class absolutely should.",
    "Yes - this was different from any other class Ive taken at Yale. Youll leave feeling much closer to and more knowledgeable about the problems you talk about in class.",
    "Absolutely. This is a wonderful course for a wide range of students-- those primarily interested in literature or social science, in old texts or new ones, or even those just interested in learning about what the humanities can offer in a world that so often wants to leave them behind.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It really is such an intellectually eye-opening class. The conversations are so interesting, and so is the reading.",
    "Yes. Take this course. I really, really hope that it continues to be taught at Yale  there's nothing else like it in the English department, as far as I know, and it will change the way you read and think and relate to literature.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! Excellent way to fulfill your renaissance requirement if you're an English major and a great way to meet new students."
