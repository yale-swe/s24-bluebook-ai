    "This course showed scientific literature that backed the existence of phenomena that affect the success of people of color and women in STEM fields.",
    "I learned more about common misconceptions within the STEM community, and how to develop interventions to improve the STEM community at Yale.",
    "Diversity and inclusivity issues in STEM education, national but also focusing on Yale and problems around us.",
    "Being Human in STEM is by far the best class I have ever taken at Yale. I learned so much, not only about the struggles in STEM that underrepresented groups suffer, but about myself, and was able to make a difference in the community at Yale.",
    "I learned a lot about the social issues surrounding STEM, such as imposter syndrome, stereotype threat, and ambient belonging. We also discussed a lot about gender and racial discrepancies in STEM and how we could try to fix that. We also learned how to design our own practical interventions and how to implement them here at Yale. It was an amazing class as a STEM major who never thought of these problems in the context of my own studies."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The class content was incredible. The class is dedicated to talking about the challenges in STEM for underrepresented students. As a result, we had a lot of the important conversations that are not had in other settings. My peers in the seminar were also fantastic. All of them had such fantastic ideas and experiences that furthered our conversations. What other class can you take where four STEM professors are listening and eager to learn about the experiences of minority students? The final project (which was definitely frustrating at times) ultimately brought me really close to my group which I appreciated. It was great getting to work with other students who are also passionate about helping underrepresented thrive in STEM.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class had WAAYYYY too many assignments and was WAY too much work. I think the professors didn't want the course to be labeled as a gut (which I totally understand) but they took it too far. We had to write 3-4 separate 200 word reflections a week on 50+ pages of often dense overall reading. On top of this, we had an OpEd to write, a final project (which had two hour mandatory office hours every Monday night) and an Other Voices Presentation (we had to guide a 25 minute discussion on some topic). Honestly, I enjoyed the OpEd, Final Project (should have been less intense) and the Other Voices Presentations but found the reflections completely unnecessary, tedious and useless.There were just too many of them to put optimal effort into them. It became a weekly chore rather than a useful source of analysis.\r\nAlso, this class should optimally have at least one faculty of color. This is important to keep the discussion balanced. We had a few unfair and aggressive escalations in our discussions that could have been avoided by having this type of professor perspective.",
    "This class had mandatory office hours every week although it was not clear at the start of the semester that this was a course requirement.",
    "The seminar-style of the course and its focus on student projects were my favorite parts, but for this class to be more successful, I believe there should be at least one person of color in the handful of professors teaching this course, especially considering that we talked about the effect of race in science pretty often.",
    "Strength are robust discussion and activism aspect of the interventions. Also, professors obviously cared a lot and were engaged. Weaknesses: syllabus unclear, disorganized.",
    "This course was phenomenal. Though it was a very high workload with the outside project, it was absolutely worth it, and I will be continuing the work that I started into future semesters. It could be improved by lessening the amount of reading that was necessary each week as the project began, and starting the project process a little earlier.",
    "This class was pretty great. I really enjoyed all of the discussions every class and I really liked it when the professors and instructors would stay after class to give the students a chance to talk to them one-on-one about anything. I found the instructors to be engaged and cared about the topics we were discussing. It would have been nice to have a little more guidance at the beginning when we were designing our projects."

    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student willing to put in the work!!! It was a fantastic opportunity to have important discussions about race and gender in STEM that aren't talked about elsewhere. Your peers in the class will also be interesting, motivated and passionate STEM students who care about creating a more inclusive STEM environment. With that said, however, keep in mind that this class is a LOT of work. We had to write 3-4 separate 200 word reflections a week on 50+ pages of often dense overall reading. On top of this, we had an OpEd to write, a final project (which had two hour mandatory office hours every Monday night) and an Other Voices Presentation (we had to guide a 25 minute discussion on some topic). Honestly, I enjoyed the OpEd, Final Project (should have been less intense) and the Other Voices Presentations but found the reflections completely unnecessary, tedious and useless.There were just too many of them to put optimal effort into them.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if they added a non-white Professor in the future.",
    "Yes, but you have to care about STEM diversity and inclusivity issues! Otherwise you nor your classmates nor your profs will be happy.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to students in STEM who want to further explore their place in the community and how to make a difference - this course changed my life.",
    "I would totally recommend this course to any STEM major. It was one of my favorite classes here at Yale. You get to interact with your professors more than you would in a regular STEM class and you get to engage in topics that you're normally not used to. The course is also structured in a way that it is not too overwhelming reading-wise, with like a 10 page reading every week with a short response to it. It was a very do-able workload and I really enjoyed the discussions during class."
