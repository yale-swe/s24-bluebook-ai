                "good professor but if there could be more timely response would be better\r\ni really like the hand writting notes help me to participate and understand",
                "Strengths - lectures were very organized\r\nWeaknesses - the content in the 2nd half of the course was very boring (lecture upon lecture about MAP\/MLE, it all blended together at some point). Also we had no homework in the 2nd half and were still expected to solve challenging problems regarding the content for the final",
                "I think the course could've benefitted from more organization -- I understand that, because this is the first semester the class is being taught, it's hard to put everything together all at one and I expect that things will get smoother over time. No worry. I think it would've been helpful to have more psets -- I think pset 2 felt really manageable as far as difficulty went. I will admit that I spent over 40 hours on pset 1 for sure. As far as strengths go, I think the material was interesting\/relevant and there was clearly a lot of planning that went into deciding on the progression of topics. And as far as the slides went -- I think it would've been helpful to have some prewritten text on the later slides [the ones that were all handwritten]. What I've found to be really helpful is that some professors will put up their slides before class, annotate them in class and then later post the annotations. \r\nAs far as the exams went -- for the midterm I know it would've been really helpful to have some practice problems because I really didn't know what to expect and my grade definitely reflected that. For the final, the practice problems were definitely helpful but it would've been really nice to get solutions so we were able to check our answers\/learn from our mistakes.",
                "Strengths: lectures and lecture notes were very detailed, access to textbooks and other sources, Weaknesses: did not follow original assignments plan so grade scheme was largely up in the air until the very end of the semester (though that will likely be fixed for future semesters)",
                "I would love more of the assessment to be based on assignments and projects rather than exams because sometimes it can be hard to come up with mathematical arguments in short timeframes. Takehome exams also work better than in class exams.",
                "Strength and weakness: very math heavy course. I wish there was more programming and less math. Admittedly, I come from more of a CS background than math background. \r\n\r\nBig weakness: for some reason, out of 6 planned PSETS, only 2 were assigned. This was stressful grading-wise, but more importantly, really stunted the learning process. I learn by doing and didn't have much of an opportunity to do so in this course. \r\n\r\nStrength: good broad intro to ML.",
                "Strengths: Prof Wibisono is a great lecturer with concise yet easy-to-follow lecture slides, and the fascinating mathematical basis behind a lot of the concepts taught in class were accessible even with just an elementary background in calculus, linear algebra and probability theory. Weaknesses: since this was the first offering of the course, it was not the best-structured; we were given only two out of six planned assignments, and we did not get to review and practice a large chunk of the course material through the assignment. Furthermore, some important aspects of machine learning, e.g. the backpropagation algorithm, were not given much time in lecture.",
                "Interesting topics, but less practice related to the lectures",
                "Concepts and mathematical proofs were clearly explained. It would be great if there had been more Psets for practice.",
                "This was a very interesting course. The instructor is very nice, understanding, and clearly an expert in the field. The only 'weakness' was that (probably because it was the first time the course was offered) we only had 2 problem sets (instead of 6) all semester, so we didn't really get to dive deeper into some concepts covered in the second half of the semester.",
                "It needs more stable Problem sets, but its normal to modify schedule as it was the first offering.",
                "I audited this course, but I thought that it was very organized and well-taught. The material was relevant and relatively easy to follow and understand.",
                "Needed more psets to really sink content in. Lectures did a great job at explaining complex concepts.",
                "Strengths: this course provided a insightful view of machine learning through the framework of empirical risk minimization. The motivations behind the methods discussed were explained clearly. Weaknesses: not necessarily a weakness, but the lectures varied greatly in difficulty and notation was ambiguous at times.",
                "Great content, great teaching. I think there should have continued to be problem sets for each new topic, as the PSets just stopped entirely around halfway which encourages cramming rather than paced learning. Having psets, even short ones to reinforce the class ideas, would be great.",
                "- The course content can be more organized. I feel I didn't learn as much after the first midterm as before.\r\n- The professor focused too much on the mathematics details. It's better if we could learn more on a higher level.\r\n- More programming assignments will be helpful.",
                "This course covers a great selection of topics in machine learning. The course started off great with nice lecture slides and challenging problem sets. However, we only had 2 problem sets. The exams also were very difficult and the lack of problem sets made it difficult to prepare for them. If the assessment portion of the course can be as good as its topics, this would be a much better course. My guess is that there was some anomaly behind the lack of psets, so hopefully that doesn't happen again in the future.",
                "Our professor was very knowledgeable so I learned a lot over the course of the semester through the lectures. However, I learn best through hands-on problem solving, and since we only had two problem sets, I found that to be disappointing."

This really made the grading much more stressful, because we expected to have other psets to make up for difficult exams, although to his credit Prof. Wibisono was relatively lenient with grading at the end of the day. \r\n\r\nFOR MATH: you'll want to be comfortable with VECTOR CALCULUS to take this class. Math 120 is listed pre-req, but I stumbled through the math in this course. A solid understanding of linear is needed too - 225 sufficed for me. Stats is good to know but felt less integral, and Prof. Wibisono covered it more rather than assuming we'd know it. \r\n\r\nThe good: good broad intro to Machine Learning. The first psets, when we had them, were difficult but enjoyable, and we learned a lot. \r\n\r\nThe bad: tough exams, psets stopped getting assigned so it was hard to stay up-to-date with material, and very math heavy.",

                "No. The lectures were OK, but the real issue with the class was the professor and TA's lack of communication. At the end of the semester, nobody had any idea what the grading distribution was going to be like, because we had 2 psets instead of 6. With no information on curving, I felt like my grade was basically a random number generator. On the bright side, we only had to do 2 PSETS (though I thought the ones we did were pretty interesting).",

If you are interested in CS+Math or S&DS, this is an excellent class to improve + tie together your understanding of different ML models and the theory of building predictive models for different types of problems through optimization techniques. If you are more into CS or S&DS and less math, I would still recommend shopping at minimum - the math isnt too bad if you have taken anything proof-based before (e.g. 202), and the content is absolutely essential for having a legit understanding of a lot of the components of ML and optimization.",
