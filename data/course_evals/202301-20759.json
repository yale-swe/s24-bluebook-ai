                "This was probably one of the most organized design classes I've taken at Yale. I learned a lot from the core three projects (web zine, public installation, and website for one). Each project was unique and had you think through who your audience is, and details in interaction design. I also liked how in terms of class critique, there was a mix of both verbal feedback and also silent feedback (google forms) for less outspoken students.",
                "Strengths: The assignments provide a good scaffolding, building on each other. They also prompt students to think critically about the web and how it can be used in non-traditional ways. The structure of the class and the use of a class site was helpful in staying organized and meeting goals. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Too many students in the class. Class is design-oriented and somewhat crit-based, but many students come into the class without a basis for understanding how to critique visual workpossibly a short intro to critique could help shape future discussions."

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to students who want to develop coding and digital design skills and learn more about the internet. Previous coding experience was not a requirement. I do think some experience with web design or visual design is helpful."
