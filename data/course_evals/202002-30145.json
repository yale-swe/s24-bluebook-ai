    "History of jazz in the lens of race and gender.",

    "Understanding of different styles of jazz, and how race has played a role in the development of the music and in the popularity of different styles. Also about gender and the way sexism and homophobia functioned in the world of jazz. Also insights into how jazz relates to different musical forms today, like rap and hip hop.",
    "I gained a more thorough understanding of the history of Jazz music, particularly as it relates to issues of race, economics, gender, and social norms.",
    "I developed a good understanding of the history of jazz and the evolution of jazz styles over time.",
    "Through this course I am able to distinguish jazz movements and their societal impacts."

   "comments": [
    "Strength: grades come in a very timely manner, professor is accessible, and the course material is very interesting\r\nWeakness: some assignments seemed a bit more tedious than enriching",
    "The course was well structured to facilitate learning, quizzes and essays were framed to drive home the most important concepts in the readings and class lectures. Professor Duffy did an amazing job of making the course content both interesting and easy to follow for students with little music background. I felt that some of the readings were outdated within the current context of discussion of race and gender in America. These could be reviewed and updated.",
    "The papers and out of class assignments were really linked with the material we learned in class, and helped me better understand. It was great to get to listen to different examples of each style in class (even though we were virtual). It's not a class really about the actual technical aspects of the music though, which was great for me because I know how to read music but I really don't have a good ear for listening. It was more about the history and social factors, which I thought was a huge strength, because it made it accessible. During the year when he teaches to grad students, Prof Duffy said he teaches much more of the theory and technical stuff. One weakness I guess would be that sometimes I got confused on the styles and how to differentiate between them because there was so much information that needed to be fit into each class (with only 10 courses in the summer).",
    "The grading system needs some revisions to accurately reflect the work and time each assignment requires. The total number of points available in the course was 111.2 points, meaning every wrong answer on a multiple choice question brought down my cumulative grade's average by a whole percentage point. This coupled with some of the discrepancies in not \"nailing\" the precise answer and very few opportunities for partial credit in open ended responses hurt my grade much faster than I feel is appropriate. The grading reduced my motivation as it felt as though the work I was putting into the class was not reflected in my final grade.",
    "Like all courses, it would be better if it was taught in person. Barring that, the high intensity of the condensed format of the summer could have been at least partially offset by more varied lecture structures. There was a large emphasis on conventional lecturing, and less discussion and student-led instruction than I would have liked from a humanities class.",
    "The course effectively addressed the issues of race and gender in the world of jazz.",
    "Online instruction was great and engaging. The order in which we discussed the movements was helpful in creating a mental image of its impact on America."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely! This course is especially relevant with the current issues of BLM and racism, and it is super interesting to learn these issues and their precursors through the evolution of jazz.",
    "Yes, amazing course for STEM majors who are interested in music or jazz and looking for a non-stem credit.",
    "Yes!!! But only if you are seriously interested in the history of the music because otherwise you probably would find it long and boring. But when you are interested in the subject matter (social factors, race, gender, jazz, etc) it is fascinating, even if you don't know much about music, or vice versa (you know a lot about jazz from a musical perspective but not about the social aspects of int).",
    "Sure, If you like jazz or would like to like jazz, but don't necessarily have a large musical background.",
    "This is a great course for anyone interested in the history of jazz and African American culture.",
    "This course was very engaging, connected history to the music, and included themes seen in today's media."
