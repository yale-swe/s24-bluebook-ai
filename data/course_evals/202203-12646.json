                "I learned how to do Python oriented programming (POOP). I was also very bad at python programming in general, and significantly improved my coding abilities. I had rusty understanding of linear algebra and barely understand controls because Linear Systems at Yale does not allow you to actually learn the material we were memorizing, this class made me confident in understanding linear algebra expressions in scientific papers and I actually understand the things I've been insecure about for years. I also learned I hate tuning parameters and that robotics can be a pain.",

                "At times too much theoretical content, but there was enough time to go over it all, very helpful to go over the code and understand how to implement the theory.",
                "Strengths: Ian. Great professor and incredibly, incredibly intelligent. He wrote a chapter of a textbook for the class each week. However, there were sometimes errors, and while this seems to all come easily to him, it was hard to spot the errors as a beginner so sometimes these texts lead me astray. I'm sure this won't be as much of an issue as he refines the course in the future.",
                "Strengths - a broad range of topics covered\r\nWeaknesses - math was too fast, I got lost halfway through the course. No TA's so had to reach out to Professor Abraham even for coding issues.",
                "Strength is Ian's background and passion for the subject. He always has a lot to say and gets very excited. The drawback is that Ian always has a lot to say and gets excited about everything, which leads him to talk even faster when answering questions. It was difficult to absorb a lot of the material at such a high speed of engagement. I strongly believe this is a class that should be recorded. So students could really struggle to understand what Ian is explaining and ask questions in person but can go back to really write down everything he says.",
                "The course material is very difficult. Many of the students were having a hard time following along. A suggestion would be to introduce a math concept, along with why we should care about it. Then show an implementation of that in code. It is better to actually code that in class, rather than show a completed code. This will help students get a better understanding of how to work on their own. \r\n\r\nI also think that there should be some part of the class where we use a physical robot. Only doing simulations made some of the assignments feel like they lacked purpose.",
                "Very well-taught with plenty of flexibility and a plethora of interesting related topics and applications",
                "It is a bit hard for beginners with no robotics background."

                "Excellent course for those interested in robotics",
                "Yes. You code and visually simulate a lot of cool stuff. I'll use the coding practices and material I learned in this course more than any other class I've taken yet.",
                "Not really, I think you need a really strong level of mathematical pre-requisites to understand and follow the course (e.g. analysis, 300+ level courses) or it will be at most going through the motions to run some Python library for homework. I felt like the concepts covered are very important (having seen them in action in industry/applications) but failed to actually understand much through the class. Even online videos aren't of much help because Professor Abraham does not follow any particular textbook and has changed some notations significantly from what you can find elsewhere. That said the graduate students seem to be doing well, maybe having another intro kinematics/robotics class would help.",
                "Yes, its one of the more difficult classes at Yale, especially for those who are not CS or math focused, but it is extremely rewarding. The manner the subject is presented to you and the topics cover really paint a clear picture of the current state of the art in robotics. I thought the class was just going to be mathy for the first 2 classes, but the math never stopped, it kept getting worse but you grow numb to how scary it is and really learn a lot. It breaks you down in the beginning to really build you up as a strong engineer.",
                "I would not. The course is very theoretical. It contains difficult mathematics, and we only simulate the robots. Some usage of physical robots would make the course much better.",
                "Yes, especially if you are at all interested in robotics and robotic control this is a super in-depth and intriguing course.",
                "Not really if you are not a MENG major or does not have a background in robotics. But if you are good at math and physics and wants a challenge, you can probably still understand the material pretty well."
