                "It will be hard for future courses to rival this one in terms of both the breadth and depth of content introduced. The supplied readings and accompanying discussions gave me the ability to discuss relevant and intriguing social issues (ranging from abortion rights to sexuality) in Chinese, something I'd never been able to do previously. In so doing, this course also helped me reassess my worldview by introducing perspectives absent from my education in English, giving me new insight into the opportunities that can be gained from being a language learner. In terms of skills, this course also challenged my speaking, listening, reading, and writing capabilities on a daily basis, although I wish the latter two had been focused on a bit more (specifically with regard to reading more primary sources and writing with more formal argumentation).",

                "Strengths: the content was very well selected and fun, the teaching was great, and the workload was just right to encourage learning and challenge through a variety of tasks without being too heavy.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not too many opportunities to converse in class or to speak spontaneously (presentations were very scripted), so this didn't allow for enough practice speaking naturally.",
                "One of the major strengths of this course was its content. As discussed in 1. above, the supplied readings forced me to grapple with complex topics previously inaccessible to me in Chinese, encouraging deeper understanding and fostering greater maturity in my usage of the target language. I also thoroughly enjoyed the format of the in-person class meetings - the ability to have open, immersive discussion challenged my listening and speaking skills in a unique way.\r\n\r\nI feel like the biggest weakness of this course was its unbalanced workload. Having to constantly prepare oral reports and skits put a strain on my sleep schedule and reduced the amount of time I had to prepare for other assignments - I feel like other forms of assessment are more time-effective for both the teachers and students involved. In particular, it would have been nice to substitute a few of the presentational projects for, say, argumentative essays, which would have aided students in developing their formal self-expression without a) detracting from discussion time and b) introducing overhead in terms of coordinating times to practice.",
                "Great readings and movies. Class size is just right for good discussion.",
                "Strengths: some very interesting topics. More manageable workload than 150\/151.\r\nWeaknesses: Repetitive.",
                "One strength of this course was the many opportunities we had to discuss complex topics using newly learned vocabulary. I learned a lot of Chinese and information about Chinese history and society. I think it could have been helpful to have a bit more drilling of new structures during class time.",
                "It is a very well balanced course. There are no major areas that need improvement, the teaching was excellent.",
                "The class is very discussion based. Students are given lots of room to try out new vocabulary and voice their opinions about readings. However, the class does move quite quickly, and it can be hard to fully internalize all of the discussed content.",
