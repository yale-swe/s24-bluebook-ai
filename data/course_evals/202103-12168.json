                "I learned the fundamentals of Chinese through speaking, writing, and reading. I also developed the ability to apply these skills to dialogues with peers, written projects, and exams.",
                "It is a super tough class with a lot of workload, but you really learn a lot by the end of the semester. I can freely talk about several topics in Chinese now, which is incredibly rewarding.",

                "The strengths definitely include the teacher Professor Shen who was engaging and kept the class focused and productive each day. One weakness may be the way grades are conveyed as it was unclear for example how dictation factors in. Also, I would prefer if homework was ungraded as having it graded made it more stressful and less open to practice.",
                "I absolutely loved how organized this course was. We were given a schedule for each week with a clear outline of our assignments and Professor Shen was very willing to answer any questions over email. I also loved how each day's homework was broken into various small parts which allowed us to cover a lot of material while keeping the work interesting.",
                "This class is very organized and with a small class size, was a great environment for language learning. There are no negatives I would note at this time.",
                "The course is so well-organized. It is probably the most organized course at Yale. You have a clear idea of how to do well in class and you clearly know what your homework for the next class is. Absolutely loved it",
                "This class was incredibly stressful to me because of the rapid pace at which it moved, and the workload was the most intense of any Yale course I've taken so far. I felt that the course was difficult to balance with the other courses in my schedule and that the grading was needlessly harsh for true Chinese beginners. That said, the small class sizes did mean that individual participation was at a high priority."

                "I absolutely would! Especially if you can have Professor Shen this class teaches you the basics of Chinese, just be prepared to work harder than other classes- this was probably my hardest course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. After just one semester, I already feel that I have learned a good amount of Chinese and I loved how the course facilitated consistent practice and conversations. One of my favorite aspects was the weekly session with the TA in which I could practice my speaking and particularly my pronunciation and tones.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Our class had a mix of experiences as certain students had studied Chinese before studying the language at Yale, and some others had never studied Chinese. Despite these differences, everyone was able to develop the necessary language skills. Though the workload was at times a lot, the teachers made the work enjoyable and I never felt what I was studying was unnecessary.",
                "Yes! If you are not afraid of putting 2-3 hours every day into Chinese (this is only homework), then definitely take the course. You will learn a lot!"
