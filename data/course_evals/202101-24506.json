                "Strengths: James Barnes. Fluid, intelligent, flexible, witty. He makes learning fun, especially in a topic like math. The most understanding professor Ive had all semester, who also recognizes our common humanity as we struggle through a period of pain and grief.\r\n\r\nThe grading system. Other math classes at Yale need to follow suit of the incredible and innovative work Professor Barnes is spearheading. He has curated a system that rewards and encourages learning, without penalizing students for taking time to learn and not doing well and high  stress environments. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Re-mastery sometimes comes late, meeting we have to retain how to do some of the more specific logistical things a month or so after. Having more readily available, and regular re-quizzes might help with this",
                "The grading system is quite frustrating. Your mastery in a certain subject is only determined by two questions that barely cover the entirety of the topic.",
                "I LOVE THE MASTERY-BASED SYSTEM. I learn better in math when its more low-stakes and this grading was the best in regards to learning.",
                "Strengths is the understanding and the personality of the professor, James Barnes, for me. Also love the mastery based system as it gives you multiple chances to learn the material and show that you actually are learning. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I would have liked problems on the PSETs to have been similar to what we go over in class. It was very frustrating to not feel adequately prepared for the PSETs from lecture. Especially when it came to word problems (not talking about rate questions).",
                "Strengths: PROFESSOR JAMES!! He was absolutely incredible, made himself available via office hours or email. The patience of the professor really made everyone feel comfortable participating in class. I also appreciated the mastery-based grading and format of the class. It was very effective in knowing what we understood and what we needed extra help with.\r\nWeaknesses: Canvas quizzes did not allow for partial credit and the timing was difficult.",
                "A strength was that the professor offered office hours every day and was so willing to try to adjust to our schedules to help us. He was also really clear in what he wanted to do well in the class. In addition, he really cares about his students and cares about whether were doing ok which was so sweet. He also makes sure to listen to our questions.",
                "This course really helps you learn the material needed for further education",
                "I think it would've been helpful to receive direct comments on quizzes on what we did wrong and go over more pset/quiz level questions during class."

                "I hated the preclass videos. They were so short (like 2-4 minutes) and James is just too smart for me lol. Honestly it's like listening to a Mathematician talking to fellow mathematicians. Very hard to follow his explanations no matter how slow I made the videos lol. I would have preferred longer videos with more examples and explanations vs the short vids that seemed to be geared toward people who just like already ...get it. Especially for an online course.",

                "Absolutely. If you were on the fence about taking a math course at Yale, this is the math class you need to start with. Such an incredible instructor, such and incredible class structure. You will not regret taking this class, even if youve taken calculus in high school. Its a great refresher and more than that, it reinforces foundations and makes you more prepared for math 115.",

                "Yes, if for your requirements.",

Honestly I won't be taking Calc 2, though I did well in the class and James made himself readily available at all times, I pretty much got myself through this class with youtube and clutch prep. I needed to find someone who didn't assume I knew small concepts not mentioned in solving the bigger concept and could dumb down their explanations of concepts -- to barney style it, as i'm just not that quick on this. So I would say if you're not strong at math, just know that you'll probably find yourself in office hours almost everyday or on youtube. But I guess that's like most classes anyways.",
                "Yes, and try to get a section with James Barnes. He is absolutely STELLAR! If you have to take calculus for your major or for pre-med, James makes it enjoyable for sure.",
