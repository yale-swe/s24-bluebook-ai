                "Strengths: facilitation",
                "Similar to the other DS course evaluations I did!",
                "Strengths: I think the balance of having one lecture / week providing an overarching framework or avenue for understanding the text and two discussion sections, where the students have time to interact more closely with the material and discuss what interested and puzzled them with their peers, works extremely well. \r\n\r\nTo me, the most helpful and interesting lectures were those who both managed to touch upon a large part of the reading material (and thus helping the student grasp the key concepts/ideas that they have encountered with such rapidity) and provide a distinct reading of the text that brings in material and biography from outside the assigned reading to enhance the student's understanding of it. One example of such a lecture was the lecture on Arendt. \r\n\r\nI believe this was the first year that Douglass' 4th of July-speech was a part of the DS syllabus, but to me it worked extremely well. Douglass' distinct understanding of history connected him to other thinkers on the syllabus, and the speech-format related it back to Pericles' funeral oration in the first semester. Most importantly, it served an important complement to nuance the Tocqueville-reading of the U.S (similar to reading Marx after Mill!).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the final exam in H&P is unnecessary hard, when compared to the ones in the literature and philosophy tracks respectively. The passage Id's are very short, which makes them more difficult to identify than the passages in literature, while the clear questions that replaces the passage id's in philosophy give the student a more fair chance of displaying as much of their relevant knowledge as possible. Having to write two essays instead of one in the remaining 1,5 hours just leads me to produce two mediocre essays rather than a longer, really good one, which I have energy to do in literature and philosophy.",
                "Its strengths are the great professor, engaged peers, and depth and intensity of its focus on a limited topic (the texts). Although I understand it's the nature of the course, I would've loved more time to digest each text, since they began to blur together after a while."

                "Yes, definitely. Prof. Thompson created a rigorous, challenging, and rewarding experience.",
                "Yes if youre interested in Western political thought.",
                "Absolutely! It provides a fascinating and diverse, yet impressively coherent introduction to political thought since Machiavelli. The readings are well-selected, thought-provoking and all contribute to increasing the students' understanding of political thought. You are provided with an amazing opportunity to discuss some of the central questions within political thought together with intelligent, passionate peers and knowledgable, inspiring faculty members.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Thompson is fantastic, and the peers are supportive and instructive themselves. I feel more confident in my own reading and writing abilities. Most importantly, I learned a ton about these fascinating and foundational texts."
