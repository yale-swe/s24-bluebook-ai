                "Very strong course, great teacher",

                "clear and interesting topics, theoretical and mathematical, but no code as a CS course",
                "The materials are interesting although I'm not sure they are all that useful except in some fields of CS (e.g. compilers). The first 90% of the lectures are very well organized and well delivered. There is clear logical flow from topic to topic and the ideas presented are very enlightening. However, towards the end, the lectures on turing machines become very confusing because the professor wasn't very good at explaining the reduction proofs. Overall though the class is very good and not heavy workload-wise.",
                "Strengths is the material is clear and the professor is very good, could be improved by more practiced examples",
                "This course was excellently done, and I would not change a single thing.",
                "The material is surprisingly interesting and Professor Bridy does a great job of explaining concepts and making them accessible. The problem sets are straightforward and really help you understand the material better. I found the Turing machine/decidability unit to be a little repetitive and I think it could maybe be shortened, but that's the only suggestion I have.",
                "Great course organization and very clear explanation of content during lecture. I only used my lecture notes to prepare for exams and didn't need to reference outside material. Overall I felt that I learned a lot from this class without it being very stressful, which feels rare for a CS class.",
                "The material is pretty interesting and the course is well-paced.",
                "Prof is the best explainer of all time. Every time he explained something I understood it immediately.",
                "could probably include more discussion of why we study automata and how it relates to foundations of computer science, beyond just saying turing machines = computers",
                "Professor Bridy was very deliberate in the way he explained many of the difficult concepts in the class. He limited the scope of the material where needed and although the homeworks were mostly proofs, they were of reasonable difficulty.",
                "Strengths: teaching. He explains everything clearly and gives examples to make abstract ideas more tangible. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Being able to drop two entire homeworks is probably too lenient of a policy when only 8 were due for a grade.",
                "It's interesting content not really covered in other CS courses at Yale. Bridy is really good at explaining things. I can't think of any obvious way to improve it.",
                "Very interesting proofs and class engagement. Professor Bridy stresses the use of examples which is very helpful for understanding the topic.",
                "Good background on the common machine models for computation. Rather practically focused which, in my opinion, is not as helpful given the unlikelihood of ever needing to perform procedures by hand. Homework was quite easy and not very proof-based which did not provide opportunities for intellectual challenge.",
                "I think it's very organized.",
                "It is a great theoretical course. It was fun playing with the various concepts related to automata, although I doubt those concepts themselves are useful for me outside of this course."

Even if not, Professor Bridy does a great job of explaining the material and making it accessible. The weekly problem sets are straightforward, and while there are proofs, they are nowhere near as rigorous as a formal proof class.",

                "Yes! Great elective that would be a requirement at many other schools. However, the course content probably isn't super applicable if you'll go straight into software engineering. Towards the end the class became somewhat proof-heavy, though nothing too bad.",
                "Yes if interested in theory.",
                "yeah it is nice to take a break from coding and take a trip to abstract land.",
                "yes, this is a pretty easy and interesting enough computer science elective. It's definitely helpful to have a good proof-writing background, but you actually don't need much if any math at all and honestly don't need that much of a coding background either. It was very chill -- open note take home exams, weekly psets that didn't take too long and were sometimes cancelled. Prof. Bridy is pretty accommodating.",
                "Yes, this is a great CS elective to take. The options are limited when it comes to CS electives that are both well-taught and a reasonable amount of work.  Especially if you enjoy the more theoretical side of computer science, this is a great course.",
                "A great chill elective if you want to further develop your understanding of the theory of computation. Perhaps it could have moved more quickly and had harder problems.",
                "Yes, it's content that isn't really covered in detail by any other CS classes at Yale. Bridy is really nice and a great explainer. I took Compilers before taking this class, and it's nice to now understand more of the theory that we used in Compilers. Having taken algos, it would also be a nice warm-up to CS proofs. You really don't need any prereqs for it as long as you have written proofs before. Great class overall, and not a ton of work.",
                "Yes, Professor Bridy is very knowledgeable of the field and explains things very well.",
                "Only recommend this class for people who like to do proofs. Otherwise its going to be very hard and dense",
                "Yes.",
                "Absolutely, mostly because of Bridy. I don't think the subject comes up very frequently outside of the academic sphere directly related to it.",
                "Yes if you want to learn some theory knowledge.",
                "yes\r\nthe instructor made clear points on everything",
                "Yes. It is a really fun course for those who like math proofs. It does not require much background knowledge and does not involve programming, which could be a good thing if you are taking other programming-heavy course."
