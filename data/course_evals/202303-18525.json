                "In the class, I was able to learn more about the intersections between urban planning and the informal sector. Besides that, I was able to hone in on what informality was in the case of theory but in practice, too. It taught me ways to be more of a multidisciplinary thinker, too!",
                "I gained substantial insights regarding the importance of the informal economy in the U.S. and abroad. I learned so much about the innerworkings of marginalized communities such as mine. Additionally, I learned about the informal economy from people who are doing the work firsthand which made a substantial difference in what I learned. The topics we covered were widespread, such as sex work, street vendors, and informal housing, yet I learned deeply about each topic.",
                "I developed graphic design skills for my final group project, which was a digital zine. I also learned about a completely new topic  the informal economy  through theory, documentaries, and in-person speakers.",
                "I learned about a plethora of issues affecting urban areas domestically and internationally.",
                "I developed my understanding of the informal economy and how to study/analyze studies of informal activity in our society. I found this course extremely engaging and enlightening on the topic and enjoyed how we were asked to delve deeper into a more specific issue we connected with for the semester."

            "comments": [
                "It's mostly strengths! I liked the organization of the class, with weekly discussions led by students, and the readings were really interesting. I think the readings are unfortunately difficult to get around to for many students because of how long they often are, but i don't think the reading should be cut back, it just comes with the territory.",
                "The strength of the course is that everyone is allowed to become an expert, meaning a lot of learning from others. The other aspect I thoroughly enjoyed was the presentations given, being able to do a lot of different types of activities! Also, the final project being self-exploratory was really nice! For improvement, the only aspect is having more guest speakers, since those were some of the most memorable parts of the class!",
                "A substantial strength to the course were the weekly \"co-facilitations,\" which were weekly presentations by students. Each week, different students presented on the readings and facilitated an activity of their choosing. This implementation was especially helpful for my learning and diversified the way we engaged with the class. \r\n\r\nA weakness was that sometimes, the classes were on zoom. Although I understanding, given the commitments of Professor Hidalgo, I wish that classes would be held in person whenever possible.",
                "Strengths: Flexibility in the topic/deliverable product for the final project, the breadth of information covered (e.g readings on different kinds of informality: from street vendors to housing justice advocates to sex workers), the opportunity to facilitate classroom discussions, and the support from professor Hidalgo in crafting a final project. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: In person-classes were not structured well/didn't require much valuable participation (sometimes it felt like students would bring up an interesting point but it wasn't explicitly connected to the course material or they didn't explain the connection well and professor Hidalgo would not intervene thus the conversation fell flat), lack of breaks during in-person class (a two hour class needs a break or else students won't focus well for the latter half), and lack of feedback on discussion posts (only in the first few classes did professor Hidalgo pick out a few posts and talk about them). \r\n\r\nImprovements: Implementing a break in the class, crafting a more structured agenda for each class AND sharing it with the class, verbally or visually keeping track of time (this is a way that structure can be communicated to students and in my opinion consistency makes students look forward to class because they know what to expect), *providing more feedback on discussion posts (commenting under one post each week and providing feedback/grades on discussion posts halfway through the semester). \r\n\r\n*In addition, the discussion post format could be altered. We suggested this while giving in-person feedback but to reiterate: you could split the students into two groups, Group A and Group B. Both groups are expected to do the readings but only one group does a reading response (meaning that each student in that group posts a reading response) and the other group responds to the first group's post (meaning that each student in that group posts a response to another post). Each week the groups would alternate. This way the discussion posts would facilitate a conversation between students.",

                "While the readings and materials of this course were intellectually stimulating, I would strongly advise against taking this course if the professor teaching it is Anna. Her style of teaching, or rather lack thereof, makes going to class pointless other than being present to get your attendance/participation points.",
                "Yes absolutely!",
                "Of course! Professor Hidalgo was amazing, and you get to learn from each other on a topic that is often swept under the rug in many academic settings. Besides that, the course is also great for self-learning but also teaching others.",
                "If you are interested in the informal economy, even in a non-academic manner, I would 100% recommend you take this course! As a student not well versed in the economy, Professor Hidalgo was a great instructor in ensuring that we had the background we needed to understand the content. This course spanned many sectors of the informal economy and even locations, as it covered worldwide informality. Therefore, there is a variety of things you can gain from this class.",
                "If the changes above are implemented then I would recommend this course to another student. I think the course readings were super interesting and well-chosen to cover a variety of perspectives on the informal economy. The main weaknesses of the course are structural, so as long as the changes are implemented then I would recommend the course.",
                "I would recommend the course to any student who wishes to expand their knowledge of global urban inequity in a small classroom setting; it was extremely insightful to learn from Prof. Hildago. We also had lots of guest speakers who had first hand experience in our subject areas of discussion; this treatment was especially crucial for approaching questions of inequity.",
                "I already have recommended this course to anyone who will listen. I absolutely loved this course and feel that anyone who is interested in the informal economy should absolutely take it."
