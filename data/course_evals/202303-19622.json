                "The classroom environment was always incredibly fun. At times, it felt that the class moved too quickly, but that was to be expected with any language course. I am overall incredibly excited by the amount of Korean I was able to learn in a semester",
                "Lee-seonsaengnim is the strength of this course.  She is so patient and moves at the speed of class.  She quickly gives feedback (returns homeworks and quizzes) so the pace of learning is not hindered.   She cares greatly for students learning Korean and for students' well-being in general. I think a two day notice before quizzes would be helpful for future iterations of the class just so people have more time to study and internalize the vocabulary.  Besides that, I'm glad there were no tests and just speaking projects because I think it's more practical for language usage.   I genuinely think Lee-seonsaengnim is geniunely one of the best teachers I've had at Yale and this was one my favorite classes of the semester!",
                "Strengths: THE PROFESSOR. SHE IS SUCH AN ANGEL. Always made sure to answer any questions and help out if anyone is struggling. The content was also never too unmanageable. \r\nWeaknesses: Nothing really.",
                "The course was easy to follow and at a pace that everyone could follow. The availability of a teaching fellow was also very helpful."

                "I would say no just to gatekeep it, but yes, it is a great course and if you can, take it with Professor Lee-Smith.",
                "Yes!! Highly recommend! The course is not only fun and engaging to learn, but also a great place to make new friends and form a fun community. The course is a good balance of challenging/educational and fun/lower-stress.",
