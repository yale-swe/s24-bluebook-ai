                "Yes --- having a generally understanding of modern philosophy is helpful. Frankly, though, spring philosophy was my least favorite of the six DS classes. The readings are very challenging (particularly Kant and Fichte). Very hard to enjoy the course and get a lot out of it without a great professor who will explain the complicated arguments. In other DS courses (like literature, and even fall philosophy), the texts speak for themselves. That being said, with a good professor (or a lot of independent work outside of class), spring philosophy can be very rewarding. Mastering Kant's argument for transcendental idealism is as exciting as it is essential.",
