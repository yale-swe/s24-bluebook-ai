I really appreciated that we read stories in the French language from around the world, and felt very proud of myself after finishing two full French novels by the end of the semester. I made friends in the class and enjoyed coming to class each morning."

    "In the future, I'd suggest that quizzes be announced with a bit more prior notice, and that we practice listening and speaking skills more in class time and in homework to prepare for tests."
