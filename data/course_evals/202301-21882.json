Not too abstract, but not too down-to-earth!\r\nWeaknesses: For the problem sets, it was sometimes very difficult to understand what the instructor was asking for. Perhaps this is due to my lack of exposure to common knowledge\/assumptions in the field, but I would have found the psets more didactic with some more context.",
                "I think a strength was the lectures on past climates and on ENSO, AMOC, and NAO. But a very prominent weakness for me was the large amount of redundancy in information from other courses like GFD, PWC, and PO. It would have been really nice if those were pre requisites such that we could have dived into newer topics in more depth as opposed to reviewing material from other classes."
