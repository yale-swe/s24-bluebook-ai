The anything-goes, quick-on-your-feet nature of this class shut off the anxious part of my mind that feels the need to prepare for everything. I learned how to stop relying on myself and to collaborate healthily with classmates. Finally, I learned to stop judging and start doing."

                "Some of the readings we had offered very valuable insights about creativity and how effective creative processes work. Some conversations and exercises also offered meaningful perspectives on the philosophy of storytelling. However, a lot of the work was busywork and at times the class seemed caught between wanting our class to be a break from school and wanting to be taken seriously as a college course. Additionally, we  essentially interacted with almost no actual pieces of theater the whole semester and a lot of the messages we were supposed to internalize were intended for writing and not specific or even very relevant to theater-making as a distinct form of creation.",
                "Strengths:\r\n - Assessments: I found the group projects and essays incredibly fun and manageable, as well as fairly graded.\r\n - Class environment: Prof. Brooks always emphasized that this class should bring joy to his students; while we should treat it with seriousness, we shouldn't stress about assignment deadlines. The class welcomed students who have no theater background, creating a safe space for students to just be themselves.\r\n - Class format: Though 2 hours, the class goes by incredibly quickly, with a nice balance between time on the stage, as an audience member, as well as group discussion on past readings and reflections on exercises.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n - The class spent more time discussing the theory of collaboration, and less time actually practicing itthe only opportunities being group projects and small class assignments.\r\n - We did less theater than I expected. I would enjoy an improv game every class."

            "comments": [
                "Yes! If you are new to performing or used to it, it is a great way to practice performing whilst also learning how to develop theater collaboratively. Even if you are not interested in theater, you gain skills and knowledge on collaboration and creativity which will be useful throughout your life.",
                "No, probably not. Youll find that youve collaboratively created a ten-minute script by  the end of the semester, but Im not sure its worth taking the class.",
                "I highly recommend this course for students with no theater backgroundit eases you into the theater environment with healthy amounts of anxiety and embarrassment. Particularly, this class benefits writers, creators feeling a mind block, team members who want to improve on their collaborative abilities, or people who struggle to find or feel like their true authentic selves at Yale."
