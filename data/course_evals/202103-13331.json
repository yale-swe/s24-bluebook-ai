                "Improved a lot with reading and interpreting primary sources. Improved writing a lot. Also learned to think about the history we were being taught in a more macro context and really extending understanding beyond just the facts. Looked at much of the class through focusing on the complexity of human motivation.",
                "I learned about British history and how the British empire came to be. Very cool! \r\nI also learned how to closely read primary readings, evaluate the arguments of secondary readings, and write argumentative essays.",
                "I developed a better understanding of early British history, and it gave me a different perspective on the colonial era",

                "Loved the course. Not a history major and was my favorite course of the semester. Lectures were interesting as were the readings. Got a lot out of section as well. Only way I would recommend improving it is to add more text to the slides and more factual background readings to understand the lecture material. Class didn't have a formal textbook and I think that actually would've been useful here.",
                "Strengths: Professor Winston is an absolute G: super nice, super knowledgeable, very good lecturer. The first half the course is structured chronologically which was very helpful in helping me keep track of what was going on, the second half of the course was organized thematically, which was helpful in seeing the larger picture. Overall, a really well organized, well taught, awesome class!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I can't think of any!",
                "Strengths: the information is generally interesting and it offers more context for things usually taught from an American history perspective because it approaches it from a European perspective\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures are often hard to follow, and there are no notes on the slides, just pictures, so you have to determine what is important as you go along. The readings for the section discussions are very obscure, and sometimes it's hard to see how they relate to the overall themes of the course.",
                "I think the lectures were very engaging as well as section, it might have been helpful if the lecture slides had slightly more details, for example, captions for images, which would make it easier to study",
                "I found the lectures to be both interesting and insightful. While I had been exposed to this time period before, this course added dimensions to Britain's colonial era that I had not previously been aware of.",
                "This course is mostly quite strong, especially with it being Winston Hill's first lecture. Hill shines when he is lecturing on broad, social, material, and geopolitical developments, but he also brings a nice focus on personalities and especially on particular institutions. His syllabus and readings were exceptionally well organized, as were his lectures. There was however an identitarian excursus in which the recent scholarly works assigned were of very poor quality. I suppose such stuff is par for the course these days, but there is a way to address the topics of slavery and Native American dispossession without relying on the incoherent scholarship produced by contemporary academia. Overall, though, Hill's lectures on these topicsin contrast to the readingswere mostly measured and coherent."

                "Definitely. Very interesting course and Professor Hill was a very good lecturer. After taking this course I plan to take more history classes at Yale despite not being in the major.",
                "100%. Much of the world we live in today originated from the stuff that happened in the British empire, so I think it's really cool and important to see how it all happened. It's one of the better taught history courses and it's interesting.",
                "If you really want a grounding in British history and a better understanding of colonial history from a non-American perspective, this is a good course to take. But be warned that Prof. Hill's lectures are really difficult to follow much of the time, and the powerpoints don't have any notes on them so you need to be good at judging important information as you go along.",
                "Very good class, fun section as far as sections go.",
                "Yes, it was a fun course, and the structure of class from timeline history, to cultural, back to timeline was well done",
                "Yes, I would, if colonial history is of interest to them. With a course like this one, if you are not interested in the material it can become very difficult at times.",
                "Yes. Whether you are looking for a good overview of British colonial North America or are looking to satisfy the American area requirement within the History major, look no further."
