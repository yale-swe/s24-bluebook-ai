                "I gained a deeper understanding of astronomy and the search for extraterrestrial life.",
                "This class covers too many topics to list, but some topics included star/planet formation, planet habitability, the origins of life, and exoplanet detection. The course pushes you to evaluate topics you have limited information on, and you end up realizing that you know more than you think you do.",
                "An overview of space, what we've accomplished so far, and so much more",
                "I learned how various topics in astronomy were applied to the search for extraterrestrial life.",
                "How to contextualize Earth's position in space and our human position in time. Such a lovely class! A lot of the earlier content in the course was about the processes by which the universe formed and foundational background knowledge on space--proof of the Big Bang, core accretion model for planetary formation, star types, how to measure distance using Cepheid variable stars, etc. Then, the second half of the course began to cover topics like dating the origin of life and how climate change affects the lifetime of civilizations. The semester paper made me realize just how much I had learned!! One of Professor Fischer's sayings in response to us saying that we felt unqualified to estimate eta-Earth, for example, was that the people making large-scale NASA funding decisions in government probably knew less than we did. She never failed to inspire me every class, and I'm always going to think of her optimism and firm belief that life must be somewhere else there in the universe--we just have to develop the tools and methods to identify it. When I first came into this course, I wasn't sure if extraterrestrial life existed anywhere in the universe. When I was writing my semester final paper, I felt so confident that there must be extraterrestrial life within our galaxy. And I had the numbers to back it up!!",
                "I gained an understanding of the role of humans within the context of the broader universe, as well as an appreciation for the current literature, progress made in the field of the search for extraterrestrial life, and my role as a citizen scientist in the world. Although the question of \"do aliens exist?\" cannot be precisely answered, the course provided the skills and knowledge necessary to deduce that extraterrestrial life has a high likelihood of existing. Additionally, the course provided the opportunity to learn substantial knowledge of astronomy and the process of scientific reasoning, which are invaluable skills not only within the realm of astronomy. Everything from an understanding of SETI to the scientific intuition to be applied to everyday life make this course a must-take!",
                "This course provided me a detailed understanding of our place in the universe. It's not very often that we think about what lies beyond Earth, and this class not only helps build the proper reasoning tools to think about what is out there but also teaches you about the universe overall, from formation to today.",
                "Astronomy, order of magnitude thinking, drake equation, etc.",
                "I gained a whole new perspective on the prospect of life elsewhere in the universe, I and gained knowledge on the process of science in general (and how to write scientific papers!)",
                "I gained a basic but broad overview of the field of astronomy and SETI more specifically. I can now hold an informed conversation about planet formation, the progress of the SETI project so far, and climate change. I also developed some skills in scientific writing, with which I was entirely unfamiliar before this course.",
                "I learned about SETI, basic biochemistry, basic astrophysics, exoplanet detection techniques, solutions to solve climate change, how to read/understand research papers, and how to write scientific pieces.",
                "This course covers a wide spectrum of topics related to the search for extraterrestrial life, including planet formation, the search for exoplanets, the chemistry of life, the Drake equation, etc. One important skill I acquired during this course is thinking scientifically, which involves modeling with uncertainty, order of magnitude thinking, etc.",
                "As a non-STEM person, I feel like this course provided a great overview of major topics in astrophysics and helped me to improve my scientific writing skills."

                "The strengths were that the class was really organized and Professor Fischer really spent time focussing in on the important topics that help us think about the search for extraterrestrial life. It was not a high-stress class and all the lecture videos and content were really manageable, especially for a non-stem major like me! The only weakness I can think of is that I wish we spent more time on the specific missions for the search for ET life rather than on the mathematical calculations.",
                "I think the interdisciplinary approach to the course was a strength, I feel like I've gained competency in a lot of different areas. The format of the course was a little weird, it wasn't really a seminar but it also wasn't a lecture or a lecture+seminar, it honestly felt most like a discussion section.",
                "Strengths: Great professor, engaging classes, reasonable workload. Really makes you think.",
                "Dr. Fischer is by far the biggest strength of this course. She is one of the best professors I have had at Yale.",
                "Strengths: Professor Fischer. She's one-of-a-kind. I've never met someone so humble and accomplished who has never failed to speak her mind--and thank goodness she did! I also think her flexibility and willingness to accommodate people's remote learning statuses were super considerate. The weekly assignments (Sunday discussion questions, homeworks, quizzes, and blogs) sometimes felt overwhelming but when I came out of the course, I seriously felt that they all played non-negotiable roles in my learning. The discussion questions for motivating me to finish the week's pre-lectures earlier, homeworks to practice concepts in lecture, quizzes to know critical astronomical background info, and blogs to synthesize my own learning with that of the rest of the scientific community.\r\nWeaknesses: the pre-recorded lectures got hard to keep up with roughly 2/3 into the semester, especially when all the content for the week was longer than 1hr. I think the professor was aware of this because the viewership of lectures declined sharply. She made every effort to keep us engaged though and I recall that she would sometimes summarize important concepts and give us relevant breakout room worksheets to make the lecture content useful. Really, this more of a systematic weakness of online learning that anything of Professor Fischer's fault.",
                "Strengths: The content of the course was extremely engaging, and we delved into a variety of topics within the fields of astronomy and the search for extraterrestrial life. The writing assignments and homeworks lended us an opportunity to apply our learning, while also challenging our own perspectives. Breakout rooms enabled us to work with other students and engage with one another, which was especially beneficial during virtual learning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel as though a larger portion of the content could have been focused on SETI, as there was a disproportionate focus on very specific scientific knowledge. Although understanding basic astronomy concepts was necessary, it sometimes felt as though we were expected to retain substantial amounts of technical knowledge that was difficult to grasp from a singular pre-recorded lecture (especially in quizzes). In the future, I would hope that the course not only focuses on quantitative and scientific reasoning, but perhaps more so on theory, ideas in the scientific literature, etc. For example, the Drake equation was only introduced very late in the course, and an entire week was spent on climate change models, which is certainly important but used up two whole classes that could've focused on SETI.",
                "Strengths: fascinating content, wonderful professor\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the amount of reading and number of videos could get a bit heavy! Although it was always manageable",
                "Strengths: Prof. Fischer is a fantastic teacher and was really committed to this class. The subject matter will fascinate science nerds and other curious minds alike, and she has been directly involved in all of it. This class will change the way you think not just about our scientific endeavors and place in the Universe, but also the role of humanity more broadly.\r\nWeaknesses: The course tried to teach too many things at once - basic astronomy, basic biochemistry, the theories of the formation of life, climate change, in addition to diving deep into Kahneman's book \"Thinking Fast and Slow\" as a guide to scientific thinking - which became rather chaotic. The workload was also somewhat uneven throughout the semester: there was a huge crush of work towards the middle of the semester, followed by a lull and a relatively short period to construct a semester paper. At times, it seemed as if Prof. Fischer was constructing the course as she went along, but I'm confident this will get better in future iterations of this course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Fischer, the super interesting topic, the small class size, the choose-your-own writing approach, and pretty much everything else about the course!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Absolutely none.",
                "This is a great course. I particularly enjoy the wide range of topics this course covers, not just focusing solely on the search for ET life. The readings and videos assigned each week are very enriching. The group work activity in each class is also helpful for facilitating learning.",
                "Strengths: Prof Fischer really cares about her students and her unique experience with SETI makes the discussions very engaging. Also, the semester paper was a great final assignment!\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the lectures were very content-heavy (especially in terms of numbers and formulas)."

I don't know if Prof Fischer will be teaching this course in its next rendition, but it's cool to take a class with such an accomplished person.",

                "Yes!! Even if you aren't particularly interested in extraterrestrial life, I highly recommend this work. I think this is one of those courses that anyone at Yale should take if they get the chance--it's hard not to love the professor and the way it expands your understanding of space and time. To get the most out of it, I recommend taking notes during pre-lectures, even if it takes you longer to watch lectures that way. i found that I retained information much better that way. Also, start your blog posts early! You kind of blow your own mind with the claims you make and support with data as you begin writing, and it's such an incredible feeling every time.",
                "Absolutely! I had no idea what to expect when I enrolled in a course on aliens, but this ended up being a fundamentally life-changing course. The content was utterly fascinating, and we delved into a range of topics from exoplanet detection to the Drake equation to the viability of extraterrestrial, intelligent life forms. The workload is not exceedingly rigorous, and there is plenty of flexibility within the course. Professor Fischer is tremendously accomplished in her own right, and it was a true privilege to attend seminars and office hours where we could learn from her decades of experience and research; not all professors have discovered exoplanets. It's a shame that this course is only reserved to a select few first-years in the seminar lotteryeveryone should try to take this course!",

                "Yes, absolutely! It's a rather easy Sc/Wr credit and it is also super interesting. I particularly like how the prof added the discussion of climate change at the end to evaluate the possible duration of a technological civilization.",
                "I definitely would!! The course content was fascinating and the professor was great! She was clearly an expert in her field (and had all sorts of interesting facts and anecdotes to share), and she was incredibly kind, understanding, and approachable. Also, the grading was not super stressful, because there were a bunch of small assignments spread throughout the semester, rather than a few large tests. Take one of Prof. Fischer's classes, you won't regret it!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who has even a remote interest in space, aliens, or thinking about our role and position in the Universe. You absolutely do not need to be a science nerd or have any background knowledge to do well in this course, and are all but guaranteed to have your mind blown repeatedly.",
