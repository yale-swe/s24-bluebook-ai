                "I learned a lot about epic European literature in a way that I was never taught before. I also was able to read many influential classics that are important to western society like the Aeneid and Odyssey, while considering more modern, experimental works inspired by those epics like Dictee by Theresa Hak Kyung Cha and Zong! by M. NourbeSe Philip.",
                "By taking this course, I learned not just about the inner workings of some incredible texts but also how they relate to one another as members of the epic tradition. Speaking of this tradition, I learned about all the different ways of defining it and how its meaning has shifted over time and adapted to modern concerns.",

                "The ability to understand and interpret epic poetry across various generations.",
                "I learned about epics and the epic tradition and how to write essays.",
                "I learned to close read texts with more attention to detail. I also improved as a reader and a storyteller myself as we read through and discussed epic literature, eventually culminating in a try at writing my own epic."

            "comments": [
                "There was a great amount of reading to be done in this course which I feel stifled its impact in some ways. Due to this large value of reading, it was impossible to read closely and give the appropriate amount of attention to each work. With that being said, though, now that this course is finished, I am glad that I read all the novels that we did.",
                "This course tackles a large number of great texts in a short period of time. I think this constitutes both a strength and a weakness because although you're getting a lot of exposure to these texts, the pace is so fast that you only really scratch the surface. I think that's perfectly fine, though, if you go into the course with the understanding that it's not just about the individual books but also how they fit into a wider tradition. Establishing what that tradition is requires you to read a lot of books, not just a few in depth. Another strength I'd like to note is the wide variety of adaptations we looked at, including pieces of art and films. I think this enhanced my learning and allowed me to engage with the epic tradition in a whole new way.",
                "A strength of this course is that it is incredibly interesting and engaging because of the amount of discussion we do on each book. A weakness is that because there is so much to discuss on each book, we sometimes are a little behind track during class.",
                "Strengths: Class Consistency, Discussion Based, Ability to Lead Discussions \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: NA",
                "Strengths : material covered\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lack of guidance with regards to essays.",
                "This course, while I did enjoy it, had too many materials in it for the pace at which we went. We skipped big swaths of books and some of the discussions fell flat because we were not getting the full context."

                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in the subject matter and willing to put aside time to complete a large amount of reading. I chose this course because I wanted to read the books that so largely influenced the western canon, and wanted to get more than just a baseline understanding of them, and I definitely got that from this course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is looking to gain exposure to great texts. I feel like my repertoire was seriously lacking in some of the classics, and now I feel much more confident in approaching these texts. The only thing I'd note is that this course requires a lot of reading, so be prepared for that. I think at most points during the semester, however, the workload was more reasonable than I was expecting it to be, so don't let that fact hold you back from taking the course.",
                "Yes! I loved this class and the readings that we did. The discussions were interesting and I looked forward to each class.",
                "Yes! Prof. Ellermann does a fantastic job at introducing and breaking down complex texts and poems. You can definitely tell he is passionate about what hes teaching and genuinely wants you to learn! He offers very detailed feedback on all submitted work and gives you a chance to grow throughout the semester.",
                "Yes the books were super interesting",
                "I would recommend this course if the person likes reading and discussion of readings."
