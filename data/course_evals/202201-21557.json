                "This class, as a continuation of the Japanese language sequence, helped me deepen my skills in all areas: comprehension, listening, writing, etc. Specifically, this term more complex grammar was introduced. We covered a variety of topics: appearances and assumptions, adverbial forms, verb nominalization, cooking, positive and negative commands, skill level, personal opinion of verbs, potential forms (can do X, etc), \"When I do\/did Y~\" statements and the like.",
                "My Japanese improved! I still feel really insecure about my speaking and listening abilities, but my writing and reading improved a lot! We learned lots of new grammar, vocab, and kanji.",
                "I believe I can talk simple Japanese in daily conversations and can understand some portion of Japanese movies, songs and news without translation.\r\nTopics covered during class include weather, hobby, location, homestay, cooking, festival, present, movie, plan after graduation, Japanese culture, places that i want to go...etc.",
                "In JAPN 120, I significantly improved my ability to make daily conversations in Japanese, learned many new grammar structures and vocabulary. We were also introduced to some Japanese cultural customs and practiced some of them, such as writing a New Year's Greeting Card. The class also allows me to write relatively more complex passages to describe a place, talk about daily routines and future plans, and tell what I like and don't like.",
                "I continued to improve my Japanese skills from L1, while developing new grammar structures and vocabulary for more advanced level expressions.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths are in the work intensity. One has to keep up the work to understand class instruction, homework, and exams, as is likely similar in other language courses. Personally, and this may be because of virtual classes and other issues, but I found pacing to be a weakness. I would have appreciated a little more L1 review sprinkled in at the onset, and it felt as if some lessons dragged while others were done a bit too quickly because our class had fallen behind schedule.",
                "Strengths: Daily homework keeps the knowledge fresh in your mind and makes you practice\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would be great if we could get grades\/feedback on assignments more quickly",
                "Strength: \r\nMany topics about Japanese culture during class. (e.g. the white valentine, the new year's card, the Japanese concept of time, the small talk about weather,  the beginning of spring) They were very interesting.\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\nI want more feedbacks on the homework worksheets, especially those open questions.\r\nThe reading part in the exam and the questions in homework worksheets were usually covered in textbook. I would like some outside materials for further exercises.",
                "Strength: Lots of opportunities to practice conversation in class. Difficult grammar points will be repeated to enhance student retention. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Students were not given a detailed syllabus that lays out lesson plans for each week, so we did not know what to expect or how to prepare for class accordingly. Timely feedback was also lacking throughout the semester. By the time of writing this evaluation, I still have not received feedback or grade for my first conversation test done in early March. The grade for homework assignments done in the last 1\/3 of the semester has also not been given. Moreover, many homework assignments (especially grammar worksheets) and lesson tests were direct copy of textbook materials which we already practiced in class. While drilling is definitely important for language learning, I feel that recycling the same materials for three or four times is not conducive to student learning, for we were not given exposure to materials outside the textbook.",
                "The scheduling and pacing for the course was kind of all over the place, which led to quite a few misconceptions about certain topics. If everything was a bit more organized, the course definitely could have ran smoother.",
                "I really liked the short writing prompts as well as the focus on conversation with echo questions and leaving out unnecessary information.",
                "The class is atmosphere is not friendly enough to foster a good learning environment."

                "Yes. Learning Japanese is really interesting. Step by step, I can feel that i progressed a lot throughout this year's learning.\r\nThis course created many chances both in-class and out-class to practice a new language. It is well-designed. The kanji tests, lesson tests, oral exams, worksheets, video recordings, clinics and LAKUGO club can all help a lot.",
                "While the course design of JAPN 120 in general is very helpful in students' mastery of the Japanese language to another level, I would not recommend taking this class with Nakamura sensei. Although I have felt a substantial improvement in my Japanese level, I felt that I have not received much opportunity for improvement or practice had I been place to another section. I took JAPN 110 with another instructor last semester, and I could feel a significant drop in the level of student engagement and enthusiasm in Nakumura's section vs. my previous section. The class operates on a \"cold-call\" basis, where Nakamura sensei would call on students to answer questions, rather than based on a voluntary raise of hands. While this method supposedly can ensure participation for everyone, she does not call on every one for the same frequency and there were signs of favoritism. She has also created an atmosphere where students are scared of making mistakes, for they would be stared and \"boo-ed\" at. Nakamura sensei would immediately jump to the next student whenever she heard a wrong answer, and thus students would not have the chance to reflect on their mistakes and improve from them. \r\nFor myself and several other students I have talked to, we dreaded going to class, and were incredibly scared of participating in class. Understandably, Nakamura sensei was facing some health issues this semester that may have impacted her teaching, but I wish there was more communication between the instructor and the students, which could have made the learning process much more pleasant and productive.",
                "If you want to continue with Japanese, I say go for it. However, just be mindful about the pacing and assignments that you will have to keep track of in this particular section.",
                "Yes, I have thoroughly enjoyed the Japanese program at Yale for the past two semesters. I really appreciate the teaching style as well as the other people in the class who make it a very enjoyable class to have everyday",
                "No. The teacher doesnt care about students."
