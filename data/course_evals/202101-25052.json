                "Strengths: Dr. Goff has an incredible lecture presence, appropriately comedic, thoughtful, and compassionate when addressing the subject matter. A lot of thought clearly went into the construction of the class. The 2 big assignments of this course, the midterm and final, are challenging, but really allow you to bring in the cumulative knowledge of the semester and grow through the work.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes sections could meander a bit, and keeping up with the readings (especially during the period before the final is due) can be a real challenge. Similarly, the midterm spills into the final, which can be tough to keep up with--both require a lot of deep thinking!",
                "The weekly discussion board posts were a bit laborious at times, and the paper assignments were a little strange. However, these also seemed to be helpful in my digestion of the material.",
                "Strengths: Professor Goff, well-paced readings, important and interesting content.\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Goff has so much knowledge to share, and too little time to share it! I left most lectures wondering how the time went by so fast, especially over zoom.",
                "The readings and lectures were very interesting and engaging.",
                "strengths: Professor Goff is an incredible lecturer and so passionate; manageable workload; interesting topic and readings\r\nweaknesses: none",
                "Strengths- very organized, good TA, good instructor, good content, allows for individualized exploration of topic since you can take the 2 papers in whatever direction you'd like, Dr. Goff makes the lessons v relevant to ongoing current events etc (obviously this is expected with the relevance of the content covered but i appreciate the intentionality). \r\nWeaknesses- It would have been nice if the assessments for this class weren't 2 very strictly academic formatted assignments. It could be cool to have some sort of creative choice/ project-based assessment (with potential collaboration) like other AFAM and ER&M courses",
                "PROF GOFF AND our TA daniella are amazing, phenomenal people. prof goff is 100% a strength in this class. he genuinely cares so much about students and can be like hey yall this is a tough time and i get that and it doesn't feel fake. his teaching is engaging, and it's so obvious that this is something he cares deeply about and that his words are backed by action. the weakness of the course is perhaps not a weakness but moreso that THAT MIDTERM PAPER AND FINAL PAPER HIT DIFFERENT. you do the readings that are pretty long but eventually figure out how to do them more efficiently or skim and read what's important but then THE PAPERS. you spend weeks writing and researching and rewriting and realizing prof goff wants something different and then APA CITATIONS ARE HELL. if you want the learning without the pain, credit D it. but also talk to your TA, start early, and do it (but also for students of color, writing about racism can be traumatic and painful. doing research for my final paper i did break down crying multiple times, so be aware of how certain topics might impact your mental health)",

                "Strengths: Professor Goff! Hes engaging, incredibly knowledgeable, and just amazing. My TF was very understanding and approachable as well. We learned so much in that class, but it always felt interesting. The papers felt incredibly rewarding to finish.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Goff is super knowledgable and a compelling lecturer, and the readings were a good length and variety to engage me without being punishing. \r\nWeaknesses: Did not feel actually that rigorous an analysis of racism from any angle other than psychology/social science, which could make it feel hard to focus on systems and legacies of power, though Dr. Goff made a concerted effort to mention these factors. Also did not feel particularly supported by teachers.",
                "The discussion sections were amazing with the diverse amount of insight from all of the participants.",
                "Strengths: GREAT lectures and GREAT professor; content was very interesting and discussion section was always engaging; readings were manageable and interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were sometimes fast-paced (the professor addressed this problem towards the end of the semester after receiving feedback); I sometimes felt lost in the material i.e. lectures were at times confusing; I felt like at times I left the lecture with more questions than answers (although this may be the nature of this class)",
                "This course was amazing. I learned that we cannot just call everything we see racist. Racism is such a strong word and the definition that we use to define it must encapsulate the elements of history and power. This course taught me that there isn't just one definition of racism. Take this course and educate yourself. Professor Goff is amazing.",
                "Strength - professor \r\nWeakness - still dont know what racism is.",
                "The course had an amazing professor and a very interesting and important subject matter. It could be improved by having more structured section.",
                "Professor Goff is a great lecturer and the point of the course -- to help us develop our own definitions of racism based on others' and to use that insight to identify what is/isn't racist -- is in itself a strength. I found myself devoting extra time to the work for this class because I genuinely cared. One thing I wished we had more of was feedback. It is always difficult to get constant feedback in a (Zoom) lecture-format class, but getting more direct feedback would have been greatly appreciated. Often times, feedback could have been vague due to the nature of the course and TAs having to read several papers and proposals; however, I wish I could have gotten comments more specific to my interests throughout the course.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Goff was very engaging during lecture and I learned so much from him. I always enjoyed lectures with him. I also think sections were very helpful and fun times for learning. Weaknesses: Though I enjoyed reading the theory for this class, it felt very hand-hold-y. I think this course was geared more towards white people than anyone else--which is fine, but I just wish that had been made clear at the start. I've taken plenty of other ER&M classes that go into way more depth than this class. If you've taken a few ER&M classes, a lot of the readings will be familiar.",
                "this course was very strong. it was organized perfectly to support student understanding of all assignments and deadlines & etc. were very considerate being that we are in a pandemic and many students were off-campus. the course was also well organized in terms of academic structure. it was very inclusive as well. i felt very welcome in the class even when talking about sensitive subjects.",
                "I like how interdisciplinary the course is, however, I wonder if having some sort of equal experience in statistics or some race theories can make the discussions we had in seminars better",
                "Honestly, I cannot think of any weaknesses. The lectures were incredible and felt like mini Ted talks each time. Dr. Goff opens each one playing music and did an amazing job encouraging student participation, which fostered a sense of community in the class even though it was a lecture. The TFs were brilliant and so helpful in deciphering and further discussing lecture material in section. I also really appreciated that Dr. Goff always held space during class for what was happening in the news and how  it both related to the class and affected students' wellbeing.",
                "Strengths: the course does very well in laying out why it is important to define stakes and have a definition. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course is laid out so that the first half of the semester covers theory while the second covers more methods of measuring it analysis of racism. I wish more time was spent discussing the theory as it was harder to grasp. I also wished I received more feedback.",
                "A strength of this course is the discussion sections as they allowed us to discuss the readings in a smaller group format.",
                "This class was really great by far the best class I've taken this year. The strengths of the course can, in large part, be attributed to Dr. Goff. He is incredibly passionate about the course material, and that really comes through clearly in an inspiring and interesting way. The lectures were engaging and interesting, and the readings were well and obviously carefully chosen. This is the first class at Yale for which I have actually read everything assigned, both because it was a reasonable amount and because they were all truly interesting and added something to the course.",
                "Strengths:  The content was great and I felt like I was genuinely learning something new every week. Prof. Goff is a phenomenal lecturer and really cares about students and our struggles.  He and the TFs were very accommodating during this difficult semester.  They were very helpful in preparing for the midterm and final papers: they offered plenty of advice and opportunity during lecture and section to discuss and develop ideas. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses & Improvements: Going over the weekly summaries took up a lot of time during section.  If we got the summaries with the TF addendums the morning of section, were able to review it beforehand, and just jump into discussion questions that would have been great.  Sometimes the readings were a lot during the week leading up to papers being due.  If we had no readings or shorter readings those weeks, that would be great.  Otherwise, pretty good.",
                "The class was very engaging, and the course material was relevant and interesting. Near the beginning of the semester, we went through some of the topics quicker than I would've liked. It was also difficult to get in touch with the professor due to his busy schedule.",
                "I really wish I could retake this class in person, but the lectures were amazing nonetheless. I think I learned more from this class than I learned from any other class at yale so far and enjoyed the learning along the way.",

In terms of classes that will actually develop and deepen your understanding of the world around you, challenge you, and improve you as a person, this is it. Regardless of major or intended field of study, this is a class that matters.",
                "Absolutely. This class (or a class like it) should be a requirement.",
                "Absolutely! A must take, I think. Challenging work that matters.",
                "Yes. As a graduating senior, this is, without a doubt, the best course I have taken at Yale. Professor Goff is the best lecturer I have ever seen. The whole team put so much work into every detail.",
                "Yes! 10000%",

                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is willing to be challenged with the assignments. Both the midterm and final paper required students to think very critically. This is not a gut or a 5th credit type of class.",
                "if you don't have the time, make the time and take this course. it's not easy, but also the main bulk of work is those papers. the class created nuanced conversations and questions that oftentimes showed the grey areas in different topics while also being sensitive about how race can be a challenging topic  . and if anything was hurtful for students, prof goff genuinely cares about that and takes feedback and makes efforts to make it the best possible experience for students. i actually wanted to go to lectures which during zoom university is saying something",
                "YES 100% YES",
                "YES. This course is absolutely incredible. I learned so much. I engaged with difficult material in an insightful and meaningful way.",
                "This was not a life-changing course, but if you are passionate about the topic then you will enjoy it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class!!",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in Dr. Goff's work and approach, or if you are a psych/socsci student who is interested in applying your methodologies to racial issues. It's a bit far-ranging but strongly connected by certain methodological approaches and themes. Certain parts of the course were a bit uninteresting to me as an ER&M major who has engaged with race regularly in college classes, but could be a helpful introduction for people who don't have as much experience and want to learn more",
                "Yes because racism has become a more important topic in today's world and the realizations that you come across are so mind boggling and interesting. Overall amazing course and topic to learn about.",
                "YES!! This class is useful and necessary for people of all majors, especially since racism is so embedded in our systems and structures. This class will help you put into words the definition of racism, which will then help you recognize how prevalent it is in society. This class was SO informative and engaging. The professor is also extremely knowledgeable and will push you to your limit (in a good way!). He will force you to ask yourself important questions and truly reflect on the material. This class teaches you important skills that are not just applicable to the topic of racism; it will teach you that you need to form a definition of the problem and your solution will be dependent on your definition. Overall, this was a truly rewarding class.",
                "yeah it's a good intro to a broad topic",
                "Definitely! There was a lot of information presented that was useful, relevant, and insightful that would help those who knew it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to a student. The workload is not too much (2 critical questions per week, 2 essays) but you learn so much from Professor Goff in the lectures.",
                "Yes--especially in the current political climate that exists, we should all be educating ourselves about diagnosing and dealing with racism.",
                "Absolutely. A must for any Yalie.",
                "Absolutely, Professor Goff was fantastic and every lecture was super engaging. The assignments were definitely challenging but worthwhile. With only two papers and weekly reading responses, the workload is not bad.",
                "yes!!!",
                "I would if you have absolutely no experience in talking about racism and if you need a theoretical basis to ground yourself. Otherwise, I don't think you're missing much.",
                "I would reccommend this course to every student. As a black student, I feel that this course was one of the most real, most equitable, fair, honest, and inclusive classes on racism that I have ever taken.",
                "Definitely! Every lecture we learned so much about the social world around us and we were equipped with the tools and language to explain our frustrations in the world.",
                "Absolutely, you should take this course. This was one of the best classes Ive ever taken. Take it for the lectures - concise but full of so much fascinating and incredibly relevant material. Take it for the content so that you can spend a semester learning and tailoring the arguments youve always wanted to make about where racism arises and the evidence to back claims up. Take it for Dr. Goff, who is one of the best lecturers out there - sarcastic, funny, and inspirational. He really cares about how students are doing and wants to help them succeed in the class papers and also in life.",
                "I would only recommend this class to students who will be engaged in this course and actually take time to think/discuss about lecture and reading materials. This is especially true for the two big papers in the class. You learn the most by doing those two papers.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This was my favorite course this semester because I found the lectures and readings very interesting and the discussions were engaging.",

                "YES! this course is incredible and so is Prof. Goff",
                "YES YES YES! I highly recommend this class because the topic is very important and the way it is explored is great: the readings are fascinating, and section discussions are lively.  It is a very organized class and there is never a dull moment.  It is one of the best courses I've taken so far and I think everyone should take it during their time at Yale.",
                "Yes absolutely!",
                "If you're ready to seriously engage with your readings, coursework, and lecture, then yeah, go for it. One of the classes that actually challenges you. It is very TA dependent though. Sometimes the grading is arbitrary, and there is no transparency. It's a tough course, I won't lie. This class seems more than just an intro course, so don't let the low number fool you.",
                "If you are anywhere to the left of Pete Buttigieg, then the intellectual challenge of this class is basically nonexistent. I noticed that some people had a harder time wrapping their heads around systemic racism than others, and that's okay! If that classification doesn't apply to you, then the onus of learning has to be on you on what you want to get out of this class. Luckily, most if not all of the TAs are helpful about that and will help you get where you need to be. I personally had a good time in the class, even if the main lecture was less than stimulating.",
                "Yes, the class was engaging and the TF was super supportive.",
                "I would recommend the class, because I think that everything I learned can be applied to my life going forward, no matter the subject I choose to major in.",
                "Yes, the class is very informative and the conversations that developed in discussion section were very interesting. This course covers important issues and definitions, so I would definitely recommend",
                "Absolutely take this course! Prof Goff is amazing and you will learn so much.",
