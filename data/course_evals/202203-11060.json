            "comments": [
                "Strengths - You get to do research for credit.\r\nWeaknesses - In my opinion, compared to previous semesters of research for credit, the extraneous workshops/worksheets were hindering and not helpful. I did not gain any knowledge from completing those assignments. I would rather have the course completely focused on the research and students can decide to opt-in/opt-out of any of added workshops.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Schilling is such an angelsuper supportive and encouraging. She truly just wants you to do your best! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Could be better organized and structured; would help to have more resources/examples (scientific writing has some type of prose to it which can be daunting to someone who has never learned how to write like that); would also be helpful to maybe have a few (optional) workshops to learn how to caption or label figures, how to write a good abstract, structuring a research paper, etc.); I think it would also be super cool to pair students up with each other to practice our oral presentations (kind of like how we did the peer review)",
                "The strength of this course is in the research itself. I did not get much out of the things we had to do for the class, including the peer review and final report, but I understand that the latter is important for showing that you completed research.",
                "The strength of the course was that it was designed in a way that ensured students could focus the most of their time and energy on conducting experiments in their research labs. The assignments for the course were structured in a way that were not overwhelming, and the directions and expectations were clearly communicated for each assignment, and enough in advance of the deadlines that students knew what was expected of them. The directions and rubrics within the actual assignments on Canvas alleviated the stress that students sometimes experience when the directions about important assignments are not communicated clearly.\r\nOne of the weaknesses of the course was that the assignments due at the end of the semester were worth 95% of the grade and were both due on the same day. Although it is valuable to have both the group seminar presentation and the research report due at the very end of the semester, because it ensures that students have collected all of their experimental data at that point, I think one way this could be improved is by having parts of the research report due earlier in the semester. These don't have to necessarily decrease the percentage that the final research report is allotted, but could be helpful in decreasing the workload at the end of the semester. For example, having a portion of the introduction and the abstract completed by midterm could be an idea to improve this aspect of the course.",
                "The course was a great way to get first-hand experience with scientific writing and conducting a real-world research project. \r\n\r\nMany important course updates were only available through Slack instead of canvas announcements. This made it hard to keep track of what was said, since we had to scroll through all of the previous announcements in slack looking for a specific message, and conversations between students and Dr. Schilling added filler to what we had to scroll through. Labelled canvas announcements or updates to the assignment description would have worked much better. \r\n\r\nIn addition, it was not clear if we would receive feedback on our peer-review draft before submitting our final draft. From slack, it seemed that we would get some feedback from Dr. Schilling, but my partner and I never saw any.",
                "Sometimes I feel that the workload of this course detracts from the amount of time you spend actually doing research. However, if you don't have a research for pay setup or otherwise, it gives you good structure.",
                "I think the course is well-designed to facilitate student's engagement with research throughout the school year. It provides structure which helps with balancing research with other coursework and develops science communication skills.",
                "Strengths - The freedom to choose which hours to spend in the lab was very convenient and made the whole experience possible to be as constructive as it was. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the peer review portion of the course was a little bit confusing in terms of instructions.",
                "Strengths: flexibility to develop research skills, lots of guidance from instructor, clear feedback",
                "Strengths  Dr. Schilling is such a wonderful person and such a supportive instructor. She struck a great balance between formal, organised avenues of support and letting us spend most of the semester focused on actual research work"

                "Yes if you are an MB&B student and love research!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. There are two aspects to this course which are critical, and both of which advance purposes that support each other. One part of the course is the commitment to work at least hours a week in a research lab, which makes sure students are allowing enough time in the lab to make progress on their projects, and working on a hypothesis-driven project teaches students important skills that are both significant in their times as MB&B majors, as well as in their studies beyond Yale, whether it be in graduate school or medical school. The course portion of research for credit helps students improve writing and communication skills in the sciences, which are two skills not taught in many other science classes, particularly in the lecture-based courses.",
                "Yes, it is a good experience in the long run. However, I would caution them against it if they have a busy schedule since this class is extremely stressful towards the end.",
                "Personally, I would have preferred to do research on my own timeline. Some of the benchmark the class requires from you felt rushed, and I sometimes felt like I was putting more energy into writing things up for the class rather than doing actual research. I wish my experience was less focused on assignments for the class. If you are considering this as the 5th or 5.5th credit, I would make sure your other classes are not time-consuming. If they are, I would choose an easier option for the 5th credit.",
                "Definitely! I think it's best if you already have research experience and have been working in the lab for a bit, because it's not really designed for the work you do when you've just started working in a lab. Not saying that someone new to a lab couldn't take the course but it might be a little more difficult. Otherwise, I think this course is the perfect balance of letting students work in lab with little interference from the course while providing some structure, oversight, and guidance when relevant and helpful. And Professor Schilling is amazing, your academic life will be better with her a part of it.",
                "Yes, it's a great opportunity to do more independent research!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are very invested in doing research and have the ability to spend 10 or more hours a week on research. It is a very involved class and you get out what you put in. Not just meeting deadlines, but working on things so that you have ample time before deadlines to contact the resources available for valuable advice.",
                "Yes! Great way to be heavily involved in research and become more independent as a scientist while earning academic credit.",
                "Yes, if you need to fulfill a lab requirement or are just an MB&B major interested in research"
