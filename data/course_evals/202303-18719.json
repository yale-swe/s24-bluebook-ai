                "From this course, students gained an up-close perspective on how 20th-century choreography, namely those works created for the New York City Ballet Company (NYCB), are created, preserved, and performed. Through this survey, we not only had first-hand experience with learning the choreography but also learned to critically analyze the broader implications of creating works in American culture. Professor Ulbricht provided multiple visual and written works for us to examine and discuss and featured weekly workshops and discussions with current members of the industry from various roles, such as current NYCB dancers, artistic directors, and administrators, and opportunities to see the historic works discussed in class through a class visit to watch the New York City Ballet. Professor Ulbricht's holistic approach to this class not only offered the opportunity to discuss archival, documented, and written commentary and primary source materials but to physically step inside the pieces, showing the class what the works of Balanchine, Robbins, Tharp, and so on feel like in action. This class highlights the practice, technique, and artistry of ballet alongside the necessary analytical skills utilized to situate this cultural art across social, political, and economic landscapes.",
                "In taking this course, I have a newfound appreciation for ballet and eye for choreographic nuances. This class taught me so much about the history of ballet, and how it is changing in the modern world. Beyond that, I definitely think my ballet technique and ability to pick up and retain choreography improved. I learned, through the assignments, how to write about dance and analyze choreography. The critical thinking skills were unlike those I've used in any other class.",
                "I learned valuable information about the dance industry and what it means to commit oneself to a nonacademic, high-intensity career.",
                "I learned a great deal about choreography and modern ballet style. Amazing class",
                "I learned SO much about choreography, dance history, and the world of professional ballet. I really enjoyed writing the midterm, final paper, and every weekly discussion post. We studied the work of George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, Twyla Tharp and several other fantastic contemporary choreographers. It was a life changing experience to not only write and read about these figures, but then get to dance their pieces in the company of the dance world's most famous leaders and performers! I still cannot believe that Yale offers this class and that Daniel teaches it; it feels too good to be true.",
                "Learned more about the history of the New York City Ballet and some of the works created by its early choreographers. Also turned to the present, looking at diversity in the ballet world and new chroeographers. As someone who has taken ballet courses but hasn't dived into the art form's history, I was watching\/learning about these ballets for the first time.",
                "I learned a lot about the history and continuity of ballet throughout this course. My perspective of what ballet is has grown deeply because of this course.",
                "I learned about a history of American ballet, particularly within New York City Ballet, choreographers George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins, contemporary choreographers like Justin Peck, Christopher Wheeldon, and Alexei Ratmansky. We were also taught sections of ballets we studied in class to see how the movements feel and explored body alignment through barre exercises. I learned so much about ballet and its history, choreographic styles, movement vocabulary, and the ballet industry as a whole.",
                "Developed barre and center skills; explored the repertory of George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and others; learned the backstory behind pieces studies in class and the approaches of the founding figures of American Ballet; explored topics of ballet programming, diversity, teaching, relevance of the artwork in the modern world."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course are its ability to bring ballet into the mainstream and reinforce its relevance to the current state of dance education and art as a global medium. It provided a safe and welcoming environment where students could challenge the status quo of ballets historical standing and the ways in which the art form and its education have improved to include more perspectives. The classroom acted as an innovators workshop to address ballets shortcomings in areas such as sexism, ageism, elitism, and racism, raising the question of how the art serves the collective while remaining elite. It also fostered the conversation of ballets malleability and adaptability to move with current media trends and present economic disparities while maintaining its foundation as an exclusive discipline inside contemporary culture. As the class is titled Ballet Now, it involves more than staged productions and into social media, streaming, and video archives. \r\n\r\nA weakness of this course is that it is only a bite-sized class for a full curriculum of scholarshipits too short. I hope to see this course expanded into a year-long 2-semester course that can delve deeper into the contributions of choreographers and dancers beyond the Balanchine canon. 15 weeks is just enough to scratch the surface, but 30 would provide the time necessary to cover these topics more seriously as history.",
                "I loved how engaging and hands-on this class was. We studied ballet in America by reading about, watching, and dancing these works. The class was fun, but it really opened up new windows for me to see ballet through. Getting to go to New York to see the New York City Ballet in action was just terrific.",
                "None",
                "This course is perfect!",
                "Everything about the class was fantastic. The workload was perfect. There were some weeks during which we had quite a bit of reading (though, like any class, not many people read the pieces in entirety), and some weeks with very little work. I really enjoyed the New York City ballet tapes we were able to access. So cool!!! We got to watch Mikhail Baryshnikov perform Suite of Dances and, of course, see Daniel perform in several pieces we studied. \r\n\r\nI was very engaged with the course material, but there were students in the class who were not as engaged. This isn't necessarily a weaknessbut do know that you will decide if this course is a gut or life-changing experience. This course was almost perfect; I only wish we could have met more often as a class, though this isn't possible with Daniel's schedule.",
                "This course is fantastic! I really appreciated Daniel's experience and attention to the history and nuances of the art form. Undoubtedly, he is the greatest asset to this course. I also really enjoyed going to see the NYCB and having guess teachers teach parts of their works. I would have appreciated more barre work and warm up, sometimes we jumped into the choreo really quickly!",
                "The central strength of this course is not only the firsthand experience dancing the ballets we learn about , but meeting such incredible dancers and people, and getting to witness a real New York City Ballet during a field trip. One weakness is the feedback within the course. I received very little feedback for my midterm essay and no feedback for my discussion posts.",
                "This class is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Some of its strengths are the professor and his connections that allowed him to bring in guest teachers. The ballets we studied were fantastic and discussing their historical context was eye-opening. And of course the field trip to see a NYCB show was a once in a lifetime experience. Prof Ulbricht brought us backstage and we got to see a bit of what the dancers experience.",
                "The course is very well structured, where the background reading and discussion posts perfectly set the stage for the in-person studio practices, where we had the chance to actually learn and perform excerpts from iconic ballets from the NYCB repertory, taught by Daniel and his colleagues. There are also chances for students to choreograph their own pieces and perform their work in-person and digitally, which further drives choreographic, musical, and performance skills. It was also incredible to have the opportunity to speak with leaders in the ballet world and leading instructors, who were invited by the instructor a few times throughout the semester. The class also takes a trip to New York City Ballet, which was magical! There are no weaknesses to the course!"

I also recommend it to dancers who wish to know more about the global aspects of ballet and its history.",
                "Yes, absolutely, if you have a background and interest in ballet. This class is incredibly well-taught and engaging. It is so different from any other class I've taken at Yale, and getting to learn from Professor Ulbricht is truly a wonderful experience. He brings such a great perspective to the study of dance from his experience, and he really cares about the students in this class engaging and learning through the material.",
                "Yes! It was really fun and engaging unlike any other course I've taken or heard of at Yale.",
                "Absolutely",
                "If you have any experience with ballet, I'd definitely recommend this course! Each class struck a nice balance of discussions, warm ups, and learning NYCB choreography. The more knowledge\/experience you have coming into the course, the more you'll get out of it, but don't shy away if you're a little rusty. Daniel is an amazing instructor who delivers critiques kindly and softly, ensuring that the studio is a safe space no matter your training level. It was a privilege to be taught by him and all of the guest speakers he brought in -- I sincerely have a newfound appreciation for modern ballet.",
                "Yes yes yes yes yes. If you are a ballet dancer or dancer of any kind, please take this class. It opened my brain in ways I didn't know were possible. Daniel is a gift and so is his class. You read, write, think, dance and create in the most amazing combinations of these skills.",
                "Absolutely! This was one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale, and it offered such a unique, hands-on approach to learning ballet. If you have ever set foot in a ballet class and have the vocabulary to enjoy the course, I could not recommend it more.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it fosters a students creative and artistic ability.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in dance or ballet. If you like dancing in class and have some experience with dance you will love this course, and if you like history you will enjoy it. This class does have two choreographic assignments where you will have to perform your solo piece for the class, so if you don't feel comfortable doing that you may not like the class. However, there were all levels in the class and everyone is super supportive!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any students who had ballet before. It is an incredible opportunity to actually learn the pieces from an iconic repertory and really causes you to grow as a dancer and choreographer, as you will be learning from the best of the best. You will also expand your knowledge of the birth of American ballet, the founding fathers and modern choreographers, and how the artwork lives and breathes in the modern age. Visiting NYCB and seeing Daniel and his colleagues onstage was incredible!"
