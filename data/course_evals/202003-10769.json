                "I am rating my engagement with this course very low because I really did not think about this class except the beginning\/end of the semester. The primary point of this class is to go to your lab 10+ hours\/week and perform research there. I think that there should have been more communication between the course coordinators and students' PIs, as I had to provide my PI with basically all of the information on grading and supervision from this course and they were often confused as to what was expected of them as a supervisor with regard to grading. \r\nI also never received feedback on my proposal from the coordinator, which made me confused as to who was actually grading me and how.",
                "This course gives lots of freedom and pretty much everything is dependent on your PI\/postdoc. The course itself is what you would expect. The only required components are a research proposal, research presentation (at a lab meeting), and a final paper. My only critique is that I never got a grade or comments back on my research proposal, which would have been very helpful in writing my final paper.",
                "Strength: was very nice to have leeway to do the work without an excess of extraneous work. Weakness: the structure is currently a bit lacking. Due dates, rubrics, syllabus need to be there\/updated for clarity. Given how it is also a course that does not currently engage students beyond the mentor relationship, assignments should really be posted at the beginning of the semester. Also it does not really make sense to have to email any assignments when the Canvas tool exists.",

If you like performing research and have no trouble contributing 10 (but really more like 15) hours per week to your research lab, you may as well take this class and get credit for it. The only assignments are a short proposal due in September, and then a final report in December. The report can take a little long, but it's good to reflect on what you accomplished over the semester.",
