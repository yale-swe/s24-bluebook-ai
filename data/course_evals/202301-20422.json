                "I learned a lot about the history of Polish cinema as it paralleled Poland's political history. It was interesting as a History major to learn about Poland through film, and I really enjoyed the comparative dimension of the class (i.e. comparing some films and directors to others).",
                "Gained a broader knowledge of Polish history, culture, and film.",
                "I learned a ton about Polish film and the important movies and directors of the genre, which I knew nothing about before. I also learned a good amount about modern Polish history and Polish culture.",
                "I learned about the undertaught history of Poland through Professor Illakowicz's personal anecdotes, mini lectures, documentaries, and most of all films. We watched so many films in this class, few that I had even heard of. I really felt like I got a grasp of both Polish history and Polish psyche during this time."

                "No weaknesses! Professor Illakowicz is very engaging and allowed for really productive group discussions!",
                "I enjoyed that this course broke up each film into a mini assignment by having a short analysis and overview due after each film weekly or twice a week.",
                "The course's only weakness may be the number of movies we had to watch. It was quite a lot to cram into the week, but beyond that the work itself was manageable and classes were enjoyable. The course's strengths are the types of films selected and the way Prof. Illakowicz is able to to draw parallels between cinema, history, and culture.",
                "The in-class discussions were super fascinating and the assignments were manageable and helped me to reflect before class. Some weeks, having to watch two movies including one on Tuesday night was overwhelming and I didn't have time to complete them.",
                "The professor is a huge strength. She is such a wonderful and understanding person. She really cares about everyone's additions to class, and this history means a lot to her. I think a weakness of the class is there by nature: some of the films aren't streamable because they are niche, old, Polish films, so you have to go to screenings. You can find some of them through digging online, but you should be prepared, if you care about the material, to go watch a two hour movie on Sundays after dinner."

                "Yes, if you are interested in film or media studies at all, take it!",
                "If you're interested in Eastern Europe but don't want to memorize all of the dates and events of a history class, this is a perfect course for you! It breaks down history into bite-size chunks and keeps topics moving, thus keeping the class interesting.",
                "Absolutely. Prof. Illakowicz is very sweet and knowledgable, and the course is designed in a way that is the opposite of stressful. It felt more like an elective in some ways as you're able to relax and watch movies, and the discussion of these movies flows very naturally. It is a low-pressure environment, and high reward.",
                "Yes! Professor Illakowicz is super knowledgeable and kind, and I learned a ton from her and from the movies. I came into the class with really zero knowledge about Poland or the communist era and now I feel like I have a really good grasp.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to students who like close reading. I say close reading because you don't just have to be a film major or have a connection to Poland in any way (I'm an English major), but most of discussion and the weekly short responses are all about close-reading a film. I find that task very fun, so I enjoyed class a lot. It's also not that much work, you get to watch really good movies (although, warning, most of them are very very sad), and the professor is super kind."
