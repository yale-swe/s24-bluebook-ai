For material that is challenging to read like The Canterbury Tales or Paradise Lost, it's really important to have someone who acknowledges its difficulty and helps their students progress through it; I thought Professor Sheriko did a great job of this.  She also provides really in-depth feedback to essays that helped me to develop a stronger writing style and think more carefully about paragraph placement.  I do not think there were any weaknesses of the course."
