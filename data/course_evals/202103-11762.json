                "I learned how to read essays for craft in order to determine the techniques a variety of writers used in order to compose compelling nonfiction. I learned to write such essays as well: this course is designed to give you an introduction to five genres of creative nonfiction: personal essays, humor essays, place/travel essays, cultural criticism essays, and profile essays. It's split up into five units: you read a hand of essays in each unit's genre, discuss them in class, and then write your own. Then there are workshop sessions (everyone has two essays workshopped), so fellow students can provide feedback on your work and you have the opportunity to improve your writing. A lot of the material we read was really interesting and honestly quite excellent, and I feel like reading works by such greats as James Baldwin, Joan Didion, and David Sedaris (among numerous others) really enabled to pinpoint what was working in my writing and make it a great deal better.",
                "I helped develop my personal writing voice, figuring out my style by experimenting through a variety of techniques we learned from other essays and our discussions about them.",
                "My writing improved. I developed a better understanding of the variety of structures and styles a personal essay can take on. I learned how different types of personal essays differ in form and techniques that can make each type successful.",

                "The tools of writing nonfiction",
                "I learned how to be more direct in my writing by taking this course as well as becoming a more critical thinker when it comes to reading nonfiction pieces. I learned how to really dissect and study the techniques behind nonfiction essay writing.",
                "This semester, I learned many techniques in nonfiction writing that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. I read some amazing short essays from a broad range of authors, as well as my peers. I have also practiced writing under a deadline and constricted word count.",
                "I learned how to be a better writer and different grammar techniques.",
                "The overall skills I learned by taking this course involved mostly around writing an essay based on non-fiction ideas but I also gained experience in discussing the readings assigned as homework. In each step of writing the essay I developed skills in grammar, analysis, and author's choice of rhetorical devices. I learned how to carefully skim articles and organize my notes in order to gain a deeper understanding of what the author was hoping to communicate as well.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the curriculum. Tons and tons of really great essays. I do wish that the selection of essays had been a bit more diverse, though. But the format of the course is really great: I like how we got to try out five different types of essays, and I feel like I was really able to challenge my skills as a writer. Weaknesses: I felt like the professor didn't have a super great grasp of how best to teach the material. Reading for craft is difficult, because I feel like it can be challenging to identify exactly what a writer is doing in their piece, but I really think that I learned more from reading the essays than from the discussions we had in class. In part, I feel like that was because the professor kind of had very set opinions about her pieces and got a little bit passive aggressive when students voiced perspectives on pieces that differed from her reading of a writer's intention. That made group discussions pretty tense.",
                "Strengths: variety of essays to read and learn from, each of which added value; good class discussions that were interesting and educational; a variety of essays for us to write giving us the space to experiment and figure out our own writing style.\r\nWeaknesses: variety of essays made it occasionally difficult to carry over a lesson learned from one essay to another.\r\nImprove: no ideas. Really good class.",
                "Readings are fun and were helpful for improving my own writing. Class discussion was usually engaging, but sometimes would focus too much on certain readings or points, not giving enough time for other discussions that may be more useful for our development as readers and writers.",
                "The strengths of this course are the readings. They are very interesting and cover a broad variety of topics. Another strength of the class is the workshop process. The workshop process is really helpful when trying to evaluate your strengths and weaknesses as a writer. This class doesn't have any notable weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: anyone can find something to write about\r\nWeaknesses: only one workshop per person",
                "One specific strength of this course is the classroom discussion. Being able to hear my peer's thoughts, ideas, and points of view on all the pieces we read was both a valuable experience. It allowed me to learn just as much from my peers as I did from my instructor. One weakness of this course is that I don't really think the initial syllabus was reflective of what we actually did in class in the sense that there were extra reading assignments added on as the semester went on, which I personally found a bit frustrating. I feel like it would be better to add more on the syllabus than is anticipated to be taught and then take things off as you go.",
                "The strengths were the variety of the class each day (with different discussions, readings, and activities), the professor, and the rewarding feeling one feels when an essay is completed after its final revision. I honestly don't think the course could be improved because it was so well-structured and -taught, but if I had to choose something I would maybe space out some of the time we had to write some essays' drafts, and during some points--I recall this being closet to the end of the course--we had a lot of readings that were a good length, and these were hard to read in detail as I had other homework to complete at the same time.",
                "A strength of this course is that it is very in-depth and really helps students learn different writing styles. \r\nA weakness is that the course was too fast-paced at the beginning of the semester.",
                "The strengths were the attentive professor and doable homework assignments. I felt I was able to read and learn from a myriad of great authors while not being overwhelemed. The feedback received on the essays was also helpful.",
                "I really improved my writing skills.",
                "The structure of readings moving into writings was awesome and flowed very nicely. Structure is fantastic. I might like to have our personal essay come last or closer to the end, starting with place though."

                "Take English 120! But don't take it with this professor. Especially if you're LGBTQ+ or a person of color. This professor said some pretty questionable things about minorities in my class, so much so that I chose not to attend office hours with her even when I needed help with my essays because I didn't want her to say something that made me uncomfortable. I also felt like she could be kind of passive aggressive, which made class very tense and sometimes unpleasant. One day, she chose to give us a grammar lesson about misplaced modifiers, and she used example sentences taken directly from our essays in order to demonstrate their ungrammaticality. In her defense, I did feel like I received good essay feedback from herher points about how I could improve my pieces largely felt quite fair. But in general, I just didn't feel particularly supported in her classroom and had much more fun reading the essays in my dorm and then working on my own drafts. TL;DR: English 120 is a great class! It will stretch and challenge you as a writer but it's really quite worth it! Just take it with a different professor. As far as I've heard, the other professors are all really great.",
                "I would. It helps you develop your own unique writing voice which helps with your own personal style of thinking and communicating outside of writing. And the essays we read are really good and very interesting/educational. Plus, the workshops are awesome",
                "Yes. The essays are very fun to write and improved my writing skills. Getting feedback on each essay is really useful. The readings are also fun to do.",

                "Yes",

However, if you're looking to improve your writing on a more academic level, I think 114 or 115 would be better suited for you.",
                "Yes, I completely recommend this course to another student! It was my favorite class this semester, and my teacher was amazing. She chose great readings for the class and gave wonderful advice. My writing has improved significantly this year.",
                "yes, but if they like creative writing. If you like more structured writing and want to better develop your analytical writing skills, then this is not the course for you. If you like more creative essay writing this is a great course that lets you try many different types of essays.",
                "Absolutely! I felt my writing skills greatly improved and the professor gave a lot of helpful feedback with accessible office hours. I enjoyed the readings and found the workload manageable.",
