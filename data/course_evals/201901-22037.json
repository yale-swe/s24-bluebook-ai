   "comments": [
    "I really learned how to do math in 3d, and learned about the concept of gradients, Stokes' Theorem,  Green's Theorem, the fundamental theorem of line integrals. I learned how to visualize 3d space and interpret it mathematically.",
    "I gained a deeper appreciation for the complexity and beauty of math. I actually started to understand what the different types of integrals mean. Also, I learned how to study better, use available resources, and approach the teacher for extra help.",
    "I learned a lot about problem solving and very detailed aspects of multivariable calculus.",
    "I learned basically all of introductory multivariable calculus as well as how to approach math problems in new way.",
    "I developed my skills of multi-variable calculus and three dimensional relationships to a much greater extent than what I previously had mastered.",
    "I got a working knowledge of multivariable calculus. This course is definitely geared more towards teaching you the how to than the why. Although I would have liked to get a deeper, more intuitive understanding of what I was doing (rather than just understanding \"to do x, first compute y, then apply z\") , I do think what we learned is a solid foundation in math and very applicable to other fields.",
    "I learned multivariable calculus, and not only how to do it but the rationale behind it. More broadly, I got experience in tackling a given problem in various ways and using various tricks.",
    "I discovered a lot of the applications of multi variable calc that we use in my physics course and was able to go more in depth into their mathematical models."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - Miki's awesome. There were ample office hours, and Ximera proved to be a valuable resource.\r\nWeaknesses - Some concepts weren't thoroughly explained. It took a while for someone to actually explain why orientation is important.",
    "Because I had Miki, the course was taught extremely well. The homework is easier than the exams, but the Ximera modules are extremely helpful. I wish there was more practice material for exams, but honestly think Ximera was more useful than practice tests. I also liked the homework questions not from the book because they make you think more.",
    "It was taught very thoroughly.",
    "There is a lot of extra material that is super helpful like Ximera and all the extra review.",
    "I thought this course was very strong, helpful, and engaging.",
    "Professor Havlickova is great. She has a fairly engaging lecture style, and prepares little \"game\" type activities to make class more fun. She also has so many office hours and this is very useful for getting individual help. There are plenty of resources provided by the course director; I found the practice exams on Ximera particularly helpful for studying. The tests were fair in that they looked exactly like the homework problems; this is very helpful grade-wise and the only downside is it's hard to know if you really mastered the material or if you just memorized the steps for each type of problem.",
    "strengths: great teaching, meaningful homework and exams\r\nweaknesses: the grading was a bit harshon the first exam I lost all 30 points for one problem because I tried to do it using a method that was incorrect, yet that we had learned for that type of problem.",
    "The Ximera modules were very helpful and a great resource. I do think the weighting of grades is skewed strangely. We spend a lot of time each week on problem sets and they occur even during testing week that to have them count for only 10% seems low, especially if people do well on the problem sets because they work better with out a time constraint and being able to come back to a problem than a timed test."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. It makes multivariable calculus accessible, and I didn't find it to be anywhere near as bad as I've been told.",
    "Yes! I honestly do not think Math 120 is that bad, just people dont prepare enough. I did very poorly on my first exam because I was too nervous and had been told how difficult the course was and how hard all the exams are. If you use Ximera and go to class, ask questions, you will be fine. There are also so many resources available to you if youre struggling and the teaching staff really cares!",
    "Yes, if taught by the right professor.",
    "I would recommend it if the student is looking to expand their understanding of calculus or if they're looking into taking higher level econ and physics class.",
    "I certainly would recommend my section to another student. I thought Professor Miki Havlickova was wonderful and really enhanced my learning experience.",
    "Overall, yes. I think it is quite useful to have some background in multivariable calculus. (If they are taking the class, I definitely recommend the professor I had.) But if they are just trying to take a class purely for fun or to fulfill a requirement, there are probably other math classes better suited to that.",
    "Yes, this class makes you realize how limited single variable calculus is. If you've taken calc I and calc II, it would be a shame not to take calc III.",
    "I would recommend it over other math coursesit is well-taught and there is a lot of support available.",
    "Yes, I didnt find it nearly as bad as everyone had told me to expect. The material was actually pretty interesting. Miki Havlickova is an incredible teacher.",
    "I would only recommend this course if it was required by their major."
