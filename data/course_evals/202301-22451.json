                "Professor Schneider has ZERO rules and few expectations. I frequently questioned whether I was doing the class correctly throughout the semester. For those of us (like me) that appreciate structure, this class is tough. But it is also an excellent opportunity to be creative; how you operate in Art 014the work you produce and the notes you takeis up to you.",

I think the class is a low-stress environment that is beneficial to the mind and helps students recognize their potential. We also had a lot of freedom to choose what we wanted to focus on for our final project which really allowed us to utilize our creativity and try to connect what we have learned across disciplines."
