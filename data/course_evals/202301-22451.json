                "I think this course is strong in its diversity and interactiveness, as well as fulfilling its main course objectives. However, the seminar could feel a bit prolonged at times given it's a three hour course.",

                "Strengths- not a lot of work to do outside of class time\r\nWeaknesses- 3 hours is a long time for one class, very repetitive in the notes we had to take, not allowed to take notes in bullet form, I don't think I learned a lot of new things after the first few classes",
                "Professor Schneider has ZERO rules and few expectations. I frequently questioned whether I was doing the class correctly throughout the semester. For those of us (like me) that appreciate structure, this class is tough. But it is also an excellent opportunity to be creative; how you operate in Art 014the work you produce and the notes you takeis up to you.",
                "Strengths: amazing classroom atmosphere, facilitated free and unjudged discussion\r\nWeaknesses: we did not receive grades for the course on any intermediate assignments, or much feedback regarding our involvement in the course"

I think the class is a low-stress environment that is beneficial to the mind and helps students recognize their potential. We also had a lot of freedom to choose what we wanted to focus on for our final project which really allowed us to utilize our creativity and try to connect what we have learned across disciplines."
