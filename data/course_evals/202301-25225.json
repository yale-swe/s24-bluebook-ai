                "I received a broad education in many schools of German (and South American, Japanese, and Polish, among others) fiction, including realism, romanticism, fantasy, and magical realism. I also found that my critical thinking and analytical writing skills had improved substantially by the end of the semester.",
                "I developed a nuanced understanding of the works of literature that blends in realism and the fantastic. I developed an appreciation, depth and creative understanding of these works.",
                "We read a cross-section of literature and theory that concerned it with the question of how to approach and transgress the boundary between reality and non-reality. This class gave me the vocabulary and analytical tools to think about these transgressions in a more sophisticated way.",
                "I developed my ability to make connections, to lead a discussion, and to enjoy what i study about. This class was so good for me both academically and personally, i loved it!",
                "I practiced reading long texts and theorizing on the text as a whole (rather than discrete fragments) and commenting across traditions, genres, and geographic regions. We also read little theory, so much of our 'theory' on the themes of 'realism' and the 'fantastic' was self-constructed, derived from the texts we read in a way unique to this class."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: A fascinating selection of texts are read and a wide variety of concepts are covered; I felt extremely intellectually stimulated but didnt feel at all like we covered too much content for us to adequately discuss it. A perfect balance! Moreover, I felt that the in-class discussions were uniformly excellent. Although this could simply be attributed to the assortment of students in the class, I felt that professor Brass had an excellent understanding of how to properly moderate discussion; every day I left class feeling that Id said everything I wanted to say and also discovered many new things that I hadnt thought of before!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course is highly comparative, so some knowledge of German philosophy and aesthetic history could be useful in getting the most out of the course, but certainly not necessary, as my knowledge is limited but I still had a wonderful time and felt extremely satisfied.",
                "This is a fantastic course which explored this multi faceted topic in an engaging, informative and fun way. The professor was very accommodating and encouraged our conversations which often went very deep and we all learnt a lot in the process.",
                "What troubled me most about the course had nothing really to do with the syllabus or the structure, which I think are both very strong, especially with the mindset of anticipating divergences, but with this particular student constituency. I found that one of my classmates saw it fit to take up a disproportionate amount of the seminar airtime, so to speak, and it hindered my ability to participate and really invest myself. If they hadn't occupied so much space, I think we would have collectively gotten more out of the class, but maybe that's just me.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Varied and interesting syllabus\r\n- Exciting ways of student engagement--not just a typical seminar discussion, but the presentation component was super well-received and was my favorite aspect.\r\n- We always found a way to make our readings relevant to our life and other intellectual interests, so everything felt salient and inter-related.\r\n\r\nNot so much weaknesses as 'considerations':\r\n- Not much theory, but for good reason\r\n- The amount of reading varied quite a bit, though with good forewarning. Some weeks we'd have pretty long, whole books, and other weeks short stories. (But we'd always know in advance when a reading-heavy week would be approaching)\r\n- There could be more structure to our class discussions, but the open-ness also contributed to in-the-moment revelations and meandering and highly productive comments."

                "This was the best course I took this semester. Even though I had little knowledge of German literature or philosophy, I felt that the texts we read were so exemplary of the concepts we covered (which were expertly discussed) that I felt completely comfortable wading into an area which I wasnt previously familiar with. I think one of the drawbacks with explicitly-titled introductory or survey courses is that they truly just scratch the surface of the topics which they cover; this class, by contrast, took the students deep into a relatively wide range of German (and world) literature that left me feeling very satisfied! I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone whos interested in German literature, but more broadly anyone who enjoys literature. I found this class extremely rewarding.",
                "I would definitely recommend it. Its a great and fascinating approach to this brilliant intersection of genres in literature. You will learn a lot and improve your critical thinking skills.",
                "If my peer were interested in the subject, this course is really great, especially at being a vehicle or lens for exploring and sharing one's other passions. If they were looking for something more concrete or prescribed, I'd still say good things, but maybe it's not for them, and that's okay.",
                "Yes! Sebastian was an amazing professor and i will miss him.",
                "Absolutely YES. Such interesting readings across cultures and time where the course satisfies the best aspects of the 'survey' and a more in-depth seminar. I feel confident commenting on readers we've discussed throughout the course (everything is super self-referential and texts we read in the beginning kept coming up in later weeks), and I learned a whole new method of reading (one where my whole self is involved, not just the analytic eye) in addition to the content of what I actually read."
