                "This course was a helpful class when it came to introductory Spanish. It taught me how to write effectively and how to keep up with a college language class. The class was heavily graded on the grammar with very little speaking assignments.",
                "I am much better at speaking Spanish than I was before the course. I wouldn't say that I am good at speaking Spanish, but I went from having no knowledge to having a good understanding of the grammatical rules and structures of the language. I also have an increased understanding and appreciation of the various Hispanic cultures of the world.",
                "I was re-introduced to the basics of the Spanish language.",
                "In this course, we learned a lot about the foundations of the Spanish language, Latin American culture, and grammar.",
                "It was a good introduction to Spanish language and culture.",

            "comments": [
                "This class was great at teaching me the basics of Spanish. I heard that the administration was looking to get rid of asynchronous classes. This day was extremely helpful to prepare and catch up with the class. This class is extremely fast-paced and leaves very little time to review, so these asynchronous classes were helpful in deepening my level of knowledge. For the course itself, I would recommend some review days because we learned so much new content it was overwhelming at times.",
                "It moves very quickly, which is both a strength and a weakness. It covers content so fast that you are forced to improve at the language, but at the same time, there is hardly enough time to really permanently memorize vocabulary, and it seems that words are very easy to forget after the first exam.",
                "The daily schedule is helpful for learning a lot of information quickly. It was also pretty taxing.",
                "Strengths-covers a lot of content, there is a variety of assignments for different learning styles, classroom culture is great.\r\nWeaknesses- this course moves very fast, if you get behind it can feel impossible to catch up. Study guides were not similar to the test at all and there is so much variance in L1 Spanish depending on your prof.",
                "Strengths: Classes and homework every day make you pick up the language pretty quickly. The course is well-structured to help you learn. Weakness: The workload is pretty high and sometimes I felt like the material in the VHL assignments was a bit difficult.",
                "The strength of this course was having the asynchronous day, because it allows students to retain the information more without having work in class to do too, this course seems like it had too much busy work at times that straight away from the work or foundation. We are trying to build, and I think we should focus more on vocabulary and learning it because thats what makes language."

                "I would recommend this course to other students as long as they have some level of Spanish. Otherwise, the class would be a lot.",
                "I don't think I would recommend it to another student, as the workload seems disproportionately high. I had more work every night in Spanish than I did for any of my STEM courses, and people I talked with in other language courses also seemed to have less work.",
                "Yes! A fantastic course.",
                "I would recommend this course for anyone interested in the language. It is a challenge and it moves fast, but if you want to learn Spanish, go for it!",
                "Yes, your Spanish skills will improve a lot by the end of the semester. It gives you a strong foundation for taking future Spanish classes.",
