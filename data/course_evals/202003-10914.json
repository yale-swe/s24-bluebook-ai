The classes where we met face to face over Zoom were the best part of the course as you really forced to comprehend and speak German, which helped with learning. The weakness was definitely the online homework and asynchronous classwork, which oftentimes took a lot of time, mostly due to technical issues.",

It was the course with smallest number of students that I took this semester, which added to the course being especially engaging. \r\nSometimes the directions and deadlines for certain outside-of-class assignments were not communicated as clearly as I would have liked them to be."

                "Anytime where we were able to engage with someone face to face was really helpful (i.e. synchronous days, weekly graduate student discussions), because it was nice to be able to practice speaking and hearing the language. The asynchronous instructional videos were very informational; however, sometimes the digital assignments were a bit finicky.",

                "The live virtual lectures three times per week were very successful. I feel as if my learning greatly improved because of the active participation that these live classes encouraged. The Zoom video-conferencing software was definitely different from in-person lecture, but I felt as if it didn't hinder my learning or participation at all. The asynchronous assignments that were assigned in place of these lectures twice weekly were also successful. However, there was more uncertainty to completing them, because some took much longer than the allocated 50 minutes. The virtual engagement during the live Zoom lectures was high."

It is an excellent introductory foreign language class, as it is geared in every way towards the teaching and learning of basic language skills, while also developing higher-level thinking skills and creativity, such as for the projects that were assigned. The concepts in the class were clearly explained by the instructor, there was always time to ask questions, and the assignments outside of class were both engaging and very helpful to my overall learning in the course."
