Learned more about how to reflect on a psychology paper and how the topic impacts me. learned how to really consider an empirical study proposal.",

However I wish the structure of the class could have been a bit more varied. Just doing readings and reading responses and then discuss those in class each week got a bit mundane in the end. Maybe have some specific ideas questions than just a reading response? And maybe have more exercises in class than just discussions.",
                "I loved the course structure the way it is. The weekly response papers kept us engaged in the readings and the class discussions never felt like they were too stressful or difficult to engage in. I appreciated Professor Gendron's patience and understanding throughout the course, which appeared in small but meaningful ways such as saving the last 15 minutes for office hours/questions and allowing us to rewrite our first assignment after receiving comments. I also really appreciated the way Professor Gendron would use our response papers to bring us into discussions. It made it easier for me to speak up in class.",
