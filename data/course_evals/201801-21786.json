   "comments": [
    "I learned all about the foundational principles in American politics, current issues, and institutions.",
    "I learned at a deeper level the functions of the institutions of the US government and why they have developed the way they have.",
    "I thought this course was an incredibly interesting and informative introductory course to American government. Before taking the course, I was a little worried that I would find the information too repetitive and not very novel, but Professor Huber provided both a wealth of new information about American government and new and interesting insights about the inner workings of American politics.",
    "I learned more about the basic structure of our government.",
    "Political Institutions",
    "I developed a basic knowledge and understanding of the American political system",
    "I was definitely able to better understand our political system after this class in a more meaningful way. I realized that there was much more than on the surface and that there is truly a balance in our government. I respect our political system more and definitely got a good introduction about basic political theory from reading Downs, etc. and a few major political science papers. I gained a better sense of what political science is as a field.",
    "The basics of American government, including how it came to be, how it is set up, how it functions, and what influences it.",
    "I can't say I learned much.",
    "I learned about the elements of the American government; the founding and the Constitution, campaign and voter theory, Congress and the theory behind committees, the bureaucracy, the president, the judiciary, the media, parties, and policymaking.",
    "At first glance, this course may seem like a typical American history class. Professor Huber does a very good job of making sure that American history is focused primarily on understanding the political environment of today. Throughout the course, you will learn how about the evolution and development of political institutions (why they changed, should they have changed, how change relates to the constitution, etc).",
    "american politics",
    "I became more capable in talking about American politics and knowledgeable of the basic political institutions our country is governed by.",
    "I have learned all about the history and principles in American politics and how those principles apply to politics today.",
    "I developed a much more comprehensive understanding of the American Political system. This class provided me with a solid framework for understanding current political events, and it made me want to take more PoliSci classes in the future.",
    "Nothing that I didnt know before.",
    "I'm not sure if I learned any skills. Maybe reading large quantities of text and trying to capture the most essential points of it.",
    "Intro to US Politics really gives you a broad overview of how US politics, which is great if you are coming in new to the US system. However, I can imagine it would be very basic for someone who understands a lot of US politics already.",
    "I learned a lot about the philosophy behind why politics work the way it does and the inner workings of politics - much more than just learning about the more basic level stuff such as the three branches of government and \"separation of powers.\" Great course.",
    "Very good, informative course about american government from a political science research perspective.",
    "This course is a great into the the actual field of American political science. Professor Huber teaches the class not like a high school civics or AP gov class, but rather as a course geared towards getting you into the main literature of American politics.",
    "I have basic understanding of the American political system",
    "Really interesting and timely class. Not a typical intro gov course, much more nuanced and analytical.",
    "None.",
    "This course gave an interesting look at the comtemporary political science literature and theory at work behind the material one would learn in a typical course about American governance.",
    "Basic introduction to the dynamics of American politics; covers basic theories such as Downsian logic of voting.",
    "This class definitely goes beyond the basic American history founding fathers stuff into the specifics of power division in th Constitution and major conflicts related to government powers today.",
    "Intro to reading political science articles of a complex article. Also understanding major problems political themes of the present day.",
    "Through this class, I gained a deeper knowledge of the American government than I did in AP Gov. I learned not only about how the government works but also why it works the way it does and the implications of the system. I also read research papers involving political science and recent newspaper articles that related to the topics we talked about in class.",
    "I primarily got a greater familiarity with the intricacies of American Politics. I also refined my ability to develop and support a thesis, and learned more about political science research and the foundational papers in the field.",
    "A greater depth pf understanding for the complicated reasons behind American political polarization",
    "This course gave a great basis of knowledge regarding the American Political system.",
    "I gained a thorough understanding of the American political system."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I felt very un-engaged - these were mostly thinks I learned in AP Gov and APUSH.",
    "The course is quite comprehensive in reviewing the role of many government and non-government actors in the development of policy. Due to all the material covered, it can be superficial in some portions.",
    "The strengths of the course are that Professor Huber is an incredibly interesting lecturer, the material provided is interesting and informative, and the course doesn't feel too much like an intro course--we dived deep into topics which I really appreciated. The readings are sometimes a little dry, though, (especially towards the beginning of the course) so maybe switching them up or mixing them with some more engaging pieces would be helpful.",
    "I thought that the lectures were very engaging, but it was a lot of information in a short amount of time. Concepts could have been explained more clearly.",
    "Wish the Professor would be able to post lectures on slides; had to miss class a few times. Overall interesting topic.",
    "The lectures were very engaging and the material was very interesting. The course was a bit heavy on reading, but had relatively little work outside of reading. One paper, one midterm, and one final.",
    "I thought the material was well-taught and the reading load was manageable. Grading was extremely fair and made me want to do work\/succeed in this class. Some of the readings were a little too technical; I can't remember exact examples right now, but the TA's definitely know which readings. They didn't detract from this course at all though.",
    "Lectures are very interesting- Prof Huber is interesting, intelligent, and a great lecturer. It is interesting and though provoking. There can be a lot of reading but overall it supplements learning.",
    "The topics were cool, the readings were interesting, but for some reason things seemed too abstract. Things didn't stick.",
    "Professor Huber promised in the first week that the class would not be like a high school american government class and he would try to focus on the political science part of it, and he delivered. It was interesting learning about theoretical models and reading real political science studies. However, I do feel that the class spent a lot of time on the founding of the Constitution and that rather than being covered in 4 weeks, it couldve been done in 1 or 2.",
    "The readings where at times very difficult to understand and there is little no help in understanding them. The weekly quizzes are designed to be very easy, but, in reality, they are often very difficult even if you did the readings for class.",
    "really reaaly good",
    "Lectures were always very engaging and the readings were interesting and thorough. I thought the course covered a wide variety of topics, but didn't always cover them as deeply as I would have liked. I was hoping to learn more specific information, and the course was often very general.",
    "This course was strong in that the professor related ideas in the class to current news. This helped me better understand how to interpret the chaos in today's political world. It could be improved by allowing students to discuss their papers with each other in section.",
    "Strengths: lectures were incredible. Prof. Huber does a stellar job conveying information succinctly and keeping it engaging.\r\nWeaknesses: sections tended to feel superfluous. Quizzes were sometimes unreasonably hard, and felt like they didn't assess whether I did the reading accurately. The quiz system also rewards procrastinating, because they tended to favor recall of relatively arbitrary information rather than the general purpose of the reading as a whole.",
    "Strengths: gut. Midterm and final are both open note, open book\r\nWeaknesses: boring bc its a gut. Also too much work, felt like a high school course. Readings are boring but there are pop quizzes so you have to do them",
    "Weakness was that there was too much reading and sometimes the quizzes were not even fully reflective of the reading. Strength was that the quizzes were expected to be every Thursday which provided some consistency.",
    "The course is split up into different topics per lecture: for example, Media for one, Congress and committees for another two lectures, and the judicial system for another lecture. This is good because it allows students to take in the lecture information and then engage with it further in discussion section once a week. \r\nA weakness is it doesn't allow for much depth in the lectures, however this is a given since it is a introductory lecture course. In fact, I'd rather have breadth than depth in a course like this.",
    "Quizzes at begin of each class is a great way to keep the students engaged, doing the readings, and coming to class. Not too much impact on your grade, but enough for you to care, and not very hard to get 100% on every one as long as you pay attention. Also, the exams and papers are very fair and quite interesting.",
    "It felt like the class was meant to teach the TFs how to teach instead of teaching us the information. Overall very good though",
    "The course I dont think was a great in its evaluations of grading student papers or the midterm. It was claimed by my TF that the course wasnt meant to bring down your grade or make it hard for you to get a good grade, yet the rubrics for grading in my opinion were intense and asked for more than you would think it would according to that claim. I was even told that if my TF took the exam, they wouldnt have done well. Because of that, it was hard to enjoy or really learn from the class because I was instead focusing on the letter grade. Also I feel like the course, although it was an introductory course, did not focus on a lot of important issues of American politics. For example, slavery was swiftly discussed and other issues like minorities, race, etc werent very much mentioned. Additionally, it was hard to focus on the material when there were at times many readings assigned for one day or even week because I found myself trying to focus on what they said for he quizzes instead of actually reading it for my interest and understanding. A strength was that the class was clearly divided so you knew where it was going and it almost had a circular track.",
    "Very much a bona fide political science course. Logical and empirical in nature without being grounded in mathematical manipulations.",
    "Lecture notes could be a little more clear, sometimes the notes we would write down I would not remember any context to which Professor Huber was speaking about",
    "I think that the professor should give quizzes on Tuesdays, rather than Thursdays.",
    "I think this course is overall well-taught, but I think the lectures could be made slightly more interesting or engaging. I think part of the problem is there is almost too much time spent on explaining things that seem kind of intuitive. I also think perhaps there could be even more application to current events.",
    "Good readings",
    "Not an introductory course.",
    "The readings were well connected to lecture, the quizzes and section discussion helped extract important elements.",
    "Professor Huber is a pretty engaging lecturer and is definitely receptive to suggestions for improvement and any student remarks. However, section could have been more engaging or thought-provoking--there were a lot of awkward silences. The class was organized as a whole, but I wish the TAs could have emphasized the main concepts and ideas a little more--sometimes the lectures covered so much detail and extraneous information that the most significant theories were diluted in importance.",
    "This course is definitely not worth taking. It is a class that brings unnecessary stress. The quizzes on the readings were  meant to be easy and not stressful but many times they were about picky things in the readings so even if you read, you might miss a few. The TAs were harsh graders (I had professors who were better graders) and definitely not very good at their jobs.",
    "Professor Huber is a great lecturer and is very engaging, but sometimes it wasnt really clear what exactly we were going to be tested on.",
    "Good basic intro to key themes. A little too much reading.",
    "One strength of the class involved the Professor Huber's lectures and the obvious expertise he has in this field. The lectures were super interesting and they would always spark revelations in the minds of the students. Another strength of the class was the research papers we were required to read for the class. It was nice to see the research that had been conducted in the field and its effect on how we view the government and its processes. I also really liked the choice between writing a final paper or taking the final exam.",
    "reading was often a little dense, opinion articles may have brought a new interesting angle to our discussions (this was great the few times we did ti in section)",
    "I really enjoyed this course.",
    "I liked that the course included both a textbook and additional readings to ensure further understanding.  However, I wish more topics could have been covered in the course."

   "comments": [
    "If you don't know that much about politics\/gov\/US political institutions then you will love this course. The teaching style is great. If you know a little more than the basics, you'll be bored and miss the details\/insights that Huber brings to the table, hurting your grade.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone curious about the functions of the US government and all those who participate in policy-making decisions.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because of its interesting and important insights into the inner workings of American politics. It is clear that Professor Huber knows a lot about American politics and government and he was able to distill that information in interesting and important ways that really did help facilitate learning.",
    "Yes, I thought that it gave a lot of basic knowledge and useful information about our government.",
    "Open note test is deceivingly difficult",
    "Yes. Professor Huber is a fantastic lecturer, and he maintained my attention more than any other professor has managed to at this school. The material is important to know and understand, and it can definitely help a student decide if they want to pursue political science or not.",
    "Yes! Loved it for both polysci and non-polysci majors.",
    "Yes, for anyone looking for the basic knowledge of government or political science, this is a really good class to take. It is interesting, not too much work, and concrete. However, sometimes it feels as though a lot of the content you learn is trivial and intuitive.",
    "If they need it for PLSC, it's not bad. But it's not fascinating.",
    "Unless you are very interested in learning about American government, do not take it. It is not an easy or gut class. There is a lot of reading that is very boring and tedious unless it is very exciting to you. Honestly it was pretty boring.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone that is interested in American politics. This course provides a very good review of political institutions (how they work, what they are, etc). It's not a gut course, but it also isn't a terribly difficult class.",
    "definitely!",
    "I would recommend this course to a student looking to get a foundation for pursuing farther political knowledge, as it is clear and lays out the foundations for and logic of American politics.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who wants a clear introduction to US Politics, but not to a student who is already a politics expert and wants a challenge. The course was certainly introductory.",
    "Yes, if you are at all interested in PoliSci you should take this class.",
    "Nope. Only take this if youre looking for a 4th easy class, not a gut fifth class bc theres so much work",
    "Yes",
    "Not sure. It was like a high school civics course. Pretty basic information yet still difficult to keep up on.",
    "I'd recommend it because I feel that it is important information to know if you want to delve more deeply into politics in the future. It is not an especially difficult class, and it is engaging most of the time.",
    "Yes. It's very interesting to learn about these things in a classroom setting and not the current biased mess that is current real-world politics. Professor Huber is very academic in his lessons, but also very interesting to learn from and easy to listen to.",
    "Yes. If you do the reading and go to lectures you really learn a lot and read prominent political scientists that will help you understand the current political climate.",
    "If they really like American politics, I would but I dont think I would otherwise.",
    "I would say if you really love American Politics",
    "I would recommend taking this course when you want to gain some scientific insight into the work of the American government that is beyond high school level.",
    "I thought that the material itself was interesting, but that the assessments didn't give me the opportunity to show what I have learned.",
    "I would recommend this course to people who are explicitly interested in studying political science and are thinking of majoring in it. If you are thinking of majoring it, I think this course probably gives an important foundation.",
    "Yeah I liked it",
    "No.",
    "I would absolutely reccommend the course, with the only reservation being that lectures sometimes felt like repetitions of the reading materials.",
    "Yes, especially if you plan on studying political science. If you do not, it's still a great class, but it might not always be the most exciting class of the day.",
    "Yes! Great course and informative.",
    "I would not recommend taking this course.",
    "Would recommend to anyone majoring in political science who wants a good intro class, also to anyone who wants to learn abou American govt outside of APUSH",
    "I would recommend to students looking for an introductory background in American goverentment or American poltitics.",
    "Yes. Well worth it.",
    "I would! It's a nice intro course to get involved with the political science major or even if you're just curious about the American government. The \"surprise\" in-class quizzes are a little tedious at times, but they are fairly easy.",
    "I would recommend this course to anybody interested in political science or who wants a strong introduction to the field. The class was quite comprehensive and the workload was manageable for the most part.",
    "Yes, as an international student it really helped me take my understanding from simple functioning process of the political system to a deep awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of that system as well as of the American political culture",
    "Yes. I found it to be very informative.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student.  I believe it is crucial for all adults to have an understanding of American government."
