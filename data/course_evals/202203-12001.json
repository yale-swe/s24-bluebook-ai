I also felt like I have been exposed to a lot of the \"politics\" or history of the psychiatric field which I had never been exposed to before and found it really interesting.",

I thought it was an excellent environment to facilitate learning.",
                "I enjoyed getting the opportunity to discuss the readings with other students and practicing giving presentations in scientific literature. Overall, the structure of reading the papers and then discussing in class is something I really enjoyed.",
                "The strengths are the papers are really interesting and the jump starts are a good way of having students themselves lead the conversation! Professor Holmes also does a good job of stepping in to help us especially understand certain things we might not know or talk about his past research experience. Some weaknesses might be that we didn't really have a brain systems primer or it wasn't as particularly neuroscience-focused in driving home that we understood the brain in its entirety like what specific systems are responsible for or focused on.",
                "This was a really interesting, yet low stress course that I still gained a lot from.",
                "Having to summarise readings helped to keep me accountable to my readings. It might have been improved if there was a bit more lecturing from prof Avram."

                "Yes!",

                "If one was interested in pursuing a career in neuroscience, this course is super helpful in understanding what the field is about and the current efforts in discovering more about the human brain.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would! We discussed really pertinent and interesting topics related to neuroscience and the field of psychiatry, and I really was able to understand how conflicting the research within the field is it's crazy how we really don't know anything about depression and schizophrenia, and that there is conflicting research for current and potential treatments. I really would recommend because it opened my eyes and was a relatively chill/easy senior neuroscience seminar.",
                "Absolutely! The class is way more chill than the syllabus makes it seem, and the subject matter is super interesting. Professor Holmes is also very knowledgeable and a great discussion leader.",
