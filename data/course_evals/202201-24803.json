Jesse is great and cares a lot about his craft and seeing his students succeed, but that also translates into long-windedness when he is lecturing, and he will just talk at you for hours. Although the lecture content (about history of fonts and influential printers) is interesting, none of it is particularly useful/there is no application for it so it is really hard to stay focused and engaged. the actual project work though is really fun  highly recommended easy art course.",
