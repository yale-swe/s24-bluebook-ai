                "I learned so much in this course. As a bird watcher and a person who has always been very interested in ornithology but did not have a Bio\/Ecology background, I learned so much here. I really appreciated the seminar format because I learned not just from Rick and Liam but also from the other students who knew a lot on the subject and shared their unique interests within bird behavior.",
                "An overview of bird behaviors all in context of Tinbergens 4 questions",
                "I learned how to read scientific papers more effectively and efficiently. Through those papers, I learned a lot about bird behavior, the history of ethology more broadly, and the state of current open questions in ornithology. Finally, the two paper assignments were helpful at improving my ability to analyze scientific papers and assemble them into a review.",
                "By taking this course, I took a deep dive into bird behavior and learned about a diverse range of topics on bird behavior, including Tinbergens 4 Questions, redstart wing flicking, song learning, cultural evolution, cognition, gender in birds, flocking, ruffs, cooperative breeding, brood parasitism, avian adolescence, and dinosaur breeding behavior. I also learned to write a literature review."

                "I didnt find there to be any weaknesses with this course. As mentioned above, I really enjoyed the seminar format for a science course and appreciated how it was structured around relevant discussions each week. The assignments also were very interesting and I enjoyed getting to research topics that fascinated me. Rick and Liam were both very available to meet and discuss anything in the course.",
                "The seminar discussion style allows you to learn from your peers very well! However discussion sometime lacked structure",
                "I think the course has a strong set up. I enjoyed taking a science class that was structured more like a humanities seminar. All of the class discussions were open-ended and facilitated interesting critique, analysis, and appreciation of the material. I do wish the papers had been posted to canvas sooner, if possible, as sometimes they were posted with only a few days to read them before class, and the unpredictability made it harder to balance my work with other classes.",
                "I loved the diversity of perspectives in the class from having a mix of Humanities students, STEM students, Ornithology students, and Humanities professors. Each discussion led to unexpected conversations. I also loved the once-a-week format that meant that the course never culminated in too much stress or too much work. I wish the papers were posted earlier in the week (e.g., Wednesday) to allow more time to review the papers, which were often rather long. I loved the visit to the Ornithology Collection and wish we had gone on some more field trips (e.g., the Yale University Art Gallery)."

                "I have already recommended this course to my friends who are interested in birds. It provided me an awesome opportunity to learn more from experts while getting to focus on what interested me through assignments.",
                "If you have an interest in birds or animal behavior, absolutely. Good even if you are not a STEM major.",
                "Absolutely, the topics of the class expand far beyond birds and are applicable to everything from game theory to evolutionary biology",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in birds, biology and animal behavior more broadly. It would even be a good class for anyone interested generally in being part of a scientific reading group.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Be mindful that this is nearly a two-hour discussion; make sure that you feel up to reading scientific papers and discussing them for that long. I would tell students who have taken Ornithology that many of the topics in this course overlap with that course. For those that havent taken Ornithology, it is a great introduction to the world of birds and Prof. Prums courses! Before discussion each week, make sure you understand the design and results of each experiment. I highly enjoyed writing the two papers as we could write about any topic in bird behavior."
