                "Taking this course was definitely a great challenge for me as a high school student. I began this class thinking that I would have to spend a lot of extra time outside of the official class times and this did end up becoming true as I had to spend ample amount of time watching the lecture recordings again, attending to the help sessions, reading over the recommended textbooks, etc. I think these efforts allowed me to gain so much as a student because I learned to be responsible for my own learning, which is something that might be quite difficult to learn back in high school when so many things are given to my hands directly. Although very challenging, I definitely feel happy about taking this course because it gave me better guidance on whether I would want to study this topic once I actually get into university and dive deeper into one subject.",

            "comments": [
                "I think the biggest strength of this course is how compact the content being taught is. Within four weeks, I was able to learn so much new information in such a concise and well-organized way that I believe it would be impossible for me to learn this content in a better way. The instructor and TAs were also always open to find ways to support the students: I was easily able to contact them through email or attend to help sessions in which the TAs provided me with helpful guidance to understand the content and complete the given assignments. \r\n\r\nI think the weakness of this course is how it was hard for me to participate a lot in the class. I always try hard to participate in any classroom discussions that may take place in a class, not to mention the fact that this course was partly evaluated on how much I participate. However, while being a fast paced class was its biggest strength, it simultaneously made me struggle to make valuable contributions to the class discussions. Whenever the instructor would ask a question, I struggled to answer with confidence because I had not yet grasped the material being discussed at that time in the course by listening to the explanation just one time. I did try my best to ask questions and clarify information that was confusing to me, but I would have definitely enjoyed the course even more if I was able to contribute more to the course.",
                "There was some very intense math derivations and forumlas which were great but were definitely overloading at times. Some application of these topics could also be a very interesting extension.",
                "The lectures were pretty clear and there were a good number of examples worked out in class which was nice. It was a lot of information at once but that is to be expected with a summer course"

                "Yes definitely! I really enjoyed the time spent in this course and think that I was able to learn so much as a student. To be honest, I thought we wouldn't be able to handle the course content with great depth since we only had four weeks to cover the information. However, this course actually guided me into the field of mechanical engineering with great depth and truly inspired to explore the subject even more. I believe that any student who takes this course would find the subject fascinating and intriguing.",
