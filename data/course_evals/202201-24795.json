                "This class was an excellent introduction to the study of business, corruption, and politics! The readings push students off the deep-end, so to say, but after doing several weeks' worth, I was able to understand methods, styles of writing, and results used by political economists studying this topic. There's no \"grand tradition\" or \"answer,\" but that's not a fault of the syllabus. This is a nascent field of study and this course is a great way to get started.",
                "This course provides an excellent overview of the role of moneyed\/corporate interests in the policymaking process.",
                "I developed analytical and strong writing skills looking at various cases.",
                "I learned about the relationship between political arena and business. I have a deeper understanding of institutions, different regimes, incentive side of politics, corruption, lobbyists, and the motives of politicians. Great course.",

                "Strengths - the professor was incredible and very informative and fostered great discussion with the class. \r\nWeakness - sometimes too much reading.",
                "If the course had dedicated parts of the first two classes to methods such as difference-in-differences, it would certainly make a full understanding of the readings easier and faster to acquire. Other than this, the course was great!",
                "The strengths of the course include Prof Zeren Li, the thoughtfully-crafted syllabus, and the discussion-based format. Prof Zeren Li is a rising star in political economy, and his deep knowledge of the field is evident. He cares deeply about student success and makes himself accessible for the final project. By the end of the semester, he had read through and provided detailed feedback on three drafts of my final paper. The only weakness I could identify is the lack of incentive for students to complete the assigned readings. It seemed that only 2\/3 of the class had done the readings each week and this meant that discussions were usually carried by the same handful of people.",
                "The discussions and discussion posts were very interesting and stimulating. \r\n\r\nMaybe there could have been more diverse material such as videos etc",
                "Strengths: seminar allowed be to engage in topic and read a ton. Not too much hw besides late in the year when the final essay must be turned in\r\n\r\nWeakness: was not able to complete all readings because it was so many pages",
                "The strengths was that there wasnt much work but it was engaging and fun."
