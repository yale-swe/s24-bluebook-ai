                "I learned how to read and think critically about the American healthcare system and the people it's left out of the narrative. I learned how to write about the hospital system and about primary sources and truly learned so much from classroom discussion.",
                "Emphasized health as not an individualized issue, but related to larger systems of power, restricting access to the hospital and health care. Traced histories of how the hospital was formed, exploring elitism through patient treatment, nonconsensual study and experimentation, small details like enforced uniforms, etc. Curriculum was not only limited to oppression, but also resistance and how low-income communities of color managed their own health care institutions.",
                "I learned how to engage with really interesting authors and texts and just how horrible the AMA has been in the history of healthcare in the U.S. I also learned how to discuss factors of eligibility, the ways in which our hybridized healthcare system has consistently disadvantaged the urban poor, and how different marginalized groups have invented ways to provision their own healthcare services. I also developed skills related to primary source analysis since that was an emphasized writing skill, being able to go in person to the library archives and closely examine the language of these sources.",
                "I learned a lot more about the inner workings of the healthcare system and how different marginalizations affect ones experience with it. I also learned a lot more about myself and gained some insight on how exactly I want to engage with the healthcare system professionally, in the future.",
                "This course goes is a discussion course that goes through a lot of readings from the 1800s to the present about healthcare for marginalized groups. There is a particular focus on healthcare in cities for the poor, like Chicago and New Haven."

                "This class is structured extremely well and felt very natural in its progression. It also incorporated a number of primary sources that sought to give differing perspectives and I really appreciated that!",
                "Strength was definitely that the curriculum was not only limited to oppression, but also resistance and how low-income communities of color managed their own health care institutions. Not really a weakness, more just something that could be improved on, but would be useful to have a short discussion just on terms that are integral to the class? For example, I'm interested as to why the class specifically used the term \"urban poor.\" Also words like professionalization, institutionalization, abolition, etc.",
                "The course's readings are truly amazing. I love the ability to discuss and learn about the history of Medicaid and Medicare and various health insurance policies, and examine the ways in which various groups had to fight for their own healthcare while examining our own current systems of healthcare and what led to this hybridized methodology of providing services. The readings really put into perspective radical community health center movements and various ways in which the people who were appointed with providing these services either prevented care for the indigent or facilitated it. Professor Abedin was really good at ensuring that we could all accurately discuss and answer pertinent questions to the reading material, and was good about allowing their to be silence during discussion for us to take it in. However, she could have had less silences and also made sure that we got more proper feedback in our writing so that we could know what she was looking for. She really emphasized primary source analysis and she was an amazing instructor with a pediatric background but could perhaps give us more feedback on our weekly questions and timeline to see whether we were doing it the way she wanted.",
                "The readings were great, but very long and it was hard to give a fair amount of time to each one. The discussions were also great. I think work wise, the papers and discussion posts were cool but the expectations werent as clear as they needed to be to do very well on them.",
                "I think the amount of writing feedback and instruction could be increased a bit. A bit more of a guiding hand in the discussion might help as well."

                "YES!! If you are able to take this class, take it. Prof. Abedin is incredible and the course syllabus has been perfected down to every reading. I learned so much from reading the primary sources and the materials from different eras of healthcare. Classroom discussions -- as with any seminar -- were a little hit or miss depending on the opinions of your peers, but I thought everyone was incredibly respectful and interested in parsing texts deeply. Loved this class so much!",
                "Yes! Prof extended help after class, and through office hours. Has a very extensive knowledge on health care within New Haven, which v much enriched the class. Also a very decent workload, enough writing that I got to check-in and make sure I was learning, but not too much where it was overwhelming.",
                "Yes!! You really learn a lot and I had been trying to get into this course since I got into Yale. The readings and discussion are truly eye-opening and helpful if you are going into health policy or medicine in the future. Professor Abedin also has great expertise related to having worked at Fair Haven Clinic, and you also learn to appreciate the New Haven healthcare history and ways in which YNHH has disadvantaged the urban poor.",
                "Do not go thinking that this class is a gut, but yes I would recommend.",
                "Yes! Prof. Abedin is very interesting and has picked great readings. If you can get in, definitely take it."
