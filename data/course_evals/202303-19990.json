The course is very interactive and is effective at teaching the objectives required for the first semester of the Air Force ROTC program. Be prepared to go with the flow of the course and rely on your peers for support when it comes to writing the MFR or the career field briefing. Most of the instructions are very laid out, but the course is also highly collaborative in nature. The assignments, in part, feel independent from the course as little class time is used to introduce the assignment. Assignments are very self-explanatory and standardized.",
