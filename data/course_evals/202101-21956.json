We learned the remaining binyanim (verb conjugations) in their active and passive forms, learned many new nouns, verbs and adjectives and engaged heavily with Israeli culture. There was great application of the vocabulary to the videos, stories and other mediums we explored in the course."

                "Strength: constant work is put into developing mastery without it being overwhelming.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Jamboard feature of the in-person activities could be used a bit less.",
                "Strengths: Sections with the TF were great, and there were some very good discussions in class. The videos and journal prompts were also very engaging. \r\nWeaknesses: It was really hard to memorize vocabulary and verbal structures, but this may have been due to the online format.",
                "I greatly enjoyed this course and looked forward to our meetings three times a week. The mix of assignment types and the structure of the course were very helpful to my learning, and I appreciated the consistent, concrete, and swift feedback on assignments.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I would identify is that I felt that I did not really retain the vocabulary\/verb forms when we moved from unit to unit, simply because I was not forced to use them consistently. But overall I felt the course was very strong and I did go and review all of the material before exams, which helped.",
                "I thought some of the work seemed repetitive and at times a bit too much, but perhaps that's a symptom of online learning that won't repeat in future semesters.",
                "Hebrew 140 is extremely strong in the breadth of things that it covers and the bluntness in which it does so. At some point, there is no more messing around and you just sit down and learn the verb conjugations and whole lot of new vocabulary, and that is good. I feel as though the strong vocabulary background is the driving force behind the course. The professor, Orit, is kind and caring and is very good at teaching the material and answering any relevant questions about the linguistic origin of the Shoreshim or words. The course also was very good in its consistency, as there was good structure to the week's assignments meaning that certain days were always geared towards certain types of learning (writing, listening, speaking, grammar, etc).\r\n\r\nI do wish that there were a bit more culture, though there was a lot, I just love the culture. I think this class would've been even better in person."

                "As previously mentioned, the asynchronous assignments were a nice change of pace while still including interaction with my classmates. I appreciated the usage of Google Docs for our writing assignments so there was nothing to \"submit\" and being able to record my speaking assignments through Canvas\/Panopto. The Jamboards during class time were a lot of fun, as were the Kahoot quizzes, but my internet bandwidth sometimes struggled to open the applications while still running Zoom.",
                "It was the best it could possibly be. It was nice to have a 1 on 1 section with Naama during the week and I though the asynchronous learning days were a good break from Zoom seminars which can get tedious (it is always good to have structured and unstructured time to learn a language)."
