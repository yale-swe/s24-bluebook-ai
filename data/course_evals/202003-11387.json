Discussions were not always engaging even though there were engaging prompts, which ultimately came down to a lack of community in the classroom. Strengths included the opportunity to meet with the professor individually for help and feedback with writing, in addition to the opportunity to do a research paper.",

The weaknesses of this course stem from inconsistencies in topics and on format and the lack of communication about expectations. There were often miscommunications about what was expected and how it should be done.",

I really enjoyed when we were able to choose our own moments of rebellion to analyze, and I wish that the course had included more social rebellion with people of color and women.",

I think it portrays it as three different categories that will be discussed and that are intertwined, but we seemed to only discuss rebellion with little mention of the other two. I may or may not recommend this course to another student.",
                "Yes This is a great introductory english writing course at Yale. Topic is very interesting and challeneges you to rethink the way we see rebels and rebellion. Also the professor is very patient and caring. Professor Baynes-Ross gives positive feedback for you to improve and understands her students.",

If not, then this course might be too taxing and unenjoyable to do well in, especially within the context of a heavy courseload.",
