                "The class deepened the level of knowledge I had on this topic. It provided extensive knowledge on a topic that I already was familiar with.",
                "I learned about the in-depth history of slavery predating the antebellum period, and outside of the United States, which was my only prior exposure to the subject before. I've gained a more critical eye for how the institution of slavery effects the modern world, and more critical analytical skills for interacting with the archive.",
                "I learned so much about the history of slavery in the Atlantic, and not just in the US, but in the Americas too and how the slave trade came to be in Africa too. I learned how to write historical essays. I also learned how to take notes and study for history exams.",
                "I learned a lot about Atlantic slavery and the evolution of the African diaspora (until the end of the 19th century).",
                "This course taught me a lot about how slavery was formed and structured not just in the United States, but across the Atlantic as well.",

                "Strengths: Professor Rugemer's lecture. TA Jeania Ree's revision-oriented grading and sections. The students in the class are collaborative. The material is presented in a way that is easily digestible and compelling. This course is essential. \r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "I really enjoyed the lecture format of the course, but I think the discussion sections could have been organized more around questions rather than just sharing opinions.",
                "Lectures were informative and easy to follow. \r\nThe physical sheet of bullet points that goes along with each lecture is a major strength of this course -- makes it very easy to understand how each point relates to the broader topic and is great for structuring notes. \r\nSections were great, TFs excellent.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelatively high workload at the end of the year preparing for an long-essay-based exam a short time after writing a labor-intensive paper.",
                "The only weakness I could think of is how long study guide lists are for finals and midterms",
                "The lectures were well-organized and clear. Assignment instructions are clear and there is plenty of support to aid student learning. There is a lot of content packed into the Final and Midterm which made for dense and challenging studying.",
                "It's hard to cover the entirety of slavery in just a few weeks of lectures, so it made sense that the whole thing felt sort of rushed. While I think it's important to have section meetings to deepen our understanding of the themes introduced in lecture, the section model didn't feel especially helpful. I thought the class did a good job of surveying the topics the syllabus outlined and leaving me with a solid understanding of the role of slavery in the world.",
                "I think the strengths of the class were the amount of material that was covered and the background information that was provided to create a good basis. The weaknesses were sometimes sensitivity of the content.",
                "Strengths: Lecture was always engaging. The readings were never too much. Very organized class and assignments are always explained in detail.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Way too many terms to study for for final exam. At times, class can feel very boring or void of any contemporary context and application.",
                "Strengths: interesting lectures, readings, and paper topic; the exams were also very reflective of course material.\r\nWeaknesses: none.",
                "For the most part, the content of this course was very informational but extremely surface-level. Especially when discussing the United States, I feel like I didn't really gain new insight that I hadn't known before. I think a large part of this has to do with the professor, however, and not the course itself.",
                "Strengths: we get to go into a lot of detail about why certain things happened rather than just learning historical facts; the TAs were helpful in completing assignments and understanding the content\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: taught by a white man. I felt that this took a lot away from my experience taking this class because the professors Whiteness allows for him to treat this course as a regular history course, not understanding the implications of the history were learning for many students in the class, and failing to acknowledge his positionality in the context of what were learning.",
                "The class is interesting and Rugemer is an engaging lecturer but there were many times throughout the semester I was disappointed by the lack of intentional care this topic necessitates. Term like slaves instead of the now widely accepted enslaved persons are seemingly small choices that make the class much more comfortable for not only Black students but all students.",
                "Strengths: very strong overview of how the Atlantic slave trade operated, how the colonies in the Americas formed, and the laws that white settlers and colonial governments used to exploit slave labor for economic gain. Handouts were a very important help because there was much material to undertake several classes and could be hard to pinpoint. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough study in slavery in South America. Not enough study into the breadth of religious knowledge and experience that formed much of the basis of enslaved peoples resistance. For future courses, dehumanizing material of Black people should not be displayed on the smart board, particularly of lynched bodies."

                "Absolutely! You must take this course because slavery fundamentally shaped the power structures and inequities manifested in our current world. To understand each other's positionality in the world, the structures of the systems in which we live, and compelling history that humanizes the lives of enslaved persons, you must take this course.",

                "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in learning more about the institution of slavery.",
                "Yes, but with a precautionary warning that the professor is very insensitive. He does not acknowledge his place as a white person teaching about the history of slavery to a group of largely Black students. The class is a prerequisite for the African American Studies major, and its a bit unfair, because he makes comments all the time in class that really offend me and my classmates. Like starting off the first lecture with: Imagine you are an enslaved person in the 18th century to a group of students whose ancestors were enslaved is not ok. At all. He should acknowledge he is a white person teaching a class about our own painful histories. Its personal for us. He doesnt need to show us pictures of Black people in the 20th century hanging from trees, just to prove to us racism still existed past slavery.",
                "Yes!",
                "I wish I had better things to say about this course because as an African American student, I came into this course excited to learn more about my history. Sadly, whereas this course could have been super powerful and impactful, I found myself cringing at a lot of the professor's comments and felt overall that the course did not always do the history it presented justice. That being said, I do think it's important that everyone takes a class about slavery because it is such a difficult but significant part of Black history, and it's important to reckon with that. I would just encourage students to really engage with the readings and material outside of class so that they can get a better understanding of the history.",
                "I would not recommend it, because it felt like a course that I just had to get through. However, for AFAM majors, I would recommend taking it with other AFAM major friends because that makes it easier to get through the course.",
                "Yes! This is a history class to its core but it was also very interesting and I truly did learn a lot.",
                "This was a very solid history lecture -- you could show up and count on Professor Rugemer to tell you interesting and worthwhile information and do so in an efficient and engaging 50 minutes. I wouldn't say there's anything that made the class a can't-miss class for me, but I don't think anybody who wants to take this class will regret doing so.",
                "Id recommend it if they want to gain a strong background understand of Atlantic slavery.",
                "Definitely. Lectures were fascinating and the section provided a great space to unpack difficult themes from the course.",
                "Yes, If you wish for a more historical and broad telling of the process of enslavement from my the trans Atlantic slave trade"
