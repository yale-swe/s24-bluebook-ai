This was true in our written assignments, but Professor Sorkin also emphasized the use quotations and student engagement in the class discussion so that we always hewed very closely to the thinkers at hand.",

I also would like to see a more diverse syllabus, including with some more contemporary readings (going past Arendt).",
                "This class is fantastic as it is, but I would recommend that some lectures be made longer/offer more historical context and analysis of passages--there were some points during the semester when a more in-depth lecture would have deepened my understanding of our authors. I really enjoyed the brief student presentations at the beginning of each class and the fact that students call on each other--I learned an immense amount from my peers as well as Professor Sorkin.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Sorkin is very good and very smart; the readings were interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the readings were so high in volume that they were impossible to finish (at least for me!) Also Hegel and Nietzsche were incredibly hard.",
                "One way it can be improved is to have a meeting as a class after the papers have been graded to talk about general problems as well as specific feedback with more time.",
                "No weaknesses - DS is a great curriculum, though, and you just wish there was more time to read the texts.",
                "I enjoyed this course immensely because of the complexity of the thinkers we studied, the engagement of the class, and the satisfying denouement that the intellectual trajectory of the texts gave to the entire year of Directed Studies. I don't have any ideas about major weaknesses, except perhaps that it would have been nice to do in person!",

In general, I think DS is an amazing program and I would definitely recommend it for students who are interested in the humanities and writing, even though it does have a limited Western focus.",
                "I would. After reading the works on the syllabus, I feel that my understanding of modern politics has a theoretical basis point and that I understand many of the major conflicts in current theoretical debates. I loved reading and discussing almost every work, and I find the work of close-reading fun and fulfilling. Professor Sorkin was an incredibly thoughtful instructor, gave great feedback on papers, and was always willing to take question about my writing.",
                "Yes I would! I love DS and DS has been so meaningful to me. The only warning I would give is that there is a ton of reading, which can be overwhelming if you're a slow reader like I am.",
                "Yes, this is a wonderful course to develop a foundation for reading and writing. The texts that we read and discuss penetrate through modern contexts and will be a huge asset in future academic development.",
                "Yes, and especially Prof. Sorkin. Hes so great at teaching and so willing to help and walk you through your papers & encourage you during the seminars.",
                "I would very much recommend this course, and the Directed Studies curriculum as a whole, to any students who are deeply interested in the history of ideas and the irreducibility of great thinkers. More than a series of historical or political facts, this course taught me the joy that can be gleaned from putting the entire canon of Western intellectual in conversation with itself, and the creative potential that this process contains.",
                "As with all DS classes, yes I would totally recommend it to someone who I think could handle it. I think taking DS is something that really requires you to be interested in what youre learning and excited to do all that work  but if you are, its totally an awesome experience.",
                "Yes. I learned a lot about modern historical and political thought and Professor Sorkin was really good at helping us break down complex texts and stepping in to explain them when we got lost in our student discussions.",
                "If a student is interested in history or politics, this course will provide them an excellent survey of the past 700 years of political thought that is valuable and enjoyable. If someone is even considering taking DS or wondering whether they should take the second semester, I would strongly urge them to do so. If a student has never even hear of DS, I would strongly urge them to research it and consider enrolling."
