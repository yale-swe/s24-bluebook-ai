It reviewed and challenged the typical understanding of relationships of social disciplines with science including religion, politics/government, and economics through the lens of catastrophes.  Additionally it provoked more critical thought about what science is as a field of study and how lines between scientific and academic fields of study are drawn. The class covered 7 catastrophes: the great flood, mass extinction events, global fisheries collapse, peak oil, nuclear winter, the ozone layer depletion,  and climate change. Some of these very hot button issues generated discussion, the widening of personal perspective, and potential ways of creating a solution.",

I learned how science does not exist in a vaccuum isolated from business, religion, capitalism or politics, and my view of science as a STEM major was definitely changed by the course. I learned how to write op-eds on present day issues by citing historical events and processes.",

Some examples include breaking down the conflict thesis, pure science, and tragedy of the commons myths.",

Learned about Biblical chronology, the study of the Great Flood, fossil study and mass extinction theory, continental drift, overfishing, peak oil theory, nuclear winter, and climate change/global warming. Most important, I learned that several \"cartoons\" we take for granted, such as the fact that science stands in direct opposition to religion, or that science fields capitalism, or capitalism corrupts science, are not true. I learned how to deconstruct those cartoons, to prove them wrong. I learned about the social construction and deconstruction of scientific knowledge, and about many prominent historical figures related to the catastrophes we studied, like Buckminster Fuller, Carl Sagan, Oreskes, Lomborg, Lyell, Darwin, Humboldt, Linnaeus, and others. The main thing you learn is how to delegitimize \"cartoons\" and really decompose what a question is asking/recognize illegitimacies in a prompt."

                "Lectures are super well organized, which I really appreciated. Maybe it would be better to make \"connections\" between concepts across units more explicitly during lecture.\r\n\r\nAlso for the midterm, it was difficult to know how to improve with the lack of comments by the graders.",
                "The class lectures were well organized, engaging, and balanced between background info and new ideas. The readings were very well selected and discussion section was organized well to support the main lecture. The other assignments for this class were also very reasonable. The exam questions and Op-ed assignments did not at any point feel like a burden, unfair, or like they had no point. Instead, they focused on how we processed the information and how it informed our opinions rather than requiring the regurgitation of facts.",
                "I think the way it taught should be a little more connected to the way it is tested.",
                "One of the strengths of the course was Professor Rankin's lecturing style. He was a really engaging lecturer and broke down difficult concepts in a digestible way. One of the weaknesses was the lecture slides. When he presents each slide, he'll start off by presenting the first topic on the slide. Then, he'll press space and another topic will appear on the slide. So, when he uploads the slides onto Canvas, he posts multiple versions of a single slide, so it makes studying a little more messy/annoying. I don't know if that really made sense and it's kind of a small thing, but I wish that would have been different.",
                "The course was well organized and interesting. I think the readings were not great which made sections not great.",
                "Better lectures notes on canvas to help study",
                "Strengths - Prof. Rankin is truly brilliant, and has the 50-minute lecture down to a precise science. Every lecture picks up very neatly from where the previous one left off, presents some really interesting ideas that challenge what he calls \"cartoonish narratives\", and wraps up just in time to connect with the broader unit of the class. Prepare to walk in to the lecture hall and really learn something new every time. There are almost no questions taken, which is a great thing. \r\nWeaknesses - the main weakness of this class is the low engagement level of most students, since it must be a known humanities gut on some of the sports teams. The weekly reading load is admittedly a tad high (and a mixed bag), but a majority of my section showed up every week having done NONE of the readings. This is not to shame, but to say that section was a truly painful experience most weeks. \r\nOne thing that I think could improve the class would be more small assignments to diversify the source of the grades. The work most weeks consisted purely of reading, which most people didn't do.",
                "This course is executed in a cohesive, structured, and well-defined way, and it is built well for maximizing a student's level of engagement. The online review lectures are thoroughly engaging. And the content was good for dealing with a host of unhelpful narratives that often surround science and its social interactions.",
                "Strengths: awesome, engaging professor; interesting and well-organized subject material; I liked the op-ed assignments\r\nWeaknesses: sections were not the most engaging, not a lot of guidance was given for exams besides review sheets, sometimes I felt a little lost in the material",
                "I thought the course was well structured. The only think I will say is that the slides used during lecture were not super detailed and thus not that helpful.",

                "I think the course is very well structured overall. The themes flow well and Professor Rankin does an excellent job of outlining what the lectures - for both that day and the week - will cover. \r\n\r\nI do think the weather mapping unit was pretty difficult to follow just because the history of weather mapping was a little boring. The ideas of mapping and data are obviously huge themes throughout the course, but I think future students would appreciate if this section were abridged.",
                "The lectures were interesting and the professor ranking was engaging and knowledgeable.\r\n\r\nThe section was a total drag and the content of the course was somewhat overwhelming and could have totally been simplified.",

                "It could be improved by improving how section was ran, it could have been a lot more interactive and relevant to what we were learning in the classroom",
                "Lectures were very clear and logical, but the conclusions were interesting and new. The level of engagement in section was disappointingly low.",
                "Strengths: This course exposes you in considerable detail to singular debates, events, or individuals, then asks you to draw much more wide conclusions about the ways we think about scientific history and functions. This was a good challenge for me. The lecture slides and goals of the class are always very clear - Professor Rankin probably does the most scene-setting and transitioning out of any professor that Ive had so far.\r\nWeaknesses: the readings are tailor to each week, covering the events or ideas of the people were discussing, but its usually chapters or books  that is, very long. I, for one, found it very difficult and not particularly helpful to be expected to do all of the reading when that type of professional detail was not discussed or useful for the class goals beyond cool exposure to the primary or secondary sources.",

Having to write a paper to make up for your absence instead is unfair - way too much work for the effort missed in section.\r\n\r\nReadings were sometimes too much (truly not doable).",

                "The course covered a wide range of topics which made it incredibly interesting as you never knew which direction a week would go. This breadth made it slightly difficult to determine the precise importance of different elements at times.",
                "Lectures were very well-done, and the slides were great--exactly what they should be. The content was probably the biggest weakness of the course. The course was very generalized and a survey of a huge span of time. Nothing was really analyzed in great detail (except maybe some of the geological concepts). It seems like this is how the course is intended to be, and the course did a good job of nailing down the few general concepts that Rankin wanted us to take away. However, I think many people find the course boring because of how generalized it is. I also would have liked to spend less time talking about geological concepts (towards beginning of course) and more time on the more modern issues like peak oil, climate change, overfishing, etc. Overall great quality of teaching. Feedback was also a problem, it would have been nice to receive our midterms back with comments, and to get more comments on our op-eds. This course could also be improved by talking more about non-white, non-male-identifying historical figures."

As a STEM major I found a new perspective of how to view science and my potential role in other areas I had not previously considered. But this class was not hard to keep up with. It seems very well suited for both STEM and non-STEM alike.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I honestly started off not liking the course because some of the topics were very dry to me (think plate tectonics, geology, etc.). The course got a lot better after that, though. The topics we learned about climate change were really important and interesting, but just keep in mind that you don't get to these topics until later in the course. Also, the workload is really manageable and exams are pretty fair as long as you pay attention in class, take good notes, and memorize the concepts from the study guide.",

This class really gives perspective on tough issues with a scientific angle, and will challenge your preconceptions of how science relates to religion, capitalism, and the state. It is also a good opportunity to take a class with Prof. Rankin (which I recommend) without having to do many hundreds of pages of reading a week for his seminars. Like most things, you'll get from this class as much as you put in to it. If you never do the readings and treat the material as a set of bullet points to memorize before an exam, you probably won't learn very much.",

                "No. I took this class because I heard that it would be a less intense humanities credit, but it didn't seem that way to me at all. I was constantly lost in all of the foreign terminology and couldn't seem to get a grasp of the lecture style at all.",
                "It's an interesting course, but not what I expected. A lot of the class doesn't talk as much about potential catastrophes themselves (although you learn the basics) but more about the debate surrounding the catastrophe. The section attendance policy is kind of weird - if you miss a section, you have to write a ~1 page paper describing what you would talk about in section. Overall, if you need the credit it's a good class but there are probably more interesting ones out there.",

                "Im not sure that I would because it wasnt what I expected going into it. Although we talked about the catastrophes that I envisioned, we also spent lots of time talking about these greater themes.

                "Yes I would it was a great class that made me learn new perspectives about the world I had not seen before.",
                "of course. relevant information and very interesting perspective",
                "mmm its very theoretical",
                "Yes, great 5th class",
                "No, because the level of difficulty is based on TA assignment (which is basically luck) not the actual course load.",
                "I would recommend this course to scientific minded students looking for a different perspective on their work.",
                "Yes if you want a survey course that makes a lot of sweeping generalizations, and want to learn about some of the prominent historical figures related to global catastrophes. The workload is extremely light compared to other courses I've taken, and the midterm and final are easy as long as you go to class. Overall Rankin is an excellent lecturer. You might find the course boring because you brush over each topic pretty fast, and it's a lot of history."
