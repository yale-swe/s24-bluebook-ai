                "I developed a relative familiarity with the larger Muslim world. But I have to warn future students, this class walks the line between vulgarization and misinformation. Multiple times, the lecturer qualified ethnic conflicts in the Muslim World as pathological and eternal struggles. The lecturer would routinely make broad claims about what history \"is\" and what it should not be, providing a narrow vision of the discipline. Her portrayal of the Iranian revolution sounded like it came from an uniformed US diplomat: She claimed the Shah was overthrown for \"modernizing\" Iran and completely forgot to mention inflation, secular strikes, and the history of communist resistance in the country. If you want to take a class about the Muslim world, stay away. I am sure the lecturer is exceptional in her subfield, but as soon as we left south east Asia, the lecture style was disorganized and at times, misinformed.",
                "I learnt a lot about the history of the Muslim community, Islamic theology, and debates surrounding both of those entities from Muhammad until today. This was a great and thorough sampler\/survey course.",
                "I learned a useful history of the Islamic World & an understanding of different perspectives on said history.",
                "I got a great overview of all of Islamic history",
                "I learned about Middle Eastern History and how to assess the evidence of other authors even when their theses are different.",
                "I developed a wider understanding of the course of Islamic history, as well as significant turning points within this history.",
                "history of islamic world",
                "This was a survey course, so it covered a LONG time period and pretty big geographic area. We spent a large portion of the semester on early Islam\/the time of the Prophet. It's very much a history course, not a religious studies course. I learned a lot about the complicated and diverse history of the Islamic world, particularly 600s-1800s.",

            "comments": [
                "More organization, more structures, more nuance, less blanket statements.",
                "This was a great sampler course, meaning we covered a lot of ground in only one semester. I would have loved to delve deeper into the topics, for example by having 75 minute lectures instead of 50 minute lectures.",
                "I thought the emphasis on intersectionality was unnecessary. A history of Islam shouldnt concern itself with that when theres so much else to discuss  maybe teach a class specifically about that.\r\n\r\nI also wouldve liked more time on the growth of Islamic Law, early Islam, & the Iranian Revolution (we spent maybe 1\/2 a class on perhaps the most important event in Islam in the past century). Stuff like Sufism would work better in a theology class.",
                "Strengths: I think the course had great opportunities for discussion in the sections. I also liked that the class was only 50 minutes. Weaknesses: The Courses films that we had to watch were on very fringe topics in Islam rather than something that would teach me about the majority of the Islamic Worlds direction (such as female imams). Obviously we could have written an argument for or against this type of reform, but I dont believe this is exactly a debate that is very big in most of the history of the Islamic World, or for Contemporary Muslims.",
                "Strengths: the professor usually explains things in an interesting way, and her slant on Islamic history is new to me because I have grown up in a Muslim family my whole life\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: while I cannot remember them off hand, there were times in which I heard factual inaccuracies. I particularly wish that the second half were more cohesive.",
                "I think, naturally, the course covers a lot of material so sometimes its hard to feel like you have a firm grasp on anything.",
                "It could be improved by being more focused and not trying to go through all Islamic history in a short period of time.",
                "This course had some interesting readings, but overall the lectures felt a bit surface-level and sometimes disorganized. I felt like both in section and in lecture we never really delved into anything deeply or in detail. I think it could be improved by going into detail more on each subject (even if this means rethinking some of the readings). For example, it feels like we barely grazed the Iranian Revolution. I think the key is having detail on the right topics -- sometimes, we would do a reading that was really niche for no reason, but other times it felt like we only covered something in broad strokes in lecture and didn't learn anything substantial.",
                "Strengths--\r\n  -covers a lot of history \r\n  -Professor Yahaya does a good job of balancing detail level with the massive time period and geographic region we covered \r\n  -really interesting subject matter \r\n  -engaging lecturer\r\n  -for the most part, doesn't assume prior knowledge of the subject (so accessible for students from a non-Muslim background)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses--\r\n -the second half of the course moved quite fast and felt a little rushed-- I wish we had more time learning about Muslim communities outside of the Middle East and Central Asia\r\n -Professor Yahaya moves fast in lecture, and sometimes the slides are jam-packed with information so it's difficult to take notes\r\n -I would have preferred a final exam with some ID questions as opposed to just two essay questions, so that students who find essay writing difficult have another way to show their knowledge from the class",
                "Strengths: Interesting topic and it covers the entire history of Islam\r\nWeakness: The course subject is too widespread to delve deeply into any one area which prevents students from leaving from this class with really anything. The instructors lectures are a bit dull. I recommend shopping the first lecture to see if you like her teaching style and presence if not, switch because it does not change",
                "The teacher and teaching fellow were fantastic. Because the course was a survey course, there was a lot of material to cover in two short lectures per week and unfortunately, it was difficult to explore and have a strong understanding of some of the important topics."

                "For anyone who has a strong interest in the Middle East and has taken any classes in the subject already, I probably wouldn't recommend it, as it is more of an introductory overview class. However, for someone who is just encountering the subject for the first time, it would be a good experience to get an overview of the history. Personally, since I have already taken other classes on the Middle East already, I felt like I didn't learn very much in the class, but it might be a different experience for someone else.",
                "Yes! Great introduction to the study of Islam, Muslim history worldwide and a good survey in history in general. Professor Yahaya is a good teacher and makes the content very accessible despite its wide scope. It is a solid history lecture.",
