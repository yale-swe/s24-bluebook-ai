                "An overview of China's historical treatment of memory and place.",
                "I developed a greater knowledge of 20th century China and the ways that history persists into the modern era via landmarks, monuments, and oral accounts. The class really offers insights into the various methods of preserving, honoring, and erasing memory as an inherently political thing. Overall, your skills for close reading and thinking critically about what constitutes the truth will improve.",

                "This course is an absolute must for any students in modern China; it is pretty much the only advanced (i.e., non-beginner) course in Chinese historical studies offered by Yale. The discussions and readings were both engaging and very interesting, and the diversity of the course (covering as it does multiple mediums of memory, like architecture, official history, photography, oral history, etc.) exposes students to a variety of perspectives and ideas. Professor Ho is also a gifted discussion leader: she lets students do most of the talking, occasionally interjecting to offer guidance and to answer questions.",
                "strengths: we have great discussions every class, and professor ho does a great job of synthesizing our reading responses\r\nweaknesses: the readings are sometimes pretty challenging and difficult",
                "Great readings, interesting topics.",
                "STRENGTHS: interesting readings, workload was not too heavy, class trip to NYC MOCA museum felt informative and fun, discussion always felt relevant and accessible, nicely organized and spaced out, unique topic from other EAS or HIST classes\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: N/A",
                "strengths: interesting discussions and readings, prof good at facilitating discussions, have good discussions with peers, awesome NYC field trip, cool primary source exposure, weaknesses: none that I can think of (for Liang Sicheng week I guess I wish we had more time to look at the primary sources and the librarians spent less time talking about research resources)",
                "I honestly think this class was extraordinarily strong, and I cant think of any weaknesses. I guess  this being the first history paper Ive ever written  it might have been nice to go over the structure of what a history paper should look like a bit more, but even then, we did still discuss that quite a bit.",
                "The assignments leading up to the final paper were very helpful and made a lot of sense. I also loved that Dr. Ho read through our reading responses each week before class and cited different people's responses to help get discussion going; I felt seen and like the conversations always were impassioned since they were based on each of our interests.",

As it stands, this course is practically the lynchpin of Chinese studies at Yale, since it acts as an intersection of historical, anthropological, cultural, and literary studies.",
                "yes absolutely! you will learn a lot about modern china. i will however say that the reason the class was so good was because of the students in the class. its good to have engaging classmates",
                "Yes! There's so many different ways that the course analyzes memory (art, monuments, performances, museums, history, etc.) that there is something for everyone.",
                "Absolutely, especially if you want to learn more about Mao-era China beyond just the political messaging/economics/Western perspective. This class really gets to the heart of the individual experience of citizens living in China during that time instead of clumping them together into a faceless suffering mass. The topic is also really interesting because there is a lot of focus on architecture and film which is not really common in a lot of history classes. There is a great selection of readings and Prof Ho is always available to share more. Overall, great class for a EAS/HIST major but also any major.",
                "Yes! This was such a fun and interesting seminar with diverse primary sources to examine. I love when seminars actually have lively discussions, and this was one of those. The professor was good at facilitating discussions (and it helps that I liked my peers).",
                "Absolutely! I adored this class. It was intellectually rigorous, but absolutely enjoyable and interesting. I think it really sets you up to think about difficult questions.",
                "If you are interested in the topics on the syllabus, you will enjoy the readings and class discussions. In all honesty the final paper just felt stressful and the class would have been better served with a few more assignments and a final paper that counted for less. A majority of our grade was based on our final paper and the scaffolding assignments leading up to it. This is a writing intensive course, but I wish perhaps there was an option not to take it as a writing intensive course; most everyone in my class studied humanities, I'm sure they would have taken the course if it weren't writing intensive as well.",
