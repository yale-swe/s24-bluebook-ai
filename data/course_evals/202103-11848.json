                "The strengths are that it covers a wide range of topics without being too overwhelming and that the peer tutors were very helpful. In terms of weaknesses, it felt like the learning environment itself was not very personalized or organized. A lot of students complained that their professors did not teach the content well, and I was having the same issue. I learned most of the content for this course through YouTube and outside resources, and learned very little information from class. I acknowledge that the professors are very knowledgeable in their fields, but this doesn't necessarily guarantee that they will be able to teach basic calculus to students who struggle to grasp the information in the first place. I just feel like the course could have been improved significantly if the professors were better at the actual teaching component.",
                "If you keep up with the lectures, it is a very easy class to do well in. However, because of the simplicity of the material, it is difficult to remain motivated as classes are not all that interesting. The PSETS are also significantly more difficult than both the midterms/finals and the Ximera homework- but attending office hours is an easy fix for this.\r\nFor what it is, the course is well designed.",
                "Good curriculum, but weird way of doing psets",
                "Lectures were very bland, hard to stay engaged and learn the material. Office hours and peer tutors for the course were excellent.",
                "The course is taught in sections by teaching fellows. Obviously the teaching fellows are very smart, but they struggle to teach the material effectively to a group of undergrads. The grading in this course is also very harsh. It seems as though the graders actively look for anything to take points off for, which is very frustrating. However, going to peer tutors for the psets, and before exams was very helpful.",
                "This course will be difficult and stressful if you aren't super interested in math. Some of the concepts were very difficult for me to understand in class, and I felt that a lot of the problems from class were overcomplicated and hard to learn from. While the teachers and tutors are nice and helpful, the way the class was taught wasn't suited for me.",
                "The weaknesses of this course are due to how inequitable it is entirely. For FGLI students like me who came from high schools that taught math in an extremely different manner this course is simply impossible to succeed in and puts students like me in extremely unhealthy situations that make us consider forgoing STEM overall since this class is a prerequisite for many majors.",
                "It should be more engaging. The classes can be somewhat boring which can cause students to lose focus.",
                "I think the strengths are the ximera videos because that is where I learned most of the topics and the weaknesses were the lectures in class. There were not a lot of example problems done so a topic would be introduced and then students were just supposed to be able to do problems after that in class.",
                "This course was well-organized, with the units, topics, problem sets, Ximera, and practice tests clearly categorized on Canvas. Moreover, another striking aspect of this course was the tremendous amount of support available --- professors, peer tutors, and teaching fellows were always available to assist with homework and help clarify our understanding of topics we had trouble with. However, a weakness of this course was that the grading on the exams and problem sets were sometimes unfair and inconsistent."

                "I would recommend this course to another student. But, I would choose my section carefully. Some section teachers are amazing and some are not. If possible, always try to get into the section with the head professor. Although the material is relatively easy, beware of the midterms and finals. They are excessively hard and the scale does not help. Even though this course is meant for students who have little to no calculus knowledge, most students in my section took up to AP calculus BC so the scale is unfair to students who are learning calculus for the first time. If you want an A in the class, you need to know calculus before walking into the class.",

                "Most likely, this course is a required class for you, but in general, it is a complex math class. There are easier qr guts to go for, but in terms of class requirements, I think it is an interesting course. Most of the exam is built up on the fundamental understanding of derivatives, which is much easier said than understood. TA office hours were extremely helpful, and I went all the time, which by the time of the final, I had gained a very good basis. You will not gain an understanding of these concepts in the last two weeks, but if you set aside an hour every once in a while to ask questions to your TA, you will do fine. Peer tutor office hours were also extremely helpful.",
                "I would only recommend it to another student if they are able to make a smart decision about which professor they put themselves with. In terms of content itself, I would recommend this course. The main thing that \"makes or breaks\" the course is who is teaching it, and if the student can find a professor who has a teaching style that works for them, then I would recommend it.",

                "This class made me tell other FGLI current high school students that Ivy league schools are willing to let students of color/poor students in, but once youre in they will let you do bad in the courses, in fact Ive told that them these schools will let you fail unless you dedicate an unhealthy amount of your well-being to trying to stay afloat. I have also told them that these classes are where you will realize everything that you did not have as a FGLI student. I would like to specify that I am a referring to FGLI students who attended regular schools, not highly specialized and academically challenging ones.",
                "I would recommend this course to people that like math or need a math class for their major but if math is not your favorite subject and you're just taking the class for a QR credit I would find an easier math class to take.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, because it lays down a strong solid foundation on differential and integral calculus. This is important especially if the student hopes to take higher level math classes."
