We learned how to prepare squashes of stained plant slices to view cells in mitosis, how to prepare genetic crosses of yeast in complementation tests and how to analyze them, and how to identify and breed fruit flies to explore inheritance patterns of genes. Each topic we covered was in depth and allowed us to fully experience the methodologies of each approach. I also was able to sustain and tighten my scientific analysis skills."

                "This course was extremely well-organized. The lab handouts were extremely helpful and thorough. However, I do wish that we received more feedback on our lab reports.",
                "Professor Hartman was the biggest strength of this course! The course was extremely well-designed, and the labs were engaging and fun. Professor Hartman's lectures/debriefs at the beginning of each lab were very helpful, and the TFs and Professor Hartman were great to learn from during the actual experiments.",
                "The strengths are in its instructor. Professor Hartman is an absolutely amazing instructor!! She is so kind and helpful, and genuinely interested in helping us learn. She puts so much effort into the lab handouts and course videos.",
                "The lab reports took a really long time and sometimes the information was disorganized. But very manageable pre-med require my bio lab and definitely recommend since Prof Hartman is awesome.",
                "I deeply enjoyed this course. I feel as if it covered a tremendous spread of genetics concepts in a very short period of time, and I feel like I was able to learn  the scientific process in each experiment at a reasonable pace. I think it did an excellent job at exemplifying various concepts we learned in lecture that were difficult to grasp without having the practical examples from lab experiments.\r\nAnother thing I really appreciate about this course was that it did not penalize mistakes in the experiments the way other classes do. In some labs like general chemistry, they say that if you make a mistake, address it by explaining what happened, what was the effect, and how to improve, but regardless dock points for having the wrong answer (which was particularly frustrating at times when a single student spoiled the experiment for everyone and everyone lost points). In this class this was not the case: if you made a mistake, or if data did not align with the initial class hypothesis, you were encouraged to explore and explain what happened. Additionally, in general, the professor would average all the class datasets together so that the result we report could be robust against slight errors from individual experiments, which I think is a very reasonable policy that should be encouraged across all lab classes.\r\n\r\nOne minor weakness of the course was that, since there was so much, at times it seemed that some topics were a bit squeezed, and during those periods I required further thought and time to understand what the concept was. Towards the end, due to complications with scheduling, various illnesses going around, and other things, some topics had to be dropped. The professor did an excellent job of making sure we learned the concepts of those topics even if we could not do the experiments, but indeed it still felt a bit rushed. Maybe condensing a couple labs a bit could make this better.\r\n\r\nBut overall, this was an excellent class and I would recommend it to others."

You will learn about a lot of foundational genetics lab techniques and work with model organisms that you hear about in lecture courses. Professor Hartman is also incredibly passionate, engaging, and understanding. This has been the best laboratory course I've taken at Yale!!",
                "Yes! Although the weeks that a lab report was due would require a lot of work to write them up, the TAs were pretty generous in grading and the lab report content itself Professor Hartman helped us with understanding.",
                "Its a lab course that isnt too heavy in terms of content and workload outside of class so Id recommend it for anyone who wants to apply genetics techniques or needs to take a lab.",
                "I definitely would recommend this class. The professor does a great job at explaining the \"what\" and the \"why\" of the experiments we do, and has a very rational policy for lab reports: all class data is averaged so that, even if a couple people make mistakes, everyone can have access to a collective dataset that represents the general result observed. However, students are still encouraged to examine and explain cases when the experiment did not work out as expected to promote critical thinking in the scientific process. This is in my opinion a very fair and rational policy that should be applied across all Yale's lab classes since, in many of them, the policy is that if you make a slight mistake, you lose points for \"the wrong answer\" which discourages critical thinking and scientific reasoning. Even wrong answers can be useful in science as they allow us to think about what should be done differently or what hypotheses should change.\r\nAdditionally, the topics in this class are really cool, and anyone who enjoys genetics would get a kick out of this class. I recommend it"
