                "Strengths: The passages we read were interesting and gave a range of the history of Rome and Roman authors\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the daily translations were a little monotonous and it was easy to just do them for the credit, but not actually understand/critically think about the text we were reading",
                "Strength: The translations were fun. Cicero in particular was a lot of fun to work with. The translations were also helpful in allowing us to understand various grammatical constructions better.",
                "Gave me a solid foundation in translating Latin prose. Classes can be a little repetitive because of the frequency of translation.",
                "Anna was a great instructor  she made the class very accessible to different backgrounds of introductory Latin, gave good feedback, and was very communicative over email. You definitely have to put time into the course (the translations due every class period MWF can take a while + studying for the quizzes/exams \r\n+ doing the take-home assignments) but it's very fair overall. I also enjoyed how the course covered the historical context of the works we read and had some Roman history and culture lessons. The final project (picking a Latin passage, translating it, and writing a commentary) was also fun to complete. No weaknesses."
