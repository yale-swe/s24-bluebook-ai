                "The \"flipped classroom\" approach, where we watched grammar videos at home then practiced in class, was highly effective. This allowed us to maximize the time we spent speaking in Japanese. The class was highly engaging, with pop culture references sprinkled into the daily slide deck. Every day there was a new fun activity to practice that day's conceptsmy most memorable moment was when we did \"speed dating\" to practice the volitional form (i.e., asking someone out)!\r\n\r\nThe online exchange with Japanese college students was super helpful in being exposed to real-life language. I found myself able to use structures and vocab we had learned in class with them.\r\n\r\nWe get lots of clear feedback on every homework assignment, and sensei is often up at midnight grading homeworks. It isn't hard to get an A on quizzes and tests. The most important part of the class is the conversation practice with the people you sit next to.\r\n\r\nI do question the effectiveness of the final project. We were to plan a trip to Japan and present about it in Japanesebut very little of the work involved actual language skills.",
                "Strengths: Nishimura-sensei is a fantastic and hard-working instructor who wants you to enjoy and succeed in learning Japanese. She gives clear feedback very quickly. The class environment felt like a fun, non-judgemental place to practice Japanese. The textbook and workbooks are very well synchronized and organized. The tests are very fair and never surprising.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: You meet every day, have homework every day, and must prepare for tomorrow's class every day.",

                "Japanese class with Nishimura-sensei is the most fun I've ever had learning a language. PLEASE take this class, and try to get into Nishimura's section if possible. You'll be surprised by how much you learn in a semester.\r\n\r\nThe homework barely feels like work, since the textbook (\"Tobira\") is so focused on modern Japanese culture. If you want to see Hatsune Miku in your textbook, this is the class to take :)",
                "Yes. If you have any interest in studying Japanese, this course is a great place to start. I cannot recommend enough taking this class with Nishimura-sensei specifically. She is an amazing teacher. Please be aware of the workload, however. You will need to carve out space everyday for Japanese. It took me about two hours each weekday to complete all the necessary homework and preparations.",
