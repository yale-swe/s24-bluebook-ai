                "This class is like a crash course in all things Black Art. We read Toni Morrison, Greg Tate, Daniel Smith, Wesley Morris, Baldwin and so many more. I developed my fluidity in writing about music, rather than just about other writing. This course helped give me the tools to write about the significance of Black Art to Black culture. We placed prominent Black publications and works in their various historical contexts and also discussed some more contemporary artists and their impacts on American culture as a whole.",
                "I immersed myself with the greatest critics of Black art and familiarized myself with the themes and traditions held within Black art throughout the 20th century. The books we read helped me understand the position of Black art within mainstream culture and I learned about different sources of Black criticism, which I hope to engage with further as a Black artist.",
                "Omg you learn a lot and you read a lot too! I didnt know a think about art criticism but I feel like Ive learned so much now!",
                "This course taught me not only what goes into writing and engaging with arts criticism, but also why Black art as well as Black cultural critics matter for the world as a whole.",
                "I learned how to critically engage with cultural products and the innovators behind them. I also gained incredibly valuable exposure to Black feminist criticism, sound, and world making projects. One of the most generative themes I took away was how Black sound serves as a repository of the soulish strivings of Black Americans, and how musicians work diligently as historians, sonorous performers, and creative geniuses.",
                "I gained so much insight about black cultural history, even outside of the arts. I am so grateful to have been in this class!"

                "It's quite a bit of reading, which is fine if you manage your time well. Professor Brooks is really enthusiastic about the material, and it's hard not join her in that passion. The reading list is absolutely awesome. I do wish we had gotten the midterm and final assignments a little sooner, especially since the syllabus was changed several times throughout the semester. I loved the opportunity to present for one week of readings, because I think it gave students a chance to highlight what was especially interesting to us. For a seminar, the class size was really large which made it hard for everyone to participate at times.",
                "Very strong in the discussion, guest lectures, syllabus, and presentations. There is a lot of reading, however, and I think cutting some of the readings would be helpful with a Yale courseload.",
                "This course was extremely engaging and opened my eyes to so much regarding how Black art is perceived in the world. The one weakness is that there was a lot of reading, so I feel like I couldn't properly engage with it all.",
                "Strengths: Im not even sure where to start. The reading material was amazing and thoughtfully curated. I loved how we were able to perform arts criticism on the blues, jazz, soul, and hip hop, all the while backing our analysis with scholarly insight. I also greatly appreciated having living Black arts critics come to class and share with us their experiences (this was was such a special opportunity). My peers were another strength. Everyone was deeply engaged with the material and with each other, and it felt like we all showed up for one another every class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I dont have anything to add. This was one of the best courses Ive taken at Yale.",
                "Prof. Brooks was always so enthusiastic and deeply engaged and this always made classes all the more exciting. I honestly don't have any any critiques outside of it was too short a class and I wish we had more time to delve deeper into all of the material."

                "Yes!! Such a privilege to take this course with Professor Brooks. The way she curated the readings and speakers for this course painted such a rich history of music in the U.S., crucially through the lens of Black history. Her passion and excitement to teach us made the class so engaging and I loved being around a cohort of students with varying backgrounds in theatre, music, afam studies, history, etc. They all brought such interesting perspectives to class discussion.",
                "The material we read in this class is absolutely worth the workload. It was all of the things I would read on my own time as part of a syllabus. That being said, it's a lot of reading every week and in order to engage with class discussion you do have to do all of the reading. It's a great opportunity to bring in and write about the cultural artifacts and people who matter to you, and there's a lot of creativity involved in all of the writing you do for this course.",
                "Absolutely. A must-take as an artist or a connoisseur of Black music and culture.",
                "Definitely. Never before have I seen such deference and appreciation for Black art, and the discussions were nothing short of transformative and eye-opening every week. Just prepared to do a lot of reading and prepare original thoughts, comments, and critiques.",
                "Yes. This is a must take course for anyone who wants to develop their skills as a writer/critic or wants to learn more about how Black artists continue to reflect and critique the modern world.",
                "I would highly highly recommend this course to anyone interested in art and African American culture or just anyone interested in taking a truly amazing class here."
