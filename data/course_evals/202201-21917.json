The class discussions are very well-guided and always inspires me to look at the texts in a different way.",

For example, on canvas, providing a file or something in the syllabus that includes definitions of literary devices used in poetry. Or, summaries of each unit and explaining the background of each period or type of poetry, like romanticism.",

It was a little challenging to start with the \"Classics\" (the ancient nature poetry) which was often characteristically dense. That said, it did provide a strong framework for our future discussionsand once we reached the Romantics, the readings felt both engaging and brilliantly selected.",
