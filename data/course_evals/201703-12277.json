    "Spanish speaking ability improved, as it will with constant practice.",
    "I strengthened my Spanish vocabulary and grammar skills.",
    "I can't believe how much spanish I learned just in one semester. I also gained new insights into the cultures of spanish-speaking countries through the literature we read and the class presentations.",
    "Obviously, I improved my command of written and spoken Spanish. Also, there was a lot of cultural emphasis which I very much enjoyed.",
    "I feel like my Spanish skills stagnated in this class. It's an overview of most high school Spanish topics with exception to the very last few weeks of the course. I think my speaking ability improved but besides that I stayed the same.",
    "basic grammar, vocabulary, general cultural understanding of a few spanish speaking countries.",
    "I learned much more of the Spanish language as well as various Spanish cultures.",
    "I learned grammar skills and a decent amount of vocabulary."

   "comments": [
    "One strength is that the activities for each day are organized well in advance so students know what to expect. One weakness is that it some material on exams seemed to expect prior Spanish knowledge that I did not have. Another weakness is that the materials for this course were very expensive.",
    "The online hw assignments are a good way of keeping up engagement. I thought that the course packet had an excellent diversity of assignments and helpful resources. I'm not particularly a fan of the grading scheme, however. It's very frustrating to work diligently in daily class, doing homework every single night for that to only represent a small portion of your grade.",
    "Strengths: small class size\r\nWeaknesses: the room our class was in did not facilitate group discussions and it was slightly disorganized. The class went too fast for me to actually learn the material and went too quickly.",
    "This class was very organized, which made it easy to follow. I wish we did some of the fun readings like The secret of daniel torres or 'al otro lado' in between two chapters rather than at the end. This way, we could be going through the grammar in the final weeks of the class.",
    "The course was well-organized, which was really helpful for a class with so many different assignments. However, while the Supersite provided some great examples, there was no way to find an explanation for any of the answers, and often these exercises were too easy for the level of understanding that we were expected to have. Also, we often spent a lot of time correcting answers or doing conversational exercises, which were great, but we often would not talk about a lot of the grammar that we were expected to know on the exams.",
    "It is well organized to keep students constantly practicing without overworking them. It could be improved by adding more listening and speaking exercises, however."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. The workload is not too much at all, just a few activities every day and a little studying. Spanish definitely improved.",
    "Yes, if the student wants to increase their Spanish grammar skills and vocabulary.",
    "Be prepared to put a lot of work into this class. But it is definitely worth it. There will be a steep learning curve if you placed into L2\/ didn't take SPAN 110 before this class.",
    "Yes. Stimulating and engaging. Going to class every day never felt burdensome. In fact I looked forward to it.",
    "You have to take it, unfortunately.",
    "Yes, if they would like to learn beginner spanish.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as I really learned a lot.",
    "I would take this class, whether you're learning Spanish for the first time, or if you've already taken some but don't remember the grammar rules very well. I had taken two AP Spanish classes in high school, didn't take Spanish freshman year (and therefore got worse), and then still felt like I was learning when I took L2 as a sophomore."
