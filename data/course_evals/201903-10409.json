    "Great course for learning how to think about spaces, philosophy on space as well as contemporary art creation and curation",
    "Taking different perspectives on art, my mind was blown a lot",
    "I learned so much in this course. So much of the readings and class discussions was so far out from what I have usually studied, and it was really refreshing to get a new perspective like that.",
    "As a person with little background in art, this course helped introduce me to a wide array of artists that produce fascinating work. I was pushed to create art myself, some of it was bad and some of it was good but I was always grateful that the projects made me think a different way.",
    "I have literally no idea. I guess, space...?"

    "The course is really relaxed and the subject matter is so interesting. The artists definitely go beyond a surface level of art knowledge. No weaknesses because grading is fair, Markus is great and accommodating, and the assignments are never too much!",
    "There were great people in my class and lively discussion. The vibe is very informal and casual which is a nice change. We cover a breadth of topics and do a lot of interesting readings."

    "Yes",
    "Yes, it is a really fun course",
    "Yes, absolutely. I loved every single day in class, thought the readings and discussions were super engaging. This class isnt like anything Ive taken and it was an incredible experience.",
    "Yes take this course! I'm not an artist but I found the subject matter and workload very easy to handle. Markus is also an AMAZING professor who is friendly, understanding, funny, and flexible. My only piece of advise is make sure you have enough time to get to the class because it can be a hike!",
    "Its a fun course where you do a few art projects and some interesting readings. There is very little work and I appreciate the informal vibe. You will spend all semester trying to explain what this class is about and even till the last day you will not be able to."
