                "This class is not for the faint of heart but Lin Zhong is a great professor. The workload is quite intense.",
                "Ive been waiting all semester to write this review because I just want to tell all of Yale CS about this class. This is the first time that Lin Zhong has taught this class in this version as he significantly stepped up the difficulty from last year. This class continuously blew my mind and pushed my understanding of what is possible in programming. If you are serious about getting a lot out of a class and want to become multiple times better at programming, keep reading! The lectures and readings are primarily about human psychology, history of computers, and good design practices, which are chill. The PSETs are only partially related to lectures but is where the meat of the course lies (grade comes 100% from 8 PSETs). The class focuses on Rust programming in the User Space and Kernel Space. Rust for Linux literally got supported a year ago so this is probably one of the only classes in the country doing this stuff. I thought PSET 4 (introduction to Kernel programming in Rust) was the hardest programming problem set Ive ever done until PSET 6 came around (Using v4l2 system calls and implementing image conversion in User Space) and then PSET 7 was absolutely monstrous and even harder (Rust kernel programming for image polling, image conversion, and networking). Every PSET from PSET 3 on took between 15-30 hours and keep in mind we only had 1 to 1.5 weeks per assignment (with a total of 8 late days that can be used at any point). I worked FULL TIME on this class when doing assignments, putting aside other classes for days to get it done. THIS CLASS MAKES CS 323 LOOK LIKE A GUT and Prof Zhong regularly jokes about this.  PSET 7 was so intensive nobody submitted on time (and we didnt get a deadline extension) and some students (grad including) I knew just gave up. I never went to office hours for 323 but I was camped out at office hours for this class every chance I got. The difference between 323 and this class is that 323 is way more guided. For an assignment of similar length in terms of lines of code, 323 may give you 10 pages of spec. For this class, only a page or two. This means that its really easy to get blocked, be confused, and need help, but it also means that you become much more independent. I wrote every line of code in this class and felt like I owned everything that I did. When I encountered issues, we had to figure them out using Google, Ed, or Office Hours. We had to do everything ourselves such as setting up virtual machines  and camera devices. We got freedom with our implementations as long as we could justify everything. These are all skills useful for SWE and thus I feel like a better SWE after this class. This class was such a grind but at the end of the day, I am so glad I took it. The stuff we do in this class is so cool and experimental that stuff like it would probably never be in production because of how dangerous kernel programming is right now (one faulty piece of a code and your OS goes down) or the fact how the last PSET we did was splitting a Tensorflow Lite Model in half, which everyone else on the internet advises against even trying. Also Prof Zhong is such a gem, is such an important figure in the department, has lots of funny and wise stuff to say about CS and life, and goes out of his way to meet students 1-on-1 twice a semester. If you can afford to dedicate the time to this class, do embark!",
                "Probably not, unless you want to spend A LOT of time programming\/debugging. The problem sets in this course (the bulk of the work) are interesting, but I felt like I spent 90% of my time on generic programming and debugging rather than thinking about systems design (the unique part of this course). You have to spend a lot of time digging through esoteric libraries and documentation. If you're into that, great, but if you just want to spend a fifth of your time learning about systems design, stay away because this course will consume a very large part of your schedule.",
                "Yes. However make sure you have a decent amount of time to work on the assignments. Thankfully the late-hour policy is generous enough to offset the difficulty a bit and make it managable.",
                "I would recommend this course to any serious systems researcher or programmer. The information and lessons learned in this course is extremely valuable in my opinion."
