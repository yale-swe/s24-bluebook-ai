It would be helpful to dedicate a day (and indicate this on the syllabus) to pull out soft-tissue specimens so that students may prepare for this ahead of time.",

Dr. Sargis gives you every chance to succeed here as long as you prepare for class (make a quizlet using the study guide and study it everyday for a half and hour) and go to lab sessions. Exams and quizzes are clearly outlined and cover what is exactly on the study guide. Again, as long as you go to class and study, you should have no problem as its just memorization."

This class is pretty difficult to get into (the whole class is basically seniors who are pre-med or occasional archaeology/anthropology majors) so you should really be sure its something you are both interested in and is useful to you later on.",
                "Yes! Dr. Sargis does a great job at keeping the content interesting, and he's very lenient on what you do during the lab sections of the course. He helps out anybody who needs it and will check in to see if you're doing alright in the class.",
