I gained a profound understanding of how environmental justice and issues of environmental burden manifest in South Asia as well as how to engage in anthropological discussions and research. I felt like I really grew in confidence to engage in discussion on a topic that was entirely new to me! I also improved my reading comprehension skills under a time constraint.",
                "The scores helped me develop critical reading, skills and summarizing themes of books. It was interesting, and I learned more about environmental issues in other countries.",
                "I learned how to think critically about what constitutes environmental injustices and how they're situated within the histories and geographies of modern South Asia.",
                "I gained a strong knowledge of various environmental issues in South Asia, along with a strong framework and perspective with which to evaluate them + their implications",
                "This course really developed my skills in thinking about issues holistically. Regarding environmental justice, the issues are deeply intertwined and complex. Though intimating, this class led many productive discussion on how it to approach and understand the problems from multiple perspectives.",
                "Completely shifted my perspective on environmental justice, to include different populations and species in the discussion as well.",
                "De-Westernized my view of environmental justice, taught me about key issues happening in South Asia and about power dynamics that exist within each country and between in some cases",

                "This course made me understand the dynamics of environmentalism (and all its different forms and interactions and tensions) within South Asia, which has changed my understanding of environmentalism in general and in my own life.  Truly a transformative class, and I will carry the ideas we explored through the rest of my Yale experience and the rest of my life.  We explored questions such as:\r\nHow can conservation be detrimental, and how do we prioritize different animals and humans?\r\nHow does environmentalism differ among the rich and the poor?  Those of high and low caste?  The urban and the rural?\r\nHow has colonialism created many of the environmental issues we see in South Asia today, like the agrarian crisis?\r\nI also gained valuable research skills.  As a first year taking this class, I was not prepared to write a 3,500 research paper, and didn't know where to start.  I learned that there are valuable resource people for the class to email about sources and topics, and that was very helpful.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: weekly readings were often fairly interesting and nuanced, Professor Shivi and Lav (the TA) were very supportive and often provided snacks and coffee for each class, not a huge amount of regular assignments; Weaknesses: not always a lot of time for in-class discussion when large amounts of reading were assigned",
                "The strengths of this course include the engaging material, discussion post structure, and incredibly encouraging and welcoming environment. The weakness of this course is the amount of reading which we were unable to discuss in full during each session.",
                "The strength of the chorus are the quality of the materials that the red and the discussions that we had as a class. I would like to have seen some more variation in the types of assignments that we had instead of having the same weekly writing assignment",
                "strengths: the professor puts together a wide-ranging reading list to expose students to diverse locations and issues but the linkages are evident and there are notable thematic through lines\r\nweaknesses: it was sometimes difficult to engage during the discussions because the class size was quite large; small discussion group opportunities could help",
                "Shivi and Lav were both fantastic, they really cared about our learning and did everything they could to make sure we were engaging in the work. The structure of the class assignments and Shivis incorporation of our discussion posts ensured that everyone did the readings and participated in discussion. I really cant think of many ways in which the course can be improved.",
                "Shivi and Lav are two of the best people I could have learned from in this class. I've never had a class make me feel so seen and acknowledged. They were so helpful in providing support for assignments and they made the effort to get to know everyone. Hands down one of my favorite classes not just for the subject but for the people teaching it.",
                "Strengths: VERY well organized, interesting topics that built on each other per week, great professor and TA, great discussion\r\nWeaknesses: presentations at end were rushed but no way of avoiding this with such a large seminar!",
                "Strength: you learn a lot from the readings and discussions, I liked hearing from everyone during class (very discussion based)\r\nWeakness: not too much speaking time since it was a class of 25 people",
                "The strengths were the professor's engagement during their lectures. This seminar would be greatly improved if we had a discussion section at the start or end of the week to discuss the readings. The amount of readings given was very heavy, it would be useful if there were key questions on each reading for students to focus on.",
                "Strengths: great readings with a lot of nuance, transformative ideas, great discussion every class because everyone was very engaged.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- lack of grades other than midterm and final essay.  The final was worth 50% of the class grade, and discussion posts and participation should really count more because that's the bulk of our class up until the last two weeks.  This made me stress out a lot over the final.\r\n- Work assigned during last two weeks. As we work on our final papers and prepare for presentations on our papers in class, we were still expected to do 150 pages of reading and do discussion posts.  I barely did the readings and was not very engaged - it would be better to either assign much less or not at all.  We also didn't even get to discuss them in class because classtime was allotted for presentations.",
                "The class material is very interesting but class time itself can get a little boring so maybe it would help to have a structure that enables more interactive participation.",
                "Strengths: Discussions were very well-structured. First, the discussant/respondents set up themes and interesting questions for the rest of us to consider. Professor Sivaramakrishnan and Lav (our TF) did a fantastic job directing the broader class discussion. They read through all of our discussion posts ahead of class and prompted us to speak when the current topic of conversation connected to what we had written about in our discussion post. The readings were also a great strength, as they were very interesting and engaging. Finally, Lav and Professor Sivaramakrishnan are both kind, generous with their time, and very knowledgeable about the subjects of the course. We also received detailed feedback on our essays. \r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The weekly discussion posts really push students to engage with the readings. Perhaps slightly fewer pages assigned, or guidance on which sections to prioritize, would make for more thorough understanding of the texts in future?\r\n\r\nIt was helpful to have a teaching fellow in a course this size."

                "Not sure. The weekly readings are quite interesting and cover topics and issues I would not have thought of otherwise. However, sometimes there is not much time for in-class discussion since there are many components to class (lecture, student presentations, and then discussion). Since the readings for each week are a bit lengthy, sometimes I left class feeling a little dissatisfied having spent so much time outside of class reading and developing thoughts but not fully exploring them.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It was a wonderful experience and one of my favorite courses at Yale! Every week I found myself enthralled with the material and was consistently thinking and talking about it away from the class itself. Such an inclusive and encouraging environment where I learned and grew so much!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it was interesting, and professor Shivi is very knowledgeable on the subject.",
                "Yes, this course is really interesting and Shivi is a great lecturer. Be prepared to have a sizeable reading load.",
                "Yes! This course is a good bit of work, but it is definitely worth it, whether you know anything about the class topic or not. Even more than a set of case studies, the class provides a strong framework with which to think about climate change, class, and many other issues in the world.",
                "Yes absolutely",
                "Absolutely! Even if you're not EVST.",

                "Yes!!",
                "Yes, definitely.  Obviously, those interested in environmental justice and South Asia should take the class.  But beyond that, anyone who has any interest in social movements and civil rights should take it (because environmental justice is social justice).  It truly makes you think differently about the multifaceted nature of movements and environmentalisms.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in the subject material but know that you really have to put in a lot of time to really enjoy and get the most out of the class.",
                "Yes, I would! As someone coming to this class from an American perspective, I learned so much new information about South Asia's environment and society, and it was exciting to find connections and patterns in issues of environmental injustice between my context and South Asia's. The class discussions were always very interesting and engaging. I also enjoyed the final project presentations, because I was able to learn about my classmates' research.",
                "Yes Professor Shivi is very caring and knowledgeable, and his syllabus is really interesting and covers a lot of ground. Also the format (short instructor lecture, short student presentation, then discussion) is excellent."
