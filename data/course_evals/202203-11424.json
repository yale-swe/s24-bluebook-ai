I wish we discussed them more and learned more applicable skills like filmmaking and storytelling techniques and got some time in class to practice them. I also wished the class was shorter. It was difficult to maintain focus and energy over four hours.",
                "There could be more guidance around week to week assignments. They were mostly open-ended, and as an introductory class, it often left me confused on what the expectations were.  They could work more on teaching camera, lighting, and editing skills before we went out and created our own stuff because then we were getting critiqued about aspects that had never been learned. However, the instructor chose good guest speakers, weekly readings, and weekly films. The QCQs seemed to be more busy work as we often didnt get feedback. The class was a very open environment and collaborative with great feedback from peers and instructors on our screenings."
