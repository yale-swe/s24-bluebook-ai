We read four plays, every single of which I thoroughly enjoyed. Although I am skeptical of some adaptations, most of them are well-taught and makes me think about Shakespeare in a different light.",

I learned a lot about some of Shakespeare's most popular plays, and the modern adaptations.",
                "How to read Shakespeare as a timeless work and the specific ways that many of his plays still apply in the modern day. Recommended for anyone with an interest in Shakespeare, is in my opinion the one course about the classics that is still absolutely necessary.",

For a course that focuses on close readings, I felt like I got more confused about how to analyze texts as the semester went on. A lot of my learning from this course came from additional readings that my TA and Prof. Ramachandran recommended as I wrote my papers.",

In comparing multiple adaptations of Shakespeare across many mediums, the class helped strengthen writing skills and skills in formulating analysis.\r\n\r\nThere was a nice background in history, specifically the colonial history of Shakespeare and the usage of works as vehicles of colonization in the British Empire. Prof. Ramachandran really just knows her shit on a different level for context on Shakespeare's works and helped connect the text of the works and adaptations to the historical context extremely well."

                "Strengths: the professor is very understanding, material is interesting, we use Discord to share our thoughts on readings which turned out to be great.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish that the professor and TA talk more about the text rather than spending much of the lectures/sections touching on background information and critical reception",
                "amazing syllabus with rich works, all sorts of different adaptations. a class to become cultured not just in Shakespeare but in global film, texts. Professor is fantastic. one of the best courses i've taken at yale. weakness is that short assignments and even the modified Discord prompts can feel like a chore.",
                "Strengths: Professor Ramachandran gives a ton of options when it comes to assignments, some of which are creative and really allow students a break from the grind of straight critical analysis. Prof is also very chill. Huge plus.",
                "I thought this class was an incredible opportunity to engage in well-known texts in a different and critical way. While I struggled with the reading loud (as a non-English major), I really enjoyed what we read, and the pacing of the course made everything very doable.",
                "This class was so informative and engaging! It was really interesting and I learned a lot. I would say the pace is a little quick, but that may have been more due to the covid-impacted schedule of the semester than anything else.",
                "Loved how the discord group added to afterclass engagement. Felt like the general weaknesses were due more to the unfortunate covid situation than the course design itself.",
                "very interesting material, though it is very easy to get lost and lose focus from topics of race and gender",
                "I think that the content and lectures were really helpful and insightful. My discussion section was also very good, I think that being able to flesh out ideas more thoroughly helped me think of better easy topics as well as different ways to look at Shakespeares work and their adaptations. \r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, I think that the discussion sections were a bit short so I could not fully develop some ideas.",
                "Strengths: The content was pretty interesting, and analyzing different forms from novels to movies kept me pretty engaged through the term. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While I felt like Prof. Ramachandran and the TAs were understanding and their words certainly reflected their kindness, the many assignments of the course made the semester very difficult. The workload was a lot more than I anticipated. I put in a lot of effort into my papers and small assignments, and as the semester went on, I dont think it got much better. We all became more exhausted, and we did get multiple options to replace our final paper. But I dont think that helped much. All the work and grades and assignment just really stressed me out a lot over the semester.",
                "This course has a really great syllabus, and the lectures are incredible. I honestly can't think of a way to improve it.",
                "Professor Ramachandran is an excellent lecturer and professor all around. Her lectures are extremely engaging and she was extremely receptive and helpful in office hours.",
                "This course is extremely strong in its connection between the original text of Shakespeare and the adaptations of his works, and more importantly, asking and answering the questions of why Shakespearean works are so frequently chosen as the basis for adaptation. The class delved heavily into understanding the canonical nature of Shakespeare and provided really interesting analyses of the works with focused passage readings and incredible lectures with lots of detail. The professor was so spot on and her care for students shone through. The themes addressed in the class of race, religion and gender were very topical but not approached in a very trite way. The analysis was nuanced and provided many different angles of interpretation to the larger questions in the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses were few and far between but a major one for me was the course's lack of close reading of Shakespeare's works. While the course did largely focus on adaptation, I felt as though there could've been more analysis of the original text. When we did close reading, it was very helpful and informed the adaptations and the plot of the Shakespearean plays but I felt there could've been more analysis."

                "I am glad that the lectures were live, because otherwise I might not have had the motivation to watch them (simply because watching recorded lectures is draining.) I think that my experience would have been better if my section had started at a later time in the day, because I wasn't in Eastern Time and I often woke up five minutes before section began.",

The course material is diverse and the topics in the course are very engaging with different lenses being adopted when looking at original Shakespeare plays and their adaptations. The class forces introspection on the nature of the traditional Western canon and our own relationship with such works.
