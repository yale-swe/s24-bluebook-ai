                "Prof Van Doren did a great job showing how to create shadows and color, and gave us the liberty to develop our own style while teaching us new techniques from past watercolorists.",
                "This course helped me develop a sincere appreciation for watercolor as not just an artistic medium, but a philosophical, academic, and historical treasure. I have become more insightful while analyzing art, especially in regard to technique and style. The knowledge I have gained of watercolor's defining artists has inspired me to continue practicing and studying this grand art form.",
                "I learned much about watercolor history from the early times to modern.",
                "I improved my writing of art-related papers as well as my concentration and creativity skills in relation to painting.",
                "I strengthened my writing skills along with learning how to paint in a new medium (watercolor) and the techniques that go along with it."

                "The workload was very manageable while keeping us engaged every week. The essays were fun prompts, and the time devoted to assisted painting was helpful.",
                "This course instilled a strong sense of independence and creative freedom in me, as constructive artistic learning environments should. It is very engaging, but not overwhelming. In-class lessons could be a bit more engaging when discussing past artists and critiquing students' work. The time spent painting during class could also tend to be a bit restrictive when the professor corrects students by drawing\/painting on the student's work himself. However, it is overall a productive, encouraging environment that makes watercolor painting very enthralling. The professor finds wonderful constructive points of criticism to keep the process alive.",
                "I feel that the course could involve more interaction and outside class activities. The lecture style didnt help my attention span.",
                "I loved the small size of the course, becase it made it an intimate setting that facilitated the bonding between peers. It was also helpful to see others' work in order to improve my own and get new ideas and inspiration for new approaches.",
                "There were no weaknesses! I loved this course. I think a strength was how much exposure we had to other artists work (through critiques in class, slideshows, and our wonderful field trips to Yales museums). It helped me to improve in seeing all the possibilities of what could be done."

                "Definitely take this course if you can. I looked forward to this class every week and it's nice being able to paint any subject you want for a class.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. While I had background experience and interest in the watercolor art form, it is a wonderful experience for students of any interest. It welcomes artists of all backgrounds to explore this flexible medium and encourages them to continue developing their own unique style while practicing traditional techniques. While the writing workload on top of the painting requirements can be a bit overwhelming, the essays can be quite exciting and relate immensely to class discussions.",
                "I would because it is a good introduction to an art medium that has a concise history and is not very intimidating to start out with.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to everyone because even if you think you are not a good artist, watercolor is a medium that everyone can enjoy and explore and actually use successfully.",
                "Yes absolutely. It was such a fun and educational experience."
