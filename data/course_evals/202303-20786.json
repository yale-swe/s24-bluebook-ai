                "This course was a great introduction to the area of Latin American studies. I appreciated learning about the history of LA through different thinkers, activists, and historians. I gained critical thinking skills as well as the ability to redefine what we know to be as the history of LA.",

                "This class is a great survey class in Latin American studies. I learned about the Spanish Inquisition, struggles for independence, American intervention, neoliberalism, and the Pink Tide. This class forced me to develop better primary source analysis skills and honed my ability to write concise takeaways from each reading.",
                "I learned a ton about Latin American history, especially indigenous and U.S.-Latin American relations. I also learned a lot about colonization and certain theories on Latin America.",
                "I gained confidence in analyzing primary texts as well as films and the readings that were completed for the course.  I think that this course really challenged me to use these sources to draw inferences and make conclusions about historical events, rather than simply summarizing those events and taking the information presented in these sources at face-value.  I also learned a lot about the history of Latin America, from pre-colonial times to the modern day, and I have definitely gained a deeper understanding of the sociopolitical and economic climates of many Latin American nations today and how those came to be.",

                "The format of this course is very engaging. Splitting the class between lecture and discussion was a great way to facilitate insightful conversations while elaborating on the readings we were assigned.",
                "Stregths: I loved coming to lecture every week! I am so glad I took this course. I see the world fundamentally differently. Everyone adores Prof Aguilar and for good reason! She picks fascinating readings. Class is 1/2 lecture, 1/2 discussion. Good balance. Prof Aguilar is the best possible person to teach you Latin American history! her lectures are very interesting, and she is a professor who actively tries to be a teacher, as well! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: as of now, you don't get a grade until reading week, except for the midterm. Hard to know if you need to cred/d/fail. The guidance for assignments is also very broad. Also, two reading responses every week was a lot! But this class is worth it!",
                "Strengths: Awesome reading list.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of profound value-add from the professor.\r\n\r\nAreas of improvement: Lectures that elaborate more on slides. Novel analysis.",
                "It's an excellent course. Though I wish we'd spoken a little bit more about the Mexican Revolution, the course is generally very very good.",
                "Getting our grades on Canvas instead of email!",
                "Strength: Engaging environment facilitated by the professor/TA and the discussion being incorporated at the end of lecture. Various forms of media for primary sources and documents  to cater to the wide ranges of learning. The suggested media/songs to begin lecture helped in getting the class started and some of the songs I've actually added to my playlists! Guest lecturers were also great as they presented their research very well, making nuanced and complex topics accessible to us. \r\nWeaknesses: Heavier amount of weekly readings compared to other classes I've had but still doable, just need to manage your time wisely and start ahead. Readings were interesting though so just make sure you dedicate enough time for the readings.",
                "Strengths: medium is cool (primary documents, films & visit to the Beinecke), Professor is kind\r\nWeaknesses: the content of the curriculum is incredibly narrow & very affected by the political views of the professor, the class environment is not conducive to discussion of viewpoints contradicting the professor's, context and consequences of events are poorly explained."

It is an ethnic studies course, and this should be a safe space for us! But everyone can benefit from knowing about U.S. imperialism and neocolonialism... you will see the world differently!",
                "Yes, I would whole-heartedly recommend this class to anyone at Yale. Latin America gets often overlooked in the American education system. This class gives a great overview for students excited about pursing a future in regional studies/work and also gives any Yale student the beginnings of a foundation critical to their participation as a citizen in our American democracy.",
                "Absolutely I would! The workload is fair and requires some time management, but overall it's an excellent course. Prof. Aguilar is wonderful!",
                "I definitely would.  This course offers deep insight into many facets of Latin American culture and history, and learning about this history has been very eye-opening and fascinating to me.  Many of the themes that are covered in this course likely wouldn't be covered in an average U.S. history course despite being extremely important to understand and recognize in the modern day.  I appreciated how this course emphasized a critical perspective towards colonial narratives of history and how this course highlighted the perspectives of historically marginalized groups.  I think that this perspective is definitely one that many more people should be exposed to.",
                "Yes the class was very interesting and eye opening",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other people. Professor Aguilar is amazing and really detailed about what she decides to teach. She also makes the classroom a space where discussions can flow and values student input!",
                "Yes!!! It eased my transition to a PWI as a Latina since the prof/TA pronounced our names with the correct Spanish pronunciation (if applicable, of course) which was comforting and helped me still feel connected to my culture. The discussion part of class made me truly reflect on the discussion leaders' questions and the content of the lecture that day since people would all share their responses to the point that we would sometimes go a bit over time. The structure of the class is also well-organized and the choice of doing a creative project instead of a final was great! The prioritization of spotlighting Indigenous and Black voices in the lectures/readings was well-done and such a crucial aspect of a course as such that is often disregarded!",
                "No, if you already know a great deal about Latin American history, this course will be enjoyable for you. If you do not, you will receive an incredibly skewed version of Latin America. This should not be considered a history course as it is far more about opinions of certain groups and the events the professor found interesting than it is about Latam History. As a Hispanic student, I was very disappointed with this course and expected more organization, structure, and diversity in thought from a YALE course about an area of the world so important to the world and so often left out. This class has seriously discouraged me from taking any future courses in Latin American Studies."
