    "I learned about Italian regional food, traditions and had the opportunity to talk to Italians living in the US. Prof. Iacovella is one of the most dedicated teachers I have met during my time at Yale. No class was similar to the other. We read snippets from Italian books and prominent Italian writers and learned more about Italian more about Italian politics and economy. I highly recommend every class Prof. Iacovella teaches. She is very enthusiastic about the material and makes every effort to present Italy not through formulaic brochures and websites, but by looking at good Italian writers and sources.",
    "Very engaging course fully in Italian, enjoyable to be a part of the conversation table.",
    "Awesome L5 course focusing on all things contemporary Italy - art, food, economy, language, poetry, literature, film, fashion, business, music: there was truly a topic for everyone. My Italian (both spoken and written) improved a lot, and I became a lot more comfortable conversing with others. It was also really cool to have a class on contemporary Italy, as most classes in the department focus on its history.",
    "I became a much better Italian speaker and writer.",
    "I learned more about Italian culture in the historical context and improved my language skills"

   "comments": [
    "The main strength of the course was Prof. Iacovella. She is the most enthusiastic language teacher I have had at Yale. She introduced us to Italian regional cuisine, to the history of Italian unification, to Italian writers and the current economical situation in Italy. She also invited three Italians who live in the US in class. I have had a more engaged teacher in the five other different language classes I have taken.",
    "Very close relationship to the professor (Anna) and great exposure to hearing and speaking the language twice a week.",
    "This class was honestly awesome. Professor Iacovella is amazing, the material is engaging, and you are forced to practice both your written and spoken Italian frequently, with in class discussions, weekly presentations, and weekly compositions (all relatively short and informal, but effective). I also really liked the guest lectures we had - it was fascinating to hear from Italian-Americans about their experiences across the two countries. One weakness was that in class discussions felt a little sluggish sometimes (small and relatively shy class), and some of the presentation sessions were more like note reading sessions.",
    "Great discussions and passionate teacher. This is a little elementary, but maybe it would be nice to have an opportunity to revise short essays so that students are better encouraged to learn from their mistakes.",
    "Great course! Nice mix of all language aspects  reading, writing, listening, speaking  and interesting guest speakers! Not sure what I would improve since I liked it so much."

    "I would highly recommend any course Prof. Iacovella teaches. She is one of the most dedicated instructors I have had in my time at Yale.",
    "Yes absolutely. I think the Italian department does a fantastic job of keeping students happy with the language and engaged in class. All the instructors I have run in to have been fantastic for my learning.",
    "Absolutely. This was probably my favorite class of the semester (and definitely the best Italian class I've taken). The material is fascinating and Professor Iacovella is a gem, but more importantly, your Italian will improve dramatically.",
    "Yes, I have recommended it to many students",
    "Absolutely! It is a ton of fun and you will learn about Italian and Italian-American culture."
