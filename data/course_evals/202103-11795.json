                "How to close read, discuss, and write about challenging, provocative plays! How to comparatively examine the evolution of a play  (alongside other plays) through time and its afterlife. What to make of a play's absurdity, staging and staging directions, objects.",
                "Apart from gaining a deeper understanding of the development of European drama, I learnt how to read plays better, to analyze drama on the level of the text and performance and place them in their historical context.",
                "I learned a lot about the playwrights we covered and the evolution of modern drama. I really enjoyed the plays we read, and Professor Robinson's comments during class illuminated the way I thought about them. This course also really strengthened my ability to read plays analytically through a number of different lenses."

                "The pace of this course was perfectly suited to the complexity of the material, and Professor Robinson facilitated lively and engaging discussions!",
                "This course was fantastic. Prof. Robinson is a true gem and a font of knowledge about theater. I really loved being able to focus in on seven playwrights and reading multiple works by each, as I came away with a more nuanced view of each playwright, rather than pigeonholing them based on one play. The class was a great environment in which to engage with often-difficult plays.",
                "Kind, thought-provoking professor who lives and breathes theatre, leads high-level discussions rich with comparisons, recommendations, images, angles, questions, and provides very thorough feedback on papers! Lots of liberty in what you write about in your two essays. I really liked the weekly blogs, which Prof. Robinson incorporated into discussion. There really are no weaknesses, but I thought there was some room for smaller creative projects that get us thinking about focused qualities of theatre: like a \"design your own stage setting\" project, etc.",
                "Marc's seminar leadership is a huge strength. Each class, I was engaged and interested. I was consistently impressed with the diversity and depth of discussion that we managed in class. Sometimes, though, I do wish we had more time. Due to the heavy reading load, some classes I felt we had a little too much content to cover in one class and some plays we didn't go into as much depth. I think the class is well curated in terms of playwrights and plays chosen, but I did find that by the end of the semester, some of our early readings had become more muddled for me. We did so much reading that I feel like I'd have to take another class with a narrower focus to really feel I have a firm grasp on each of the playwrights we covered. All that said, I loved the class and feel like my appreciation for theater grew a ton.",
                "There really aren't any weaknesses. It's worth taking the class just to hear Professor Robinson's thoughts on the plays. Whether or not you're interested in drama, you'll learn a lot and get to read some really cool plays.",
                "Although it's the size of a seminar, the course functions more like a lecture based on blog posts from people in the class. I really liked listening to Professor Robinson talk about the plays, and I felt like I was able to contribute when I wanted to. That said, I sometimes felt like it was hard to find what to write blog posts about from all of the readings and hold myself accountable for preparing for class when I knew that it would be structured that way."

                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student! Professor Robinson is a deeply engaging and excited professor, and has a wealth of knowledge to share.",
                "Absolutely! If you are interested in reading modern European playwrights, this class is the place to do it.",
                "Sure I would! You study some really thought-provoking plays (Ibsen, Chekhov, Brecht, Shaw, Beckett) and engage in deep discussion in class (it's of course a lot more enjoyable if you share your thoughts, even if you just talk one or two times). PLEASE WATCH the productions (I'd recommend before reading it, and any version you find on youtube), as seeing the whole play produced makes just about everything so much clearer (blog, discussion, paper, just getting through the plays--some of which are long.) A great opportunity to explore theatre as performed art and literature.",
                "Yes, 100%! I've taken two of Marc's classes now, and I would recommend anything he teaches. Each class, I found our discussions productive, engaging, and thought provoking. Most courses have a day or two where the content is more blah, but I've never experienced that in Marc's classes. My only caveat with this class is that you have to be prepared for a little bit of a heavy reading load. I found the readings to be well curated, interesting, and paired nicely in the syllabus so the extra reading was worth it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! You get to read all the greatest works of European drama with wonderful insights from Professor Robinson each week. Seminar discussions were the perfect balance of Professor Robinson's take on each play and contributions from the rest of the class. It was also really nice to have so much flexibility with the essay assignments, and you get really clear, detailed feedback on each one.",
                "Yes, absolutely. If you're interested in theater history, reading plays, or the playwrights the course covers, this is a great class to take. Especially if you're a TAPS major, Prof. Robinson is someone you should absolutely take a class with before you graduate."
