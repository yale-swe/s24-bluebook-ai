There were two workshops held for each of the long stories, and while student feedback was generally mediocre, Prof. Gaige provided a lot of one-on-one support. Prof. Gaige also provided an interesting variety of course readings, which were helpful.",
                "I learned so much about how to write clearly and persuasively and honestly.",
                "I learned how to write persuasive fiction, use unreliable narrators (first and third person), and use form as a mechanism of content, expanding  time and space deliberately for (de)emphasis.

                "The course was great. I enjoy the workshop format because you can come away with great feedback from your peers. More feedback from the instructor however would have been great, but I think that entirely depends on which professor you have",
                "I loved this course. The workshops were definitely a strength of this course. Professor Gaige created a warm, respectful, and productive learning environment in which to praise and critique each other's writing, discuss what makes for persuasive storytelling, analyze exemplary works of short fiction, and collaboratively grapple with some of the literary\/personal challenges that confront writers. I learned so much about my strengths and weaknesses of my writing through the workshop, and through Professor Gaige's super helpful office hour sessions. I really enjoyed the fun short exercises, which helped to ease us into the two longer writing assignments; they also helped to hone particular aspects of our writing, like prose rhythm, narration, etc. The short stories that Professor Gaige selected for our reading and analysis were also really enjoyable.",
                "I think the weekly exercises provided for good engagement on a variety of fiction techniques. However, I didn't feel adequately prepared to write the final story, which was meant to be 12-20 pages long. I wonder if there was a way to reduce the amount of in-class time spent workshopping so that the professor could lecture more.",
                "I loved the course. I learned so much and Professor Gaige was amazing. One thing that I think could be improved is the structure of the course. We started the first week with a writing assignment, but I think it might be better to spend the first week or two doing tons of reading of different fiction pieces and then discussing them a ton in class, that way when we get to week three we have more of an understanding of how fiction pieces are written.",
                "Strengths: Writing exercises forced the students to frequently generate content under different constraints that allowed exploration of the craft; workshops provided students both the skills to critically discern what makes a good short story (by evaluating their peers)  and the workshopped author meaningful feedback from a thoughtful readership.\r\nWeaknesses: there wasnt enough discussion of plotting before tackling the full short story",
                "The strengths of the course are definitely the feedback sessions with other students and the ability to read other student's work. You really don't learn from the professor, but rather from the other students in the class. If you are skeptical about how much you can actually formally improve in creative writing, don't be. You objectively will get much better at writing after this class.",
                "The exercises and workshops were very fun and useful, and the class was very engaging overall. I would have liked to have more small group sessions with my classmates."

As a student shared their work aloud, listeners would comment in the chat on words and phrases that resonated, which was really helpful instantaneous reader-writer feedback. Also, virtual office hours allowed one on one feedback\/conversation with the professor on our work. Finally, the virtual reading at the end of the semester allowed authors to invite many guests to hear the work shared allowed in a larger venue than they likely could have had on campus.",

                "Yes. This course is literally incredibly, especially with Amity Gaige. It's amazing to be able to write your own short stores and Amity Gaige is so accomplished and talented but very humble and respectful of her students. This is an incredible class.",

Be prepared to structure your time well because there is a lot of work that you have to each week (write 1 3-page short story, do ~2 15-20page readings, write 2-3 1-page critique letters, do line edits on ~30 pages worth of stories. \r\n\r\nBut this heavy workload is what makes the class so meaningful and valuable to each author!",
