I loved this course because it was a great combination between a survey course and a more focused course. We covered multiple different types of confinement in a very deep way.",

                "I learned about various institutions of confinement throughout history and ones today and the power dynamics\/imbalances that exist within those. I also learned to challenge ideas\/concepts of confinement being simply a physical space or as the opposite of freedom which allowed me to reflect upon institutions or spaces of confinement in everyday life. I learned important terms and concepts which allowed me to critically think about the social and cultural contexts of those being confined and institutions doing the confining such as biopower, pawnship and panyarring, spritual pawnship, austerity, performance of power, utilitarianism, and many more. I will definitely be able to apply many of these concepts and queries from this class to future courses and also thinking about the world around me.",
                "I feel I have a completely new perspective on so many things. By far one of the most insightful courses I have taken.",

I learned about the neoliberal state, welfare v. workfare, insurance, pawnship, slavery, rehabilitation, re-education, and many other iterations of state-individual confinement. I gained many new insights on how confinement has been shaped through time, governments, and systems of power.",
                "Great course on the histories of systems of confinement, including the asylum, prison, rehabilitation centers, and hospitals. The course provided insight into the means by which confinement shapes our every day societies, are often rooted in power and control, and can be punitive and\/or beneficent. The course also provided tools to help us analyze mechanisms of confinement including the structures used to confine individuals, the institutions at play, and the tools\/systems\/ideologies used by these institutions.",

                "The history of confinement is far more nuanced than if someone is actually confined. The powers that result in confinement are far more than the dyadic 'ruler' versus 'ruled,' rather they are everywhere and exist in a state of ongoing negotiations.",
                "I gained a wide array of knowledge regarding the valuation of human life, manhunting, biopower, and confinement. My writing skills were strengthened by a focus on political philosophies and other frameworks.",

It introduced me to ways of thinking about and engaging them beyond their immediate concrete makeup. That is to say it showed me how oppression and confinement, specifically, are not clear cut.",

I had previously had no exposure to the subject matter, and we undertook an extremely sweeping survey of the topic of confinement across time and the entire world, and yet Professor Quarshie did not sacrifice the intellectual rigor of the way in which we discussed the topics. At times it felt like whiplash, but I'm so glad to have been exposed to these ideas.",
                "We covered systems of confinement including West African slavery, prisons, hospitals, asylums, rehabilitation centers, re-education\/integration schools, and racial quarantining\/social distancing during the bubonic plague. Our discussions centered on manhunting; we complicated the binary between confinement and freedom and came to the conclusion that they're not polar opposites, but rather conditions within a larger cycle. Other large themes included the effects of austerity, the work of performance and power-relations, memory as an alternate source of history (thus, histories, plural!), theory versus practice, the value of human life, colonialism, neoliberalism, projects of modernity, the establishment of order, and the disruption of time as linear."

            "comments": [
                "I liked how this course covered a lot of material and topics. It was interesting to learn how confinement developed from pawnship and slavery to the present day, across the units of asylum, prisons, rehabilitation and hospitals. Our discussions were interesting and encouraged critical thinking. This course's deadline could have been clearer and I would have preferred more frequent smaller assignments throughout the semester rather than 5 papers (including the final worth 30%).",
                "Everything we covered in the course was engaging and both the professor and the teaching fellows gave us a lot of room to discuss with them and our peers. I think one of the biggest strengths of the course was how much discussion we actually had because it really challenged me to develop my own ideas. I think the only thing that could be improved were lecture slides. Professor Quarshie did not put too much emphasis on dates or titles or names or expect us to memorize them, but I think it would have been helpful to have in my notes for my own reference. The lecture slides were usually only pictures and I think some of those key words and phrases should have been put up on the slides as well",
                "The class covers some fascinating topics and Professor Quarshie is quite passionate and knowledgeable about everything he teaches. However, sometimes he went quite quickly during lectures and it was difficult to follow. Though this course claims you don't need any prior knowledge, I found that you were more likely to succeed if you had taken history classes that covered these topics before. \r\nOne thing that could really improve the class is better powerpoints. Prod. Quarshie primarily used them to show images. It was frequently difficult to tell where he was going with his lectures and thus you didn't know what you should or should not be taking notes on. It would be much more useful if he gave an outline of his points in a powerpoint (as well as writing out or specifically defining some of the more difficult terms).",
                "This class could be improved by having greater engagement. Although everyone seemed intrigue by the topic to some level, at times engagement seemed lacking and it seemed some got disinterested.",
                "I thought the combination of lectures and the case study breakout sessions along with discussion sections was a unique and effective way of teaching the course! As someone who's unfamiliar with this field, I definitely had a learning curve with the terms and concepts that were talked about in lecture, but the breakout sessions and discussion sections helped to gain a better understanding of the concepts. I also appreciated the Q + A period after lectures for students to ask for clarifications on anything that was discussed.",
                "It is incredible as it is.",
                "I found the lectures to be fascinating and sometimes wished we'd had a few more lectures. I also wished the readings had been incorporated more into full-class discussions. I loved the interactive applications of concepts in class and found these very productive.",
                "Strengths: captivating lectures, discussion-style lecture once a week where we got to observe\/analyze archival works and incorporate ideas from our readings and lectures in these analyses, discussion sections were meaningful, and the course content was superb.",
                "Strengths: response papers and readings are manageable lengths, especially with help from the wonderful TFs; lectures are AMAZING and never boring, really helpful Q&As after lectures with the prof, prof Quarshie knows so much about super niche and fascinating topics, and the 2nd lecture each week is larger discussion\/activity that is super rewarding. Weaknesses: I wish we went into ideas of confinement as it pertains to migration\/other topics, although it seems like prof Quarshie will try to integrate that into next year's syllabus!",
                "While the information was very interesting, some of the readings were hard to follow.",
                "This course excels in outside-the-box thinking. Professor Quarshie brilliantly questions answers that may be technically right, constantly pushing his students to think critically.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-covers a wide range of cases (geographical & historically); from the Asante Empire to present-day life amid the Covid Pandemic\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-presupposes prior knowledge about Biopolitics; better grounding readings would have been helpful in addition to the lectures",
                "Strengths: the topic is incredible. Prof. Quarshie has incredible perspectives about how to weave together very disparate aspects of confinement (from pawning to quarantine). TA's were highly invested in this course and were a great resource for help beyond Professor Quarshie. The assignments were very fair, papers were rather short for a Yale course, and reading was not overwhelming. Weaknesses: Professor Quarshie does read his lectures, which can be a bit monotonous as a result. However, a lot of the things he talks about are very complicated and the slow pace provided by him reading rather than freely lecturing was actually a bit helpful when topics were harder to understand. I am unsure if every week a discussion class instead of a lecture class was helpful. Not everyone came prepared and it was a bit difficult when you were not with people who you knew from your discussion section. Therefore, they could be a bit painful to work through. I think they would be more useful every other week.",
                "I wish the lectures were recorded. In this way, I could review concepts I did not fully understand from the live lectures. However, the discussion sections were very helpful in clarifying lecture topics. The readings assigned for this class were amazing. I enjoyed them very much and learned a lot from them. I wish we could have read more!",
                "The course challenges your critical thinking abilities as well as your ability to think outside the the box and view things from different perspectives.  One weakness I think was the lecture style present within the first session of the week. At times the information presented didn't seem specific or relevant to the units they were discussing.",
                "Strengths: the teaching team was very understanding and invested.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes lectures were a bit fast or confusing.",
                "This course was at times a bit broad and a bit sweeping, so perhaps restricting the topics just slightly and cutting down on reading would help to make it more manageable.",
                "The strengths of this course were the patience and flexibility of the professor and teaching aides, as well as the opportunity to engage with primary-source material. Essay prompts were relevant to their matching units, and the two books included in the syllabus were very interesting to read through!\r\nOne weakness was the way lectures were structured. I often found myself getting lost in the note-taking. While I appreciate that Professor Quarshie tried to use more visuals than blocks of texts on his slides, I think it would have been helpful to have slides that explicitly defined key terms and concepts. He did a good job of providing lots of context and quotes, as his main points were rooted in complexity, but it was easy to get lost in the little details. This isn't to minimize the importance of context and background, but rather to suggest a re-organization of the slides so that visuals more clearly connected to main ideas. Students learn differently, and I think the aural approach isn't always enough for everyone to retain the information. Perhaps we could have access to lecture notes to refer back to when reviewing, or when we want to cite his teaching in our papers."

For my other classes that were recorded, it was very helpful to be able to rewatch the lectures and make sure my notes were complete. Additionally, particularly in a pandemic, sometimes students have things in their personal lives that can be distracting (deaths, hospitalizations, etc) that make it hard to pay attention to class any particular day. Recorded lectures are particularly helpful because we can then rewatch them at a time when we have the mental capacity to pay attention and to make sure we fully understand the concepts that are taught.",

These discussions did not usually flow as freely as our weekly discussion sections with our TA's mostly because the groups were randomly assigned and not as comfortable with one another. I think these classes are useful as the prompts were very though provoking and helpful to my learning. However, I do not know if they are needed every week.",
                "I wish the lectures were recorded. The topics covered in the live lectures were very deep and hard to grasp immediately.

                "I definitely would, but you should keep in mind that Prof. Quarshie approaches confinement very differently than you would originally expect. Read the syllabus thoroughly to be aware of what you're getting into before you sign up. \r\n\r\nAlso, keep in mind that this is not a typical lecture. On Wednesdays, the large lecture is sent into breakout rooms and you are given scenarios with primary source material to answer questions about. These questions tend to be very vague and confusing. If you are looking for a lecture to balance out other seminars you are taking, this is definitely not the place for you, especially since his \"midterm\" and \"final\" are just more papers. I took this while taking four other writing heavy seminars and regret all my decisions. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but something he should have made everyone aware of before beginning the class.",

                "Yes, definitely! I think it provides an essential history of how power-systems have resulted in deployment of confinement across time and nations. I found my mind opened and my perspective shifted in the course. I also found the papers incredibly helpful for diving deeply into ethical analysis.",
                "Yes! I think this course is so necessary to shaping our understanding confinement through different lenses, especially ones that interrogate what it means to be human or have citizenship and be included in a state, what it means to have autonomy, the history of psychiatry, along with tools of biopower and biopolitics.",
                "YES YES YES. My absolute favorite class I have taken since coming to Yale. As a history major who is interested in politics\/law\/gov't and intellectual history, I got SO much out of this class and was able to learn an incredible amount about the development of confinement as an idea throughout time and in variety of social and geographical contexts. If you can, try to get Anglica as your TA, she is INCREDIBLE! You really do not have to be an HSHM major to get the best out of this class!!",
                "Most definitely.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone with the caveat that lectures are very theory-heavy, and the assigned readings exemplify the concepts (not explains them).",
                "Yes! Thinking about biopower - especially through the valuation of human life - is so essential to anyone who wants to study the history of science and medicine (or just any history). I found that taking this class effectively changed the ways in which I thought about my other courses. I found myself applying the political philosophies from this course to everything I was thinking about. It is just that powerful. Professor Quarshie is also just a great professor. He is relaxed, kind, and very knowledgeable. He also has lots of cool personal connections to the course content he chooses (such as readings coming out of the University of Toronto, or the first course unit's focus on his home country) which allows him to provide incredible insights. You definitely need to take this course!",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students, especially premed students. Courses like this one teach students so much about society and awareness. Premed requirements are all science classes which do not teach students how to become the best people they can be.",
                "Yes, this was a wonderful course that challenged me to think critically in many ways.",
                "Yes, this class is extremely interesting. It definitely has more of a philosophical perspective than I anticipated, but that was appreciated! I had never really studied history or medical practices from a philosophical lens before.",
                "Yes. After taking this course, I would consider it to be essential knowledge for anyone engaged in the world on any level.",
                "Yes, if you're prepared to read a lot. The weekly workload is intense given the circumstances, but as a result, the TAs were often more flexible with paper deadlines. Additionally, we were warned from day one that we would finish this class with more questions than answers, and I think this rang true in a positive way! I was pleasantly surprised to find that our readings accompanied the work I was doing in my other classes, as I am an ER&M major, not an HSHM major."
