The professor would assign random assignments at will and by mouth so it was difficult to recall and keep up with the assignments. It was not specified whether or not the assignments were graded. We had to submit everything through email (which the professor did not mention) because the professor did not upload on CANVAS. We mostly had to figure things out by ourselves as a class. Assignments depended on if the majority of the class did the work. The assignments would always be so tedious and you would need to dedicate so much time to it so the work would overshadow the rest of your classes. The Vietnamese we were learning was not colloquial and would not be used in normal conversation; the words we were learning was ancient which the professor expected us to know.",

A bit more work than L3 viet, but we go into much deeper topics during this semester that I really enjoyed learning and think are important to learn (such as topics like refugees). The deadlines for work is quicker and there's more work, but it's definitely very doable still!",
