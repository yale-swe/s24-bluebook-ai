And while the conclusions are strange, its unclear where the argument goes wrong. Thus, students will learn how to reason about philosophical arguments, pick them apart, and support/object to them. Moreover, students will learn the importance of interpreting the purpose and content of philosophical arguments and ideas with considerable charity.",

As a skeptic of broad survey courses usually, i became convinced that every aspiring philosopher should this class as soon as possible.

It felt like we went right from essay 2 to final preparation with little time to look at our grades. I also know that this creates a lot more work for TFs, but I think a rewrite option on at least on essay one (and preferably essay two as well) where either the two grades are averaged or the better one is granted in full would really help demystify philosophical writing in this intro course.",
                "Strengths: interesting lectures, brilliant professor, fascinating discussions in weekly section, well-explained content, wide range of choices for paper prompts\r\nWeaknesses: There's disparity in how TFs conduct their sections, which is not inherently bad but when it comes to writing your paper, you're going to want to talk directly to your specific TF about your approach and what you can do to improve since that TF will be grading yours.",
                "strengths: wonderful overview of major authors\r\nimproved: more Kant!",
                "The course by nature has to move very quickly which is a strength because we got through a lot of content, but also a weakness because we could not go as in depth into the arguments/full ideologies off the thinkers as I sometimes would have liked.",
                "Professor Della Rocca is a great lecturer. He has well structured lectures but leaves space for questions and interactions with students during lecture.",
                "Strengths - MDR is a wonderful lecturer and even better in office hours; also an extremely kind and approachable professor; references to Olivia Rodrigo and Taylor Swift were a highlight of his teaching style",
                "This is an exceptional course. I think removing one philosopher and spending more time on the rest would make this course much better.",
                "Professor Della Rocca and my TA were definitely the strengths of the course. MDR is an absolutely incredible lecturer and is one of the leading authorities in the field. It was an honor to have taken his class and despite his high status, he still knew most of the class by name and was super engaging at office hours. The content was also super interesting to me and I felt like I learned more in this class than any other class at Yale. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
                "MDR is great and his energy is infectious, wish we related metaphysics to more relevant real world issues/thought experiments though.",
                "Section could have been more engaging. Preparing for the final exam was initially a little stressful.",
                "Strengths: very clear lectures and accessible staff\r\nCons: Sections didn't leave time for student opinions on the material.",
                "i wish there was longer discussion time in sections beyond the 50 minutes. most of it is spent reiterating any of the confusing points and it is then difficult to transition into flow of philosophical conversation because so much of the material is dense and needs clarity. lectures are phenomenal and define points really well, but then the lectures and readings dont always time well with section so not everyone is on the same page or we are discussing different things in section to soon before or much time after they were covered in lecture",
                "Strengths: Amazing professor and TFs. Office hours are so helpful and insightful. MDR's lectures are so good that you could probably complete most of this course without the readings. Numerous resources are given to help you learn to write a cogent philosophy paper (which is strikingly different from papers in other disciplines). Weaknesses: Only went over the metaphysical systems of early modern philosophers, when the name of the course would suggest a broader scope of content.",
                "It would be great if the required course for the philosophy major on \"modern philosophy\" encompassed more than early modern, rationalist thought.",

I didn't do most of the readings, but his lectures are more than sufficient for the whole course, to be honest.\r\n- MDR is just an amazing professor\r\n- My TF was amazing. She is leaving but was absolutely wonderful. Very knowledgeable, understanding, and intelligent. \r\n- Low workload\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n- Grading across Section TFs wasn't consistent. My friend's paper was rushed and pretty average, and he still somehow got an A- whereas another friend (who had a much better paper IMO) got a B. Since papers are 30% of your grade, it can affect your grade pretty heavily. \r\n- Study Guides or more notes would help\r\n- Sections can feel a bit disorganized",

                "fantastic course as both an introduction to philosophy and a survey of the early modern period and several extremely interesting issues (skepticism, mind body interaction, existence of God), nothing to improve on imo",
                "Strengths: MDR as a professor. He explains things really well so that not quite getting the reading the first time through is not a barrier to understanding and enjoying the material. Makes a huge difference in my opinion \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: because there were so many philosophers to get through, we didnt get very deep into their ideas or arguments besides the topics you specifically chose for papers. But thats to be expected in an intro course",

                "This course can be as boring or interesting as you decide it is. I found the material most stimulating when I was last-minute cramming for the final or writing my papers, honestly, because it forced me to really immerse myself in the material.",
                "Strengths -- loved the material & instruction\r\nWeaknesses -- wish there were more resources on Canva, e.g. lecture outlines...would make exam review a bit easier, especially given how abstract the material could get",
                "Readings not as structured as they could be.",
                "This was a strong course. The readings were accessible and manageable. The grading was more than fair, and I received helpful comments on my papers. The peer community for this course was strong, and I frequently studied and talked about the material with friends. The only weakness I can think of is that there were only two graded assignments the entire semester, in addition to the final exam. My skills at writing a philosophy paper improved throughout the semester, and it would have been great to have more opportunities to develop this skill, and not to have the grade depending so heavily on a few assignments.",
                "It's just a great course!",
                "Strengths: final was good, papers were good\r\nWeaknesses: midterm would be helpful, perhaps some supplemental texts to clarify the readings",
                "My section was really dry and wish it was more argument and debate focused.",
                "Strength: incredible teaching of content by MDR, very interesting content, readings are not too long. Few weaknesses",
                "Very insightful and well-taught. Wish the sections were more engaging.",
                "This is a good foundational course in philosophy; it covers a wide range of philosophers. Professor Della Rocca was a great professor, always explaining topics very well. I wouldn't say this class has any weaknesses. I just personally didn't love the material but that has nothing to do with the class itself.",

MDR is an incredible professor who keeps lectures engaging and breaks down complicated philosophical concepts in a very digestible way (you could honestly get by without doing any of the readings because he explains things so well). The content is truly very interesting and thought-provoking, and the workload is super manageable. It's a great introduction to philosophy that never felt overwhelming. I honestly can't recommend this class enough for anyone who is remotely interested in philosophy and the topics in this course.",
                "Absolutely - if you want an accessible, fun introduction to analytical philosophy with a great professor, this is a good class.\r\n\r\nNote that it very heavy on metaphysics so not for those looking for a class on ethics, or philosophizing about the meaning of life/death. This is about understanding various intellectual systems and learning to reconstruct these arguments.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This was my first real interaction with philosophy and the material learned in this class can be applied to many other topics. I found it to be incredibly engaging and I will take more philosophy classes because of it.",
                "I absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in philosophy, or wants to branch out/fulfill a distributional requirement. I learned so much about the subject of philosophy, as well as writing papers and reading difficult texts.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in philosophy. The ideas discussed form the foundation of much of contemporary philosophy, so they are helpful in understanding more modern ideas. Moreover, the arguments put forth by early modern philosophers are extremely interesting, especially with regard to how reason is used to justify odd conclusions. Its really interesting to see how philosophers respond to each other and build off of each others ideas.",

                "Absolutely. Good for philosophy gourmets at any level",
                "I really enjoyed it, to be fair Im a philosophy major. I recommend it if you like philosophy and want to get a solid foundation, the content of this course would certainly be important for that",
                "Yes! It is an accessible but stimulating philosophy course.",
                "This course would definitely be an excellent fit for anyone, with or without a backing in philosophy.",
                "If theyre interested in the philosophers in the syllabus.",
                "yes, if philosophy is your jam, particularly philosophy concerning the veracity of the material world and God, as well as our own selves and how our mind and body communicate. Not much talk of moral philosophy, and much of the philosophy is based on God's veracity, so if that sort of thing doesn't interest you I wouldn't take this course.",
                "Definitely. Especially if you're in the CogSci or philosophy majors!",
                "Yes",
                "Absolutely. It's a fantastic course, even for non-philosophers.",
                "Maybe.\r\n\r\nIf interested in metaphysics. Also quality of course depends highly on the TA.",
                "Yes if you want a comprehensive and manageable overview of modern philosophers. It does not go too deep, but professor does a very good job of ensuring you have a solid understanding of basic philosophical arguments.",
                "Yes",
                "Absolutely. I learned so much. MDR is an absolute legend. TAKE!",
                "Yes! Modern philosophy is fascinating and MDR is a one of a kind man and instructor.",
                "Id recommend this course if you really like metaphysics.",
                "Yes, very fun!",
                "If you're curious or interested about philosophy, then this is certainly a great class to take. I think it's a good intro class, delving deep into a lot of different philosophers with many different opinions about the world. However, if you're not really into philosophical thinking (especially from way back when) then maybe pass and look for a different class.",
                "Yes, I would recommend to anyone who is considering the philosophy major."
