This allowed me to improve my reading in Polish because of the many readings given during the course. My conversational Polish skills also increased because of the complete immersion in the language during class. Finally, my grammar skills also improved because of the homework assignments.",

                "The strengths of the course were that it allowed room for the students to incorporate their own interests. This made the course much more engaging and interesting. It was also strong in that it focused on many different aspects of the Polish language and culture. A weakness was that some topics were covered in too much detail, taking away from other topics that were also supposed to be covered. The course could be improved by better balancing out time among the different topics.",
                "The strengths mainly come from the small class size as well as the full emersion in the language, as this allowed for great whole class discussions where everyone could participate easily. There were not many weaknesses but I would say that sometimes, there was too much time spent on correcting homework which led to some less eventful days in class.",
                "This was a wonderful course that elevated my Polish skill levels. The virtual format, in which students presented on the texts we read and then discussed the main ideas, surpassed my expectations."
