                "This is one of the most wonderful courses and opportunities offered at Yale. I recommend taking full advantage of an opportunity to be part of a production of this calibre in the UT. However, the course might be improved upon by starting rehearsals sooner, and perhaps even using class time earlier in the semester to help students get a grasp of material and blocking which otherwise is clustered into the latter part of the term leading to stress. Show week is great!",
                "Strengths: Tech week and all the staging rehearsals were very well-organized; I felt my time was being respected and we were getting a lot done. \r\nWeaknesses: I think this course should have a midterm paper rather than a paper after a long tech week and two performances. The final paper sort of takes away from all the excitement and gratitude for the experience of putting on a show.",
                "The actualy class sections often lacked structure and ability to hold my attention. This didn't bother me too much, because I felt that the main focus should have been on the coachings and rehearsals. However, it might have been cool to dive into the specific text of the opera we were putting on in class, or talk more in depth about specific scenes with the whole cast present.",
                "Toni and Grant are tremendous teachers and the process of putting on an opera was super fun. The greatest strength of this class is that it is the only professional opera opportunity at yale -- every aspect of the opera, including musical direction, stage, acting, costume, set is managed by professionals and undergrads have the rare opportunity to perform."

                "Yes! Grant and Toni are really lovely, and its a really unique opportunity to have a role in a truly professional opera production. The production quality is literally professional and if you want to direct or music direct a show in the future, this is a great opportunity to learn from two fantastic people and see how they run rehearsals. A really special opportunity and a highlight of my Yale career.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who likes music or theater. Herreid and Dorfman are both so intelligent, tech week is super fun, and the show's level of professionalism is something you will not get anywhere at Yale, even through the Dramat.",
                "Absolutely. The opera was a transformative experience and made me fall in love with vocal singing again.",
                "Absolutely, for anyone interested at all in performing Baroque opera.",
                "Its a once in a lifetime opportunity to do this with a first-class quality production, so if you can sing & are curious about baroque opera, try out!"
