    "MV",
    "An understanding of 3D curves, surfaces, and solids was developed. Various integral types were covered, including double, triple, vector line, and flux integrals. Finally, a variety of methods and theorems were applied to evaluate integrals.",
    "I learned a lot of integrals (scalar line, vector line, scalar surface, flux, triple integrals, etc.) and theorems to integrate (Green's and Stokes'). I also gained a better understanding of vectors and what each integral represented geometrically. Beyond direct calculus knowledge, I also learned how to look at problems from different angles and choose the most effective way to approach a problem.",
    "I learned how to thoroughly and critically think through problems. By the end of the course, I felt like I could tackle any problem given to me.",
    "Multi variable calc",
    "Calc 3",
    "How to do multivariable calculus.",
    "I got much better at problem solving and intuitive thinking",
    "I learned many different methods of integration, as well as the conceptual theory behind a large portion of vector calculus. In doing so, I was able to get a grasp on different functions in three dimensions. Some other topics that were covered included implicit differentiation, chain rule, local and global extrema, and cross products.",
    "Because I've never had any exposure to multivariable calculus, pretty much all the material presented was new information to me. I learned new skills in approaching math problems and was challenged by the new information.",
    "Being able to imagine and compute in more than two dimensions, and a lot of integral calculations.",
    "Very thorough understanding of multivariable calculus.",
    "I feel like I learned a lot in this course. \r\n\r\nI feel much more confident visualizing in 3D space. I also feel fairly confident about my knowledge of multivariable calculus now. \r\n\r\nThe most important thing I gained out of this course is the motivation to think about majoring in Math.",
    "A thorough introduction to multivariable calculus",
    "In this course I developed an understanding of multi-variable calculus and a repertoire of integration techniques. I don't mean to repeat what the syllabus could tell you, but I will emphasize the inter relatedness of the material. By the end of the course I had a mental map of each f the theorems we had learned (FTLI, Stokes\/Greens, Divergence theorem) as well as how the conditions necessary to apply them related to each other. \r\n\r\nSlightly outside of the realm of integration techniques I gain a better understanding of implicit differentiation and the characteristics of global and local minima and maxima across surfaces.",
    "I became comfortable with the theory and mechanics of multivariable calculus, including scalar and vector integrals. I practiced worked with multidimensional spaces and learned a variety of math theories related to integration.",
    "I learned about multivariable calculus! And a LOT about the different integrals (gotta love the vector integrals).",
    "Problem solving skills, as well as deep knowledge in multivariable calculus was gained by taking this course. The course grew my love for math and provided me with insights on potential majors I may want to do. Overall, I gained a lot from taking this course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Sudesh is the strength. If you get Sudesh as your instructor you will be fine. He is an incredible teacher and makes the material interesting and engaging.",
    "Good course",
    "The course is very structured and organized, with weekly homework assignments, a workbook for class notes, and module practice problems for assessments. Group work is also encouraged, both inside and outside of class. An area for improvement for this class would be the apparent inapplicability of the content, which could be improved by further including applications of multivariable calculus.",
    "This course was very structured and progressed a decent pace. As someone who had never taken multivariable calculus before and took AP Calc BC senior year, I found the course to be taught in a way so that the coursework was pretty manageable and the concepts fairly straightforward to understand. Sudesh also really made an effort to relate concepts to each other and really draw a connection between everything we learned, which helped with understanding the concepts better. I also liked that Sudesh really encouraged group work, as the class felt more collaborative and students were able to bounce ideas off one another. There were also so many resources and practice problems provided, such as review sessions, office hours, practice exams, and Ximera. A weakness of the course as a whole is that it seems that each student's experience varies greatly depending on the instructor. I attended some review sessions held by other professors, and their methods of explaining were a lot less approachable and methodical than Sudesh's, and I believe I would have had a harder time in this course if assigned a different professor.",
    "Sudesh was an excellent professor - I have never enjoyed math more than I did with him.",
    "Learning to study math everyday like in high school",
    "I liked this course as it was.",
    "Strengths: The course was extremely well taught by Sudesh, including both the theoretical concepts and also the computational part of the class as well. There were lots of resources to prepare for exams and the problem sets reinforced content that was directly needed to succeed in the class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Cannot really think of any to be honest... perhaps that I was not really aware who my TF was (partially my own fault but also seeing them during the first class or two would be useful\r\n\r\nImprovement: Maybe have some more involvement with the TF's and students in some way. Also, I felt that some problem set questions were graded extremely harshly.",
    "Strengths: 1) intellectually challenging, 2) a lot of resources for practice and help\r\nWeaknesses: 1) large disparity between professors\r\n\r\nI believe this course can be improved if the professors were more on the same page with material and the way the material was being taught.",
    "There are some instructors who are amazing at explaining concepts, but there are also some who made me more confused when I went to their review sessions.",
    "The course was very interesting and well taught, but the level of difficulty of the tests was inconsistent. The first test was extremely difficult with subsequent tests being doable. This gave students the impression that the course was not as accessible.\r\n\r\nThe problem review sessions were not that helpful since the instructors that run them used rather complex terminologies and methods. Their teaching should be more accessible.",
    "This course was amazing. Strengths: Sudesh's explanations, willingness to answer lots of questions, review sessions, and thorough teaching. Weaknesses: the final exam is worth so much of our grades and an \"off day\" can have a major impact and result in a grade that is not representative of work during the semester.",
    "Strengths: I think the course is very well structured. The course content is highly relevant and interesting. I found Ximera to be very useful. The videos on Ximera explain all concepts very well which is a great way to review the material. The practice problems are also very useful to prepare for the exams. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I am very happy with the way the course was taught by my instructor and I cannot think of any.",
    "Strength: The overall structure of the course was very clear. The instructor worked really hard to make his students understand all the concepts. \r\nWeaknesses: I feel that the difficulty level could be further increased.",
    "The weakness of this course is the breath of the material covered. There were points in the course where the details of new material were difficult to understand because I had not yet truly understood the prerequisite knowledge from earlier in the course. However the teaching style was very respectful of this phenomena and by the end of the course I had a very good understanding of the functional connections between the units.",
    "The course is very comprehensive and covers a wide range of topics quickly. However, it is also able to teach these topics effectively through well-structured lectures. The problem sets and Ximera problems help to enforce understanding of the content. I don't have any suggestions for how the course could be improved.",
    "There were so many practice problems, modules, and office hours to practice, learn, and get help from. If you put the work in and understand the material, you will do well in the class.",
    "The course was extremely well taught and very engaging. The were plenty of opportunities to get help for PSETs and learning the material through office hours and the reviews prior to exams were also very helpful. The course could be improved by perhaps having an optional problem solving session once a week, or once very 2 weeks."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you can get Sudesh as your professor.",
    "Yes, if you need to take multivariable calculus, math 120 would be the best option.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to students who had a good grasp of calculus in high school, even if they don't need it for a major or other requirements. I gained a very thorough understanding of multivariable calculus, and it was a good bridge between high school and calculus math. Don't let the intimidating reputation scare you off since this course is very manageable if you're willing to do the work and go to office hours, and you really learn to view math in a different way.",
    "Yes - if you enjoy math, this is a great course to take.",
    "Yes but it is very challenging with only a Calc BC background from a public high school",
    "Yes! If you take it with Sudesh. He is amazing. Otherwise, probably no unless you need it.",
    "If they liked math I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes. This class with SUDESH was one of the best math classes I've ever taken, and even as a prospective non-Stem major, my favorite class this semester. If you put in the time and energy into this class, it's not as hard as everyone hypes it up to be, and it's super interesting and Sudesh is an amazing instructor. Don't let people scare you away from this class!! It's amazing.",
    "Sure. Sudesh is a great professor. The class itself, however, in my personal opinion can definitely be structured better. There is so much content to cover over the course of a semester, and even though the professors work hard to cover everything, sometimes things can seem a bit rushed. If you take this class, just make sure to put time in to learn things by yourself.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. This may have been the most structured and informative math class I have ever taken. It provides a strong basis for going into further math\/engineering courses and I feel prepared to go to the next level. Math 120 was a bit of a challenge, however it was definitely something that was possible if you worked hard at the material covered in class.",
    "It depends - I would not recommend this course to another student if they're just looking to fulfill a prerequisite. I would recommend this course if students are looking for an intellectual challenge and want to learn a lot about multivariable calculus.",
    "Yes. There are many concepts and skills taught in this course that most people will need for other courses they'll be taking.",
    "Yes provided they are confident in their mathematical background",
    "Yes, please take this course with Sudesh!! Math 120 is a class all prospective STEM majors should take and Sudesh's explanations and willingness to spend time with students makes his section by far the best.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to another student. At the end of the course, you will feel very satisfied with the amount of content you learned. You will feel very confident with visualizing in 3D space.",
    "Yes, if you want a thorough introduction to multivariable calculus. The course is very calculation based, and it turned out to be a bit mechanical especially towards the end. If you still want a more theoretical understanding of MATH and you are willing to devote your whole semester to one course, at least shop MATH 230.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. Although the volume of material can sometimes be overwhelming, but the understanding achieved at the end of the course is rewarding enough to justify periods of mystification. This class has given me the confidence to take more advanced math classes.",
    "I would highly recommend this course because it provides an excellent extension to high school calculus, as well as a great introduction to college-level mathematics. It teaches many fascinating mathematical theories and concepts that I found enjoyable to learn.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course, as a gained a lot of knowledge and the class was very well taught."
