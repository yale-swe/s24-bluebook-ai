I also wished I got to hear about the placements of the other students at some point. I wouldnt mind submitting a weekly reflection about my placement, and maybe the prof could select a couple each week to share and discuss with the class.",

However the course is quite low in terms of workload so a lot of the most meaningful work has to come out of practical component \r\n\r\nHowever, I left the clsss feeling a little unsatisfied. I think the course has a lot of potential but should be reworked to give more opportunity for learning and engagement.",
