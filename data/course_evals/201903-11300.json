   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Required section\/problem sessions were pretty annoying.",
    "I thought that problem session was very helpful in reviewing the weeks concepts and making sure people werent falling behind.",
    "Strengths - Eric Brown is a really good lecturer, the psets seemed realistic, the content covered was applicable to what we will be doing as engineers, problem sessions that were exclusively dedicated towards understanding the problems we were solving more thoroughly\r\nWeaknesses - In lecture, the problems solved were much simpler than the homework problems, but the problems made available at problem sessions were more like the homework problems so it wasnt really an issue. He made relatively frequent math mistakes on the board, so if you zone out for a while during class it can be a bit confusing.",
    "Strengths: interesting and applicable, good ordering of topics, I like the concept of problem sessions. Weaknesses: grading was extremely inconsistent between ULAs which is disheartening as a student. Professor Brown's office hours were also at times pretty frustrating because we would do a problem entirely wrong after asking him how we should try it and he gave little guidance or wouldn't tell us that we were entirely off base. It seems like even though we were willing to put time in and do problems the right way and actually learn the material we weren't rewarded in any way for trying, and didn't even get to learn the right way in office hours. The solutions online were sometimes entirely incorrect which was also frustrating. Problem sessions were also discouraging when the ULAs didn't have the answers so couldn't teach us how to solve problems. Although I respect the withholding of answer keys so that we actually learn things, even when I would put in many hours of going to office hours I didn't get to actually learn the process because of the lack of clear solutions or a lack of solutions at all. The problems were certainly interesting and applicable, but it's really not rewarding or useful to not be able to actually figure them out. The final and the final pset were also pretty problematic for me. The solution manual was wrong and unreadable for the final pset which was supposed to be practice for the final exam. The final exam was pretty long and engaged and somehow felt really open ended despite it being an engineering class. The entire grading system of the class was not transparent at all and could be improved.",
    "Strengths - well taught and the TAs were very helpful\r\nWeakness - Sometimes it felt as though the problem set questions were very difficult since practice questions like it were not really worked through in class (The easy ones were looked at in the problem solving sessions)",
    "Plenty of resources available to students, including lecture, videos from other lectures, appropriate textbook chapters, and office hours and help sessions for the material",
    "The course has a problem session associated with it that I found to be very helpful!",
    "A very good course leaving me feeling like a much more capable engineer.",
    "More practical examples in and out of class, because exams always have new material which is hard to synthesize. However there is a great number of TFs to help teach the material. It is well organized",
    "Strengths- the class has a lot to offer and if you are a mechanical engineer you learn useful things\r\nWeaknesses- you learn everything alone since prof Brown gives you the basic, super-simple stuff in class and then gives homework that have a lot of stuff he never taught.",
    "this class was extremely well organized, and well taught. the one primary weakness i felt was a lack of feedback on grades during the class.",
    "I think that a strength of the course was the problem sets. They were a set of problems that did a good job of preparing us for the midterms. One weakness of the course was that there needed to be a better compilation of course materials such as the displacement tables and material properties. Some of the practice problem we did used information not in the tables provided, so it made it tough to study.",
    "It needs a new professor (which is good because our Prof is quitting) and grad student TA's, not undergrads who can't explain things that well.",
    "I thought the lectures were well-organized, making note-taking really easy. I liked having problem sessions, though I don't think they were completely effective in helping us with our psets because they were so short. Overall, the lectures were good for introducing broad topics, but did not prepare us enough to solve the more complex pset questions.",
    "psets take a while to complete but they are doable especially if you go to office hours",
    "Strengths: material and the teaching was very organized, problem sets were a little long but fair, exams were very fair. Weaknesses: I think there were two main weaknesses of the class. First, the grading was very ambiguous. We did not receive any grades other than the grades for individual assignments and prof Brown said the grading was going to change based on improvement without any real quantitative terms. You can understand how this is frustrating for a class full of prospective engineers. I think the main way of improvement for this would be to upload grades on Canvas, and put the improvement factor in quantitative terms such as the latter exams and psets being weighed more or the final being able to drop one midterm etc. The second problem for me was that the course material wasn't very exciting. Prof Brown tried to make it a little fun with bringing show and tell stuff to class but it is statics and regardless of the fact that I chose to study mechanical engineering this really isn't stuff that's fun... I cannot think of how this would be improved.",
    "The strengths of the course are the material, which is interesting. The weaknesses of the course are the professor and the unorganized nature of the course.",
    "I have no idea what I have in this class. None of my grades were ever posted and our percentages were not correct on the syllabus. So I had no way to judge what i needed to do for the final in terms of time management.",
    "The problem sessions were really helpful and so were then TA office hours. I think that the stuff covered in class was much simpler than the problem sets, so the problem sets were a struggle. The midterms were fine but the final was so hard.",
    "It's a pretty good course, and the ULAs are great, but some of the course policies are arbitrary and annoying. For example, giving students automatic zeros on late homework, without dropping any lowest scores, is pretty mean, and caused a lot of avoidable stress.",
    "Strengths: material is laid out clearly, many resources (eg textbook, videos, ULA office hours, professor office hours, problem sessions), homework helps you learn the material\r\nWeaknesses: the homework was much more complicated than what was gone over in class, the exam grading didn't seem like a holistic approach to evaluating if students understand the material",
    "Professor Brown was not a great lecturer and it felt as though there was a disconnect between his class and the difficultly of material we were tested on.",
    "Well structured, divided into clear modules for learning",
    "I liked having the derivations but I wish they would of been explained more thoroughly so that I can understand how each mathematical step relates to a real physical situation",
    "Homework questions were very difficult. I was struggling with the course and despite attending help sessions, etc., it felt very overwhelming trying to catch up while solving problems with difficulties that appeared exceedingly difficult."

   "comments": [
    "It's a pretty easy course if you're an applied math major looking for an elective.",
    "Definitely a challenging class, but was very reasonable course compared to other MechE classes",
    "I would strongly recommend this to any student who is interested in engineering\/structure analysis. I think it was a really useful course, and I feel that students who are interested in this content\/are required to take this class because of their major get a lot out of it. Eric Brown is a really good professor who cares a lot about his students. He understands the need to teach the theory in class so that students have a strong foundation moving forward in engineering, but has the insight to recognize that theory alone isnt enough to understand how to solve realistic engineering problems - thats why he established problem sessions. He conveys information in a way that makes sense, and he doesnt make any question a student asks sound bad. He was able to break down how we should approach solving problems in this (or any, really) engineering class in a way that made a lot of sense.",
    "You probably are only taking this if you have to. The content is actually pretty interesting especially if you enjoyed physics. The math is manageable too. I would hesitate from recommending taking this course with Brown because the grading felt pretty unfair at times which was really discouraging and office hours were also discouraging. I think that if you put as many hours in as I did with my classmates to actually learn there should be a means to do so. Also, this course needs more ULA office hours desperately (which I know is not Professor Brown's fault)!!!",
    "To engineering\/ maybe architecture student, yes.  But to all other students, no.",
    "If you are not taking mechanical engineering, don't take this class. It is an essential course to understand engineering further, but it is not worth the struggle if you aren't required to take it",
    "Yes, I enjoyed the course material very much. If you're interested in engineering, this is a core class that is very helpful and teaches a lot of what is necessary to be an engineer.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in physics and engineering.",
    "Only mechanical engineers, even though it was the most interesting course I'd ever taken",
    "Well if you are a meche student its a requirement. I would suggest taking it if Browns not teaching it. But I think it was his last year at Yale (or so I have been told).",
    "yes. this class is a requirement for mechanical engineering so i would recommend that if you are required to take this class that you should take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to mechanical engineers that are required to take it, but not to other people unless they have a specific interest in the topics of the course.",
    "No, do not take it. It's terrible and really hard. You won't understand anything, and then when you think your getting it, all the rules will be changed.",
    "Sure, I learned a lot. However, be prepared to struggle.",
    "Yes, Professor Brown did a good job of teaching the subject.",
    "If youre taking this youre likely mech e but if youre not and need a credit for applied mathematics I think this is a interesting and doable class",
    "This is the first class non engineers think of we take when they think of engineering classes. Like looking at strength of beams and stuff. This is an entirely accurate representation of the class and frankly it is nothing more. It is required for ABET. Even if you're not ABET but looking for an engineering career I feel like this would be relevant whatever you do. Yet, it will be boring. Make friends in the class and do psets with them.",
    "If taught by professor brown, no. I do not think that he helped nor cared about his students. The grading was extremely unfair.",
    "Its an interesting class that I dont think is to hard if you understand whats happening, but only take it if you need to",
    "Only if you are studying mechanical engineering. It has little application outside the major",
    "If you're in ME or applied math its a cool course, but its a lot of work so don't take it lightly",
    "Yes, it is likely a requirement for mech e but it provides a good foundation for understanding key concepts in in a manageable way",
    "If necessary, it is a core class with core skills in MechE, otherwise, no.",
    "It's probably required for your major. Still, it's a good course and you'll learn a lot about the fundamentals of Mechanical Engineering if you're interested in combining that knowledge with another major",
    "I would very much recommend this course. It is one of the best courses I have taken so far. Although the course load and me falling behind in the semester has made me question my possible major. Great class to introduce someone to mechanical engineering though."
