I really do feel like I got a great grasp on how music has evolved and changed since then, in many good and bad and weird and interesting ways. This class covers classical music, symphonic music, program music, romantic music, ballet, opera, modernism, impressionism, expressionism, American experimentalism, jazz and its related genres, neoclassicism, serialism, chance music, electronic music, and minimalism. The composers include: Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schumann, Liszt, Chopin, Berlioz, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Rossini, Verdi, Wagner, Mahler, Debussy, Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Gershwin, and many many more. If this stuff interests you, take the class for sure. We also covered musical forms and broke down songs from a (simple) theory perspective. The class is very low workload except the midterm, final, and listening exam require a good amount of prep, which is good because it forces you to really learn the stuff.",

            "comments": [
                "This class could have been great. I took this one over Listening to Music because Listening to Music seemed to focus on a lot of weird stuff; I thought this class would focus on classical music from the 1800s. I was terribly wrong. You spend 2ish weeks studying Beethoven, Bach, Shubert, Mendelson, etc but it quickly goes into opera where you stay for several weeks. While I gained a possible appreciation for opera and went to see my first opera due to this class, It was not my intention to academically study opera; if it was, I would have taken an opera class. After 3-4 weeks of exclusively opera, you then pivot to impressionist and modern music (i.e. weird stuff that a layperson wouldn't consider music). A month and a half of this stuff and you realize that while you hoped to learn a lot about the great classical composers so you could have educated discussions about classical music and heighten the enjoyment of famous symphonies, you will instead be beating your head with your headphones as you're forced to listen to atonal noises and train sounds. Some more notes. After 4 years at Yale, this is the only class I've been in that takes lecture attendance, yes, you will be treated like a middle schooler and forced to sign the sign-in sheet at every class, causing a stir as half the class shows up late. It's also published as great for non-musicians, accepting to all, but while that may be what you think, it entirely depends on your TA grading your work. My section TA was great and made me feel (as a musical outsider) welcome, but the TA grading my work was extremely harsh and nitpicky, critiquing my use of words that weren't even musical terms and basically telling me my subjective opinion of music was wrong. Don't take this class for a grade (or at all) because guess what...at the end there is a listening quiz where you have to learn 90+ pieces, the year composed, the composer, and attributes about them (The 90+ include the crappy atonal stuff and train sounds). Overall, if you are like me, hoping to take a fun class outside a stem major and wanting to learn about classical music this is NOT your class.",
                "Prof. Kreuzer is great",
                "I enjoyed that the lectures were very engaging and the sections gave us a good chance to review the topics we weren't familiar with. It would have been interesting to spend a bit more time on modern musical genres like jazz, rock music, or hip hop.",
                "strengths: very organized, low stress, interesting lectures\r\nweaknesses: not really a negative but music experience/knowledge is definitely helpful!",
                "The strengths of this course lie in the course material. The material of this course is extremely interesting if taught appropriately. Unfortunately, the weaknesses of this course come from the course format, instruction, and instructors. The course is in lecture style format but requires participation, which is unusual in and of itself. In addition, the instructor decides to cold-call students in lecture, which is rather daunting considering the material is advertised as not necessitating any prior experience and the fact that there is a massive range of musical knowledge within the students of the class. It was also very evident that students began to avoid sitting in the front during lecture, opting instead to sit in the very back where it was hard to hear, just to avoid the cold calls of the professor. In the sections of the course, the TAs were highly knowledgeable of the material, but so much so that their tone was very often condescending and their teaching style was unhelpful.",
                "Strengths: Manageable workload and fun assignments, interesting lectures, teaches you what it promises to teach you. \r\nWeaknesses: Definitely helps to have some basic music theory knowledge or just basic music experience to understand some stuff when she breaks down songs. Not necessary, but helps.",
                "I enjoyed the pieces played at the beginning of each class, and always was excited to see how it fit in the story of the day. The biographical information was really interesting in how it influenced the pieces! Professor Kreuzer was really interesting to listen to each class, and section was helpful but nice that you didnt have to go to every week if it was a hectic time of year.",
                "I think the scope of the course is really large and I felt like it was difficult to be able to tell what things I was going to be tested on later because there was so much information, but that might just be the nature of history classes. Everything else was great",
                "Great overview.",
                "I thought in terms of a timeline and topics covered, I thought that this course did a pretty good job of covering a little bit of everything. However, sometimes I feel like certain topics were a bit rushed.",
                "Strengths:\r\nI like what I learned \r\nWeaknesses\r\nLess people. Focus on the biggest ones. It was too much material and a harder class than it should have been. People want to take this class for fun and for the love of learning\r\nToo strict on attending class/being allowed to watch lecture from home",
                "Strengths: Very interesting material that spanned a wide variety of topics\r\nWeaknesses: Very much a survey into major topics of western music history, so if you're looking for a more in-depth class, this probably won't be a great fit",
                "Strengths: Prof. Kreuzer is incredibly organized, and the TAs were super helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lectures felt long",
                "engaging lectures, fair + well-structured assignments and assessments, interesting material. not quite chronological which was confusing at times but overall helped with understanding course themes",
                "One of the worst courses Ive ever taken at Yale. Professor Kreuzer is less interested in getting the best out of her students or providing them with a healthy environment to learn than playing one big game of gotcha. This course was billed as one that no prior music experience was required for, yet each and every exam or written was highly technical and required extensive knowledge of music theory, far more than what one could expect to learn in 10 short weeks. I would never recommend this course, or any course taught by Professor Kreuzer, to any friends in the future.",
                "Its really a history of classical music. Not a lot of emphasis on other genres.",
                "The interactive lecture format of the course paired with a weekly section was a strength of the course. There is an incredible amount of content and section was helpful to hone in on the most important information and to rehearse information that may have been forgotten since lecture. The lectures being 75-minutes, though necessary for the amount of content covered, made it difficult at times to remain engaged as lectures include both a high volume of content and a longer duration.",
                "It can be more interactive. It was very informative.",
                "Everything is perfect!",
                "Strengths: Good survey of music history, especially for someone like me who plays a bit of saxophone but couldnt (previously) distinguish Schumann from Chopin. Listening exercises force you to think about what youre hearing. \r\nWeaknesses: After jazz unit, I feel that we should have listened to pop/rock  even the textbook included it, but we just focused on chance/minimalism/process music.\r\nOne random thing that could be improved: we got a word bank at the beginning of the semester with words like timbre and meter  would have been super cool/helpful to have a more comprehensive word bank of ~examples~ of those things. Would have been helpful for listening early in the course.",
                "The content was not organized in a way that was conducive to engaged learning, especially for people who do not have a musical background. The instructor assumed a relatively high bar of understanding after explicitly stating that the course was for complete beginners. After asking for feedback on assignments that didn't receive a desired grade, there was very little specificity and no clear direction for improvement.",
                "I don't recall any specific strengths or weaknesses, it was just a good class overall",
                "It was a fun class! The class was pretty big but the TAs managed to keep the level of engagement high. I liked going to lecturesvery concise and to the point!",
                "Strengths: first half of the course! The class was well-designed explaining the histories/contexts of a wide variety of important composers.\r\nWeaknesses: after the midterm, the content felt somewhat obscure and slightly less relevant to the big picture of music history. The course spends a puzzling amount of time on experimental/abstract serialist music while largely neglecting important developments in western music such as film scoring, the evolution of jazz, and early rock music.",
                "The strengths of this course were that if you were already somewhat knowledgeable about classical music, you could get more in-depth info about well-known composers, pieces, and trends, in addition to learning lots of new works. One weakness is that it felt as though to do well, you needed to just regurgitate information rather than critically consider it."

                "if youre interested about music and its history- yes! this class is a brief overview of trends from the 1800s and is relatively low stress. as long as you pay attention in class you will get a lot out of it.",
                "If it was with a different instructor, I would recommend this course to another student.

                "Yes! If you're somone who has a classical music background and doesn't have too much knowledge of WAM history, this course will be super chill but still very engaging. If you don't have that background, the course will still be chill + very engaging, but you might have to put in more effort on listening assignments and such",
                "Absolutely not see above.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another studentwith an asterisk. I expected this course to be a fun, easier course, and students are expected to engage somewhat highly, recall a significant amount of content for exams including many different composers, pieces, historical events, and genres of music, and at the end of the semester, to take a listening quiz where they need to blindly recognize eight pieces of music from 1800 to the present. The content is extremely interesting and engaging, but needless to say, it is not an easy course! The workload is less than other courses I've taken, but the rigor is definitely the same.",
                "Yes, if you have interest in classical Western music, you should take it.",
                "Yes! This class is so beautiful!",
                "Absolutely not. Worst class I have taken at Yale.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student with little background in music history. I found myself loving some units and being utterly disengaged with other lectures, but it was definitely worth it to discover Mussorgsky, Joplin, and a few others. Moreover, the listening gave me the musical skills to articulate certain elements of a composition, which is something I couldnt do before.",
                "I would not. The course material is organized poorly to facilitate connection with and deeper understanding of the material. The instructor and TA's were difficult to work with, and the other students were also frustrated.",
