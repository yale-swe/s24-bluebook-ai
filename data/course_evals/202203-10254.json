                "Learned about the First Amendment's freedom of speech protection and its exceptions. Discussed various hot-button issues that face the First Amendment, like fighting words, obscenity, and compelled speech.",

By the end of the course, I feel like I have a really good understanding of First Amendment law and how misunderstood it really is.",
                "Learn about analyzing legal issues. Obvious strong focus on the first Amendment and free speech. Learn about fighting words and breach of the peace, etc. \r\n\r\nGood seminar skills. How to conduct yourself in a more flexible space."

                "The course covers great material, has a caring and passionate instructor, and is the perfect size. It is rare to take a seminar with 13 people and really wonderful. I also liked the attention both to state and to federal cases which enhanced my perspective. Perhaps the weakest part of the class are the rounds of discussion about what people feel/believe about morality, not law. They tend to get repetitive or abstract. I preferred when we accepted the complexities of law and had to account for them in our moral discussions. Abstract right and wrong I find uninteresting when compared to concrete right and wrong in the world in which we live.",
                "strengths: you cover a bunch of topics, discussion is always great, articles/cases are usually interesting. weaknesses: a lot of reading, its late at night, the direction of discussion is pretty open (some like this some dont).",
                "The course is designed to make you think about complicated cases concerning freedom of speech and where you stand in relation to them. It's one of the few Yale classes I've taken that I've really had to question my personal ethics rather than taking for granted the mass opinion. KG is a wonderfully kind professor who wants all her students to succeed. I will say some times the classes felt like a long discussion where people were just trying to make their opinions heard. It would be best if there was a pared-down list of questions prior to the class rather than the 10 or so KG usually sends. Also, a primer on the judicial and courts system at the beginning of the class would be really helpful.",
                "This course offers a good overview of the First Amendment and the complexities of balancing freedom of speech with other compelling government interests. Most of the class efforts are focused on responding to weekly prompts and questions. I think the class could be improved if the midterm and final assignments offered greater lenience for students to come up with our own First Amendment arguments, instead of summarizing other people's arguments.",
                "KG is 100% the best part about this course: she is incredibly passionate and caring about her students, and she is incredibly knowledgable about the case law. This is likely one of the best courses at Yale, and if you ever have the opportunity to enroll you MUST take it! There is absolutely no weakness I can think of.",
                "KG is the obvious strength. An incredible professor who creates a wonderful space. I really liked when she picked students to speak on certain readings. It helped to keep the conversation centered and not going all over the place. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses. Sometimes a bit disorganized. But usually students fault."

                "yes!! among other things to look for in a class, one important metric is interestingness to easiness ration. This class totally maxes that ratio. it is super interesting given that the workload isnt particularly bad. Other classes may be easier, and others may be more interesting. But this class has a lot of both.",
                "Definitely! If you're interested in law and free speech or just want to understand more about the American judicial system and importance of the first amendment you absolutely should",
                "Yes! KG is great and the class was very relaxed. It was an opportunity to discuss the First Amendment in a low-pressure environment where everyone's opinions were encouraged and conversation was facilitated so that all could participate. If you are interested in the First Amendment, this is a great course.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! KG is very warm and welcoming, and class is always very fun.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. This course is a must-take if you are at all interested in the law. KG is an amazing professor and is without question the best part of the course.",
                "Yes totally!\r\n\r\nIncredible. KG is the best. If you dont get in this semester keep trying. PLSC majors, make sure you apply through EPE preregistration. You need to (at least for the past few years)."
