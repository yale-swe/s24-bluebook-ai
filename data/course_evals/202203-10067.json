                "This course was basically one big research paper plus a little bit of lecturing, it mainly taught me how to independently work on a large writing assignment and how to search for sources.",
                "I learned about Spanish colonization of the Southwest through the lens of the experiences of Indigenous people. The class largely focused on New Mexico and California, but took an expansive view of the Spanish borderlands from Florida across to California. The second half of the class taught us how to construct a research project using archival research, culminating in a 15-page paper.",
                "I learned so much in this class some of it the easy way and some of it the hard way. I learned much about indigenous California and the rest of the borderlands. Importantly I learned about the recentering of American history and how reframing can shape the way we understand history. This class also taught me much about how to write college-level papers as well as seek out professors for office hours.",

            "comments": [
                "The readings were rarely integrated into the discussion, usually only one or two of them would really have time to be addressed in-class. There also wasn't a lot of lecture material to accompany the sources, so it was hard to know what takeaways we were supposed to have from each class. I would improve this course by providing a little more advance direction about what we should focus on in the readings.",
                "I appreciated all the time we spent on formulating our research process, and the chance to become an expert in a niche area. The readings covered the gamut of borderlands scholarship from its inception, which left me feeling like I understood the field pretty well. This class was supposed to be a seminar, but it felt more like a lecture-seminar hybrid with less student participation than other seminars I've been in.",
                "It was difficult to tell what was expected and when during the second half of the semester--the syllabus gave vague deadlines for assignments that were never mentioned in class but would have helped build up the large final paper if we actually did them.",
                "Strengths would be that the information was always presented in an interesting way and the readings were also extremely interesting. The class discussion was also always lively and never dull. Weaknesses would be organization and feedback.",
                "I think having class discussions centered more around the readings or particular readings would have helped my learning in this course."

                "This was pretty good as a writing credit, as the final paper was big but we had plenty of time to work on it. As a history course I was somewhat underwhelmed, it felt like the ratio of content covered to class time was pretty low. I would recommend this to history students who need a writing credit, and maybe STEM students who need a writing credit. If you're interested in studying the Spanish Empire or (like me) have an interest in Indigenous peoples of the Americas, then I would still recommend the course to get your \"fix\" for this sort of content. The content that we covered, though we didn't spend as much time on it as I would have liked, was very unique compared to any other class I've taken at Yale or in high school. On sheer novelty of the content, that is notable.",
                "I would recommend this class as a great pre-industrial credit for the History major. It's also a great option for AMST majors or anyone interested in or from the Southwest/California. This class would be a good foundation for junior History majors interested in exploring the Spanish colonial period for their senior thesis.",
                "the entire second half of this course is devoted to the research paper, which means that it can be hard to stay engaged with the class during those weeks because there isn't any reading or much group learning going on. it means the class has a low workload but the final paper is still a bit daunting. prof blackhawk is great but im not sure i would recommend this course unless you're already familiar with native american history and/or the spanish borderlands."
