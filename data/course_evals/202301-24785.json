We discussed everything from Irish boy bands to Eurovision, Guinness, Irish pubs, Enya, country music, and Irish-American history. Through the lens of Irish music, we were able to analyze race, gender, nationalism, migration, international relations, the music industry, and diaspora. Going forward, I'll be better equipped to approach new music topics from an academic lens.",

                "The organization of this class made it such a high point of my semester. The professors did an amazing job immersing us in a deep dive of Irish popular music, taking an unfamiliar topic and breaking it down using musicological concepts. We got to do interactive work, like an ethnography, a fiddle workshop with a local musician, and a Zoom call with one of the authors we read. Most of us came from a non-music major background, but the professors engaged us on topics like architecture and history that were familiar to us.",

For non-music people, this is an accessible way to start learning about musicology. For people with a musical background, I also recommend this course because it's an interesting and new subject, and popular music studies is underrepresented in academic musicology.",
