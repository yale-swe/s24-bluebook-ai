                "I developed knowledge about Jazz in the USA from the 1900s-1960s. This included musicians, how jazz changed, and where\/how it originated and grew.",
                "I gained more understanding of jazz history, its origins, and the complexitiesmusically, interpersonally, and politicallyof the world of jazz.",
                "I gained a much deeper knowledge of and appreciation for jazz history from 1900-1960 in the U.S.! From key information about notable musicians to nuanced analyses of the racial politics at play in and around the music, I feel like a much more informed and active listener and scholar when it comes to jazz \/ early 1900's American pop music. I was also happy to learn more about jazz protocols and get real listening practice so that I could identity jazz form and idioms while listening.",
                "I learned about parts of jazz that I was unfamiliar with. I also was unfamiliar with the origins of Jazz.",
                "Leaned about the different styles of jazz, important figures in the world of jazz, and history behind all of it.",
                "This is a great class to delve into jazz in a formal, coherent way and gain and understanding of the course of its history. You always discover a lot of music.",

                "Great class! I thought the lectures were engaging. You should definitely listen to the spotify playlists alongside the lectures to really get a sense of the music.",
                "I think assessments can line up more with what we are learning about and talking about in class. Especially for the last two assignments, I feel like we didn't spend enough time in class learning about those topics, so it was really difficult to form my own thoughts because I didn't have a strong grasp of the content.",
                "Strengths: Professor is very knowledgable and class assignments (all written assignments) felt like a good fit for the material. Class is well geared towards students both with and without music backgrounds.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Main weakness was the course asked for too much reading that wasn't gone over in the class, as well as a generally unorganized lecture structure.",
                "The course was very successful at engaging me with the material. I was intrinsically motivated to show up with curiosity to lectures, prepare for discussions, etc. There's a huge variety of different lenses on the material in the syllabus, from playlists to scholarly analyses to reviews from Down Beat, which I thought was fascinating.\r\n\r\nMy sole complaint is that I wish there had been a more consolidated syllabus with clear deadlines and dates for major assignments and exams. which wwould have made it easier to plan in advance",
                "I enjoyed the throughline built throughout the course.\r\n\r\nHowever, I wish that Brian would upload his lecture notes, as the slideshow is very unhelpful.",
                "Lectures felt really long sometimes; Professor wouldn't get to the point clearly. However, Professor is very knowledgeable and excited about the content. One of the biggest cons for me was the sections.  The content basically mirrored the lecture, so if you paid attention to lecture, you didn't have to go to section because it would be a waste of time.  Not only that, the TAs were learning the content along with us, so we couldn't really go to them for deeper learning. Each of the TAs had different content and expectations for grading, so your overall score really depended on the TA.  One TA would give 100s to their students because \"they didn't feel kike grading\" while the other had extremely high expectations on the content of the papers.",
                "It could be improved by perhaps involving more discussion. It felt very much based on the course of history rather than the significance. As such it was less engaging despite being interesting content. It was a lot of long lectures that didnt engage the class too much.",
                "Strength: Professor Kane is a wonderful lecturer. Strength and weakness: It's clear the readings aren't mandatory for this course, which is nice because it takes pressure off, but I also wish there had been a little more structure encouraging us to do a few of them.",
                "Strengths: the papers were really fun to write, low workload, engaging material \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the lectures felt a little long",
                "Syllabus is well-organized\r\nCould have weekly checkpoints\/quizzes\r\nThe essays were broad enough to require a good understanding of the course material but specific enough to allow further research into a particular topic"

                "Yes! It's a low-workload lecture about a really interesting topic. I think I gained a lot of cultural knowledge and you can really make the course what you want -- we wrote a paper about the relationship between a jazz musician and U.S. foreign policy, for example. You don't need any background in jazz music.",
                "If you're very into Jazz I'm sure you'd love it.",
                "If you have any interest in jazz, how American music came to be the way it is today, and\/or U.S. history in general, go for it! The lectures and readings are fascinating and you'll come out with a deeper appreciation of jazz and music history.",
                "I would! Especially if you are interested in early popular music and how it intersects with history.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn more about 1900-1960 Jazz.",
                "Absolutely. Prof. Kane is really knowledgeable and creates a great classroom environment. Never boring, with good opportunities to practice all kinds of assessments.",
                "I would for sure recommend this course. Lectures were always very lively thanks to Prof. Kane, and the material was very interesting to me, even though I came into the class only slightly interested in Jazz. Sometimes discussion sections could be a little less engaging, but it was still helpful. The two essays were fairly short, and the mid term and final \"essays\" were surprisingly fun to write. There was a lot a lot of reading for the class, but it was not necessary to do well in the course, but it's worth reading if you have the time.",
                "Definitely! This is a great 5th credit",
                "For a fellow jazz enthusiast definitely",
                "Yes, fantastic class.  Fun, interesting, and I learned a lot with a low workload.  Lectures are engaging, readings were great (but more or less optional), and I even looked forward to sections.  I had no music background going into this course either.",
                "Yes, it's a solid introduction to jazz for those who haven't studied it previously. The workload is not very intense, so this is a good way to fulfill any course requirements. As with any course, you will get more out of it if you do the assigned readings and listenings."
