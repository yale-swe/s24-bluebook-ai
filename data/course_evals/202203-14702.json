                "I learned an incredible amount in this course; from the book of Exodus to Plato's Republic to Aquinas' Treatise on Law, we covered material from an unfathomably large curriculum. We learned about the political origins of civilization, what defines different political communities, how cities, nations, and even empires rise and fall, what it takes to govern effectively, and so much more. The course was one that provided me with a broad underpinning to political theory, and for that, I am very grateful.\r\n\r\nAs for skills, I think time management and paper writing are at the top. Learning how to churn out a cogent, original, and persuasive piece of writing in a short period of time is not something I had previously done. The structure of DS allowed me to hone this skill (particularly under a time crunch), and that is something that I will carry with me not only throughout the remainder of college, but probably (and hopefully) for the rest of my life.",
                "I definitely improved my reading skills in reading ancient Greek and Roman texts. I haven't read any of the texts we encountered and didn't have a religious upbringing, so the texts and the discussions definitely pushed me out of my\r\ncomfort zone and definitely improved my analysis of these texts when reading them as a whole. My appreciation of classics and this time period has greatly improved. These really are foundational texts that I'm glad I read. The learning curve is very real and very intense (for me, coming from a magnet, STEM-oriented, public high school education) in terms of reading workload and essay writing and preparation, but there's a lot of support. The design of the program overall helped me with time management and reading\/writing skills, all of which I am grateful for.",

Writing structure also demands fast-paced but high-quality turnout, honing a skill that many do not have previously.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Pace of the course leads to overlooking of critical passages. I'm also not sure that so much of Plato's Republic needs to be in the course, other than perhaps books 5-8. We never discuss the education of leaders in other texts, and that element of the Republic always seemed less important in the context of H&P.",
                "Strengths: the starters (which I dreaded but once I did it, it wasn't so bad) , the people, the insights, the interesting lectures\r\nWeaknesses: just an absurd amount of reading most of the times, but that's by design I suppose",
                "Strengths: Great discussions, great essay feedback, very engaging and extremely knowledgeable. Good system of \"starters\" (you run the class for the first 20 minutes at least once during the semester)\r\nWeaknesses: Difficult to think of any. This is a more obscure critique, but rarely with certain topics Professor Thompson would sometimes hold steadfast to a particular reading or analysis of the text. She would always gladly welcome disagreement and counterarguments from students, but occasionally she would prepositioned to analyze the text in a certain way",

In fact, if somebody was hesitant about taking DS, I would still encourage them to take a course with Professor Thompson.\r\n\r\nAs for DS writ large, I would recommend it only if someone is interested in ideas. Coming into DS, I had had no previous exposure to the Western Canon, and I was not particularly keen on taking two literature courses. What excited me, however, was the structure of the course. Having completed one semester, I now feel as though it is the content that I found most rewarding. I don't mean to say that the DS content is better than anything I've ever read (and I've certainly read more interesting texts), but the ideas embedded within DS works are beautiful and multilayered and, quite frankly, fascinating. So my recommendation for someone considering DS would be this: take the course if you are interested in grappling with new ideas, and take the class if you want to improve your writing. Only if they meet these two criteria would I recommend DS.",

I had extremely limited experience with these\r\ntexts coming it, but I wanted to try it out and overall I would recommend it. It is intense and\r\ndifficult but really rewarding: you get out of it as much as you put into it, and by design, this\r\ncourse asks you to put a lot into it. It's a beautifully design liberal arts education, and I\r\nguaranteed it's hard to regret doing it, even if it feels too difficult at times.",
