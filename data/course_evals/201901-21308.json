   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about what goes into making a good song and the theory behind what sounds good and bad.",
    "I learned how to read music and rhythms, develop my own compositions in a style of interest, critically analyze historical pieces to identify musical elements of interest, and I learned some good music history along the way.",
    "I learned a lot about patterns in music, and how to write and understand music. We also did a lot of performance, so my singing and piano ability definitely improved.",
    "I learned a significant amount about music theory and a fair amount on music history and the different ways that music scholars study and approach the topic. I was also able to hone in on a single composer and piece of music during presentations and so learned quite a lot about that individual and that composition.",
    "I learned about all the basics of music."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course could be better for those who have no previous background but the assignments are engaging and fun.",
    "It felt like there were constantly assessments and assignments which was a bit unrelenting at times. I think maybe toning back a bit on either quizzes or practicals would have made it less stressful.",
    "I think there was too much focus on sight-singing toward the end of the course but it was mostly very good. I think we got a lot of historical context for the music we were learning about while also getting a good grounding in harmony and music theory.",
    "Strengths: Fun and engaging. The syllabus is well-organized and can be tailored to match the skill level of the class. A good balance between learning theory and doing practical assignments (compositions, playing, etc.)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A very occasional lack of specificity on some of the assignments, which sometimes led to misunderstandings.",
    "It covers a lot of  material which is helpful to understanding music in general, but as someone who didn't have a lot of background in music, I found it very hard to keep up at times."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I recommend if you are interested in music writing and would like to do something with music in the future.",
    "If you dont know any music theory and want to learn, these really are the basics. It can be kind of annoying if you have people in your class that already know a lot of the stuff, but it is good to start from square 1.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The workload is not very high, but that doesn't mean that you can slack off. The material is usually built off of previous material-- if you're learning how to read music in the class (which is the first thing), then you can't just wait until you move on to the next thing because literally everything in the course relies on reading music (this is just an example). I feel that many students take this class because they feel like it will be an easy credit or something, and the class isn't particularly difficult, but it was obvious in some classes that nobody was prepared to discuss the material. I think that a student taking this class should be willing to take it seriously.",
    "Yes, it wasnt too difficult and it helped me learn a lot about music.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were a musician, regardless of skill level. I would hesitate to recommend it to someone with no musical experience whatsoever, only because the course moves VERY quickly. I personally would have been very overwhelmed if I did not already possess background knowledge.",
    "Yes and no. Be prepared for the workload. It will vary based on your TA, but it is a lot of busy work. However, I learned a lot I guess."
