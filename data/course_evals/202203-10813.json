                "Rachel Diethorn is an excellent instructor. Her guided notes and teaching style are very helpful and she is able to simply difficult concepts. The class is taught and organized very well. The psets and exams are graded very thoroughly which is helpful for understanding things you did wrong, and Rachel's office hours are helpful. Some of the parts of this course meant for engagement like the explorations, professor stories, and learning strategies were not very useful to improving my learning.",
                "The notes offered were great.\r\n\r\nThe pace of this course could be improved, it could go a little slower to make sure students have established foundational skills before moving on.",
                "Strengths: Rachel Diethorn, the instructor! Rachel is an amazing math teacher. She always brings a perfect, productive, quirky energy to class. She explains every concept in a manner that is easy to understand, takes very thorough notes on an iPad that are projected during class and posted to Canvas, and makes herself very accessible to students in class and during office hours. This course offers peer tutoring sessions at night, office hours, and review sessions before exams for students seeking extra help. The problem sets are very effective for practicing concepts, and there are ample practice resources before each exam. The grading for this course, through Gradescope, is fair and clear, so it is easy to know how you are doing in the course as it progresses. While calculus might not be the most interesting subject for many students, Rachel gets the job done very well.\r\nWeaknesses: The online \"Explore\" modules due before each class are not very helpful and are essentially busy work. Similarly, the \"calculus stories\" modules don't seem very relevant to the course.",
                "great, Rachel is awesome. wish there were more practice Qs, the tests were pretty hard",

                "The medium sized classes helps to balance the lecture style with in class participation which works well with math.",
                "I loved my section of this course because Rachel was an incredible professor: she was organized, straightforward, approachable, and humorous. I really appreciated how she assembled a packet of notes for each class period and walked us through the packet on her iPad with different colors. However, having spoken to some of my peers enrolled in the same course but different sections, I think there was a wide range of experiences depending on people's professors which may have put some students at a disadvantage.",
                "The topics in the class were organized in a great manner because they built off of each other super well.  The class could be improved by providing examples in class that are as difficult as those that we see on the exams so that students feel more confident and prepared going into exams.",

                "Strengths: Rachel is amazing and helped so much and the way she taught the class was easy to follow\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: calc 2 here is not meant for those who have limited knowledge of calc 2 so it feels very confusing and as if you cant build the skills if you dont already have previous knowledge",
                "This course is taught very thoroughly and it made my understanding of the material rock solid by the end of the semester. The explore assignments were useful in preparing us for the material.",
                "It was very well laid out. I think the number of resources that this course offers to students is a great help. The review sessions at the end of the term for the final exam were great. I think the main weakness is just student specific--I didn't find the class as engaging as I'd hoped but it could just be that the material wasn't as interesting to me.",
                "One strength of this course that may be specific to my professor is the worksheets that she gave us which were very helpful for organization, especially for students who were working on paper. There were also a great amount of practice problems for each unit which was very helpful.",
                "Some of the TAs created stigma regarding not doing well in the course making it difficult to seek help outside of class."

She is a fantastic math teacher, and you will come out of this course with a solid understanding of Calc II. Be careful signing up for sections of this course, because certain other instructors may be inexperienced. Rachel, however, organizes the course very well, gives very clear explanations of each concept, and provides thorough notes in class and online so that you will surely learn the material. The main graded elements are weekly problem sets of textbook problems, two midterms, and a final exam.",

Rachel was a great professor and if I ever felt myself struggling with a topic, she always cleared things up. Various resources were available for clarification\/extra help, and many practice problems were always provided to help prepare for an exam. I have no complaints about this class, it was much easier than expected and I never felt underprepared.",
                "Yes I would. It was not too difficult to just focus primarily on learning as a result of the many available resources.",
