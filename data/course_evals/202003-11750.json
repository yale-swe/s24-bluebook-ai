The focus is primarily on groups, covering material through quotient groups, isomorphism theorems, Sylow theorems, direct\/semi-direct products, and classification results. We then gave a brief treatment of rings with some applications in cryptography.",

For the first few weeks I was pretty clueless why the things we learned were actually important, but the more you learn the more you understand how things you fit together and the more you appreciate the beauty of the math. This class definitely helps you improve your proof writing skills. The homework is pretty intense and is NOT graded for completion, but the graders give good feedback and can really help you improve as long as you read them.",

Everything you learn is fundamentally connected to other mathematical tools and arguments you use frequently throughout the course (psets directly enhance your understanding of WHY things are what they are... psets are rigorous but rewarding).",

                "I think the best part of this course is the use of breakout room and jamboards. Miki encourages student working together in class. \r\nAlso the course has a clear structure and well-taught.",
                "This course is very strong.  Miki is a great lecturer and is also very kind and generous with her time.  She lectures very clearly and designs psets well so as to reinforce and expand on core material.  Grades were usually returned decently quickly.  The class has no significant weaknesses, but it is certainly a lot of work and has higher proof-writing standards than an intro class like MATH230.  But all the work is 'good work' rather than busywork.",
                "This course is really good, and when compared to other Yale math courses, it is great - it's likely my favorite math class I've taken at Yale. Miki is a fantastic instructor that cares deeply about the success of every student. The homework assignments were helpful, and Miki was very accessible and always happy to answer questions \/ provide a nudge in the right direction. The course is about 2\/3 groups and 1\/3 rings - I personally found groups much more interesting and would have liked to spend more time with them. The rings content was more rushed and we didn't get very deep into it, so the results and work with rings was not as satisfying. I realize knowing rings is likely important for students continuing onto Math 370. I would have also appreciated more clear feedback on the homework, i.e. a framework of a solution rather than just being told my answer was wrong.",
                "The course is challenging in a good way. If you do the homework and study, you will come away with a deep knowledge of abstract algebra. The main weakness is that the exams are only 45 minutes, which means that it is hard to get a good grade in the class if you are a slow test-taker.",
                "Strengths: Very engaging with plenty of applications, Miki made class run very smoothly in the virtual format, great ULA's, I found small group tutorial particularly helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not many at all. The only thing I would suggest is longer, more involved problems on the exams as opposed to many short ones to do in a small amount of time.",
                "Really well structure course, interesting topics. Weakness is that it is really time consuming and it can just be too much at times.",
                "I thought this course was done incredibly well, especially given that it was online. The level of engagement was high and I found both the lectures and preclass components to be incredibly useful.",
                "This class is very well organized",
                "Overall, a very strong course. At the beginning of the course, there was a definite feeling that the content was a bit unmotivated. For me, and the way I like to learn math, that wasnt a huge problem, but it is something to consider in taking this course.",
                "Grades were returned promptly and with helpful feedback. TAs were extremely helpful and friendly. Although the material is plentiful and difficult, there are many opportunities to ask for help.",
                "Unbelievably fantastic lecturer, the course is really well thought out.",
                "This class was excellent. Miki is the strength of this class, she is great at teaching and pours all her energy into making sure the class is perfect. She pre records lectures that are wonderful and always teaches with a clear plan. The only change I would suggest is that pre-class components had a little less work. They often take almost an hour to fully digest. The ULAs are also great and the feedback is very helpful.",
                "The course is very rigorous, there is a lot of work, and it moves very quickly, but Miki puts in a lot of effort to make sure that everyone is keeping up. I wouldn't change anything.",
                "Strengths: clear and superbly delivered lectures, great support through office hours and study sessions, and a fascinating subject. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: felt like we tried to squeeze in ring theory at the end too quickly. Either cutting some group-theoretic topics or eliminating rings would make for a more focused and satisfying treatment of the material.",
                "Strengths: The professor. I always looked forward to the lectures and this class was just crazy organized in general. Also, the material is quite dry and reading the textbook alone was definitely not enough for me to build intuition of the concepts, so having a great professor who can walk you through the material was super helpful. The homework feedback were also super detailed. Weaknesses: The textbook is comprehensive but some of the explanations are too tedious and many are \"left as exercises to the reader\", which is sometimes annoying.",
                "The time distributed between groups and rings was too uneven, and the final 3 weeks felt especially rushed.  Even from the textbook, though, it felt like they compress 6 chapters of material on groups into 2 chapters of material for rings.",
                "Absolutely incredible course: Miki is so dedicated to making it great, and the teaching staff was fantastic.",
                "I think that the course was well structured and there were a lot of opportunities for help in office hours.",
                "I think this class did an excellent job at making me a better logical thinker and mathematician. I also feel like I have a very good understanding of elementary group and ring theory, which excellently prepared me for future classes like Math370.\r\nI think one thing this class could improve on is making out-of-class components more interactive, perhaps providing more sources for outside help (the current tutorial system doesn't feel like it does a lot to help students understand difficult materials), and maybe adding weekly quizzes to ensure a better understanding of the course material as we go. In addition, I think a more clear feedback on problem sets, both on proofwriting mistakes and logical errors, would be very helpful.",
                "Groups are your friend, and you get really used to them! As for Rings, however, I felt there wasn't enough time at the end of the course to digest all of the Ring definitions and develop a sense of intuition. It felt like there weren't as many concrete examples provided.",
                "The class is very well-constructed in that it gives a friendly introduction to all the important algebraic objects in abstract algebra. (Groups and rings and fields, oh my!) I liked how selectively Miki insistently proved key theorems and jumped over details that weren't horribly important. I would have liked homework problems to be a bit smaller in number, but also to be much harder.",
                "MATH 350 was overall a really great course. It was extremely rigorous, with fast-paced lectures and difficult problem sets. This level of rigor was helpful in developing solid proof writing skills, but also meant that the coursework took up a lot of my time. Considering how much support was available to us however, I dont think this was a failing. Overall I cant think of a way this course could be improved.",
                "Everything, including the lecture, pre-lecture quizzes, and assignments, was well organized and very helpful.",
                "I think Miki and the teaching staff would be the main strength of this course. This semester, the ULAs and Miki really made an effort to make sure to make everyone feel welcome in the course. The lectures and the tutorial sessions were really clear and helpful, and the assignments and exams were very reasonable, and I learned a lot. Also, as a cherry on top, the material itself is really interesting. I wouldn't say there are any weaknesses in this course."

Office hours with Miki and the ULAs were often and clearly advertised.  Obviously, collaborative work and finding study groups is more difficult, but this is no fault of the class.",
                "The breakout rooms were not fun and were rarely helpful. I liked the in-class polls and pre-class quizzes. The bi-weekly ULA study groups were not very helpful (although they were optional after the first one).",
                "Of all the classes I took this semester, this one (thanks to Miki) handled the new methods of teaching the best. Class was made as engaging as I think it could have been, with plenty of polls, healthy amounts of low stakes group work (using a shared whiteboard on Google Jamboards). I found bi-weekly small group tutorial particularly nice, and I think more math courses should work to incorporate something like this.",
                "Classes and peer tutor worked well. I just think that because it was online, much more was expected outside of class time. Pre class videos, stopping to take notes and understand them could take up to 20-30 minnow which 3 times a week really adds up on top of the other stuff. I just felt like the fact that it was online added a bunch of components to the class, which made it feel suffocating at times.",

                "They were a lot of work, but I appreciated having the preclass videos and quizzes. It's definitely easy to fall behind in a course when everything is online and lectures are recorded (a feature which undoubtedly saved me in this class), but the preclass components made it necessary to at least keep up with the material for every class. I always sort of knew what was going on because of them. I think otherwise I would have been a lot more confused during class and needed to rewatch the recorded lectures many more times.",
                "Of all my professors and courses this semester, Miki handled the remote teaching the best. It was fantastic. Her combination of pre-written slides with live working-out was a perfect balance, and she did a fantastic job of integrating questions into the lecture as easily as in an in person setting. I dont think that anything needs to change.",

                "Miki put us into breakout rooms of 3-4 people roughly once per lecture to do group work, which I really liked, since it was one of the only times that I got to talk and work directly with classmates this semester.",
                "Breakout room problem solving sessions were a success!\r\n\r\nThis is my only class that did live Zoom-proctored exams, and although I see the need for a high-pressure test to promote rigorous studying of the material, I felt that the time limit on these exams was a bit over the top. Other classes did take home exams with deeper, more involved questions, and I thought these exams allowed me to engage with the material in a more rewarding way than the timed 350 exams (which mostly involved drilling basic examples for speed).",
                "Lectures were great and exam review sessions were really helpful. Not sure if the preclass quizzes were actually helpful in terms of my understanding of the material because I usually just tried to get over with them late at night instead of actually trying to process them, but I appreciate how they made me keep up with the material to certain degree.",
                "I think the tutorial sessions were a great addition during covid times. But if they were more frequent that might be even better.",
                "Although COVID-19 presented unique challenges to the class environment, I think this class was not severely impacted (since it's a large lecture to begin with, there is not that much interaction during class sessions). That being said, I think there was a lack of communication and relationship-bonding within the class due to being remote, something I think could be worked on.",
                "This course was actually very well COVID-adjusted. I felt very cared for by Miki (who sends many emails and canvas messages) and the ULAs. I didn't like having to pre-class components, but that's because I'm lazy and prefer to compartmentalize work. The classes were often a bit too short, which the groupwork didn't help. I would have preferred to have had less group work over zoom.",
                "I thought that office hours and ULA study groups functioned very well. However I thought that the ULA tutorial system should have been a bigger component of the course, with more meetings and mandatory attendance.",
                "The pre-class assignments helped me keep on top of the material."

                "I would recommend this course to students interested in topics in algebra. The topics are challenging but core to math students, and by the end of semester I did learn a lot.",
                "100% recommend - this is an absolutely fantastic class.  Miki is a fabulous professor who lectures clearly, and the class has tons of support from her and the ULAs.  The material is fascinating, and I also found the textbook to be very nice and clear with good excercises.  I would say that even for somebody who has taken MATH 230\/231, this class can be difficult and a lot of work at times, but it's all very clearly worth it.  It's also a great foundation for future classes, but most of all it's just fun and great.  If you like math, this is a must take.  If you don't like math, however, I imagine it might be quite the slog.  Doing well is far from impossible, but take this class because you want to learn cool math rather than because you want an A.",
                "Yes, this is a great course that you should absolutely take if Miki is teaching. The content is likely completely new, which is exciting after possible years of analysis and linear algebra. While the course takes a lot of time, the difficulty is mostly because the material is entirely new, so there's a lot to cover and a lot of new ideas to familiarize yourself with (rather than the material being impossibly difficult or confusing - it's not). Also, go to office hours with Miki! She is very helpful.",
                "If you have any interest in abstract algebra, I highly recommend this course. Just be aware that the course requires a significant amount of time, so if you are already taking a heavy course load, maybe push this course off to another semester.",
                "I took this as a physics and math major (sophomore). Though abstract algebra hasn't played a big role in any of my physics courses yet, I'm very glad I took this class simply because it was fun. Algebra is definitely a new flavor of math, and I think the way it's taught is a perfect introduction to it. We had time at the end of the semester (2 lectures) to talk about RSA cryptography, which was a nice culmination of the material.",
                "yes, but make sure this is the priority of the semester. If you feel like you will enjoy this course, then you will. the material is very rewarding and opens up a whole world of math. You have to make sure you have the time and the emotional energy to put into the course.",
                "I would most definitely recommend this course in that I found it useful for both advancing my math knowledge as well as my general proofing skills. The professor was also fantastic and engaging.",
                "Yes, I wish I could have taken this class much earlier in my Yale education. It really teaches you how to think and problem solve and gave me a really fresh view of many basic ideas in math.",
                "I cannot recommend this course highly enough. The material was engaging, the problem sets interesting, the ULAs and teaching team were fantastic. It was an extremely positive experience. Im the one note I would make is that, at the beginning, some of the material felt a bit unmotivated. This wasnt a huge problem for me, but is something to note.",
                "You must have a strong interest in proof based theoretical math to enjoy this course. With that being said, if you do, you will love this course, Miki is an incredible teacher and lecturer, and the material is new and exciting.",
                "Yes, if you're willing to work very hard. If you're a math major and you love algebra, you will love this class.",
                "This is the best math class I have ever taken, even though I prefer analysis and this class was online. So it is a must take.",
                "The course is certainly very difficult but it gets you thinking about math in a different way, which I found very interesting. Miki is also fantastic and really cares about you succeeding.",
                "Absolutely. If you take this course seriously and meet its hefty demands with enthusiasm and dedication, you will be rewarded with a jumpstarted foundation in one of the most important mathematical subjects.",
                "If Miki is teaching it, then yes. She knows how to teach this stuff. Just be warned that algebra is very very abstract and not much time is spent thinking about \"how is this important in the grand scheme\". You kind of just learn it without asking too many questions along the way and assume it'll become relevant once you learn more math.",
                "This is a good class, and it is necessary for advancing into high levels of math.  However, due to the incalculable quantity of work that this class demands, if you're only a student who dabbles in math, I suggest you go elsewhere.",
                "Yes, I think that for anyone who is interested in learning abstract algebra this is a great way to get started.",
                "Yes, if that student was interested in majoring in math. If you're not interested in pure math, there is no reason to take this course, nor would I recommend this course for an easy A; this class is not a GUT. However, if the student is a potential math major, this class would be an excellent class to take to either fill out their major requirements or assess how much they would like the major, since I feel like this class is very representative of most other advanced classes in the math major.",
                "If you appreciate abstract truth and want to learn what the word \"Algebra\" means, then this is the course for you! It might sound too simple, but that is the meaning and scope of an intro Algebra course. If you are willing to appreciate math and work on your technical skills, the course will be very rewarding for you.",
                "Yes! If you're a math major, I don't know what you're doing not taking abstract algebra. If you're a nonmath major, this is the type of beautiful, exciting, puzzle-solving that math people keep going on about! This is the class that teaches mathematical thinking -- it's all about symmetry, counting, and surprising numerical truths. Drop by and see what all the fuss is about.",
                "I would definitely recommend it to anyone whos interested in math. Plus, Miki is the nicest instructor Ive seen.",
                "Yes! MATH 350 is a great introduction to the world of algebra, is organized and efficient, runs smoothly, and has some really fun and exciting material. In particular, I loved applying ring theory to encryption at the end.",
                "YES!! It's among my favorite courses taught here at Yale. Miki is a wonderful professor and the teaching staff were really great. The material is also really interesting, and you learn a lot about groups, rings, and even RSA encoding.",
                "Yes. Professor Havlickova is a great teacher and abstract algebra is a very useful class to take for math majors."
