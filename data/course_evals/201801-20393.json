    "amazing course!!! just hands off enough to have personal exploration of art and make your own work in studio time, but also had occasional readings and weekly discussions to bring the class together and keep everyone engaged and on similar pages.  all the readings were super interesting and thought-provoking and discussions were great.",

    "Absolutely! Not only do you learn all about painting and truly explore the medium, but it is a class for thinkers.",
    "yes!! if you have prior painting experience this class is great!! it is very much not representationally focused so you won't be getting much critique\/help on those aspects, but it is amazing for helping to develop critical thought about your own work\/art in general.  there is ample studio time in class so you'll have in-class time to work, but much of what you'll do will likely be in your own time.  you really do begin top develop a studio practice which is critical for any developing artist! the readings and discussions are not too overbearing and are all super interesting and help direct thought and keep everyone on similar pages.  overall an amazing class!!",
    "Yes for sure",
    "this is an amazing class  molly is a great teacher! youll spend tons of time in studio, which can be frustrating, but its incredibly worth it!!",
    "I would highly recommend this class to a student who has some experience in painting--I feel like someone with little to no experience would have a difficult time"
