                "I learned how to analyze art works and used this knowledge on various assignments concerning ancient Chinese art.",
                "Learned a lot about chinese history and its interaction with art, specifically how art pieces and objects are a product of socio-economic, cultural, and political forces.",
                "I learned a lot about Chinese art throughout different points in history, concentrating primarily on art before the 20th century. Having never taken a course on Chinese art, I learned a lot and also gained a lot of knowledge about the history that accompanied the art made.",
                "I developed a great understanding of Asian art history and how to visually analyze art within its context. The class allowed us to explore archaeological findings (including pottery, jade, and bronze vessels) to discuss ancestor worship, as well as used art and architecture to see the influence of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism on decorative arts.",
                "This class provides a comprehensive examination of the expansive history of art in China, delving into both its breadth and depth. It emphasizes the importance of recontextualizing art and artifacts within their original settings, including those currently housed in modern museums. By doing so, one can gain a more profound understanding of the circumstances that gave birth to each masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe course also introduced significant concepts such as materiality, imagetext, and the multifaceted meanings imbued within pigments. These themes serve as common threads interweaving Chinese and Western art, thus fostering a broader perspective of global art history.\r\n\r\nI think guest lectures provided invaluable insights and greatly enriched the learning experience. By combining traditional historical perspectives with a nuanced appreciation of context, this course offers an enriching exploration of Chinese art's past, present, and potential future."

                "I felt that sometimes there was not much connection between what was being talked about in lecture and most of the graded work. I feel like most of the work could have been done without attending lectures.",
                "I really enjoyed the lectures which were extremely accessible to a non-art/art-history major. Professor Ngan does a wonderful job lecturing and presenting the information in a clear and engaging way. Section at the YUAG was very fun and exciting to see pieces up close and even get to hold some of them! The Kahoot \"quizzes\" were a fun way to review a weeks worth of information in a non-stressful way. However, I do wish there was a bit more guidance on how to construct art labels and prepare the art exhibition proposal which is something I struggled with as the only STEM major in my section. Even though I meet with the TA to get more information on preparing it, I still felt very lost at times. I think this could be fixed by moving the movie review assignment closer up to the start of class as the first assignment instead of the art exhibition proposal since the movie review lecture was presented earlier on. This allows students more time to be exposed to different facets and themes in lecture and develop a better plan.",
                "I really enjoyed the scope of this class; I felt like it was broad enough to cover a wide range of topics and time periods while simultaneously allowing us to engage deeply with each time period covered. The lectures were interesting and the readings were very helpful without being repetitive. I think the amount of reading was perfect not to overwhelm us too much. I also really enjoyed the assignments. The exhibition project was a good cumulative-style assessment that challenged me in many ways but allowed me to venture and explore other parts of Chinese art not necessarily covered in class that I found very interesting. The only weakness I would say is the amount of feedback provided for these assignments. Especially with the exhibition project, I dedicated a lot of time to it, considering it might be something along the lines I'd be doing in a professional setting in the future. However, the feedback I received was not very complex. I would've appreciated more detail as to what aspects of my work were strong and which aspects were weak, and what exactly I could do to improve.",
                "Strengths: very well organized, lots of interactions with materials during section visits to the YUAG, great range of content covered during lectures.",
                "I wish class could be longer."

                "Definitely! It's super interesting, covers a wide berth and the movie review assignment was very fun",
                "Yes! Although there was some disconnect between the lecture itself and the assigned work, I still felt that I gained a lot of useful skills in art analysis and learned a lot about ancient Chinese art. The professor is great and we had a lot of different guest lectures that I felt I would not have been able to experience/listen to if I had not taken this course. My TF was also great and I felt that I learned a lot in section.",
                "Yes I would especially for anyone who hasnt taken a hsar course",
                "Yes! Definitely!! Professor Ngan is a wonderful professor who is so knowledgeable and passionate about teaching the subject. Lectures are amazing and Professor Ngan holds office hours --which I highly recommend attending even just to chat and learn more. The assignments are really fun and engaging, requiring you to apply the skills and knowledge from lecture and section.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student if you're interested in Chinese art or just art history more broadly. I think this class is as challenging as you make it to be; if this material is something of serious interest to you, you can learn a lot and really challenge yourself with the assignments given. But at the same time, I do think you can take it easy with the course and cruise by if you'd like. I personally think the material is very interesting, and for that reason, I would recommend it to another student.",
                "Would definitely recommend it! Very nice way to learn about something new and be involved with the art world.",
                "Yes. This is a great class for whoever interested in Chinese Art or any non-western Art."
