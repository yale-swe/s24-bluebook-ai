                "A major strength is the overall flexibility of the course, which allows students to plan their time in lab accordingly while still encouraging them to think carefully about how to structure the semester as a whole. Another strength is the optional enrichment opportunities offered, including both in-person sessions as well as helpful links that were provided through Slack."

                "Yes. I think that this course is a great way to fit lab time into your schedule. That said, this course is really whatever you make of it. Prof. Schilling is always available by email/slack for help, but your work in lab will determine the quality of your experience. As far as MB&B goes, 10 hours/week is not a whole lot of time, so I felt as though progress was especially slow at times.",
                "Yes! If you already work in a lab this is a great opportunity for an elective. While I would say the workload is high with a 10hr/week expected commitment to your lab research, the class assignments themselves amounted to a much smaller workload than the average class.",
                "Yes! a great course to take if you're doing research already and want to get credit.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! It's an excellent way to make time for lab work in a semi-structured environment, and can be especially helpful for those without much prior experience in scientific writing/presentation (provided they take advantage of the guidance offered). That said, it's important to be sure that you're interested in your research project and committed to spending a significant amount of time in lab -- if not, this may not be the class for you."
