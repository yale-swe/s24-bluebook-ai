It also doesn't punish beginners, so as long as you find the work fun you'll have a good time. Collaboration can be really frustrating though, and it is the core purpose of the class, so be wary of that. You won't learn anything in this class, but you can write a few songs and hear some songs from your classmates which is fun.",
