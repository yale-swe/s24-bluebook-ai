I learned to be more cognizant of how quotes being misattributed can result in a degradation of an author's reputation. I gained some useful skills when it comes to writing, mostly in how to structure and organize my writing. I also developed some insight into how the themes of Shakespeare's works are mirrored in pop culture, particularly those of revenge and love.",
                "I gained skills and practice in writing papers for the college level, including style and strategy. I learned how to read critical essays efficiently and incorporate them into my arguments. I also developed new ways of thinking about Shakespeare and others through the readings and class discussions.",
                "How to dissect critical essays, some college writing skills, reading strategies.",
                "As someone who had never read Shakespeare before taking this class, this was a great introduction to the Bard. We discussed his works, his life, and a lot of additional works/events that influence how Shakespeare is seen in popular culture."

                "I think this course gave a really good overview of Shakespeare's place in popular culture, although I recognize that obviously we couldn't touch on every example of Shakespearean popular culture, this course gave a great overview. I think a weakness was that we rarely had opportunities to work together on peer revisions or talk in smaller groups about the reading. I think having more time devoted to talking with each other about readings before we did a class discussion could be beneficial in the future. A strength would be how the instructor divided the class in terms of reading and activities, the activities were great at keeping everyone engaged. I would also want to explore different plays that are slightly less popular, like Twelfth Night, A Midsummer's Night Dream, or Julius Caesar.",
                "The course had a great assortment of Shakespeare content, on both his plays and his position in pop culture. A lot of what we read was very interesting and engaging. The activities and excursions were fun and provided new insights and a break from the classroom. Sometimes, the reading felt a little long, especially when it was all critical essays. Additionally, the discussions could feel a bit redundant as we approached the end of the semester. I also would have loved to have read one of Shakespeares comedies.",
                "Strengths - seminar with great participation, field trip days, some games are played to keep engagement up, a nice blend of various mediums (plays, movies, items, games, etc.)\r\nWeaknesses - there could be more opportunities for feedback on our writing (maybe smaller assignments every two weeks or so), the reading long felt a little tough when we sometimes whizzed through them in class, the content discussed feels a little repetitive by the end.",
                "The class was a great way to start reading criticism surrounding an author. The discussions in class were very helpful in understanding the text, and why it is so widely revered."

                "I would recommend this class to another student because I thought the instructor was great and the material was interesting overall. It gave me a deeper appreciation for how we can use what is learned in a classroom outside of school. Also, I can roll my eyes every time I see a quote from \"Shakespeare\" about how \"you say you love the rain but pull out an umbrella...\".",
                "I would recommend this course, as it was a very interesting writing class and it is structured to improve students writing.",
                "If you are a Shakespeare fan or are just fascinated about his popularity, you will gain a lot from the course. The seminar structure allows you to have deep discussions with classmates and the assessment prompts are open ended, so you can explore your interests.",
                "Absolutely, especially if you've never read Shakespeare before and are looking for a fun place to start. The course was a great mix of reading Shakespeare's plays, reading criticism, and talking about how Shakespeare impacts pop culture. The fact that it's a freshman seminar also helps with creating  a more relaxed learning environment."
