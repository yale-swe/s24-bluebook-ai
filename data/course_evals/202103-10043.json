                "I came into this course without much of a background in WGSS theory, and I learned so much. Through foundational texts in the discipline, we discussed the production and performance of gender, intersectionality, the history of sex as it relates to gender, intersexuality and its contribution to the creation of sex, queerness/sexuality, intersectionality, and more. The texts build on each other and the 2-hour seminar format allows for rich discussions.",
                "I learned so much foundational work in the WGSS field and also learned a lot about the intersections of race, gender, and sex. All the readings were really really interesting and the discussions were very engaging.",
                "This course is amazing!!! We read so many foundational texts and stretched our critical thinking in the classroom. The seminar format really allowed for an exploration of ideas, and I developed confidence in asking questions and sharing my own thoughts and ideas.",
                "I furthered my skills in critical analysis. The texts we read were equally challenging and rewarding, and the course pushed me to be a better scholar in order to understand and write about them.",
                "I learned SO MUCH in this course. It was one of those ideal classes, learning content AND learning 'how' to think about content, myself and the world. It was my first time reading Western academic theories of gender, sex and sexuality, and I got to learn so many amazing core texts, and grapple with questions I've mostly approached personally from an academic anglethe social construction of gender, the politics of queerness, so much more. We also learned a lot of histories and tackled many questions I hadn't come across beforeintersex, the \"deployment\" of sexuality, the politics of pleasure. I'm coming away from the course with a very rich foundation of knowledge in the history of how gender, sex and sexuality have been created, implemented and thought about in the West, and a sense of stakes of those questions for how my body and I will inhabit and move in this current society, and tools for tackling those questions.",
                "I read some foundational gender studies texts and learned about intersectionality and the history of gender studies.",

                "Strengths: Literally everything. The syllabus was fantastic. Each week was a new gem. Professor Kunzel (Reg) is a wonderful seminar leaderwarm, calm, knowledgeable, and a very capable facilitator. The make-up of the class was great, as well. Everyone was very committed, but there was a variety of interests coming in (I came in with very little knowledge). The 6 reading responses are a lot, but they're helpful for clarifying your thoughts because you do a lot of reading. Weaknesses: None",
                "Honestly, I thought the course's structure was very strong overall. I don't have any suggested improvements, except perhaps to incorporate asexuality into one of the discussions.",
                "I loved the structure of the course, the units built on each other really well and Prof Kunzel tied themes together along the way in a way that made the whole course feel coherent and substantial. It hit such a perfect sweet spot of breadth and depth, where we covered a lot of ground but it never felt rushed or superficial. I also thought the assignment structureno big midterm paper, but six 500-750 word critical responses due whenever you want throughout the semester, and then a final projectwas just perfect, because it encouraged deep engagement with the texts throughout the course. Prof Kunzel is The Strength of the course, they are one of the best seminar discussion facilitators I've ever encountered at Yalethey are so kind, BRILLIANT, and intentional about how they open and guide conversation, and they brought out the very best in us and created a space where we could engage the texts in very genuine, deep, critical ways. I honestly can't think of any weaknesses, just that I wish we'd had more time to cover more things!",

                "Take this class! This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and I've loved lots of classes. It's a rigorous foundational courseyou read a lot every week (maybe 100-250 pages)so students with a strong background in WGSS will still be challenged by the material and newcomers eager to immerse themselves in social theory will also enjoy the course. Why take it? 1) The texts are amazing. I was challenged by the material (on sex, sexuality, gender, pleasure, and embodiment), felt like it was well-connected, and loved the discussions. 2) Reg is such a great seminar leader, as well as very kind and intelligent. 3) Getting to talk about these topics in a seminar, as opposed to a huge lecture, is huge. 4) While it's a lot of reading and there are six reading responses, the final paper is only 8-10 pages.",
                "There are a lot of readings, and some weeks are especially heavy. However, all the readings are very much worth reading and really changed the way I think about gender and sexuality. Discussions were really good too, and Professor Kunzel is a very good discussion leader.",
                "Yes!!!! Definitely take this course. It was my first WGSS course I've taken at Yale, and I'm so glad I did. The classroom dynamic feels incredibly safe, supportive, and intellectually challenging. The readings and reading responses seemed like a lot at first, but you get used to it. I also really like the reading response format (you only have to submit 6 out of the 13 weeks). The professor is also wonderful and very down to earth.",
                "Yes! A great intro class to important feminist and queer theory texts.",
                "Yes, I would! Reg is a wonderful professor, very kind and excellent at leading seminars.",
                "Yes!!!!! Absolutely! 100%! This is one of those courses that ~everyone~ should take if you get a chance, gives you some foundational texts and thinking to make sense of yourself and the society you live in.",
                "This is a good course if you are interested in the WGSS major. It will give you an idea of the style of analysis used in WGSS and the types of discussions you can expect to encounter.",
