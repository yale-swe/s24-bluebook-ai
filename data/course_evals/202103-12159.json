                "I improved in my ability to read and think critically, to analyze prose and poetry, and to develop nuanced arguments through clear and concise writing. The class left me with insights regarding race and the environment that I'd never previously imagined.",
                "I learned a lot more about what Black nature meant, and how to further define whiteness and Blackness and how they relate to the natural world. My world perspective has definitely expanded.",
                "This course gave me a new perspective about our relationship, as humans, with the environment. Specifically how there's hidden blackness in nature that we tend to overlook.",
                "I learned how to better define both my own Blackness and humanity in general, particularly in the context of our world and planet. I also got to explore both familiar and new literature through a lens I had never used before.",
                "I learned a lot about how to apply conceptual thinking to various economic problems, where I was really challenged to think beyond.",
                "I learned a lot about what it means to view nature through a black lens. I thought the reading selections were great and really challenged the pastoral view of nature that has become so normalized. I dont think I learned how to be a better writer, though. Although I gained feedback and focused on his comments in trying to improve my other works, it never seemed to reach his standard, which was extremely frustrating given my effort.  I also went to office hours and feel like I wouldve received the same grade if I hadnt gone and spoke with him on what I could do better. This class was very discouraging.",
                "I learned a lot about the wide breadth of authors and works in the African American nature writing canon, and it definitely changed my view on the implications of white supremacy and climate change. Another interesting skill was how to nature walk. Now, whenever I am outside, I can't help but think back to our class and our readings.",
                "This course expanded my knowledge of the transatlantic slave trade, but also of the relationships between black people and nature throughout that time. I have gained a new perspective of myself and the world around me by taking this course, a much needed improvement to my life.",
                "I learned about black history, ideologies, and nature. Their beautiful intrinsic connection between nature and humans.",
                "I learned a lot about African American literature, and specifically how it connects to the history of blackness and nature. I also received good and helpful feedback on my writing throughout this course."

                "The course was fantastic, replete with strengths and with minimal weaknesses. Discussion was incredible, readings were interesting, and the teaching was both enjoyable and effective.  I do wish we spent a little more time analyzing specific poems (reading an entire anthology over the course of a few classes meant less time could be spent on each piece), but other than that, I have no suggestions for improvement.",
                "I feel like this course was overall disorganized and lacking clear communication from the professor at times. The professor did a great job of facilitating our discussions about Black nature and I was very invested in the topic, but I feel like because of this downfall I was not able to fully enjoy the course as much as I would have liked.",
                "Strengths- everything",
                "Structurally there were elements of the course that were weak. Assignments could have been clearer, the final project in particular. Time spent in class could have also been at times more organized.",
                "I think the strengths are in the care that the Professor took in terms of making more problems available on the problem sets (that were optional) so that we could grow our understanding more if we were having trouble with certain concepts, as well as well as making the lectures available online. I think the weaknesses were in the teaching fellows and a lot of the office hours peer tutors. In my experience, some did not speak English very well, and would confuse themselves in explaining problems, as well as confusing me and my peers as well. I think better care needs to be made in the selection process for TFs.",
                "The strengths were in the readings that were chosen, however the weaknesses were in the lack of organization. I feel like the Professor would go on many rants consistently, where I didnt see direct purpose in every class. I felt engaged with the materials, but not with the class itself.",
                "I think some of the readings were too academically dense, with too little in-class explanation. I also wish we spent more time discussing and close reading the texts in class. I wanted to get into the nitty gritty of the literature. Our class was really fun, though, and I really enjoyed our weird little side discussions and squirrel impersonations.",
                "We didn't get to discuss some of the readings that we did in depth, I would have liked to do more of that especially for the larger books.",
                "The readings were really good and the material was gone over in class but not the entire lesson was finished and gone over.",
                "This is one of the most unique classes I have ever taken, which was very enjoyable. I loved the topic of the class, the books we read, the seminar style of it, as well as the community with the other students. However, because the course is new I think some of the structure might understandably need to be fine-tuned. There were some assignments that weren't very clearly explained, but once we figured them out were very interesting."

                "Yes, 100%. Granted, this is my first semester at Yale, but I am confident that this is one of the best classes I will take during my time here. I believe most anybody would find it interesting. The discussion can genuinely be described as exciting, which I am not quick to say about many classes. Overall, I could not recommend this class enough.",
                "Yes and no. I say yes for the insight and knowledge gained, however it was definitely not what I was expecting. I think if it were more organized I would have enjoyed it more. This made the course a little frustrating towards the end of the semester.",
                "I would highly recommend this course, because you finish this course feeling like you want to interact with the environment differently.",
                "I would definitely recommend the course to people of all backgrounds who want to think critically about our relationship as humans with Earth and Nature. After having taken the class, I think it is vital to consider such ideas when thinking about race and the continued legacy racism in the world.",
                "If they are taking the class to really learn as opposed to get a good grade, I would say yes. It was very intellectually stimulating. However, being someone who did not take any economics in high school, it was definitely rough as I always felt behind many of my peers who had already taken it before.",
                "I would recommend the course to other students, yes. However, would challenge the way Professor Howard taught it.",
                "Yes. I think more people need to be aware of Afam nature poetry and that it is a great class to take if you are interested in nature and the environment as well as race relations and literature. Super interesting subject matter and not a ton of unnecessary work.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It will definitely challenge the way you view nature in general.",
                "Yes. It is a very interesting class and the material was very interesting as well. We have gone over topics that I did not even think we would touch and it taught me a lot about the perspective I have on this world and the Black people that reside within it.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes I would, especially other black students at Yale. It is really fun to take AFAM courses, and this is a super unique and fascinating class."
