You could feel that he really enjoyed teaching us, and was very understanding when we didn't understand a concept and very receptive to feedback on his lectures. Sometimes he'll throw in a little bit of math history as well, which is always nice and fun to listen to.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The final was quite long, which is fine, but I found some of the questions to be a little repetitive in what they asked."
