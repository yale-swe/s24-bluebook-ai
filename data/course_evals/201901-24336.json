   "comments": [
    "Professor Fahmy is a pretty awful professor. Seems like a nice person, but not sure how he is still able to be in charge of this course. Extremely disorganized. Once Sean the TA leaves, the department should really switch professors since Sean is the only reason why the course existed. Content was very neat, though.",
    "Strengths are hands on experience with nanoparticle formulation and cell culture. A weakness is that even though flow cytometry was utilized I fell like it was not explained well enough.",
    "The course has a good foundational concept and one of the TAs is a god-send that imparts knowledge and helps us through the labs. \r\n\r\nEverything else about the course is eclectic, disorganized and largely a free for all. Nonetheless, the lab reports still require a fair amount of  effort which is a 180 from the actual labs.",
    "Tarek Fahmy does not show up to class. He only came twice and the class is literally taught by the wonderful TA, Sean Bickerton. Unfortunately, he's gonna be done with his MD\/PhD soon so I don't know how this lab is gonna turn out",
    "Sean is a great TA who really does his best to make the course run well. Overall, the course is pretty disorganized but it is low stress.",
    "I learned a lot i the lab thanks to the teaching fellow Sean without him this class would have been a mess."

   "comments": [
    "No.",
    "No because even though I wouldn't say it was bad and actually enjoyed it, the lab still  felt haphazard.",
    "No, if you dont have to take it, dont. Sean is leaving so the class will only spiral from there.",
    "If you are a BME major, you don't have a choice. If you are just curious to learn stuff, maybe you should take it. The lab reports are written as a group which is great since you don't have to do the work alone. \r\nDownside is  Tarek doesn't show up to class. It seems he doesn't either care about the students or just hates teaching.",
    "This course is very disorganized and the professor leaves all the work to the TAs, he basically shows up for the first few lectures and then sporadically through the semester to tell you you're doing something wrong or share some story about the industry.",
    "I wouldn't recommend to a non BME student.",
    "If it is required for your major, than yes."
