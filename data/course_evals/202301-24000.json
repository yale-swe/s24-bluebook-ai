                "I learned a lot about myself through this course, both as a writer and a person. We engaged with some literary theory in this class, which was helpful for me as someone without a strong background in theory. We read such a wide variety of essays and authors from a myriad of different backgrounds , and I learned how to analyze and glean meaning from texts I agreed with and those I strongly disagreed with.",
                "I was challenged to write in a way that was fearless, honest, and purposeful. I was given precise and encouraging feedback, which allowed me to revise my work after submitting a first draft. I learned how to produce a long (16+ page) paper, compiling research, archival work, and interviews. I was introduced to many different forms of writing, including theory, for the first time. I learned to think critically about these work, make connections between different pieces, and apply the strengths of these pieces to my own writing.",
                "Rachel and her amazing class taught me how to write critically and with rigor. I learned from her lectures and office hours, as well as the writers we read in class and the writers she invited to speak with us during our classes, different elements and styles of journalism and creative nonfiction writing.",
                "A really great class to learn about craft. I thought more about structure, the weight of words, and also about looking inside myself and interrogating what I believe and why,  how that translates into my work, and how I engage with the world.",
                "SO MUCH. I learned how to really closely read a text and examine how the authors ideology intersects with and influences their argument. I gained a set of tools for breaking down others writing and learned how to construct arguments that are grounded in opinions",
                "This class was one of my dreams. It was somehow the manifestation of my every wish for how a class could be. Professor Kaadzi Ghansah gave us each such attention and care. She saw us as not just as students, but as fellow conspirators in the act of writing  she saw and treated us as colleagues and writers. In my semester in her class I feel I have grown more in my writing than my 19 years of being. She liked to talk to us about \"rigor,\" and she taught us rigor alright, how to make every word matter, how to use the \"I\" in writing and to refine it, how to think and act and move through the world and the page as a writer."

                "The material we read was absolutely fascinating, and I found myself taking time outside of class to continue reading books from the excerpts we were assigned. I think I gained the most from this course when I took the initiative to set up meetings to discuss my progress. The seminar structure provides a great opportunity to engage with the writing of your classmates, and that was one of my favorite parts of the course",
                "This course's  syllabus is filled with so many diverse, insightful, and perplexing readings. I never felt bored or that I was doing \"busy work.\" Each reading felt meaningful and necessary. Additionally, Professor Kaadzi Ghansah seamlessly blended lecture-style teaching with seminar-style conversation. During class meetings, we were free to discuss our thoughts and about the readings... as well as learn from the specific skills the authors employed. The ~2 hr time slot was perfect for this course. I was also so excited about every guest speaker, and felt honored the writers we'd studied wanted to meet with us, too. Professor Kaadzi Ghansah used her resources to ensure we got the most we possibly could out of this course. I also thoroughly enjoyed our mini-assignments in between larger essayslike the prompt to visit the gallery and analyze a Basquiat piece, or the assignment on outsiderness at Yale. I think this course could benefit from some additional mini-assignments like this to really hone our writing skills before the long final paper.",
                "Strengths: Rachel is a brilliant writer, knowledgeable about craft and the industry. She reads your work and provides critical and thoughtful feedback about your writing and participation in class. It is hard not to want to impress her, but she is not looking to be impressed. She is looking for the same thoughtfulness and rigor in your writing and work as a student. \r\n\r\nThe readings she chose and her in class lectures are also amazing. Every week, I was wowed by both.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Also a strength but can be a weakness of the course is it and Rachel ask for a lot of thought and time from you. If you are unable to do the readings or spend time revising your work before submitting, it is obvious and it will be hard to engage in the class as the best student you can be.",
                "Theres a great array of readings from different times and a variety of authors. Learned many techniques when it comes to nonfiction creative writing, and received great feedback. Also, a really open class environment. \r\n\r\nSometimes I wished we had more class time to discuss the readings as I liked them a lot.",
                "Incredible course. I learned so much about writing, but also how to think about arguments and ideologies and how they are expressed on the page.",
                "I loved the readings we read, the discussions we had, the wisdom from Prof RKG, and the direct writing assistance we received. She answered many practical questions, and made herself available to meet with us whenever we needed. She workshoped our first pieces one-on-one with each of us, which was an incredible experience. Sometimes though conversation got cut a little short in class, or we only got to focus on a portion of the readings, so wish everything got more coverage in discussion. Part of this was hearing all of RKG's unmatched knowledge and own thoughts (which were so insightful!!), but wished more time to hear more from all my classmates too!"

I know I will return to so many of these readings throughout my academic career, and I know Im a better writer and student for taking this class.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, English major or otherwise. But this student must be committed to putting in the work, participating, meeting with Professor Kaadzi Ghansah for Office Hours, and revising. This is not an \"easy\" class, in the sense that you can't just \"get by\" without doing hard work.... but that's what makes it so satisfying. I saw significant improvement in my writing and my confidence from the start of the semester to the end. This is the most personally rewarding course I've ever taken.",
                "Absolutely!!! You will grow exponentially as a writer in this course. At first, it was challenging for me to accept the fact that this class and Rachel were pushing me to think, interact, and write a step further than anything or anyone before, but I ended this course a that much stronger writer and thinker.",
                "If Professor Kaadzi Ghansah ever comes back to Yale, take a class with her. This was the best class I took at Yale.",
