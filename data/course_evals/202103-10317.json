                "Honestly, not much. I don't feel as though I have a better understanding of time or what it means as a result of taking this course; the syllabus was not cohesive and the professor not much help in the sense of giving actually helpful feedback.",
                "I became much more deliberate in my writing and developed skills in writing a counterargument and developing a well-thought out thesis (particularly when tackling the research paper).",
                "I did not develop too many skills that I did not already have other than working with sources a little better.",
                "I decided to take an English 114 with Professor Shoemaker in hopes of improving my writing, but this proved to be difficult as most of my efforts on my assignments were directed towards pleasing the professor instead of what might actually be correct for college writing. (since the professor's requests/ recommendations sometimes directly contradicted what multiple Writing Center people would suggest). It was also very difficult to get advice or help from the professor since he was often unavailable and didn't hold office hours. I felt that the grading was meaninglessly strict and that my writing was pointless regardless of the abnormal amount of time and effort I spent on it. The feedback on my papers was also sometimes inconsistent with what he had previously suggested/said would be okay or just generally inconsistent. The feedback I received was rarely helpful in my improvement as a writer. In general, I just never felt like I was being encouraged to actually improve in my writing or that the professor was trying to help us in that sense, even though I have had other classes that were not even writing courses that seemed to care much more for genuine improvement in writing.\r\nAll in all, though, the topic itself was very interesting, and I definitely did learn by writing the various papers, even though it was more through help from writing partners/ other's at Yale than from my professor himself. The peer-review we did for all our drafts and papers was often tedious and I feel that more direct feedback from the professor would have been more helpful, but it probably did help me learn how to review other papers including my own. Peer review was also helpful in discussing ideas with peers and letting us bounce ideas for our papers off of each other.",
                "I developed my writing skills, and learned to think about time in complex, interesting ways.",

            "comments": [
                "Essay prompts and grading rubrics were vague and writing guidance was unclear, especially with respect to the fourth essay. I needed to consult writing tutors to find out what the expected writing style was, how the essays were most likely being evaluated, and what all of the \"buzzwords\" in the prompts actually meant (for example, words such as \"problem\" and \"tension\" did not refer to actual problems or tensions within the text, only points of interest that could be further explored). I do not feel that the course itself improved my writing skills.",
                "Strengths: it was nice to be able to workshop in class with peers. \r\nWeaknesses: extremely unclear expectations for writing/rubrics/grading (no clue how anyone got an A in that class, to be honest), harsh grader, unengaging seminars with little back and forth/opportunity to workshop ideas, professor unwilling to go the extra mile to help students succeed/respond when prompted for clarity/help. It could be improved by overhauling the syllabus to include more time-specific works (as opposed to ambiguous interpretations of time like the movie Memento). Unclear feedback on essays submitted and unclear standards as to what a successful paper looked like.",
                "The course material allowed us to have interesting discussions. I enjoyed the chosen readings and the professor made the discussions engaging and open. I wish there had been more feedback at the beginning of the course equivalent to the feedback we received as the class continued. Another strength is the writing process in which we wrote a draft and then had time to peer review and revise ourselves before turning it in.",
                "It could definitely draw upon a wider variety of sources (ie science, news, legends and myths, etc.). I also believe that students should learn more than just MLA format.",
                "This course could be improved by having office hours, by openness from the professor, by more flexibility by the professor in terms of the writing he accepts (encourage creativity), understanding that it is often first-years taking this course and they may generally be more lost- e.g. may require even extra help, extensions, etc., by being accommodating of extensions and sometimes even encouraging it for a student if it seems that their writing could improve greatly by that extra time. Another improvement could be extending the due date of a paper's draft and shrinking the time between the draft due date and the revision due date. I found that many people in the class were staying up late and stressing a lot to complete a draft on time when it could have been completed with much less stress and probably be a much better piece of writing if it was not rushed.",
                "I appreciated the clearly written assignments explanations for each of the essays.",
                "I enjoyed the topic and material of the class, however, I felt like that there was vague feedback compared to the strict grading system. The grades felt punishing rather than helpful."

The professor was an obstruction to learning and I put so many hours into essays that ultimately \"weren't adequately successful.\" Please, do not take this class; you don't get enough out of it for the amount of intellectual/academic struggle involved; it's clear Shoemaker has his own conceptions about what every paper/essay you write should look like and if it doesn't match exactly what he wants he won't have much time for you (no pun intended).",
                "I would recommend this course because it challenged me as a writer while also giving me the space and opportunity to grow from my drafts.",
                "I would not recommend this course. As mentioned in other comments, this class unfortunately was disappointing and I was a lot more stressed than I actually learned. I was really looking forward to taking an English 114, so I think if you definitely want to do that take a different section or just take a writing credit that is not 114 or 120.",
                "I would recommend this to students who would like to practice their writing skills. I would note that there is not as much reading involved as other English courses.",
                "I ruminated on how I would answer this question. My writing did improve undoubtedly, however, the process made me hate writing and myself as a writer and stamped out a lot of my confidence. The professor looks for a specific writing style that did not match my writing going into college...while this was helpful, it was crushed some of my style as a writer. Take this class to improve your writing, but make sure to safeguard your confidence in the process."
