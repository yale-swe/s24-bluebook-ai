            "comments": [
                "Strength: it is a great survey course for AI\r\nWeakness: I think the TAs were a bit lost in a lot of ways. First, they do not have access to the exams, so their review sessions were quite messy and were of minimal to no help. Second, I think some of the communication for the class was largely mishandled. They would make changes to the PSET and announce it via an Ed post that may not be communicated to all students. Rather, I think Canvas announcements should have been used.",
                "lectures well broken down into different topics, lecture slides thorough and contains a lot of examples",
                "The PSETs for the course were often messy and disorganised. You are only given one week to complete the assignments and the provided starter code was often incorrect for the first 3 or 4 days.",
                "Great course, and very knowledgeable professor. The lectures could feel a bit standardized at times since the instructor followed very much the same format and preferred questions to be saved for the end, so interaction lacked a bit..",
                "Strengths: Lectures focused on just the right details. Prof. Scaz is very good at explaining difficult concepts in a crystal-clear way. The course was also practical, and the discussion sections and lectures on AI Ethics were very interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Time to stop for questions in the middle of lecture would increase engagement.",
                "Honestly the logistics were messy. Having no practice material for the final exam, plus the fact that almost every PSET had some kind of important typo or error that wouldn't be fixed until asked about on Ed (and then the solution would be released as a new version of the starter code and if you already started you would need to somehow merge the new code with your existing code), was stressful. \r\n\r\nBut the content was very accessible and engaging!",
                "The psets are almost all trivial, so we don't really get any practical experience from them. I don't know how this is a 400-level course that graduate students can also take, because we don't go that deep into the material (though this means it is a good course for first or second year undergrads interested in AI). Sometimes the course tried to cover AI societal topics like ethics, but these lectures always tended to be speculative and shallow, i.e. the professor's opinion on what the future will be like, and more fit for a TedTalk than a lecture.\r\n\r\nWe do cover a lot of non-modern topics, though, which is cool.",
                "Strengths: Engaging lectures, reasonable psets\r\nWeaknesses: Because of the wide breadth, some topics were not covered in that much detail",
                "Strengths: highly structured lecture notes and topics. Weaknesses: did not go into any depth in the topics. Hard to review for midterms as it was unclear how material learned the class would be applied.",
                "If this is an indication of the future of AI, we dont need to worry. Poorly written code and half-baked algorithms arent taking over the world anytime soon.",
                "A solid elective in the CS curriculum. This is a survey course, so you don't learn about a topic in great detail but you do get exposure to a variety of topics, which helps you pick out which ones pique your interest. It would have been helpful if we got practice with problems in the later half of the course.",
                "One of the strengths of the course is Scaz, who is an excellent lecturer. Another strength is the relevance of the material to computer science. However, a weakness of the course is that it is very hard to know how well you are doing, since no indication of what counts as an A / A- / ... is given. Additionally, the exams are very hard and feel like they are on a completely different level than the homework assignments.",
                "This was a good course, and I really feel like I learned a great deal about the different facets of what is really a complex and broad field of computer science. I was slightly bothered by how little we were allowed to participate, particularly the fact that we as students were not allowed to ask questions during the lectures except at the very end made it difficult if we were confused but later on forgot our questions or had to go to another class right after AI.",
                "The problem sets were horrendous - poorly organized and often with confusing wording. They were easy to do but not all straightforward. I would often have to spend several hours trying to understand the organization of the starter code just to end up writing two lines of code. There was also a frustrating lack of support for the midterm and final, and the professor didn't give us any information about the format of the exams or the types of questions there would be, making it very hard to study properly.",
                "The piece sets were occasionally super super frustrating and grading was unclear at times. They were also often borrowed from other schools' AI homework, which made adaptations difficult and annoying. \r\nThe course straight up followed the textbook chapter by chapter, which felt a bit... odd and unoriginal.\r\nExams were ridiculous. The first exam was too easy and impossible to study for the second exam was ridiculously hard and impossible to study for. He spent one slide on Baye's rule (a single slide!) and then dedicated an entire question to it on the final exam. On an AI exam! A Baye's rule question!!! That was frustrating. He also said final exam would be cumulative but, and I quote: \"only because I can't test the second half of the course without testing the half because they build on each other.\" Turns out, HALF OF THE QUESTIONS WERE BASED SOLELY ON THE FIRST HALF WITH ABSOLUTELY NO RELATIONSHIP TO THE SECOND HALF OF THE COURSE. He straight up lied and it ruined my grade on the test. I did almost perfectly on the second half and still didn't do so well because I didn't study the first half because why would I need to? He implied I only needed to study what was built on.",
                "The problem sets and exams seemed disconnected from the lectures and were in greater depth than had been covered in class. This made them very challenging; however, most problem sets did come with starter code, which was helpful. I really appreciated the discussion of ethics in the course, and the lectures were interesting.",
                "ta's need to be more engaged/knowledgable about course material.",
                "I felt this was a great introduction into AI, but its a survey course. You never really go on depth in any topic. This also meant the psets jumped around a lot in terms of difficulty",
                "The strengths is the presentation of the material and the psets overall. This is a good survey course of AI techniques. If you want a deeper dive into a particular AI topic there are other classes, but this is a good intro. I loved the AI talks that we had in class and our professor should absolutely consider holding them in future offerings of the class",
                "The course mainly just covers the textbook. The textbook is pretty good, and Scaz is a pretty good lecturer, so I would say that the actual content taught was probably the biggest strength of the course. For a survey course, I thought it gave a pretty good idea of various AI techniques.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I thought that the problem sets were done very badly. Some of them were directly lifted from UC Berkeley, and these were pretty good, but the other ones were simply poorly designed. I didn't feel that they helped my learning at all, the writeups were confusing, and they were often filled with bugs. The TFs didn't help very much, often seemingly not knowing the correct answers to some of their own questions.",
                "Strengths: The entire course is shaped in a natural cohesive manner. This makes it possible to build connections between topics that you've seen earlier on in the course. Weaknesses: We cover a ton of topics very briefly and so it is difficult to feel as though you really understand certain topics.",
                "Potentially, go into deeper in deep learning",
                "Strengths: very interesting and Scaz is an engaging lecturer. Weakness: Poorly organised and not supportive of covid circumstances",
                "The office hours were inefficient, at least over Zoom. It was hard to tell when a TA would be able to get to you. The lectures were engaging and interesting, but they were a bit too high level at times. The course is structured very well, and serves as a great introduction to AI. The PSETs felt disconnected from the lectures at times.",
                "Good psets, good lectures. Could have better materials to study for exams from",
                "Professor Scaz is an incredible lecturer and has great slides and presentations.  \r\nOffice hours on the weekend would be very helpful.",
                "The professor is great and a giant in the field",
                "Although the breadth of topics covered in the course was great, the course was not managed well. The problem sets often had mistakes in them, the ed discussion posts werent answered on time, the TAs often did not know what was going on in class. The decision to not give a practice final was a concerning one. Overall, learnt some stuff but did not appreciate the course.",
                "The lectures are fantastic! I found the content interesting and the teaching very engaging. I was genuinely excited to go to class.\r\n\r\nThe one weakness of the course were the office hours. There were only 6 total hours offered of help each week for a class of over 100 students. I found it was hard to get help, and I had to ask all of my questions at once, because I could not see a TA twice on one pset. However despite the scarcity, office hours were helpful when I could talk to a TA.",
                "Very nice lectures.",
                "The material was very engaging as well as the lecture style. I came in with very little python knowledge so the first pset was especially challenging, however I learned quickly.",
                "This course is very well-structured. As a survey course, it gives a remarkably deep amount of insight into a very large field. The psets are a lot of fun, particularly the ones on genetic algorithms and Othello.",
                "Problem sets need improvement; do not cover the entire scope of the course",
                "Prof. Scaz's lectures are solid and they do a good job of giving an overview of the topics. However, this course suffers from being extremely unorganized in terms of the teaching staff. I've heard plenty of complaints about the office hours not actually having a TF at the right time. PSETs also suffer from being either copied from Berkeley or just too simple to actually learn the material. A huge weakness of this class is also the content on exams and their grading. Often times, the questions on exams seem to come out of nowhere and are definitely not covered in lecture, and then to add on to that, the grading is often ambiguous, with no clear reasoning why points were taken off. The point distribution on exams also generally doesn't make any sense, and a 1 sentence answer can somehow be worth 12/80 points on a midterm.",
                "It was a great course. I think more Professor/ta with student interaction would make the course better",
                "This course felt very disorganized. The biggest weakness for me was the problem sets and the amount that we learned from them, which was very little as we were only replacing a few lines of prewritten code. I felt unprepared for exams due to a lack of materials and any guidance from the TFs/professor.",
                "There were not enough TA office hours and there were np practice exams or even practice problems for the final which made it very hard to study.",
                "The assignments are very well constructed, but more can be done in terms of providing practice exam questions. In general, it feels like the class size is too big for each student to get adequate attention and evaluation for assignments.",
                "I found the homework assignments quite challenging and often a bit confusing, as they required students to pick through a series of instructions and edit or append pre-written code. This was unlike any other homework I've done at Yale.  I wonder if there would be a better way to help ingrain course concepts.  \r\n\r\nI also thought that the exams could be improved, or that lecture/homework could include more examples whereby we get to practice techniques or concepts covered in class.  Homework assignments were usually 100% coding --- but there was no coding on either of the exams.  Though I thought the exams were fair, a few more concrete preparatory examples would have been much appreciated. \r\n\r\nWith all that said, I really enjoyed the course and found it a fascinating gateway into the world of artificial intelligence.  The material was among the most interesting that I've studied in college, and Scaz does an excellent job presenting it and inspiring students to care about why artificial intelligence matters. Even the TA's were good --- responsive and helpful.",
                "Strengths: I thought the sequence of topics was really effective, and each subsequent topic built on the ones prior really nicely. It was great to learn about recent developments in the field-- the last few lectures on current topics were really engaging. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the Psets in the second half of the course seemed to be a little too surface-level; the ones in the first half of the course, pre-midterm, were great and prepared us well enough for the midterm exam, I felt.",
                "The problem sets for this class were extremely weak and disorganized - there were several typos and the problem sets often involved filling in the blanks in the PDF or starter code which required no understanding of the concepts being taught. I left the class feeling like I couldn't do anything practical at all with the information I had learned. Scaz seemed very uninvolved with the creation of the problem sets, and was condescending towards students who had clarifying questions about the clearly ambiguous instructions. The TAs also seemed to care very little about the students' experience, and were completely unprepared for office hours as well as review sessions. The strengths of this class are the organization of the lectures, and Scaz's own expertise in the area which is great to hear about during the AI \"chat sessions.\""

                "recorded lectures very helpful, love that the professor names them after the topic so I don't have to click on each of them to find out what recording is what",
                "Tests were poorly adapted to the virtual setting. Reviews, chats, and other sessions with student involvement were inexplicably not recorded.",

                "The recorded lectures are very helpful for students that may be sleep-challenged.",
                "This class was run very well in light of the pandemic. Lectures were easily accessible on Panopto, and schedule/pset material was on Canvas.\r\nAI chat sessions were cool, but it was a shame they weren't recorded like the lectures.",
                "I think that the lectures were very well-transitioned to virtual learning. However, I was unable to understand the rationale behind the practice of holding questions until the end of each lecture.",
                "I can't say I would change much.",
                "The live AI chats were a refreshing break from the lecture routine and a personal highlight of the course.",
                "Office hours could be improved. It was hard to tell if the TA was even there, as students were kept in the waiting room for over an hour. Being able to take the exams on our own time rather than in a limited timeframe would make it more flexible. Recording the lectures was helpful.",
                "not much",
                "For office hours, you usually had to sit in a zoom waiting room until the ULA was ready, which was a bit annoying since you had no idea how long it might be or how many people were ahead. Otherwise, the online procedures were fine.",
                "The live recorded lectures were extremely helpful and accommodating. Engagement was also improved by including non-recorded AI chat sessions that served to answer questions around AI that students had.",

                "Recorded lectures",
                "The office hours were not efficient. You would be stuck in a Zoom room, not knowing when a TA would be able to get to you. There were a couple times when I went to office hours right when they started, and a TA didn't get to me until >30 minutes after the office hours had officially ended. While I really appreciate them staying behind to make sure everyone got help, it was an inefficient system. Although, unless the class is remote again, I don't think this will be an issue in the future.",
                "one final exam slot? at 2pm eastern? kinda rough for those in most time zones",

                "I loved the AI chat sessions.",
                "The lecture style was well adapted to virtual learning. It was very easy to adjust to. The office hours were not ideal. There were only 6 hours total held in the week which made it difficult to go to. I imagine it would have been even worse for international students who live in different time zones. Furthermore, the format of office hours was awful. Until it was your turn to talk to a TA, you sat in their zoom waiting room. There was no online queue or any indication whatsoever about how many people were ahead of you, when you would be seen, would you be seen at all, is there another student stuck on the same problem II could work with or anything like that. It made office hours incredibly stressful and nerve wracking.",
                "AI chats were cool.",
                "A little more support with office hours.",
                "Not taking questions until the end made it so we never wasted time with time consuming questions, but also completely removed the bond we felt with our Professor when he answers our questions in lecture.",
                "Hopefully, this is not an issue in the future, but I took this course remotely from an Asian timezone which made it difficult for me to participate in important non-recorded lectures such as the AI chats and review sessions as well as take the final.",
                "I enjoyed the course as it was --- since the cadence of Scaz's lecturing is a bit slow, I was happy to be able to speed up lecture as I watched recordings. I only wish the AI chat sessions had also been recorded --- there were a few that I was unable to attend, even though I would have liked to hear and participate in the conversation.",
                "Having recorded lectures is such a game changer-- it makes it possible to revisit lecture material, and as someone who sometimes struggles with attention during long events without breaks such as lectures, this made my learning process a lot easier. Things felt in general a lot more self paced this term, with all online resources, than normal."

                "I would recommend this course to another student for Scaz. However, I do think Scaz should pay closer attention to how he can facilitate better interactions between students and TAs so that students can feel supported in their learning.",
                "Yes. An interesting class; though I don't feel like I learned much in depth about anything, I did enjoy the overview of the topics.",
                "Yes, you get to learn and explore different concepts related to ai.",
                "If you are looking for an intellectually challenging course that goes into depth in a few topics in AI, you should not take this course. However, if you are looking for a course that covers several topics in AI at their surface level, this is the perfect course for you.",
                "Probably, the course itself was quite interesting.",
                "Absolutely. And I took it virtually. Can't imagine how good it will be in-person.",
                "It's not a TERRIBLE course but it's not great either. It's kind of like a history course with some high-level technical topics sprinkled in. Even if you're a CS major interested in AI, I would hesitate to take this course, though it could help you bridge to other AI courses in the CS department.\r\n\r\nIf you're a math or stats major interested in ML, don't take this class (unless you need it as a prereq for other classes).",
                "Honestly, no. Scaz is no doubt a good lecturer but psets were disorganized and all completely different from each other. Exams were very different from both psets and lectures and no practice exams or review materials were given. The topics were interesting but the coursework needs to be more centralized and coordinated in order for it to be a truly educational class.",
                "If you're interested learning a wide range of AI topics, yes! Also I can see it leading into taking other more advanced AI courses.",
                "Yes, even if you don't know anything about AI. It's a great CS elective to help you sort out which topics in AI interest you. Problem sets were on the easier side and it could serve as a good fifth class.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in artificial intelligence and willing to study a LOT for the midterm and final.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Really great way to understand all of the variations of AI in our world today along with the ethical and moral questions behind developing these technologies.",
                "This is an easy CS elective, but the organization can be quite frustrating. The problem sets are confusing and the TFs were not helpful at all, and the lectures themselves can be really engaging in one moment and really dry in the other. The result is that you get familiar with a range of AI topics, but you don't really learn any of them in the end.",
                "Excellent course and really interesting material!",
                "If you want an easy class and are willing to be frustrated often, sure.",
                "No. Scaz is a great teacher, but there is too much material to cover and the exams will be unnecessarily hard.",
                "It's a great course to get some insight into the applications of AI and some challenges faced in the field. However, it does not extensively cover any single topic, as there is way too much material for the limited number of class weeks.",
                "only if they're interested in a survey of ai.",
                "Id definitely recommend this to CS majors looking for an interesting elective. Also its great for anyone with a little bit of programming experience that wants an great intro to artificial intelligence. Definitely take it with Scaz!",
                "Yes. This is a good survey course of AI techniques to get you started on possible other AI classes you may want to take at Yale. It doesn't go terribly in detail in any one topic, and the psets are somewhat challenging but doable and fair. The psets are very interesting and were among my favorite CS psets ever done at Yale",
                "Not really. It does a good job surveying AI, but you could get just as much, if not more, from a good free online course. The poor problem sets and exams as well as the lack of any clear feedback make it not worth it.",
                "Yes. If you are looking to learn more about AI in a very general sense I think that this class is a very good starting point. A lot of really interesting stuff is covered.",
                "Yes, if youre interested in AI!",
                "Yes if it is in person and not online. Very interesting class but organisation could have been a lot better",
                "I would say yes, especially if you're interested in a broad overview of topics in AI. It's definitely possible to take this class right after taking CS201, but I wouldn't recommend it. You would greatly benefit from having taken CS223 beforehand.",
                "yes. great intro to AI. will help you figure out if you like the field",
                "Absolutely! The material is extremely interesting and covers a wide range of topics.  Professor Scaz is a wonderful, kind professor and his classes are well formatted for student learning.  You would be missing out if you didn't take this class.",
                "Yes, it is a great introduction to AI without getting to deep into one specific topic",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course. I loved the lectures and the professor was great!",
                "Yes, it's a great course to get an overview of different areas of AI.",
                "I would most definitely recommend this course. Professor Scaz is an amazing lecturer and the material was extremely interesting.",
                "Yes, it's a very fun course, the psets are technical but not too challenging, and the professor shares many interesting anecdotes about the development of AI.",
                "Only if you are interested in artificial intelligence. It is not necessary to read the book cover-to-cover, but one should come in with good background knowledge of AI.",
                "Not particularly. This class is easy to add on to four other courses and Scaz's lectures are quite good, but the ambiguous grading and confusing exams will make you question why you are taking this course.",
                "Yes! A good intro to AI",
                "I would not because it is a surface level survey course and the teaching staff did not seem very engaged with the course.",
                "I would recommend this course if you're looking for a high-level overview.  Be aware that there might not be many TA office hours for the size of the class, so you have to stay on top of the psets in case you need to go to OH before it's too late. There were also no practice exams which made it hard to study.",
                "Yes, I think the content of the course is important for any computer science major or person interested in technology.",
                "I would highly recommend this course for someone who wants a relatively low-key CS course that covers a wide breadth of fascinating material. I would say that you should adhere to the listed prerequisites and make sure you actually have programming and Python background.  I have a decent amount of coding experience, including in Python, but most of it revolved around data science and analysis.  I was thrown by the algorithmic nature of this course's coding assignments, and struggled to complete many of the problem sets. CS students who have already taken a number of classes in the department should be fine --- I heard from many that the homework was quite easy relative to other assignments they've had to complete over the years.  Other students, though, should proceed with caution and understanding that the homework may be harder than expected.",
                "Yep! It's a great choice for one of your first CS electives. Scaz really knows so much about AI, and it's a lot of fun to listen to him talk about it!",
                "Only if you're looking for a super general survey of AI. This class offers very little practical skills due to the extremely weak problem sets, and the course staff is very unorganized."
