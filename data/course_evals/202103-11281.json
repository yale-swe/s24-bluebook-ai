                "Great primary source analysis and great preparation for a senior thesis.",
                "Although this course certainly provided a great depth of knowledge on Hamilton and Jefferson, it used them as a means of understanding the era. Through their letters and other writings, I was able to get a deep, personal understanding of the politics, culture, and outlook of the late 18th Century and early 19th Century. As a course based on a central essay, I also developed my writing skills in a meaningful way.",

                "I learned a lot about early American history, including its people, their ideas and personalities. Learned a ton about reading letters and how to read between the lines.",
                "This course really strengthened my writing, primarily through the final research paper. It was a huge challenge for me to write a paper so long on an unfamiliar topic, but I gained new research and writing skills that will be quite useful to me in my future courses (and definitely for my thesis). I also gained deep knowledge into Jefferson and Hamilton as characters, leaders, politicians, and men. Given my limited knowledge on early national America prior to this course, I am grateful to have gained new insight and knowledge into this time period through the lens of these men.",

Skills: writing an in-depth original research paper, from finding sources and crafting a prospectus to editing a rough draft into a final draft; close reading of primary sources-- particularly recognizing biases and hidden clues in letters during the 18th and 19th centuries; the ins and outs of proper footnote usage; discussing historical sources with fellow classmates"

                "Weaknesses: \r\nI would have appreciated greater variety in readings, as we read 2 biographies to begin the course, but then spent the rest of the semester on the same collections of letters. I also think a lighter reading load would be more beneficial to really dig into the sources, especially 18th century primary sources. Additionally, I felt professor Freeman could have encouraged more meaningful class discussion, as conversation often felt repetitive week to week without really reaching deeper conclusions. Finally, we never received feedback on our first short paper, which I would have really appreciated.\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\nProfessor Freeman is so knowledgable and passionate about her work. She is the highlight of the course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Freeman\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of dense reading, hard to know which readings to focus on, Thomas Jefferson's existence",
                "Strengths: super cool that all of the reading (except for the first two weeks, where you read biographies) is from Hamilton and Jefferson. Professor Freeman has great stories and insight on the text.\r\nWeaknesses: if you do all of the reading, it'll take forever. Skim judiciously and choose a handful of letters to focus your energy on.",
                "Dr. Freeman is by far the best part of this course--she quite literally wrote the book on early American \"Affairs of Honor\" and brought to the class a level of understanding that no written source could ever convey. The discussions were well-paced and focused and the timeline of the central essay was perfectly designed to challenge us in the best possible way. I can not think of any improvements.",
                "The readings and discussions were good. I think there should have been a brief lecture or secondary reading each week to give more context to the primary sources.",
                "Professor Freeman is the foremost scholar in her field and is deep.y invested in the work of her students. The readings were rich and grouped according to relevant and interesting themes. I cannot think of any downsides.",
                "Strengths: primary sources\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not enough historical context",
                "Strengths was all the letters and the consistency of assignments week to week. Prof. Freeman is great, very cheery and incredibly knowledgeable. A weakness is that we did not get as much support as advertised on the final paper, and the discussions were not always great. I felt like most students comments were just summarizing the readings rather than digging deeper in a continuous thread.",
                "Strength: I loved the thematic nature of this course. I felt our conversations were so generative BECAUSE of the thematic layout of the syllabus and weekly readings. \r\n\r\nWeakness: This is not so specific to this course, as it really applies to most of the Humanities(-esc) courses I've taken here: the reading load is just so heavy. I feel like I would've gotten more out of the course if there was less reading assigned, because then we would've been able to discuss more of the letters in depth.",
                "strengths: the discussions, professor Freeman\r\n\r\nweaknesses: giving a recommended order for the readings would guide them. There are a lot of small readings every week and it can be hard to know where to jump in",
                "Strengths: very 'user-friendly' process for completing the main research paper that helps students every step of the way; professor is foremost authority in world on significant portions of the curriculum and knows the material inside and out; surprisingly entertaining primary source material. How could it be improved: at beginning of semester offer 'quick and dirty guide to participating in seminar' for inexperienced students, giving proper etiquette and explaining what the basic aims of seminar discussion are"

                "If you're going to take a class on early American history, take it with the expert in Hamilton's letters! It's a super cool way to learn about this time period. Professor Freeman is energetic, funny, and engaging. She line edits your rough draft. She's hard to track down over email, but will meet with you whenever you have a question. Research paper is early in the semester (you have to turn in a topic prospectus after reading only a few weeks of letters) which allows you time to gradually research and write. Manageable workload.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Freeman is far and away one of the best professors I have ever had--she is knowledgable, motivated, caring and led every discussion in fascinating directions. As a history major, I greatly appreciated the format of the final essay. It was vague enough to allow us to focus on something we care about but spread out over the semester to get important feedback.",
                "Yes, it is intellectually satisfying and challenging.",
                "Yes. I would recommend it to students interested in the founding period and also those who are interested in developing their primary source research skills.",
                "Yes but with the caveat of already knowing a fair amount of American history being necessary.",
                "Yes I would, although not very strongly. I think if you're interested in the time period, especially Hamilton and Jefferson, you will like it. Some of the best times in class were when Prof. Freeman talked for a while, so I would also consider just taking her lecture. The heart of the course is the letters, so think about if that's something you're interested in as well.",
                "Absolutely. Regardless of whether you are a History major, Prof Freeman makes the readings, discussions, and assignments extremely accessible.",
                "I would, especially to someone who loves history/American history. You have great discussions and while the paper seems daunting it is very rewarding.",
                "Yes. Will improve your writing and research abilities, and the material is engaging and debate-provoking."
