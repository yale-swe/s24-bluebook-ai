                "A lot of interesting biases\/fallacies that we make in everyday life.",
                "I had gone into the course a little nervous, but the professor and TF made the class environment a lot more enjoyable and less nerve-wracking. Aside from the general content of the course, I really was able to focus on student-to-teacher communication, which really helped me understand the course topics in a deeper perspective. Overall, I really enjoyed learning the content and had a lot of fun!"

                "Strengths: lectures are engaging, Professor is wonderful, I was happy to have taken it in a small setting \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  I think it would be difficult in a very large lecture",
                "Strengths - Lecture. Lecture was both informative and entertaining. I would love to attend these lecture in person. The material was also interesting and useful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The actual classes. You basically fill out a worksheet with info from the lectures and then go around in a circle for 90 minutes giving your answers to the questions on the worksheet. There is little new information and I feel that I would have learned a similar amount from this course if the classes were eliminated altogether and we just had to watch the lectures and fill out the worksheets.\r\nAnother weakness is the opacity of the grading. You don't know what grade you're on track for ever and you need to make an appointment to see any mistakes that you made on the tests.",
                "The ideas of the course are thought-provoking, but the experimental quality of many of the discussed studies is sometimes questionable and should be discussed more in class. There were also instances where essentially the entire class disagreed with what the instructor believed about a concept or a True\/False, and discussed and clarification of points in these instances was lacking.",
                "The course was absolutely wonderful. I wouldn't change a thing.",
                "Strengths: Professor Ahn is funny and is a fun lecturer, although all the lectures were prerecorded (as it was summer). The material was also highly engaging, and I always actually interested in watching the lectures and excited to do them which was totally great. Weaknesses: the assignments to prep for discussions were a little tedious but I guess they did help you review the material and prepare for the exam. Being graded on your in class responses was also a little stressful, although I don't think it really negatively affected anyone's grades.",
                "I very much enjoyed the provision of the discussion questions and the live component of the class used to ensure our understanding of the key components of lectures. Sometimes I have anxiety or trouble knowing what to ask from completely unstructured live discussion so I enjoyed the balance this class provided of outlining what we should have understood from lecture while also allowing time to delve into deeper more extended postulations.",
                "Strengths: the lectures were very fun and engaging to watch; good workload for summer course.\r\nWeaknesses: the discussion sections were sometimes a bit slow.",
                "Of course, there are always downsides to learning online, but I found that the professor, TF, and the students made it feel like we were having in-person classes. The level of student engagement was high and the students were able to give their own opinions and jump in on answering questions. This was a rather fast-paced summer course, which can't be fixed, so we couldn't fit everything into the curriculum, but I would've found more in-class review sessions to be helpful!"
