                "Intro to Jewish cultural history from the Enlightenment until the early 20th century. Improved my writing skills with these types of readings.",
                "I learned more about the development of Jewish society in Europe.",
                "This course will give you a serious, grown-up understanding of Jewish history pre-WWII, and covers a large historical range. It will also improve your writing a bit.",
                "Learned about two periods of Jewish life in Europe by looking at art and reading histories, memoirs, novels, philosophical works.",
                "I learned a lot about how Jews were able to adopt the media/genre around them and transform them into Jewish culture and preserve themselves. This course was great in that it was both informative and really helped strengthen writing skills.",
                "This is a really interesting cultural and intellectual history course that gave me a broad understanding of Jewish history in the designated time period.",
                "Ability to write better",
                "This course overviews European Jewish history from around the mid eighteenth century u til the turn of the twentieth century. It is a history of European Jewish thought - expressed through various forms, whether memoir, paint, novel or history. A fantastic overview of that period in Jewish history.",
                "Philosophical and literary works by 18th and 19th century authors",
                "The analysis of Judaism in Europe in the 18-20th centuries through a historical and literary lens",
                "I developed deep knowledge of modern European Jewish history, as well as modern European history more broadly. I also developed my skills of cultural and intellectual historical analysis.",
                "This course gives an interesting look at Jewish history during Emancipation, which is often overlooked in the study of Jewish history. History is examined through writing and art, specifically philosophy/memoir/novel.",
                "I got better at writing essays and reading complicated texts. Especially, I got better at seeing the structure of long texts. I also learned a ton about Jewish history and European history more generally.",
                "This is not a history course. This is a literature course. Very engaging literature course, but you will not learn much of anything about Jewish history.",
                "I learned all about the modern Jewish intellectual tradition. I came to understand how Jewish thinkers responded to the crisis of modernity and rearticulated what it meant to be Jewish.",
                "I learned about a lexicon of Eastern and Western European Jewish writers, thinkers, artists and visionaries that were determined to build a record of their musings. From the new Jewish woman, to the empowering notion of domicile, to the historic reverence for the Talmudic-studied Jewish intellectual, to the constant redefinition of a subject and their ever-changing wider culture, I know this course is one I will continue to soak in for some time."

                "Strengths: interesting to discuss cultural Judaism without discussing the Holocaust, Professor Sorkin is a wonderful lecturer, the content and materials were enriching\r\nWeaknesses: assumes a certain foundation of Jewish history or knowledge that isn't required explicitly in the syllabus. It also assumes a certain level of knowledge about Enlightenment thinkers, philosophy, and European history that STEM majors or non-humanities/history/philosophy majors may not know.",
                "Great readings, love Professor Sorkin, appreciate the first/final draft format. Little to improve quite honestly.",
                "The lectures were very interesting but the readings were a bit overwhelming at times.",
                "I think the structure of this course was smart but it was a bit confusing in terms of timeline and geography at points because we really jumped around.",
                "Great course, just difficult to keep up with the readings if you're a busy student, which in turn makes it hard to be engaged in the class later during the semester. TAs tend to be great with giving detailed writing feedback.",
                "Professor Sorkin is a gem. I would highly recommend taking a course with him. He is a great storyteller and makes every class engaging. The writing in this class is also useful. You get a lot of feedback from TFs and have a ton of academic freedom.",
                "The course has no weaknesses. Prof. Sorkin is one of the best professors at Yale, an excellent lecturer and extremely knowledgeable. The course is very engaging and the readings are well chosen. My TA was also great and used section time to condense the information from lectures and offer writing advice.",
                "I think this course could benefit from more historical context, in addition to the literary thought, intellectual history, and cultural development focus that the works selected provide.",
                "Very well organized",
                "I thought this course was very strong in its content and framework. There was a variety of perspectives and out of canon content.",
                "The strength of this course is Professor Sorkin: he is a brilliant, fastidious, and passionate teacher. I found his lectures enthralling and informative, there was scarcely a wasted word. It could perhaps be improved through more feedback in writing.",
                "Strengths: Professor Sorkin is incredibly knowledgeable and you can tell he really cares about his students.\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of reading -- basically a full book a week, and not necessarily easy reads, but the essays are on the readings so you really need to be more thorough in doing them.",
                "This course was extremely interesting and Professor Sorkin did a great job guiding the class through each of the works we studied. The one weakness of the class is that it assumes students have preexisting knowledge of general history of this time period. I did not, which made it a little difficult to understand the context of the works we studied. There were some general historical lectures, but the majority of class time was spent discussing the writings we read for class.",
                "I thought this course was very well designed. I especially liked the way that we talked about art while we were working on our essays so we had less readings. \r\n\r\nSome small things that might be helpful: If you could post the essay prompts on Canvas (or ask a TA to do this) that would be helpful, because sometimes I would want to think about the prompt but I wouldn't have the piece of paper with me. \r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the lectures; because I knew so little about this topic at the beginning of the course they were super useful in providing context for what we were reading. I appreciated the way that for Oppenheim there were a set of notes about what we went over, so that if something was said and I didn't register it as important or fully understand it at the time but later I realized I needed it for my essay I could look back and see what had been said. Posting similar notes about the other lectures would have been very helpful (these could either be the notes that you use or you could delegate a few people each class to take careful notes and post them).",
                "Exceptional organization.",
                "Extremely well organized. I thought all the readings were great. They were also timed and sequenced perfectly throughout the semester (art during paper week was very helpful).",
                "Strengths: enthralling lectures, purposeful readings, wide-ranging essay topics, engaged peers, clear student expectations\r\nWeaknesses: room for additional exploration of visual media (perhaps in the form of a field trip to see Chagall's work in New York or holding a screening of a film that relates to the themes of the course)"

                "Yes! Great to take a class with Professor Sorkin. The content is interesting. Regardless of your background, youll find a work to latch onto.",

                "Yes, I loved this course. I felt like each class I learned something totally new and vitally important. The readings were very interesting and engaging, the lectures were fascinating and the course discussion was very good.",
                "This is a great course to be exposed to lots of Jewish writers, under the guidance of a spectacular professor. The quality of learning will depend on your TF who engages closely with you on the 3 essays. If you have a great TF like I did, you will be in good shape and can absolutely walk away as a stronger writer. Be aware that although there are 3 papers, you have to (get to) re-write each paper, which is not revising, it is re-writing. So, it's more like 6 papers, with the re-writes only being marginally easier/quicker.",
                "YES! This is the best course I have ever taken at Yale. It is a great way to understand the modern Jewish intellectual tradition. It avoids the pitfall of other survey courses by not assigning too many authors and allowing for time to think about each author in depth. Professor Sorkin is a great lecturer and discussion leader and the class blends these two forms.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, particularly those that are hoping to reckon with their Jewish heritage in a pre-Holocaust, intellectual history and novelesque sense."
