I also improved my ability to participate in active discussion of readings and films through this class.",

From learning how to write emails, form theses, structure academic papers, explore Yales vast resources, connect with tutors, and build relationships with professors, TFs + peers in a virtual setting, this class did this AND more. I was able to read the classics, explore texts close to my identity, all while feeling confident and supported.",
                "I learned a great deal about Yale's collections, the idea of a collection, close reading, comparing texts, and technical and stylistic aspects of writing.

                "This class really improved my writing process and introduced me to works of literature and film from all around the world. It also made me feel a lot more comfortable with using Yale resources, especially in terms of research.",
                "Through this course, I developed college-level writing skills. I also became a better reader, and more able to understand difficult or dense texts. The course material itself was fascinating, and I gained a lot of insight into how I view myself and how that view is influenced by my environment. I was exposed to texts from all different locations, cultures, and time periods, so I felt I developed a good understanding of how views on the self vary across the world and throughout time.",
                "i learned everything about developing a proper writing process to thinking differently and critically about complex readings. i pushed myself as a writer in ways i had been afraid to before this class. the positive impact of this course on me has been immeasurable.",
                "I learned how to close read, to write, and to analyze text. My writing and reading skills improved. More importantly, I think, I learned about perspective. This class really opened up my thoughts to other perspectives and opinions by hearing my classmates and their insights about the texts and films featured in the syllabus. I also learned about writing as a process and not simply as a one-time, one-sitting task. Writing, as a process, was challenging for me, but I know now what I can do to help myself become a better writer. I also learned more about myself as a communicator and an individual with my own thoughts, morals, and values."

                "All strengths. No weaknesses. Please continue to fund Humanities courses such as these because I think I speak for my entire class when I say that this is truly one of the best courses I've ever had in my life.",
                "This was a really wonderful course. I really appreciated the variety and interest of the reading and film material for the class. The discussion was also very interesting and engaging, especially when the professors entered the breakout rooms. The collections visits were also very interesting, especially after the changes made after the midterm. Most of the weaknesses I saw in the course (lack of engagement in collections visits and not enough time spent in breakout rooms) were addressed after the midterm review.",
                "Strengths: I appreciated the feedback from TFs and seminar style discussions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Felt there wasnt enough time to go over all texts. Friday lab times could have been used more productivelyat times the Beinecke talks got a bit too long but Im sure this was just due to the virtual nature of the sessions",
                "I thought the format of the course was great, and even without being physically there, collections days were so interesting! This course also used a huge variety of material both in terms of time and place of origin and in terms of genre, which was really exciting and eye-opening. However, there were no older texts from the Americas, and none from the Pacific at all, which is not inherently bad, but it definitely would have been interesting to contrast the older texts from Europe and Asia against similar self-making narratives from pre-colonial societies.",
                "Strengths: Great professors and TFs, interesting material, well organized, and awesome discussion!\r\nWeaknesses: The common thread of selfhood wasn't always entirely obvious, but this didn't reduce the quality of conversation at all.",
                "I don't really have anything bad to say about this class. I looked forward to attending lectures and doing assignments every day. We read widely and deeply across many literary and philosophical traditions.",
                "I very much enjoyed the wide range of topics and works covered, but at times discussion felt somewhat unstructured with ambiguous takeaways.",
                "The strengths include the professors' teaching styles, the intersectional, international structure of the syllabus, and the structure of the course in general. A way in which this course might be improved is by allowing more discussion time (whether in a group discussion or in writing) for deeper analysis of specific works (like reading responses pertinent to specific texts).",
                "incredibly insightful discussions everyday, and very interesting friday labs switching from visits to yale collections and writing workshops. i think this aspect of the class was so valuable to the experience as a whole. overall, the TFs and Profs were able to very successfully conduct class, remote as we were. i would do it over again in a heartbeat!",
                "I think one of the weaknesses was the online lab period. I just feel like it was not as engaging as I would have liked it to be. Most of the material was interesting; however, because it was not really engaging, it was hard to concentrate. I think this online lab can be improved through using tools that Zoom has to offer such as breakout rooms or using other tools from external sources to engage the class. This class felt overwhelming at first because I did not come into the class knowing how to coherently communicate my ideas at the same level of expertise as my peers. I think this made the seminar sessions intimidating when it came to addressing my ideas. However, I consider this a strength for me personally because it challenged me and provided a way for me to learn from my classmates. After thinking about the seminar as more of a learning opportunity and less of a display of intelligence, the environment became a kind of safe space to openly share my thoughts and feelings regarding the material. The professors and TAs truly did a wonderful job of ensuring this environment was preserved throughout the semester."

                "The discussion seminars in this course were held over zoom, and these were a great success. Though we were over zoom, I felt that the small-group setting and the use of breakout rooms allowed for comfortable participation and fruitful discussion with the time that was available. Though they seemed very long at the beginning of the semester, the virtual Friday labs were very interesting, informative, and helpful in beginning to navigate resources at Yale. In my experience this past semester, the Friday writing labs of this course were some of the most engaging and productive virtual learning experiences I had. This time was helpful not only in vastly improving my writing skills but also in discussing writing with peers and meeting other students.",

I also think that the organization of the seminars with the TAs having designated roles and the professors mainly leading the main group discussions worked well. The breakout rooms during every seminar session was a success. I just think that the only practice that could be improved is the online lab."

The professors are incredibly kind, engaging, and helpful, and the class is directed in a manner that prioritizes academic growth. The subject matter might seem dauntingly abstract at first glance, but is helpfully discussed, contextualized, and explained by professors and TFs. I grew a lot during this course, and though it was certainly challenging, I never felt stranded because professors and TFs alike were incredibly responsive and open to answering questions at all points in the course. On top of this, this class is also a great introduction to academic writing and to resources at Yale. This is a phenomenal course.",

                "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. It was probably my best experience with school in a pandemic setting. The professors are both awesome and were super understanding of the circumstances, the TFs were super approachable and helpful, and the content was really engaging.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student! I thought that the course material was sometimes hard to grasp and especially hard to write about, but I improved greatly over the course of the semester. You get out what you put in in that regard I think. The professors and TFs were all amazing and supportive, and the class community was wonderful. The professors also presented us with quite a few careers in the humanities which were very interesting to learn about and I felt like it gave me options looking to my own future. The syllabus is a big part of what makes this class so great in my opinion. We read everything from plays to philosophical texts to novels. We even watched movies for some classes, ranging from The Human Condition to a Bollywood musical. I loved being exposed to all kinds of different works and ideas. The discussion parts of this class were also great. Sometimes the collections labs could stretch on (a three hour Zoom call is a lot), but that's the only structural complaint I ever had about this course. Take this course! I'm a much better writer because of this experience, and it's really rewarding.",
                "absolutely. for all the reasons i listed above, and just how transformative it was for me, i would recommend this to any student, regardless of their major path. everyone can stand to learn and talk about the concepts and issues we looked into in 6PGS",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The professors and TAs were amazing. The texts and films assigned were both challenging and enjoyable. The basics of writing and reading taught are essential and very important for future writing. The individual development was very helpful for me and for my experience at Yale as a first-year."
