                "I really would love it if the course talked about radical right movements in non-white contexts; whether in Africa or South America, or as a minority of racial supremacy groups (Black Trumpites) or Nation of Islam.",
                "Strength: Professor Aslanidis is incredibly passionate and is a really wonderful professor. The assigned readings were one of the best parts of the course, and seminar was always engaging. He often paired videos and clips with what we are discussing that day.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only weakness I could think of (although some people might see this as a positive) is that assignments are graded from 1-10 on a kind of arbitrary scale since there was no rubric provided. Some of the formatting requirements for the papers were also a bit odd, but both of these are really small issues. The seminar is still wonderful and I highly suggest it!",
                "The strengths: organization, work load, and professor \r\nWeaknesses: Class Engagement",
                "Great readings, great professor, interesting course material. Workload every week was very manageable, and the readings were fascinating. Class discussions were always interesting, thanks to Prof. Aslanidis leading discussions but also engaged peers. Weakness: sometimes class discussions got too heated and personal, and the Zoom chat did us no favors.",
                "Strengths: interesting readings. Professor Aslanidis is very engaging and has good insight into the topic. Meet with him before you write papers and he'll really help you dig deeper. The class is a nice mix of hard polisci and history. \r\nWeaknesses: Class discussion was a mess. This was more due to the makeup of our class, but things got very heated and it was hard to de-escalate over Zoom. Coming to class felt very stressful at times due to section bullies.",
                "Professor Paris is the biggest strength of the course. Thank you for balancing the discussions with documentaries and great reading material. Wish this could be in-person.",
                "One strength of the course is its structure. I thought that the week-by-week subject matter flowed well and provided a comprehensive understanding to the overall themes of the course. In addition, the larger writing assignments were spaced out enough to be manageable. \r\nOne point of caution in this course (and in this semester I viewed as a weakness) is the quality of the discussion is largely dependent on the students and their background knowledge that they bring to the course. This means that there can be a lot of academic jargon or abstract topics that can alienate others  in the seminar who aren't familiar with it. In our seminar I frequently felt that class was a hostile space where there was one right answer to the discussion and as a result, discussing the nuances of certain topics was cast aside because there were too many minefields."
