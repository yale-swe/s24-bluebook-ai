I learned the basics of how to approach determining the constitutionality of a law, thinking through hypotheticals, and separating ethical and legal questions.",
                "I learned about free speech, the First Amendment, and its various restrictions (threats, incitement, defamation, obscenity, etc). We talk a lot about both the legal and ethical questions and had a lot of interesting class debates.",

                "I learned about the law and ethics of the First Amendment, with a focus on its applications to speech and the press. The law covered in the course is both accessible to those who don't know much law and extremely interesting, covering topics like changing norms around what is considered harmful speech and how our legal system has chosen to weigh speech-related harms against other types of harms."

                "Strengths: Topic material is fascinating and could not be more timely. KG is killer. She's the best. \r\n\r\nWeakness: the course was slightly too large. would have been nice to have a more intimate feel but I understand the necessity to keep the space open given the popularity of the course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Goodrow is a huge asset. She's fun, open, and very knowledgeable. Her classes feel very much like an inner chamber, discussing cases openly but thoroughly. The class itself is a nice mix of topics and cases. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We perhaps don't get as a thorough a foundation for some of the legal cases and principles, as we mostly do surveys. Professor is very keen about hearing people's views and opinions, but sometimes it can take a lot of time and get us off track. I would have liked more legal theory\/lecturing.",
                "Strengths: KG is super fun and engaging in discussion. Learning by reading cases is fun and probably good practice for those considering law school. I also actually enjoyed writing the midterm and final, and they tested the same argumentative skills that we'd been practicing throughout the semester. The class encourages open dialogue, and students test and challenge each others' ideas (respectfully) more than any other course I've taken as an undergrad.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course is not very well-organized. The weekly topics in the first half of the course don't seem to cohere with one another, and perhaps the most frustrating thing is that rather than discuss all readings as a class, we often assign groups of three to preset on each of the readings, which gives you little incentive to read those outside your assigned one. I would much rather just limit the number of readings and have a more traditional seminar-style, roundtable discussion.",
                "Great class. No improvements.",
                "Strengths: KG is great at moderating conversations, always coming with interesting discussion questions and involving the entire class in discussion. She is also incredibly nice and helps students feel at ease. The readings were a good mix of cases, commentary, relevant studies, etc. I actually really enjoyed the final exam, a hypothetical that brought together many of the themes of the course. I also really enjoyed how KG blended the course and current events.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses I can think of!"

                "Yes! KG is an excellent instructor and teaches you how to think through every day situations and the application of the 1st amendment. She takes something difficult and breaks it down every step of the way.",
                "Yes! Even if you have no interest in the law, thinking through the topics posed in this class and their implications is fascinating. if you get into one of KGs classes, you should take it.",
                "Yes! Especially for older students, this is an entertaining class that will expose you to the underbelly of First Amendment Free Speech law, and really make you understand the complexity of some of the decisions courts have to make. Professor Goodrow is a great professor and a lot of fun. You'll really just enjoy the class.",
                "Yes! This class was a ton of fun and a great introduction to the first amendment and law. I appreciate how we learned about practical applications to the first amendment, and KG gave plenty of examples in her experience on the court. It's not very stressful but you learn a lot!",
                "Yes, I would. The real fun of this class is the spirit of discussion that happens in seminar. I wouldn't go into this class if you don't see yourself liking that environment and prefer to learn more outside of class than in it.",
                "YES! KG is an amazing instructor and a wonderful person. She has so much real-world experience in law, and I always found her comments on the cases insightful. Def take the class if you can. Make sure to pre-register!",
                "Yes! KG is incredible and if you are interested in free speech, this course is a great chance to think about the topic more rigorously and debate some of the ethical dilemmas surrounding it together with classmates. I learned concepts I am confident will actually stick with me."
