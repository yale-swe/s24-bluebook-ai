I also feel as if I felt a lot more emboldened in my skills as a student, which gave me the confidence to engage in some of my more challenging classes more frequently as a contributor to the dialogue. This is a really great class to take, particularly if you're dipping your toes into the field of women, gender, and sexuality studies. It does a great job of touching on the big ideas of the disciplines and sparks very productive conversations that bleed into the other courses that one might take that are related to the subject.",
                "This course taught me how to prepare a lengthy presentation/ facilitate discussion for the duration of the course. We worked across age-level to ensure everyone had a certain level of understanding of course materials. I learned about second wave feminist theory and seminal queer theories.",
                "I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the works of feminist and queer theorists that I otherwise would have not had exposure to; I was able to think critically about their contributions to the world of feminist and queer theory, and challenge my own norms and hierarchies that exist in close proximities to me.",
                "I was introduced to a ton of scholarship and intellectual thought in the field of feminist and queer theory. Upon leaving this course, I feel I will have a foundational understanding of each field."

            "comments": [
                "This course is very good at offering a wide variety of readings in womens and gender studies. It might be too ambitious.",
                "Professor Canfield takes a very radical approach to the classroom, which doesn't land well with all students. I think that you definitely get what you put into this class. If you do all of the readings and come to class ready to dissect and interrogate them, it's way more fun. However, because there seems to be a lot less pressure and lower stakes and it's a class where you show up and engage in for the sake of learning, it can be kind of hard to get some conversations going about the texts because not everyone has read them. The makeup of the seminar's student body is definitely going to be a major factor as to the success of this class. The structure of grading is incredibly relieving and allows for students to feel more comfortable exploring the topics and styles of work that fit their needs most adequately. I felt as if there was a lot of freedom to explore what worked for me in this class and what I enjoyed about the ways in which I engaged with the content as a scholar.",
                "This class is organized in a way that is not only logical, but fundamental to understanding the material and issues discussed in this class. The professor also facilitated conversations, but allowed the conversations to take on new directions as they arose. Overall, I thought there are few, if any, weaknesses to this course.",
                "Learning from our peers was a great facet of this class---the weekly presentations made us engage with one another intimately, and having to present in front of everyone was both challenging and rewarding, and prepared me for other large-scale presentations. \r\nMy favorite classes began with praxis exercises, like writing to our senators about the Don't Say Gay Bill and others. It would be great if we could start with a template that you send to us, so that we aren't like chickens with our heads cut off and so that we can make the maximum impact with our time. But this was a great way to bridge the divide between Theory and activism.\r\nAs far as weaknesses, I think a once-a-week, 2-hr class might be a better format for a class like this, so we can really delve deep into conversations about the readings. Of course, there will always be topics that we miss, but in the 75-minute class, it was rare to have in-depth and thought-provoking conversations. \r\nI also think that asking that people not to bring computers/iPads could work well. That might require printing out readings, or some alternate accommodation. But there were a lot of distractions every class, and certain students made the learning environment a bit hostile by saying controversial statements and then returning to their screens to ignore what everyone said in response. \r\n The biggest piece of constructive criticism I have is that we need more Black feminism in the class. And more than just the CRC and Audre Lorde. We need more intersectional and third-world feminists, and a sharp argument / understanding of how Black feminism and queer theory interact. We also need more trans studies. Rather than having a day, or a week, dedicated to those topics, they should just be interspersed with the other topics so that we see and discuss the threads.",
                "The course's biggest strength is definitely the syllabus, I found that it was very diverse and it encapsulated a wide variety of scholars that had differing or similar viewpoints on feminist/queer theory, and some of the readings were absolutely incredible and definitely made me think deeper about the subject and the institutions and systems that I engage in/am surrounded by. Additionally, Craig was extremely kind, flexible, and understanding, which was definitely a big plus. The fact that we were able to choose our own deadlines or opt for the standardized ones was a nice touch that I think a lot of students appreciated. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses of this class specifically were that at times, we wouldn't get to the readings until very late into the class, meaning we didn't have time to adequately discuss them a lot of the time, and some days we wouldn't even get to certain readings at all. This made me feel like (at least for the tougher readings) I wasn't completely understanding them, but (this leads to another weakness) I didn't feel comfortable enough in class to bring this up. The people in the class honestly did not foster the most inclusionary environment -- many of the students had deep backgrounds in the subject already, leaving little room for those of us with less robust backgrounds and making us feel as though our contributions were not welcome in class (or in my case, making me extremely reluctant to talk at all just out of a desire to not make a fool out of myself). I found that though on a surface level my peers seemed to be nice, there was a lot of judgment to be had which contributed to my desire to stay silent for the most part. This class made me experience extreme imposter syndrome, and I feel like this could've been alleviated had there been more of an effort from the instructor to reel in conversations that started to stem from material we hadn't read.",
                "I loved that the course was malleable to our personal interests. Our work, while centered around feminist and queer theory, could always be relayed back to something we were interested in outside of the course materials. I think one weakness of this course was the lack of structure for discussion. Although we had weekly readings, we often did not discuss our readings until fifteen minutes before the class ended. It seemed like a missed opportunity for informative discourse throughout the entire semester."

                "I would recommend this course to another student with the warning that much of the course jumps into a lot of theoretical readings without much prior framing.",
                "Definitely! I think that this is a great introduction to the WGSS major and even if an individual isn't majoring in WGSS, I think that this gives everyone the opportunity to step into the discipline a bit and familiarize oneself with the vocabulary and grammar that is common in that arena. It's a great site for interdisciplinary collaboration, especially because the content is often relevant to many other fields of study. I think that this class is very focused on applicability, so if someone concerns themselves largely with the theoretical and abstract philosophizing of WGSS, this might not be as good a fit. However, there are certainly opportunities to engage in that theoretical abstraction within this course, although I think that for my semester we definitely didn't have that style of writing resonate with us as much and we found ourselves gearing the conversation towards what that theorizing meant in application.",
                "Absolutely. This course not only allowed me to explore my writing style and comprehension of academic works, it guided through understanding my own identities better in a safe environment of students that were had similar experiences and understandings.",
                "If the student already has a background in the subject, yes, definitely. If the student is starting out and trying to see whether or not they want to major in WGSS, I'd suggest another course."
