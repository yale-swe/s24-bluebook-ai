                "A strength of this course is how quickly it moves. With the material being learned, it makes the most sense to move rapidly through the material. A weakness of the class was that the two teachers were not able to co-teach a class. I think that couldve gotten them on the same page as to where the class was at.",

                "The course was very well organized and the teachers made our responsibilities for the class very clear. One weakness would be the amount that we spoke the language, as I felt my writing and grammar skills were a bit stronger than my listening comprehension and speaking skills.",
                "I thought the course was conducted really well, and I appreciated having Wednesdays as a break from Zoom. There were some points during the semester where expectations were unclear, but that got resolved pretty quickly. Both professors were really kind and understanding, and they both made efforts to ensure that we enjoyed the class. I didn't expect to enjoy the breakout rooms, but they were actually a nice way to get to know other people in the class, and they made the 2 hour class period go by pretty quickly. I really liked the balance between class discussions and in-class practice of grammatical structures. Overall, if you're willing to put in the time, the class is really great. Even though it was intensive due to it being compressed into 5 weeks, I felt like it was still pretty manageable.",
                "I think a great strength of this course was the amount of conversation we engaged in. I think the main project could be improved. I've basically done the exact same project 3 terms in a row.",
