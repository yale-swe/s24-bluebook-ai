            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Clear structure with lots of resources to help you including pre-recorded lectures, lecture slides, office hours with the instructors, and with peer tutors. Mid-terms are also weighted less than the average STEM class",
                "strengths: lots of office hours, very helpful TA's, professor is accessible to students, lectures posted online, awesome peer tutors, practice problems solved in class, non-cumulative exams, good powerpoints for lectures, formula sheets for exam\r\n\r\nweaknesses: lots of work on your own to understand material, time-consuming problem sets, difficult to get A because many students have already taken multivariable calculus in high school or MATH 120\r\n\r\nhow to improve course: more generous curve, shorten problem sets",
                "The office hours were very helpful, and the professor always put the effort in to helping out students who do not fully grasp the content. The small class size facilitated interaction, and the professor kept me very engaged in lecture. The only thing I would change are the pre-lecture quizzes. I always did them last minute, and I felt like they were not necessary to follow the lecture material.",
                "The strength of the course was definitely the professor. Vidvuds was really intentional during the time that he spent with students, for example, during office hours he was there strictly to answer our questions and engage with us and the course material. The course has a great source of supporting materials. If you missed a lecture, there was a recorded mini-lecture you could watch to not fall behind. There were many excellent resources to prepare for exams, too. The problem sets were pretty reasonable in terms of difficulty and there were always enough opportunities to get support in completing them during the week. Personally, I am not a fan of the pre-class quizzes. I know their aim is to have the students become somewhat familiar with the topics ahead of class, however, in practice, they simply end up being something to quickly get out of the way before class, which means that not much intentional thought goes into completing them.",
                "There are a lot of office hours and TA hours, and plenty of time during class was devoted to going over examples.",
                "Strengths: The p-sets are hard, but they prepare you for the exams. Expectations are laid out clearly in the syllabus. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The pre-recorded lectures contain the same content that is taught in the lecture. Sometimes I find the book more useful in learning the content.",
                "A major strength of this course was how the professor explained the theorems in a way that clearly added on to the textbook reading and quizzes. The PSets and organization of the class (quizzes, psets, exams) made it very easy to prepare and gradually improve.",
                "Online lectures that were posted helped a lot, as well as office hours.",
                "the weekly psets are relatively long but do teach you a lot. the exams feel fair though there is usually a time crunch. no real complaints, vidvuds is great and engages well with students",
                "Strengths: format with pre-lecture videos and quizzes, abundance of review sessions and office hours\r\nWeaknesses: lack of practice problems in class with in-depth explanations",
                "Pace was fair and many practice questions were distributed to engage the student to the class. Peer tutors and teacher assistants were also very helpful in navigating problem sets. More time and work was necessary to learn concepts by yourself rather than from lectures. While this may improve a student's studying habits, it takes up time when lectures are consistently confusing.",
                "I think this class was well-organized, and it was well-known what was expected each week of class.  One major strength of the course was the ability to use the review material on Canvas to prepare thoroughly for the midterm and final exams.  These review problems helped the exams feel much more sensible.  One weakness of the course was the lack of engagement in the classroom itself.  As it was a lecture, there wasn't much room for participation.",
                "Taught very quickly particularly for freshman adjusting.",
                "Strengths: builds strong multi variable calculus foundations",
                "Good course. However I didnt always feel like concepts were explained well.",
                "The course was well organized but sometimes the lectures were confusing and not a lot of practice problems in class for the topics I needed help with.",
                "It good",
                "This class does well at teaching applications. No weaknesses",
                "Very fast and tough to comprehend",
                "At times it was very fast paced and difficult to follow, but for the most part this course was taught extremely well and help was given whenever asked.",
                "The strengths of this course would be that the professor teaching it had a very solid grasp on the concepts involved, the lecture notes and videos as well as the practice sets were all very helpful, and the course was of a good size. The only weakness I'd say would be that the pace was very brisk sometimes, and some topics may have benefited from some more time spent on them, though which topics honestly depends on the student.",
                "Teaches a broad range of skills but at times I believe it could be explained for in depth as some of the material is gone over too quickly",
                "Only 1 section, felt there wasnt enough peer tutoring hours and the hours available werent beneficial",
                "Very clear lectures could be more interactive",
                "office hours times",
                "The strengths of the course are how organized all the units are and the amount of help that is offered. I would say the weaknesses lie in the overwhelming workload, that is amplified by lectures not always being clear or related to the material thats being tested.",
                "I wish that the pre-lecture and lecture contained different content sometimes, that was slower paced in some ways and could strengthen the understanding of the material provided in psets and other problems of the sort. However, the conceptual basis for the class is well explained, and I enjoy the content thoroughly!"

                "Yes, it is a very nice way to become acquainted with multivariable calculus, and to discover the many ways it relates to engineering.",
                "Yes, but it seemed like many other students had taken multivariable before or were familiar with the concepts. I am not sure if that is a tend only for the fall class. I felt that I picked up the concepts quickly but the tests would test the creativity of the concepts in ways different than high school, so in that regard people with prior experience had an advantage. However, I do not regret taking the class immediately after Calc BC because, it would be the same outcome regardless.",
                "I dont know how many people would be interested in taking this rigorous of a math class just because, however, if those people do exist, then this course is really excellent for that endeavor. The course really gives you such a universal toolbox of skills to tackle problems in so so many different fields, in addition to improving your problem-solving skills. The difficulty level is also just perfect in my opinion. You will definitely feel challenged, however, you wont feel like pulling out your hair every single week upon seeing the problem set. Attending class is an enjoyable experience. The course wonderfully highlights the fundamentality of calculus in literally every single QR and science field.",
                "Absolutely! I thought that the class moved very quickly but there was a perfect amount of practice through the class and psets for me.",
                "Take this course if you need it for your major; otherwise, it is a pretty difficult course, so I would not recommend.",
                "I would! This class was MUCH more engaging than MATH 120 and would 100% recommend it if you are looking to take multivariable calc. I am an Economics major but still really enjoyed the class.",
                "Yes",

                "Yes. Especially over MATH 120. The exams are non-cumulative and were taken during class time, and the concepts were easy to grasp with a little bit of studying.",
                "Yes, if it is required for your prospective major.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone considering a degree in the applied sciences or engineering because it provides problem-based learning that gave me a solid background in multivariable calculus.",
                "Yes but it is very hard.",
                "Yes if they are interested in mathematical applications.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class if taken with Professor Ozolins, and probably regardless of the teacher! I had found calculus a bit boring in the past but this course really elevated all of the content I had learned during Calc I and II, and is probably one of my favorite courses I have taken so far at Yale. I enjoyed Professor Ozolin's highly-visual explanations and example-based teaching, and although each class/PSET required a good amount of independent preparation/work, each exercise felt worthwhile to my overall understanding of the course content. I feel like all of the time I put into this class was well-spent, and Professor Ozolins is such a kind and approachable teacher--along with the TAs, I felt like there were plenty of resources as long as I sought them out! I took this class as a sophomore and it was definitely quite rigorous compared to other STEM courses I took at Yale, so I don't know if a first-year student would feel as comfortable with the intensity during their first semester. It definitely took me a few weeks to adjust to the workload, and conceptual difficulty as well.",
                "Yes, great professor and class.",
                "Yuh",
                "Yes, if taking engineering.",
                "Only if they have to take it",
                "Yes, because it is apparently better than Math 120 in the sense that it is more based on theory than hard calculations.",
                "Yes, I would. I was able to learn a lot in this course, and it actually helped me become acclimated to the different teaching style in higher education. I feel that I have obtained a solid understanding of the concepts in this course as well, and the course was structured so that everything came together towards the end. The coursework was not overwhelming, and every topic was within reach if one applied themself.",
                "I would tell them to consider math 120 and Enas 151and choose which suits them best",
