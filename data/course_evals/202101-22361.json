In particular, we learned about taxes, sociopolitical institutions, and some microeconomic theories behind the increase in inequality.",

                "There were many strengths to this course. The content was very tailored and each week had a specific focus that allowed us to really gain a deep understanding of income inequality. The professor was also really committed to helping us understand the material and encouraged regular participation. The fact that it was such a small lecture really allowed us to talk about the material and develop a stronger relationship with the professor. A small way it could be improved is by having pre-selected dates for the midterm\/final\/paper so that we can plan our schedules more in advance."

While I am not much of a fan of cold-calling, it did help make the class move along well.  We had a fairly small class size, which didn't help much on this end, but it made us more comfortable speaking, so even if we answered incorrectly, it didn't matter much.  Overall, the professor encouraging discussion and prodding students along helped move discussions better.",
                "The lecture was done in the best way possible for the virtual environment, but obviously an in-person class where we can see the board better and engage in a more natural way would be better for the future."

I would not recommend the course to students who don't have an understanding of calculus, however, because it is important from understanding the microeconomic sections of the course at the beginning.  Overall, I would recommend to any economics  major and a political science major with a basic understanding of economics and a workable understanding of calculus.",
