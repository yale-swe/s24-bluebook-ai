                "I learned a great deal about how paleoclimate proxy records inform our understanding of historical climate change events, and how ancient societies reacted and adapted to them. The course focuses on numerous case studies that demonstrate the interconnection between climate change and societal collapse, and ultimately point to the interesting conclusion that societal collapse is an adaptive strategy in the face of insurmountable climate challenges.",
                "I had zero knowledge of archaeology or the paleoclimate sciences coming into the course. Through a lot of reading and helpful discussions with the section TA, as well as the course lecture, I learned the basics of terms and methodologies in these disciplines. I also got a good grasp of the complexities re: the questions of collapse analysis on some of the most significant and contentious cases in human history such as the Akkadian, Assyrian, and the Mayan collapses. The most important takeaway I think is the critical eye with which one must evaluate all data, quantitative and qualitative in order to understand relations, causal and otherwise.",

                "Strengths: Breadth of content, flexibility to explore one's own interests\r\nWeaknesses: Wish there was more lecture instead of student presentations, but I think that might just have been a symptom of having a large class.",
                "I truly loved this course! I learned so much about ancient civilizations and their collapses, especially relating to climatic change. The only \"weakness\" is that I have no idea what my grade is.",
                "There are a lot of readings in the class, but the discussions with Prof Weiss and the TAs really helped me to make sense of them.",
                "The strengths is that it relies heavily on research and scientific evidence alongside more digestible books and paper, which builds literacy in scientific research and the ability intertwine paleoclimatology, archaeology, and anthropology. Another pro is the opportunity for each student to present a 30-minute case study and PowerPoint, which is a valuable exercise in and of itself. A third pro is the inclusion of competing theories in the syllabus -- although Professor Weiss certainly has his own perspective, he clearly wants us to read and think through different ideas for ourselves. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of the course is its grading structure. It was quite stressful have received so few grades until the final week. At this point, I have no idea where I stand in terms of my grade and have not received any feedback, even though the semester is over.",
                "The best thing about the course was the subject material and the breadth of data available, the types of questions generated from their analysis, the potential for interdisciplinary work that can and must be done to answer those. I appreciated all the student presentations and would've loved more time for discussion on each topic/collapse scenario presented. Also the sections did not meet as regularly as expected, though the times we had together were very helpful. Lastly, it was challenging in the beginning for someone like me coming in without any baseline familiarity with archaeological, geological studies to get a super brief overview on terms and concepts so that I could understand and critique the readings assigned later more holistically.",
                "I liked the topic. It was stressful having no grades until the final 3 weeks of class. More and smaller assignments and less reading would be great."

                "Yes, it is interesting and engaging with a low workload. I really liked that we learned about how data is collected in archaeology/climatology and how claims are supported- this made it a decent intro to archaeology/climatology class.",
                "Yes, if they are interested about the relationships between environments and societal change.",

                "Yes, a great way to think about collapse in general, especially in view of the possibility of severe climate consequences in our near future. Taking this course helped me gain historical and cultural awareness of this question, and apply the scientific method to think about collapse.",
                "I think a student with a sincere interest in historical climate collapse cases would be very interested in this course. I think if there was improvement to the grading structure or incremental feedback offered, then I would be much more willing to recommend this course to my friends with an interest in climate science but perhaps to as much deep paleoclimate/archaeological experience.",
                "Yes and no. I definitely loved the material and everything I've learned. I just wish the course could've been structured in a way that supports student's learning process (e.g. basics of archaeological terms and dating methodologies).",
