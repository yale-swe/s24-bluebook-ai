There was also no common theme to the class other than the formatting of code and very basic R functionality. The industry doesn't even use R anymore, and the adamant opposition to using any packages did not enhance our understanding in any meaningful way. To be honest, I have no idea how this is considered a capstone class given how incredibly basic the material is. We spent a very long time doing web scraping with R, and there was very little opportunity to actually use the more advanced concepts we learned in the major."

We had a problem set that he refused to give us answers for as he felt that is what the real world would be like. I often felt like I would be scoffed at when asking a question until towards the end. It may not be out of malice, but he can be cold. There isn't much teaching that goes on in the course either, you'll learn more from working through assignments with friends than you will in seminar.",
