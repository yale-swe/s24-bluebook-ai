            "comments": [
                "Strengths: lectures were so fun - they felt like Ted Talks more than classes. Super diverse sources of data viz were drawn from (e.g. Web DuBois) which was super cool and a broader perspective than I've ever seen in a data-driven course at Yale\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I took this class to improve my coding skills, but there was little to no coding practice during lectures. Sections were helpful but it felt like some time could have been reallocated to focusing on actually creating the plots that we were analyzing. Lectures often felt a bit disorganized although they were always interesting.",
                "The weakness is that the lectures are sort of a mishmash of the things that Alex is interested in and knowledgable about related to data visualization. Sometimes these were more germane to my interests than at other times.\r\n\r\nSometimes it felt like the TFs had to try to squeeze too much coding into the sections, and I think that some of the lectures could have had a little more time devoted to teaching it, rather than squeezing it into 50 minutes each week. \r\n\r\nThe strength is that the lectures are sort of a mishmash of the things that Alex is interested in and knowledgable about related to data visualization. They were often pretty interesting and Alex's passion for it certainly came through!\r\n\r\nAnother positive is the amount of flexibility in the course in terms of being able to adapt the homework throughout the semester and the final project to whatever you might be interested in or researching.",
                "I think a major weakness of this class was that there was no real need for section. Sections just became mini lectures because the course material was not well designed for collaboration. Additionally, much of the \"learning\" was self taught. Some lectures would consist of the professor spending an entire hour describing a graphs that were very clearly interpretable and could've been done outside of lectures. Lectures felt like a waste of time.",
                "No feedback was given ever!!! Also they randomly gave everyone 2\/3 on all assignments and said that stood for a check and was fine. Which like cool bro but also wtf does a check mean in terms of grades??? Like should I credit d or what? And we didn't recieve these grades until past the midterm sooooo we couldnt even try to improve our checks???",
                "The course assignments were very strong, with a reasonable weekly pset and exciting final project broken up into three steps. I also feel that section was very helpful. The only improvement would be more availability for meeting and office hours as much of the coding work was done outside class.",
                "The strengths were the lectures, the psets and the sections. The only thing that could be improved is the general structure of the class and the feedback mechanisms. I often did not know what exactly was expected of me, nor did I know exactly how I was doing in the class for the majority of the semester.",
                "There are many strengths in this course. The professor was very knowledgeable in data visualizations, and pretty much allowed us to use our imagination when it come to doing our problem sets. A weakness for this course was that at times, it seemed a bit unorganized (Psets would be posted late, Section would not relate to what we are learning in class, etc.).",
                "This is a great class, I'd say the only improvement needed is more clarity on what assignment grades mean",
                "I like the variety of the material we learned. I struggled with learning R, so it would have been nice if the sections were catered toward each of the problem sets more than they were. Sometimes there was disconnect between lecture and section, and it was hard to know in which direction the course was going. But the lectures were great, and Prof. Coppock is super cool and engaging! The perception experiment we did was the coolest part of the class. More things like that would make the class better.",
                "Perhaps just more structure to the course. I felt like every new lecture was like an Easter egg, I didn't really know what we were going to talk about. Maybe that could be better clarified on the syllabus.",
                "I wish that the course curriculum were outlined in detail in the syllabus, so that I had a roadmap of topics covered prior to starting the semester. Each week's lecture was definitely interesting and helpful, but sometimes I found myself confused as to how to use what I learned in lecture to complete problem sets. I also wish problem set feedback were more specific, so I could learn how to improve my code.",
                "It was kind of unstructured, which I didn't like so much, but the content was great.",
                "strengths: discussions, instructor walking through the code during lectures and showing examples, office hours, availability and willingness of TFs and instructor to virtually meet with students outside of class, piazza\r\nweaknesses: vague guidance\/information regarding grading and assignments",
                "This course was extremely interdisciplinary, exploring data visualization through theory, analysis, coding, and its relationship to the visual arts; this was one of its strongest points in my opinion. One weakness was that the explanation of some of the code was difficult to understand (during discussion sections mostly).",
                "Prof. Coppock is a very engaging and caring professor. Lecture brought a variety of perspectives on data visualization. The one source for improvement would be increased clarity in assignments: throughout the semester the class grading scheme was unclear and students received sparse feedback on their assignments.",
                "This course allows for a lot of individual exploration and expression, meaning you can get a lot out of the class if you invest into it. At the same time, however, the freedom and flexibility of the course might leave you a little lost if you don't have something you care about. I thought the flexibility was really conducive for my learning, but I can see how it might have the opposite affect for others.",
                "The section in conjunction w lecture was very helpful",
                "Strengths: really interesting content and fun psets! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: unclear structure, no official syllabus, and weird grading scale",
                "Strengths - professor, skills learned\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes a bit jumpy in terms of course material.",
                "Strengths: Fun professor, knowledgeable TFs, interesting content.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Poor communication. Some of the questions I posted in Piazza were never answered or received replies after 2-3 days. Feedback for the final project was minimal. I also had no idea how I was doing in this class since Canvas does not display my grade and pset grades were not entered until late in the semester.",
                "such incredible teaching!! wouldnt change a thing.",
                "The diversity of topics and the arts-based perspective of this course was very interesting. I liked the clean and clear portrayal of the code offered in this course.\r\n\r\nThis course could be improved by offering more substantive coding material. I loved learning about maps, animations, and various plots, but I wish we could have delved deeper into these topics or learned more code. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, this course could be drastically improved by offering clearer feedback on problem sets in a quicker timeframe. We didn't receive the majority of grades back on problem sets until halfway through the semester, and the grading scheme was unclear and feedback minimal. The grading scheme and expectations of the course was never clearly communicated, which made it difficult to improve",
                "This course was absolutely fun! It taught me to take what I already learned in other stats classes and actually pay attention to the design and aesthetics of the data I was visualizing, and to produce the data in a way that was visually appealing\/would better convey the information. The teaching staff were really supportive w class material and beyond, and I had a wonderful time learning from them.",
                "Strengths: Goes beyond the R you learn in 230 to create visualizations that are closer to the kind you'd need to make for real jobs in business or academia. Weaknesses: Expectations were extremely unclear throughout the whole course. It was never specified what problem set grade was full credit, feedback was late and very little when we did get it, and instructions for the final project were unhelpfully vague. Organization was definitely the class' biggest weakness and I hope that will improve with time, since this was the first year it was taught.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Very well structured lectures, highly engaging despite being online\r\n- Amazing professor: very accesible and willing to help!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I felt the course sometimes lost time by going through certain abstract\/not so practical topics: eg. history of data visualization,  abstract art. In all fairness, this was clearly anticipated when enrolling in the course. But I still felt as students we could have spent more time learning more valuable practical skills (eg. learning to plot more complex time series, or more complex mapping projects) instead of the abstract part.\r\n- office hours, while super helpful, were way too limited for the course load (15min per week not enough when you have multiple coding questions)",
                "Strengths: very useful skills, nice professor and TA, they were super helpful as well with code troubleshooting.\r\nWeaknesses: took a while to get grades back on things, unclear expectations and rubrics on some assignments."

                "This course worked well virtually, and the recorded lectures were a great resource to come back to.",
                "Recording lectures asynchronously was really nice as I found myself rewatching them. I thought the weekly sections were also helpful.",
                "Done well, TFs and Teachers were very accessible",
                "I think the lectures were super fun and interesting and very adaptable to online formats, but they weren't always super related to the homework. Additionally, the course felt a bit too unstructured.",
                "This course was well adjusted to virtual learning. Sharing screens to show R code was very helpful",
                "I found the lectures very effective in the remote setting for this class.  The use of breakout rooms when possible was always great as well",
                "I feel that this course was pretty well-adapted to the Zoom format. Professor Coppock's excitement for and enjoyment in teaching the material was palpable every day, and that made lectures always interesting. I'm glad for Q&A and discussion that sprung from the Zoom chat. Both my TF (Cleo!) and Prof. Coppock very clearly prioritized students' learning and wellbeing, and for example encouraged us to ask for help\/an extension instead of staying up late to complete an assignment, which I really appreciated. It was nice to have Piazza for asynchronous Q&A, but I wish that the teaching team had been a little bit more frequently\/consistently presentsome weeks a question might go unadressed for many days. It might also have been nice to have distributed the grade percentages differently, in order to encourage student engagement on Piazza or in section. Otherwise, another really helpful aspect of this course was just how relevant much of the material was to such a crazy and hard year. It was motivating and helpful to engage with data viz that looked at the COVID-19 pandemic, that looked at the U.S. election, and that was relevant to the movement for racial justice (such as when we studied Du Bois).",
                "Which practices succeeded:\r\n- Well organized lectures\r\n- VERY engaging professor (even funny!) --> crucial for online lectures\r\n\r\nWhich could be improved:\r\n- More time for office hours, given these are online it's not the same!",
                "I think the instructor did well with office hours, sections, and lectures.  It was easier to follow along virtual than it would've been in person.  Easier to see exactly what the code was."

                "If you're looking for a chill way to learn about data viz, go for it! It's a great 5th class. Wouldn't take this if you're trying to start off with a solid coding foundation though or if you want something more rigorous.",
                "Yes, but you should know what you're getting yourself into. Learning R\/ggplot is only one part of the course. There's also history, theory, artistic abstraction, etc.; it's sort of a grab bag of the professor's interests. He's a really interesting guy and everyone will find some things to like in the lectures but probably find some less helpful than others. But if you're interested in learning about a bunch of different topics related to data visualization and also some coding, then this might be the class for youthink of it as a really cool podcast with some programming thrown in.",
                "I would honestly not recommend this class, unless you want a filler class that won't be too difficult and need it for a distributional requirement. I feel like I learned as much as I would've learned by taking a few weeks to learn ggplot on my own.",
                "Sure if you like the professor. It was honestly not very useful to someone looking for a gut. They tried to ask for a lot, without providng ANY feedback or guidance???",
                "Yes. Anyone who is interesting in learning a bit of code or on visualizations should take this course. Professor Coppock is great.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone that wants an easier introduction to coding in R. Professor Coppock and the TAs are really good at helping beginners with the code.",
                "Yes, but only if you have experience with R and ggplot. It makes things easier at the beginning of the course. I took it as an S&DS elective",
                "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS! It's a great environment to learn data visualization. Professor Alex is one of the best professors at Yale. He really encourages you to learn and has made the course in such a way that you can learn without completely harming any of the self-esteem\/confidence you have left",
                "Yes. For the STEM people well-versed in R, you learn more about the theory and history of data visualizations. That is great. For humanities students like me, this class is great because it's a transition from history\/theory to a more practical application of it in R.",
                "Yes, esp. for those looking to satisfy a credit for the S&DS certificate!",
                "Yes, if you're interested in an introductory course that delves into R through the lens of ggplot.",
                "definitely!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this since I believe these skills can be used beyond the classroom and in our careers",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student who has interdisciplinary interests--perhaps a humanities student who wants to dip their toes in data science\/coding. I do think, however, this course is best for those who have some previous experience coding in R.",
                "Yes, I think I learned a great number of practical skills.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to gain more experience in R. You will gain very tangible skills in designing, creating, and thinking about data visualizations which can be helpful in a lot of fields.",
                "Yes, great way to learn an effective skill in data visualization but in a social context",
                "Yes! A lot of useful and good information, only if you care about the topic.",
                "Yes if you want to learn how to do data visualization. Useful skill to learn. Professor Coppock is 10\/10.",
                "Maybe. The course content is interesting and unlike any other class that I've taken before. HOWEVER, the course can sometimes be overwhelming especially if you don't know R. As a non-S&DS major who has never used R prior to this class, I survived but I had to go to office hours a lot. Communication sucked. We had a Piazza forum, but some questions never received answers. Weekly pset grades were never swiftly entered into Canvas. Also, watch out for the 3,000-4,000 word final essay.",
                "YES. You learn such cool skills in this course and it is always very interesting.",
                "Yes Alex is a great professor, so nice and funny, and the course itself is very interesting",
                "I would recommend this course as a low workload, interesting course on R code. It is not particularly challenging. No prior experience with R is required, but some coding knowledge may be helpful.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this class as it was fun, full of learning, and not the most difficult",
                "Yes absolutely! I loved this course, it really taught me to think about how I visually present my data and also how to be creative with data visualizations! The teaching staff were so understanding and kind to me as I encountered personal challenges throughout the semester, and this was honestly one of my favorite classes this semester. Assignments and topics were fun, too!",
                "I'd recommend it if you already have some R programming experience. Even though it says that's not a pre-requisite, this is not the class to learn the language.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. It's been one of my favorite courses at Yale, and I'm sure it will only get better the more it iterates (this was the first time it was taught).",
                "Yes! Super fun and low stakes way to learn how to visualize data. Lots of work, but very fun and rewarding! \r\nAlso you get what you put in.",
                "Yes!  Especially if they want to learn R.  Producing graphs on it is so easy now, and they look good.  The skills I've learned in this class have definitely helped me out in other classes and projects as well."
