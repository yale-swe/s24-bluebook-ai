   "comments": [
    "I was glad to have the opportunity to focus a little bit more on South American and Central American history after two semester on focusing on African and African-American history. I think this course revealed ways of thinking interdisciplinarily around Black Studies and its connections to broader colonial projects.",
    "Knowledge: Colonialism, slavery, resistance, emancipation, post-emancipation, in the Americas (Haiti, U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Puerto Rico, Cuba, etc.), Africa (Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Togo, etc.), and Europe (Britain, France). \r\nInsights: How the threads of colonialism, imperialism, and capitalism intertwine across the Atlantic. How these issues remain unresolved today. Looking at race and gender with a critical eye on how they tie into the colonial project.\r\nSkills: How to examine historical sources and secondary literature critically.",
    "I learned about different types of empires, how they conquered new lands, and how scholars are reclaiming the voices of the formerly enslaved.",
    "I really learned about the Atlantic world as a site of colonial exploitation and brutality but also as a site of resistance on the part of many people.",
    "The class got me down, for good reason. It was a thorough survey of the destructive ideology, inhuman practices, and frequently distressing,  occasionally absurd motives behind colonialism and imperialism in the Atlantic World. The class provided me a valuable foundation  I gained a sense of the intellectual, political, and technical developments that guided these processes.",
    "surveys a region of the world that seems obscure but is actually at the foundation of our modern experience"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the course ultimately assigns more reading than is feasible, but Professor Eller, the seminar fellow, and the assignments are all excellent and well-calibrated to thinking about the work in the course. I also feel that the interdisciplinary work (thinking around Trouillot and Wexler) were some of the best moments of this course, and I would love to see that more fully integrated into the syllabus. However, I think the course could use a more limited geographic scope to avoid jumping around, and to make it easier to articulate the week-to-week connections.",
    "Strengths: A really diverse and broad coverage of material. Illuminating connections and microhistories! \r\nWeaknesses: Literature was overwhelmingly secondary. Would have appreciated looking at some more primary sources.",
    "The readings for this course were not carefully chosen, nor was class discussion well guided to make sure that we would come out of the course feeling that we had learned a lot \/ become fluent in an area of history. Because we so rarely read more than one thing about any given topic\/place\/time period, we were stuck evaluating our readings without any context. I recognize that some of the issues with this class were a result of the very broad topic-- but I think a course with this broad of a topic can work if the class discussions are guided really well to facilitate student learning (unlike in this class). The professor obviously knows so much about the topics we studied, but when we asked questions we were more likely to get a book recommendation than to get a substantive answer. Aspirationally we would all have time to read academic books on our own time, but that's not the case and it would have been way more helpful to get real answers (even if incomplete).",
    "Classroom discussion was engaging and the professor was extremely enthusiastic in teaching us about the content and where to go for further reading.",
    "I did not feel Professor Eller had specific goals for each class. I wish shed had her own discussion questions for us. I felt the final assignment seemed unclear. Also, the feedback on our multiple reading responses wasnt that helpful.",
    "I thought the readings for this class were very interesting and that the workload was very fair - especially since we could choose when we wanted to submit our reading responses. The only thing I might change for the future were the student presentations. I wasn't sure what they contributed to the discussions, or the class in general, and it may have been more helpful to have students lead the discussion that day or something like that.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think the span of the class was a bit broad and I might have gotten more out of it had it been purely centered on the Caribbean (which it was for the most part anyway).",
    "The class was immersive in its vagueness. It was often unclear why we chose too focus on certain locations and instances rather than others, and it might have been helpful if the thematic structure of the course were more explicit. The jumping between regions, cultures, and times revealed the alarming ubiquity of colonialism and imperialism, which was a powerful effect.",
    "great reading materials and professor. would love for more insight and direction from Prof. Eller rather than mostly on the students"

   "comments": [
    "Yes. I think Professor Eller is wonderful, very knowledgeable, and a good person to know in the fields of colonial history. The course is interesting, and interdisciplinary at its best moments, and that makes it worth it.",
    "Take it if you're the least bit interested in the history of colonialism, slavery, and post-slavery societies. Prof. Eller is super passionate and engaging.",
    "No -- I didn't come out of it feeling like I learned a lot. I learned some of what is out there to be learned, but we never engaged with topics in depth enough for me to feel like I really understand them now. It was a very frustrating course, because it felt like it could have been so good if more thought had gone into selecting readings and guiding class discussion",
    "Yes. Our world and discourse are shaped by the horrors of the past two centuries. One can gain a lot of insight into racial discourse and discourse about power through understanding the past.",
    "I would not take this course again.",
    "If you can take a class with Professor Eller, absolutely do so. You will learn so much from her, and you will never look at the Caribbean the same way again.",
    "This course was an enlightening dive into the dynamics of colonialism and imperialism. Definitely focused more imperialism than resistance, the course offers a lot of insight into the historical origins of contemporary notions of geopolitics, economics, and race. The readings are interesting for the most part, and Anne Eller is an enthusiastic teacher with an encyclopedic knowledge of the subject.",
    "Definitely, especially for those interested in European studies. It is a subject matter that reveals the hidden turmoil behind easily accessible narratives familiar to us.",
    "Yes! This seminar was a wonderful way to connect events and themes across the Atlantic. This course helped me to gain a more complex understanding of imperialism and slavery in the 19th C and made me want to learn so much more about each of the topics we touched on."
