   "comments": [
    "ability to intake full ethnographies and synthesize main ideas to form a greater understanding of medical work",
    "I was able to develop my reading skills as we had to read two ethnographies a week and write book reviews as assignments.",
    "We explored anthropological approaches to global health, through reading and discussing award-winning ethnographies and films. We focused on infections and inequalities, child survival, gender matters, and healthcare and humanitarianism. In addition to these facets, we focused on many exigent global health problems, including HIV\/AIDS, malaria, obstetric emergencies, the global polio campaign, infertility, and the health costs of war and displacement. This class helped develop my awareness of the political, socioeconomic, ecological, cultural, and organizational complexity of most global health problems, and the consequent need for anthropological sensitivity, contextualization, and activist commitment.",
    "How to read better, present myself in discussions, apply myself to other contexts",
    "Learned about the complexities of health issues around the world and the structural violence and sociopolitical issues that affect them.",
    "In this course I got to know more about how medical anthropologists conduct their field work and structure their ethnographies. Furthermore I got an inside view of the dynamic between humanitarian organisations, grass root workers, high ranked officials, politicians, anthropologists, pharmaceutical companies and the people who are suffering. We looked at a variety of different topics, countries and cultures. On one hand I had the chance to dive deep into one specific ethnography and on the other I could compare them and highlight similarities and differences. One of my biggest takeaways of this course is: \"Every situation is different. Therefore I cannot judge organisations or people based on my experiences in other situations, but have to take a closer look at this particular study.\"\r\nI'M still deeply touched and amazed by some of the ethnographies. \r\nDuring the discussions I got an in depth view of how fellow students relate and work with the topics we discussed. By getting to know their opinion I got the chance to challenge my own.\r\nBy leading a discussion and preparing a question set with a partner I got the chance to expend my leadership skills. Furthermore I got to know another persons work style which was really inspiring too.\r\n\r\nSkill wise I improved in focusing on a specific topic or argument and the structure of my reading responses and book reviews. I developed better writing skills by improving in how to develop an argument and how to write a text which is structured and clear."

   "comments": [
    "The only assignments given were writing assignments which we were not allowed to revise so I do not think it is an accurate way of grading a student as there was a grander scheme of knowledge that could have been tested.",
    "Strengths - the structure! we knew exactly what we were doing each day. Class was Monday and Wednesday. each day an entire ethnography was due along with a reading response. the 2.5 hour seminar was full student - led. you paired up with a person and led discussion. \r\nWeakness - a lot of reading and wish this class was offered during the year!",
    "AMAZING CLASS no downsides, Marcias amazing, no improvements except it should fulfill a WR.",
    "This was a fantastic and intense class, with a great professor and engaging topics of conversation. Our writing assignments and presentations were well structured. I only wish our essays could have had more of an analytical component rather than just boom review.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- lively and inspiring discussions\r\n- room for self improvement by writing multiple reading responses and book reviews\r\n- individual time management by having the chance to choose which reading responses and book reviews I want to submit\r\n- safe and trustful group atmosphere which gave everybody the chance to open up and share their thoughts\r\n- excellent pick of inspiring ethnographies \r\n- individual feedback\r\n- sweet or savoury surprises :)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nnone!"

   "comments": [
    "YES TAKE THE CLASS! To be honest, before going into the class, I was kind of uncertain whether I made the right choice because I had little previous background in global health. But I ended up absolutely loving it! The readings are very interesting. Most of them are pretty easy to read through with mostly compelling ethnographic accounts of people struggling with health issues in different regions of the world.",
    "yes!",
    "Yes, it is a good way to read in the summer and learn time management.",
    "yes yes yes. all students who are interested in global health, public health, medical anthropology, cultural anthropology...take this!!",
    "YES you will learn so much about the world never be bored also she brings snacks!! (Literal icing on the cake)",
    "Absolutely, for those of all interests. It's a very involved course, but you get a ton out of it.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to everyone who is interested in the work of humanitarian organisations and wants to improve their leadership and writing skills.\r\n\r\nThis course is inspiring and challenging no matter if you major in anthropology or not because the topics discussed are relevant to all of us."
