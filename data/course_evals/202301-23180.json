                "Content: explored the historical legacies of democracy promotion, democracy promotion's various mechanisms, and possible implementations, and the United States' (and the West's) complex involvement with democracy promotion, etc.",
                "This is a really interesting and practical course that talks at great length about American foreign policy relating to democracy promotion.",

                "Extremely interesting readings and very dynamic in-class conversations. Professor Bush is always open to giving feedback to students and meeting with them to discuss the class and assignments.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bush! She knows everything about the topic and cares about it.  The material was interesting; everyone loved the week on the Color Revolutions and for good reason. Other weeks were a bit more hit or miss, but Professor Bush clearly thought a lot about her pieces! The guest speakers were also super cool; I wish we had more. Weaknesses: there wasn't a lot of discussion on the \"its critiques\" part of the name - the course assumed that democracy is a priori a good thing regardless, which is maybe not always so clear. The course was a hybrid political history and international relations course, and some weeks felt disconnected. While each reading was interesting, the course should be tinkered with in the future (especially the disjointedness of the response papers \/ final paper).",
                "The readings and writing assignments were very interesting, though sometimes class discussions seemed to lack the same vigor and enthusiasm.",
                "The class has interesting topics, but the readings and professor are relatively bland. To be honest, there are better seminars out there, but the professor is very nice and helpful",
                "Strengths: Interesting and engaging professor, relevant material, great readings\r\nWeaknesses: Discussions can be a bit disjointed and not everybody seemed super engaged",
                "Great readings, class discussion was a little stale even the members of the class were excited to discuss because of the breadth of the material",
                "I learned a lot about NGOs and democracy promotion programs."

                "I would say yes; this is very much an \"international relations\" seminar. At times discussions felt uncomfortably US-centric, and most of the readings were Western-centric. This makes sense given the content, but the most engaging weeks were from the perspective of non-western states (for instance, the Color Revolutions and Otpor!). The material is not for everyone, but it's interesting, and even if you're against democracy promotion, you could get a lot of useful history from the course. Professor Bush is lovely and cares a lot for her students; she had a difficult semester health-wise and made the best of it, which I admire her for!",
