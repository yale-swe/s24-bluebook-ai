                "I developed an ability to understand authors within the context of their work and think about questions relating to who is writing the work and how that affects it not just the work itself.",
                "Prof. Mitchell really did a fantastic job of asking us to think for ourselves when analyzing the readings. Every question was on the table and every question was open ended. I really think this course asked me to think critically in exciting ways while also allowing me to approach the material in an emotional manner.",
                "I learned about Claude McKays writings and life. I was able to think about how his writing style evolved and his arc from a post to a novelist. I also learned a lot about how to discuss literature in seminar and what to search for.",
                "I felt I came away with a deeper and more intimate understanding of not only Claude McKay, but how to read an author's work and their own relationship to it.",

                "Strengths: very fun, very chill atmosphere. I'm super glad I took this course\r\nWeaknesses: lack of feedback on papers, wish we had gone into the history and mckay as a person more",
                "excellent course!!",
                "The strength of this course was Professor Mitchell. He consistently provided important insights in class and guided our discussions skillfully. He was also very understanding and committed to students' needs. The weakness of this course was that we did not receive any feedback on any of our papers at all.",
                "In the best of ways, this class is what you make it. Professor Mitchell does an incredible job stepping in to provide context for the material when needed, but more generally, stepping aside to let discussion flow organically. He's directing traffic and does so in a way that isn't detached or uninterested. Quite the opposite, you can tell he loves the material and loves the process of re-learning it with his students. He gives enough space to both teach and be taught. It's dope.",
                "Appreciated the three essays spaced out to discuss different McKay texts/forms. Less stressful than a midterm and final, and allowed us to more deeply explore what we were interested in - lots of freedom and I think the ability to interpret literature/fiction within historical context created a lot of interesting and nuanced papers. Looked at intersections of race, gender, queerness within histories of colonialism and racial oppression through fictional characters and their stories. Prof also very kind and understanding with need for extensions",
                "Strength: The focus of the course! Its so refreshing to read one authors almost entire literary body of work.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Class at times felt unstructured aside from the book being discussed.",
                "The strengths of this course was the incredible class discussion and Professor Mitchell's insights. The weaknesses could be the lack of graded work and feed back throughout the entirety of the course despite student asks to do so.",
                "There weren't many weaknesses in my eyes. Due to the nature of the course, everyone there wanted to be there and I think that contributed to a good classroom energy. I did struggle to keep up with the readings, so perhaps the Prof. can think more about pacing moving forward, but overall this was a great discussion filled course.",
                "A strength is that Prof Mitchell as a McKay scholar is really knowledgeable about McKays work and life.",
                "Strengths: fascinating books, wonderful professor, serious discussion.\r\n\r\nWeakness: no feedback on writing.",
                "This course felt like a very familiar structure of reading and coming to class and discussing the reading. There weren't reading responses and there were only a few essaysthe major work of the material was just how many books we went through. It wasn't unmanageable, but I definitely had to plan for a significant amount of time in my week to get through it."
