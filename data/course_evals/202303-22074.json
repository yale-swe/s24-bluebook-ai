I learned a significant deal about Lewis Carroll beyond the fact that he authored Alice and Wonderland. I learned about the history of the real Alice and Lewis Carrolls life prior to writing the first Alice book. I got to compare the books to different on-screen adaptations. I got to learn about different childrens stories from the time the Alice books were written. Finally, I got to learn a great deal about names and various philosophical ideas present in the works on Lewis Carroll.",
                "This was a very interesting and creative class, and it was a fun introduction to philosophy.",
                "How to apply philosophical theories and ideas to contemporary literary texts and draw comparisons across texts.",

                "This was a very fun course. It could have been better in the end once the Alice in Wonderland book was finished. Once the book finished the readings were not as interesting.",
                "I liked that complex philosophical texts and ideas were presented in a beginner-friendly way, and that there was a nice balance between the professor teaching us about certain concepts and inviting us to engage in discussion\/debate.",
                "This course starts off very engaging, reading the Alice books and watching the films, however, the required reading moves extremely fast initially. Following the discussions of the Alice books, we moved into very philosophical ideas from very old philosophers which was not something I had anticipated from the class. Since the class is advertised as being about Alice and Wonderland, I believe a larger portion of the course should focus on the two texts and various film adaptations. By comparison to the more philosophical lessons, it feels that we moved through the Alice portion far too quickly, so the course material could be better distributed throughout the semester. Overall the course is engaging, and the discussions are very intellectually inspiring though.",
                "Professor Szabo was a large strength. He is very passionate about philosophy, and his energy when teaching the class was always very appreciated. The only weakness is that philosophy can be very confusing at times, but that doesn't really have anything to do with the class. Another strength is the variety of sources we used during the class, such as watching films and going to the Beinecke, which were very enjoyable experiences.",
                "Strengths: interesting discussions and topics\/texts\r\nWeaknesses: Philosophy readings can be difficult, class discussions could use some more structure",
                "Strengths: fascinating content (esp interesting to draw parallels to philosophical ideas\/puzzles in the alice books), enjoyable non-reading resources (aka the movies), fun discussions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings were often difficult to understand, especially from someone with no philosophy background. Would have appreciated a few notes\/annotations for certain parts of the readings."

                "Yes it was very interesting with a great professor.",
                "Yes! It was a thorough introductory survey of major topics in philosophy through the lens of Alice in Wonderland. The workload was manageable, and the readings and assignments were genuinely enjoyable. I do think this course would be better tailored to the interests of philosophy fans than Alice in Wonderland fans, though.",
                "Yes. If you are interested in philosophy of sequences and names or childrens morality stories then yes. However, if your are only interested in this course because of Alice in Wonderland, then you may want to reevaluate. Mr. Szabo does a very nice job with the class and any student would be extremely lucky to get to interact with him in this sort of setting.",
                "If you're interested in Philosophy and looking for an interesting, unique class to explore that interest, then I think this would be a great class to fulfill that interest. If you're not much of a philosophy person, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it because it's very, very philosophical which I could imagine would be a little bit of a headache for those who don't have a real interest in those concepts.",
                "Yes, I absolutely loved this class and the professor. Great class for anyone who likes to discuss and debate in a seminar-style setting. I gained so many insights from this class and am so glad I took it.",
                "Yes!! But make sure you are interested in philosophy as well as the alice books. Readings may be difficult but are important to do as otherwise the discussions will be dry."
