   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about materials and building processes",
    "Nothing really. Lectures are pretty boring, and labs don't teach you all that much",
    "I became familiar with machining and welding metal as well as lay brick and mixing mortar. The chemical processes of making each material were very interesting to learn about. However, some of the construction skills were not new to me simply by virtue of being an Architecture major.",
    "Materials in Architecture is a survey of materials and shop techniques used in construction. In the class, I learned how to lay bricks, pour and reinforce concrete, weld, build a basic wood-frame house, and construct an architectural model. The survey nature of the course necessarily sacrifices depth on each of these materials, but it was totally worth it for all of the cool, practical experience I got. The lectures were valuable to learn some of the structural\/scientific reasons why different materials are chosen for different applications and to get a sense of a few relevant architectural precedents in the built environment for the use of these materials. The model-building part of the course forces you to learn the basics of architectural drafting, potentially CAD, and really hone your skills in the shop as you put the final model together.",
    "Survey level knowledge of basic material properties and manufacturing techniques.",
    "Hands on fabrication techniques and real world applications not otherwise taught in the architecture department!",
    "I think I definitely understand the importance of specific materials when designing a building.",
    "Learned a lot about how different materials work in architecturevery informative hands on approach.",
    "Learned about materials used in architecture and basic construction techniques",
    "A real potpourri of techniques: chopping, sanding, welding, metal-bending, self-preservation...",
    "You learn about different materials in architecture and how to work with those materials in the lab section. You get to \"own\" a building for the semester, becoming the expert in that area.",
    "I thought the lectures were by far the most interesting and helpful parts of this course. Tim did a really great job of explaining the history and manufacturing process of each material throughout the semester. Additionally, I was introduced to a number of fascinating precedents I had never seen before. Going through the final project, it was also great to have Tim, Dimitri, and Laura's advice when it came to model-making. I'm sure it will help me out in the coming years."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I liked this course. I wish it weren't on Fridays but besides that it was a wonderful course.",
    "Strengths: Hands on coursework, could be a way to learn useful hands-on skills (small amounts of carpentry, masonry, concrete work, etc).\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures are boring and not very informative, labs also aren't very helpful or informative. There is only one long assignment (a research project on an existing building with a midterm presentation and final model) but the assignment is poorly thought out. Non-architecture students were given very little background on what the assignment should entail until just before the midterm presentation and then a huge amount of work was dropped on us. Grading also seemed arbitrary  everyone seemed to get the same grade on the midterm no matter how much or how little work they put in. A similar thing happened with the final project. This course could be improved by giving the assignment more structure and have the TAs lay out the expectations for the assignment more clearly and earlier in the course.",
    "Strengths- it requires no weekly work outside of class, only a midterm and final presentation. it is interesting to learn how materials are and have historically been made\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- the lectures are not always engaging, and disengaging from the course is almost encouraged by the course's structure.",
    "I thought the bricklaying, concrete, and welding labs were very strong. The wood house was also fun but involved a lot of waiting around, and I would have liked to get more of a sense of the structural reasons for choosing the particular design that we used and best practices for designing a similarly stable structure. I thought that leading the class off with a primer on model building in the shop was good, but I wished there was a refresher (which could be led by the TAs outside of class time) in the lead-up to building the model in the final weeks of the course.\r\nI really liked the final model project as a way to come to a deep understanding of how a building is put together and how drawings translate into 3D space. It definitely felt like there was not much guidance, though, on how to approach it, and I think some kind of write-up of steps and tips for model building that could be distributed to students before embarking on the project would be extremely helpful (especially for those of us who aren't architecture majors).\r\nAlso, I understand that the teaching assistants are busy with their own work, but I think if they had led a CAD\/drawing tutorial in the beginning of the semester and a guide to model building halfway through it would have helped a lot.",
    "Very relaxed introduction to shop work, fun final model, low work except the final.",
    "More direct engagement with students as they prepare their final precedent studies could be useful.",
    "There were a lot of people and sometimes that made it difficult to try new things without doing rotations, but otherwise everything was good.",
    "Strengths: diversity of materials you get to work with\r\nWeaknesses: the class structure (2 hour lecture at 9am followed by a hands-on workshop) can get repetitive",
    "This course was great!! It was super engaging to spend a few hours (the bulk of the course) each week doing hands-on work. Lectures were a little zzzz, but forgivable with such interesting labs (plus, like, it's sensible to learn about metalworking before you... work ... with. . . metal... . . ). Great to have talented TAs on hand as well.",
    "During labs, there's a lot to do, which is great, but the machines are limited, so sometimes you can just be standing around waiting to use a machine. If you're not an architecture student you don't have access to the computers or the lab space, so you have to find somewhere else to do all of your modeling and building, which can be a bother because you can't get help after business hours. There's no class budget for materials, so everything come out of pocket. On the other hand, the course is relaxed and you get to learn about different materials, but can be a bit boring if you've had a lot of shop training and building experience before.",
    "I think the course was too large this semester, which made the labs a little bit boring. It usually felt like Tim was demonstrating a technique, but we didn't really have a chance to learn much. I think the labs could be become more educational and sophisticated if the cap was adhered to.",
    "The course is really cool and I learned a lot from the labs. Tim and the TFs were great!",
    "It would be interesting to see some more modern material trends reflected in the syllabus, and perhaps more of the physics\/chemistry behind them!",
    "Loved the hands on nature and Tim was an AWESOME teacher."

   "comments": [
    "If you're an architecture major, try to take this first or sophomore year. Otherwise it will be absolutely useless.",
    "Yes. I liked it and it had a very low workload.",
    "I would not recommend this course. You don't learn that much and it is still a fair amount of work around the midterm and the final. Not worth 4-5 of your Friday for class time and not worth the work you'll put into the midterm and final.",
    "If you are an architecture major, you probably have to take it. If you aren't, you will probably find it fun.",
    "I totally recommend Materials in Architectureit has been one of my favorite and most unusual courses at Yale. Tim Newton, the professor, is funny and does a good job teaching both in the shop and in lectures, which is not an easy thing to do. I also appreciate that he kept a relatively relaxed atmosphere in the shop (without downplaying safety). I'm a mechanical engineering and history major with an interest in architecture, and I learned more shop skills in this class than I have in any of my mechanical engineering classes.\r\nIn terms of workload, the course is tricky because there are no homework assignments. Instead, the entire semester is spent working towards building a final architectural model. This is an extremely time-consuming task, especially if you have never done one before. My process involved paper drawings, a CAD model, and building the actual model out of wood, and it took over my life at the end of the semester. Get ahead because this class can't easily be blown off. That said, it is definitely a great \"fifth class\" in that (especially if you aren't an architecture major) it relies on a totally different way of thinking from the rest of your courseload.",
    "Yes! Lots of fun and a solid hands on course, even for a non major.",
    "Yes! Take this course if you want a no-nonsense non-theoretical approach to architecture.",
    "yes",
    "Take this class! Tim is a riot and you'll learn a lot from his lectures. The final project is involved but definitely manageable if you get on top of it. The TFs for this year were awesome and are really helpful. You even get a coffee break between lecture and workshop! A hidden Yale gem",
    "I picked this course because it seemed really engaging, which was something I really needed as a second-semester senior. Turned out to be a perfect choice -- you can kind of dial how much effort you want (I turned the dial towards \"medium-spicy\") since the bulk of your work goes into your final project (building a scale model of an existing building). A great opportunity to get your hands dirty once a week.",
    "It's not made for people who have had shop training before--it's actually a bit boring at that point.",
    "Really cool, low-workload course! No assignments except for the midterm and the final presentations, and the labs are very chill too."
