                "I learned how to evaluate empires from history, identifying what strategies the imperial force created to justify their colonization efforts. I want to emphasize that this was not what I expected the course to cover. My expectation was that the class would look at modern examples of imperialism, and dismantle narratives we ourselves may be convinced of. Instead, we looked at historic examples of empires, which was at times dull, and the \"narratives\" we searched for were often fairly obvious and somewhat repetitive. It was still interesting, but different than my expectation.",
                "I developed new historical knowledge as well as an in-depth understanding of the impact that empires and their strategies/practices have had on shaping many aspects of the world today.  While I was familiar with some of the topics we covered from high school history courses, material was presented in a new way and I felt that I learned something new each class meeting.  \r\n\r\nI also think I developed my discussion and synthesis skills in this class.  The content we covered has definitely impacted my worldview -- there are imperialistic structures present at all levels of society.",
                "I learned a lot about the ways in which imperial powers have generated false narratives in an attempt to justify colonization, especially through the themes of \"civilizing missions,\" commercialization of empire, and paternalism. The most interesting insights that I developed by taking this course were from the counter-narrative literature we read, especially A Small Place by Jamaica Kincaid. The novels were absolutely incredible, and the discussions about them were always extremely enlightening.",
                "I developed public speaking skills, critical thinking skills, and the ability to better participate in discussions. The multiple public speaking opportunities in this class allowed me to be more confident and be able to share my knowledge with my peers. I also think that the discussion form of the class allowed me to sharpen my critical thinking skills ad to be a more active member in discussions.",
                "I developed skills in careful reading and analyzation. I learned that there are always more perspectives to understand than what is immediately presented. I gained better insight into understanding the significance of the viewpoint I learned history from.",
                "In this class, I learned how to identify and deconstruct imperialistic narratives in a multitude of forms (i.e. historical documents, movies, advertisements, videos). I learned how to apply a critical lens to the stories that have been created about the past and build my own response to such stories through analysis of both primary and secondary sources.",
                "I learned a lot about the narratives empires built about their colonies. By the mid of the course, you get to a point when you start recognizing interesting patterns that appear very frequently in those narratives.",
                "I gained knowledge of narratives and ideas commonly used in empires to maintain existing social structures. I also learned about how these ideas impact the people in these imperial contexts and how we can combat these notions in the modern day. This class was important in opening my eyes to histories of empires and commonalities between imperial structures.",
                "I really enjoyed the broadness in this class through the use of different source materials as well a visiting a wide variety of different place since I thought it added an interesting aspect to the glass.\r\n\r\nIt also helped develop my critical thinking ability and taking a more thorough look at the context and deeper cultural implications of parts of history. \r\n\r\nThis class has followed me daily in the way that I think about things and how certain narratives can still be seen today.",
                "I was able to understand and see common themes throughout history that I was not as well aware of prior to taking this course.",

            "comments": [
                "The readings were really fascinating, and Prof. Hallinan was really sweet and made the classroom a stimulating environment for learning. The only weaknesses might be that there was occasionally a narrowness to the class discussions, especially if the narrative we covered had certain politically-correct preconceived notions around them.",
                "Strengths: this course provides really interesting insights that I had not spent time examining before.  The workload was manageable, but appropriately challenging.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: we jumped all over the place in our studies of particular moments in history, so it was difficult to gain an in-depth understanding of a particular period (except for the topic we chose for the final project).  This was helpful in learning a broad range of information, but this class is not an in-depth study of a particular period of history.",
                "The main strength of the course is the professor. Professor Hallinan is the best professor/teacher I have encountered in my life, and if you are lucky enough to be in her class, you will understand why right away! She is kind, compassionate, and understanding. Beyond the professor, some other strengths of the class are the structure of the semester and the material. The semester is centered around discussions and a final project, broken up into many parts. It never felt like there was an overwhelming amount of work because everything was paced out so well and extensions were granted if you were swamped in work from other classes. The course content is also super important and interesting. The mix of academic articles, novels, podcasts, and videos ensured the classes were never monotonous.",
                "I think the professor was great at teaching and very accommodating. I really felt like she valued what her students thought and the input they gave. Weaknesses may be that the discussions can become a little bit repetitive. It may be helpful to switch up the class format every once in a while.",
                "The strengths of this course include how it was organized, the level of feedback from the instructor, and the amount of instructor-student communication. The weaknesses of this course include its fast pace.",
                "There were many strengths to this class: the classroom always felt inclusive and welcoming, discussions were lively, and the course content itself was very interesting. One weakness was that it often felt as if we were covering more historical content than time allowed, so it was difficult to strike a balance between breadth and depth. However, Professor Hallinan truly did her best to create this balance and is actively modifying the syllabus to address this issue.",
                "Class discussions were very interesting and the professor was super caring and supportive. One thing I would change, however, is to cap the class to 12-15 people.",
                "The course is strong in showing commonalities between imperial structures through time. While the analysis of each empire in time is not incredibly deep, it does not need to be for the purposes of the course. The class is geared toward highlighting long histories of oppression and discrimination and how these realities feed the modern day. It does a wonderful job at achieving this goal. Readings are interesting and manageable and class discussions are integral to the class experience. A definite strength of the class is that its structure requires students to be engaged with the material and generative with their ideas. Professor Hallinan is also incredibly understanding with how she runs the class, acknowledging that students deserve kindness and respect in her interactions and class structure. I cannot think of any weaknesses in the class.",
                "As mentioned \r\n- good variety of source\r\n- really interesting use of Yale facilities with art galleries and the beinicke\r\n\r\nBut also the way it lead into discussions and throughout the semester focused on helping the class get deeper into the discussion. \r\n\r\nThis is a course which I would heavily recommend especially in its position as a first year seminar, so I actually have a hard time finding weaknesses in this course. The way the final project was done was also a really enjoyable process for me personally since the gradual deadlines helped create this longer and deeper development of my project and engage in discussion with people on my topic to give different perspectives.",
                "This class was very engaging, but in the second half of the course, it began to be slightly too repetitive. The content was still very engaging, and the class discussions were enjoyable, but it felt like we were having the same discussion sometimes.",
                "I think that the title of the course is a little misleading---we didn't really dismantle narratives of empire so much as talk about them and why they're bad. I would have preferred a wider diversity of resources that we learned in class."

                "Yes. This class is pretty chill, not much writing, and a normal amount of reading. Plus, I left the class having learned a good chunk about how imperialistic narratives are constructed, explicitly and implicitly, and how we can dismantle them. It's a really good class for a first semester at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course if they have a interest in history. It is important to note that I expected something different than what the class was, and it's important to understand fully what this course will entail. My expectation was that we would look critically at empires, especially those in more modern times, to dismantle notions we had in our own mind about them, but instead the course looked at older examples of narrative, with less emphasis on critical analysis of narratives than simply identification of narratives. There was still brilliant and interesting classroom discussion, and Professor Hallinan brought in a variety of resources for study that kept our studies interesting. The class was fine, but maybe not as illuminating as I was hoping.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student.  I learned many new things and this course helped change my worldview.  The workload was manageable and appropriately challenging.  This course provided a valuable, new perspective on the history that many students typically learn in high school.",
                "I cannot recommend this course enough. I adored this class and looked forward to it every Monday and Wednesday. Professor Hallinan is absolutely incredible, and the course material is extremely interesting. The workload is much less than any other class at Yale, and yet, it is still an intellectually engaging and rewarding academic experience. If you are even remotely interested in the course description, I suggest taking it. Professor Hallinan is super understanding and provides extensions if you are struggling. All of the assignments are split up throughout the semester so it isn't a huge burden to work on the final project (even if you end up leaving some assignments to the last minute). The class is super interactive, with many ways to demonstrate participation. Overall, if you want a class with interesting readings, a low workload, generous grading, and an incredible professor: take this course!!",
                "Yes, I really lie the professor and I think that I learned valuable information that I would not have learned anywhere else. This is a great class for first years because it isn't too challenging but is still very enriching.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. Professor Hallinan was an excellent instructor and her class has truly changed the way at which I look at history. This was an education-defining course, and the skills and knowledge I gained from it are invaluable.",
                "I would undoubtedly recommend this course to another student.Professor Hallinan makes the class incredibly accessible so students of all interests and backgrounds can succeed. The delivery of the course content and the grading structure ensure that students can focus on developing their analytical skill s without feeling any pressure. This course teaches you to think critically about the media you consume and the historical narratives that have become popularized throughout history. I think all students can benefit from the skills you acquire in this class.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are looking for a super interesting class with a relatively lower workload. The only heavy task that we had was to write a final paper 6-8 pages long.",
                "Absolutely. This is a great course for building an understanding of empires in history and the narratives that become defining of imperial structures. For anyone interested in the study of these things, this is a great course.",
                "Really great variety in class with a manageable workload. I also really enjoyed the professor and her way of leading this seminar. \r\n\r\nThis is also an extremely relevant topic, one I would argue that every person needs to learn about a some point in their life. \r\n\r\nThere is also a great freedom for the final project which is provides a good opportunity to dive into a topic of your choice.",
                "Definitely. This course provides great insight/analysis of various narratives constructed and upheld by different empires throughout history. But what I personally enjoyed the most about this course was the grand availability of opportunities to explore topics of personal interest beyond the syllabus in the seminar discussion sessions and especially through the final project. You are given the analytical tools necessary to dissect the topics/material in the syllabus for each class session and then encouraged to apply those same critical thinking skills outside the classroom. It was because of this unique class structure that the learning experience in this course as a whole was very productive and genuinely helpful to truly understand the meaning of empire and its effects.",
                "Yes, I enjoyed this class a lot, and I think it is a great class to take for an stimulating and comfortable environment."
