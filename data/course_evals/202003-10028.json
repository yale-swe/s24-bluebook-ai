            "comments": [
                "Perfect intro course for non majors",
                "Loved this course all around, don't have many suggestions on how to improve it.",
                "The strengths of this course were many. This class is remarkably successful in making very advanced material accessible to non-STEM students. As a humanities major, I never thought that I could become well-versed in things like accretion disk theory, time dilation, and supermassive black holes. While I'm still far from an expert, I know that I now have a basic understanding of these really marvelous concepts that have animated scientific inquiry over the past few generations. The format of the course was well-designed and the asynchronous videos were very helpful for review. The \"course review\" videos with concept maps before every test were especially helpful! I also appreciated the opportunity to meet for problem-solving sessions every week. \r\n\r\nBy way of suggestion, I would only note that the \"synchronous Q&A\" sessions could sometimes stray from the focus of the course and that the content of these sessions could be a little scattered at times.",
                "The course provided a fast-paced, engaging overview of relativity. I genuinely enjoyed watching the prerecorded lectures as well as attending the synchronous Q&A sessions. Professor Bailyn is so knowledgeable and passionate about the subject matter that it makes learning often-challenging concepts enjoyable. \r\n\r\nI do see how a non-STEM student would be over their head with the level of math that is used. Professor Bailyn often assumed that students knew how to perform the calculations he presented without stopping to work through problems step-by-step. Also, the grading of the course throughout the semester was frustrating. It was never clear how the problem sets would be graded, and the TA's took points off for concepts (ex. significant digits) we had never discussed in class. Also, the exam questions were incredibly complicated and presented in such a short amount of time that doing well was incredibly challenging, no matter how hard you studied or understood the material.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bailyn was incredibly understanding and accommodating to people's situations during the pandemic. Weaknesses: I never understood the purpose of having the grading scale structured as it was, and the rubric for each question was so pedantic that if one wasn't incredibly rigorous with every answer, listing everything they know, it is likely that they would've gotten points off and the comment would be \"could have also mentioned___________.\"",
                "the course was interesting, and the professor is definitely the biggest strength. he is funny, brilliant, and very approachable. yet the course was not easy for a non-science students.",
                "I think the greatest strength of this class is Professor Bailyn. He is very engaging, loves what he does and teaches in a very clear and concise manner. I personally like having a textbook to be able to look things up and go back to when things are unclear but there is not one for this class and because the class isn't for astronomy majors or an introductory class but it's own thing entirely, it is hard to look up topics without getting way more information and detail than is needed for the class.",
                "This course covers a wide range of very complex ideas (such as time dilation or the physics of black holes) without making it too complex or too difficult to understand. Professor Bailyn put a lot of effort into making the videos and meeting with students after each exam. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness of the course is that problem set questions are sometimes a bit vague. That being said, they do not count for much in terms of grading, so it is not a big problem.",
                "Strengths: I thought the exams were fair, and the problem sets helped me prepare for the exams. I loved the format in which the class was taught. Overall, I thought the class was interesting, & there was a natural progression to the course material. \r\nWeakness: It took a while to find out how I was doing in the class because grades for problem sets took a while to be released.",
                "Good \/nice professor, relatively easy material, generous grading and interesting concepts. To improve, I would had prefer not to have a quiz every lecture.",
                "very interesting class!",
                "The strengths are Professor Bailyn who truly cares for the students and wants to make sure everyone is understanding the material and no one is confused, and also having to watch the recorded videos in preparation for the live lectures because you can be sure that you understand the base material before the live lecture",
                "I felt that I had some difficulty completing the assignments and understanding the material through an online format, but this was not the fault of the course. I think in general more clarity about what we need to know for exams and problem sets would be helpful since there was a ton of content and I never knew what to study or what I needed to memorize. It was a bit overwhelming.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bailyn's enthusiasm and love for the material is a big strength. He seemed pretty passionate about what he was teaching and tried his best to not forget that we are not experts like him. So very often he would explain things in ways we could understand them or admit that maybe he previously assumed too much of us or didn't explain well enough. The hybrid of recorded videos and live lecture was a bug plus for me because most of the content is covered in the recorded portion, which would allow me to take my mine with the material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is an \"extra credit\" that is build into the grading system, however, it does not function as extra credit at all. The way he has it set up, it just makes either the tests or the final worth more of your grade and it ends up hurting you more than it can help you. There were also sometimes some inconsistencies with what it seemed was expected of us on the tests. I do appreciate that Prof. Bailyn would own up and realize that some questions may have been unfair given what we covered and know.",
                "It took a long time to get our grades back and it was difficult to know where you stood in the course due to the grading scheme.",
                "I felt like a strong point of this course was the support available from the TAs and the course instructor. I thought that problem solving sessions were particularly useful. Moreover, the individual conversations following each exam were an incredible addition to the course. I felt like these helped me gauge my strengths\/weaknesses better and get to know the professor better. However, I felt like it would have been helpful for students to schedule 1:1 office hour appointments if they felt like they needed the help. While I know this option may have been available for students who pro-actively reached out, I feel like if a Calendly or other easily-accessible scheduling sources were provided to students, more students would have taken advantage of an opportunity to seek out extra help. In addition, I felt like another aspect of the course that could have been improved was the clarity of what we would be responsible for on the Final Exam. I felt like most students felt like the material that was emphasized in the daily quizzes and problem sets didn't always match up with the exam content.",
                "I think that more individual conversations are always good. Strength wise, the material is already great.",
                "I enjoyed the asynchronous and synchronous sessions; everything was paced very well. I think the material at the end felt a little disorienting and a lot at once.",
                "Strengths: Phenomenal professor and TF's. Professor Bailyn made concepts easy to understand by having a structured plan for each lecture as well as engaging his students with a low-stakes quizzes at the end of each lecture. The TF's were very helpful with problem sets and solidifying any concepts that we learned in lecture. The problem sets and exams were fair and not overwhelmingly challenging. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None, really.",
                "I think a great strength of this course is the combination of synchronous and asynchronous components. The synchronicity of the class kept me on track, while the asynchronicity allowed me to watch lectures flexibly to prepare myself for the synchronous component.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting content and well-paced lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Non-existent feedback. I only got my grade back for one PSET the entire semester, meaning that I never knew if I did anything wrong or never had any idea how to improve. There is a quiz after each recorded lecture in which you have to ask a question about the content, but out of all the questions I submitted throughout the semester only a couple actually received a reply from Prof. Bailyn. Prof. Bailyn is also not great at answering emails, and unfortunately neither were the TAs, so you're kind of on your own in this class, which is less than ideal.",
                "Strengths: The material is really interesting, the course is split into 3 sections, which makes it easier to see how everything relates at the end. The lecture videos are short and to the point, making it easy to go back and watch them while studying. \r\nweakness: The answer keys to homework assignments could be more thorough to aid with studying (and because points were sometimes taken off for leaving out things not asked for in the question) , slides were not posted before class which can make note-taking hard. It would be nice if the TF's were told a little bit about what the test questions would be like since they run the review sessions.",
                "Very few weaknesses. Strengths are Prof. Bailyn's organization \/ clarity, and the thought-provoking psets. Lectures are amazing for how short they are.",
                "Great professor, a. bit unorganized course with regards to feedback however.",
                "The class was organized well, the review sessions and individual conversations were very nice for more personal engagement with the instructors."

                "I thought that the group quizzes every meeting were not always necessary or the best way of utilizing that time. Maybe using that time for more lecture or for a going through a practice problem as a class would have been helpful.",
                "Recorded lectures worked very well. I appreciated that the live sessions were shorter, taking into account the time we spent watching the recorded lectures.",
                "n\/a",
                "I thought that this class was done very well over Zoom. The individual conversations and the mix of live and recorded lectures made the class run really smoothly",
                "The course had pre-recorded lectures, making it easier for students to fit them into their schedules. There were synchronous sessions with mandatory group work (approximately 5-10min per lecture) that were sometimes useful and sometimes not, though this is more a problem of students choosing not to participate than of the course itself.",
                "I enjoyed the pre-recorded lectures paired with the live shorter sessions for questions. Professor Bailyn's pre-recorded videos were usually around 20-30 minutes, with the live session MWF being about 25 minutes, so overall it followed the 50 minutes of class time MWF designated on the course description.",
                "Flowed well, as lectures were divided into synchronous and asynchronous material.",
                "live sessions were interactive",
                "Uploading the short recorded videos that are intended to be watched before their accompanying live lectures worked well because you can pause or rewind and make sure that you understand the material beforehand and can post questions or bring them to lecture.",
                "The recorded lectures were nice and the late start 30 minute live virtual lectures were also helpful, considering time zone. I know question submission and quizzes was meant to check engagement with lectures but I don't think they helped me engage or learn.",
                "I think this class's hybrid system of prerecorded lectures and live Q&A sessions was probably the best system I had out of all my classes. I would probably only say that it would be good if the prerecorded videos were available more ahead of time than they sometimes were.",
                "I liked the length of the asynchronous lectures, however, the timing of the review sessions wasn't great and the number of points dedicated to small things (asking questions, in class quizzes) seemed excessive.",
                "I felt like some of the course lecture videos could have been slightly more concise. The total class time expected for each MWF lecture was around 50 minutes. Professor Bailyn structured this class so that we spent 30 minutes in live lecture, and around 20 minutes in asynchronous lecture. However, there were many times when the asynchronous portion took up around 30-35 minutes, so it would have been helpful if some of these lectures were a bit more concise. Moreover, as I said earlier, it would have been helpful to have had an easily-accessible way to schedule 1:1 office hours with the professor and\/or TAs of the course, rather than solely having group problem\/review sessions available.",
                "The mix of synchronous and asynchronous lectures worked well, and I think having breakout groups was important in helping students learn from each other; I would say that perhaps only 2 breakout groups a week would be better as it got to be a lot and leave less time for the actual synchronous lectures. The virtual review sessions and problem sessions were helpful.",
                "It is what it is. This course is fine for pandemic education, but eventually I'm sure an actual class would be better.",
                "The lecture style worked.",
                "The combination of asynchronous lecture videos and live Q&A's was a very effective way to learn given the circumstances.",
                "Again, I think a great strength of this course is the combination of synchronous and asynchronous components. The synchronicity of the class kept me on track, while the asynchronicity allowed me to watch lectures flexibly to prepare myself for the synchronous component.\r\n\r\nAnother component is that there was a quiz at the end of the synchronous component, which incentivized me to actually process the asynchronous lecture before going to the synchronous lecture.",
                "The idea of double lecture (live and async) isn't really the best approach to keep students engaged during a pandemic.",
                "Splitting the lectures into half synchronous and half asynchronous made it easier to stay focused in class and retain information. It would have been useful if the asynchronous videos were posted earlier in the day because we had to submit questions for credit by 10pm every day a video was posted (the day before the scheduled lecture). I did appreciate the individual conversations because they allowed us to meet prof. Bailyn and the teaching staff outside of class time, but I didn't like that our performance in them (when asked about the material on previous tests) counted for a grade.",
                "split lecture was amazing",
                "The professor was very sure to check in with everyone on their well-being and how the structure of the class worked specifically for them. He was also considerate of time zones and different circumstances of students being at home."

                "Yes, Perfect intro course for non majors",
                "Yes, loved this course so much, would recommend to any non astro or physics major looking for a science credit.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student! You will be challenged and engaged, without being overwhelmed. The material is absolutely fascinating and Professor Bailyn approaches every topic with infectious enthusiasm. The grading scheme is also very generous and allows for ample opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of the material in various ways. It's a great way to earn a science credit, or learn more about some of the more mind-bending topics in astrophysics!",
                "The concepts taught in the course are far more engaging than those of any science 'guts' you will find. Be warned, however, that this not a 'gut' in the slightest sense. The material is difficult, the grading is often harsh, and the exams are difficult. In my opinion, though, being able to understand that time is not absolute, for example, far outweighed the extra challenges.",
                "I would recommend this class to people looking for a science credit that covers material that isn't typically taught in high school, but isn't unreasonably difficult.",
                "yes. the course is designed for non-science majors. but even if you are not too \"sciency\" you will really enjoy interacting with the concepts, and fanciful ideas such as wormholes and \"time stops.\"",
                "I would definitely recommend this to other students who enjoy science but are not a stem major. It's definitely a little bit of a challenge at times but super fun.",
                "Absolutely. If you are interested in the absolute extremes of physics but do not want to study the complex math behind it, this is the perfect course. Theories of relativity and black holes are fascinating and Professor Bailyn is clearly passionate about his field. Just watch out - the course does not count for Astro and Physics majors.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in General Relativity, as well as an introduction to theoretical & observational astronomy.",
                "Yes - interesting and good Sc credit.",
                "yes! a fun science credit",
                "Yes, I would recommend the course. The material can be challenging at times and take some time to fully understand, but it is all pretty interesting, especially if you are interested in space, black holes, etc.",
                "I would recommend it to students who genuinely want to learn about the subject and is willing to put in a bit of time, especially if you're non-STEM.",
                "Yes! It was a very good introduction to all of those concepts described on the course description. I would say we go into them a bit more in debt than some Netflix documentary would, so its not just a survey course. The high school math makes the class fair and keeps it in reach for those who may not be so math inclined. I had some issues with the grading at times, but in the end I will probably finish with an A-, at least. I will say, be prepared to study for the tests as they are not at all easy.",
                "Yes, but students should know that this isn't a \"gut science\" course. You have to put effort into your problem sets and studying for exams to do well.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in the topic, and you don't mind having to do quite a few calculations. I actually found the math and physics involved to be fairly complex, and it's a little more than just plugging into formulas, but the material is very interesting and the workload is fine.",
                "Yes I would. The math is not terribly difficult and the concepts are interesting.",
                "It's not a very easy class, but you learn a lot and get a lot out of it. Definitely take it if you have any interest in relativity or astrophysics, but not so much if you're just looking for a science credit or easy class.",
                "Absolutely. Professor is amazing and clearly has an interest in teaching students the basics of relativity and black holes. I did not have a strong background in math\/physics, yet I was able to understand all concepts of the course. This class is engaging, challenging, and rewarding.",
                "I would highly recommend this course for anyone interested in understanding the wacky science of space (such as the science seen in Interstellar) and able to commit time to the course.",
                "If you're ok with the idea of all your work being sent into a virtual black hole the entire semester (you will get pretty much no feedback for anything and your questions and emails will go into the void), then sure. Otherwise, I'd look elsewhere for that Sc credit.",
                "Yes I would, it's really interesting to learn about what relativity is, the history behind it, some of the science behind science fiction, and the cases where Newtonian physics fails. it might be hard to wrap your mind around relativity at first, but there is ample support and  it will get better throughout the course!",
                "Yes! Especially for humanities students who are interested in the math behind relativityor for STEM majors who want a class in which they can think about the intellectual progression \/ history of astrophysics.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I found that the material was interesting and well taught, particularly as each new subject was put in context with the rest of the course.",
                "yes! it was fascinating",
                "Absolutely for a science credit. I'm a social sciences major and I really hate biology so I liked this as not a gut, but certainly something where the grading and expectations were clear and the information was presented in a way I understood. I felt behind in the class at times, but thanks to the diligence of Professor Bailyn and the TFs I was able to catch up and they were very helpful."
