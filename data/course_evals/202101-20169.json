I know that's the nature of the class, but especially with \"Don Quixote,\" I feel like we flew through the text in a bit of a whirlwind.",
                "This course allows you to read some truly incredible works of literature and place them in dialogue with each other. The people who take this course are genuinely interested in literature, so class discussions were always insightful and generative.Since the amount of reading we had to get through in the semester was fairly high, I sometimes felt as if we rushed through certain parts of the books; Ulysses, in particular, was difficult to read quickly and still understand. At the same time, I genuinely loved all the books we read, and I wouldn't suggest removing any of them in order to make more time to discuss the others.",
                "Fantastic course. Professor Markovits is great, and the readings are really interesting. They're pretty heavy too, but that's not really a weakness of the coursetake it if you have time to read a lot, and it will be very fulfilling.",
                "Great selection of books.",
                "One strength is the texts, which are definitely challenging but all incredible in their own different ways. The other is Prof. Markovits, who teaches the class with incredible rigor, energy, and generosity. There are no real weaknesses as long as you are prepared to do the reading."

However, it is a lot of work. And the professor isn't an easy grader(although not extremely harsh). I also found the exam a little difficult and this is one of the only english classes that still has an exam. I was just short on time when writing an in-class essay. Otherwise, though I'm just proud of getting through this class. I just love these books and the discussions we had. Very much worth it.",

It'll allow you to read some incredible works of literature that you were probably planning to read anyways but with the scaffolding of a formal course. I don't think I would have gotten as much out of the some of the textsparticularly Ulyssesif I hadn't had class discussions to supplement my initial understanding of the readings. The reading load is fairly heavy, so don't take this course if you're just looking for an easy credit.",

Prof. Markovits is simply the best English teacher I have ever had. \r\n\r\nShe is thoughtful, precise, and generous in her curriculum, her (virtual) classroom, and her feedback. She both justifies and challenges the existence of a course on European Epic. She grounds our conversations with emotional and thematic stakes that feel powerful and urgent. She is brimming with enthusiasm for our discussions and our contributions. Somehow she can keep us lingering on a single moment in a five hundred page novel for half of a class, and yet when it's time to move onto the next one we feel like we've done the whole text justice.\r\n\r\nI am so grateful for the opportunity to read alongside her. If the books on syllabus appeal to you, don't think twice  take this class."
