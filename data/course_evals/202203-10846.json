Our discussions with the rest of the class about how each translation went and what choices we made were quite insightful. The readings paired really well with each week's assignment. The one thing I wish had been done differently is that we spent most of class going over the theoretical reading for the weekI would have preferred spending more time workshopping/peer editing in class.",
