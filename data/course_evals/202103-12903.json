                "In Skepticism with Professor Della Rocca, I learned about several different kinds of skepticism throughout the history of philosophy. For example, we read ancient authors, Chinese and Buddhist writers, as well as Renaissance and Early Modern skeptics. I really liked the readings and how MDR would break down each type for us as a class and draw connections between them. I think I definitely learned more about skepticism and find myself making skeptical arguments in conversation sometimes (it is a fun party topic in my opinion -- like, how do I know I'm not dreaming right now? How do I know my senses tell me the truth about things?). Also, there are two papers, so I did improve my philosophy writing, especially because we had to write a longer piece.."

                "It is a good overview of skepticism throughout history. I like how the course covered different philosophers such as Zhuangzi, Nagarjuna and Sextus rather than just covering traditional western philosophers. Della Rocca created a great environment for discussion and explains difficult concepts very eloquently.",
                "This course was a lot of fun! We met once weekly for about two hours and the discussions were always very interesting. The course was made up of undergraduates (mostly junior and senior philosophy majors), as well as some divinity students and philosophy PhD students, and for me (an undergraduate) I found it valuable to hear from the graduate students as they were all very smart and insightful. Also, MDR is a wonderful teacher and human being: very understanding and very enjoyable to learn under. He has a knack for explaining complex arguments in simple terms, and gives very useful feedback on papers. He actually received a Sterling professorship as he was teaching this course which was very cool. I enjoyed writing my final paper and I thought the course was overall very strong.."

I feel like I learned a lot, and many of the discussions and readings will stay with me after this semester. Professor Della Rocca is absolutely wonderful and I recommend everyone interested in philosophy to take a course with him at some point. My favorite authors we read were Sextus and Descartes, and I also enjoyed the small taste of Chinese philosophy we receive with guest Prof. Hunter. It was nice to have graduate students present on topics they were particularly knowledgeable about, and I liked having the graduate students in class because I learned a lot from hearing the ways they were thinking about the texts. This class was definitely challenging for me and probably the most difficult course I've taken so far in my major, but it was absolutely worth it.."
