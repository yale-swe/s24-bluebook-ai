After taking this course, I feel that I have a thorough understanding of Simone Weil's heterodox philosophy and how much of her later Christian thought was latent within her earlier political writings. More than others, this course forced me to read long philosophical essays for argument rather than other types of reading.",
                "I gained a valuable, in-depth understanding of the life and work of Simone Weil, as well as some thinkers critical of her through the years. Just the chance to spend a whole semester with such a brilliant thinker felt like a privilege and a pleasure. In the process, I learned much about topics as diverse as Marxism, 20th-century European history, history/philosophy of science, colonialism, Christian metaphysics, and theology. As in any good seminar, I also became a better reader, writer, and thinker.",
                "Critical reading of a singular figure, appraising a writer by their biography and their texts, intellectual history of 1930s and 1940s, tracing philosophical and intellectual arcs within a writer's oeuvre."

                "Yes, this was an incredible course that I felt lucky to take. Professor Ellermann is an expert facilitator of class discussions, and the readings were fascinating. It was a unique opportunity to read a lesser known philosopher in depth.",
                "It impacted my thinking outside the classroom in a way that all great courses should. The subject is a bit strange though, but this you probably already know.",
                "I would recommend this course to any humanities student who is interested in Marxist thought, Christian thought, 20th-century continental philosophy, 1930s and 40s Europe, and the Western canon. Simone Weil was a prolific writer who consumed almost all of Western (and non-Western) thought and then made it her own.",
                "Absolutely. This is a quintessential Humanities course invaluable to anyone interested in the topics Weil's work covers.",
                "Yes if you're at all interested in Christian mysticism, Marxist criticism before WWII/philosophy of labor, the relationship between one's life and one's writings. A really fun and insightful intellectual and spiritual journey."
