                "This class was very interesting. The first half, we learned a lot about immunology and some of the applications; everything up to the first exam was hard knowledge. But the second half was somewhat all over the place. One had to be extremely attentive because missing anything would derail your understanding and cause you to get completely lost. However, if you were able to follow along with the professors chaotic teaching style, this class was a gem. For the first time at Yale, I was able to take a science class that not just threw a bunch of information at me. Here, we learned to think about the information and apply it in very creative ways, such as with the final project. This class changed my way of thinking about immunology and engineering and helped me appreciate what it means to be interdisciplinary.",
                "An in-depth review of the immune system and all the molecules and factors that play a role. With the crossover with engineering, biomaterials and technologies used in the field of immunology was introduced.",
                "you learn a lot about the immune system, different drug delivery systems, and immunotherapies",
                "I love immunology, but had never taken an engineering class before, so thinking about the immune system from an engineering perspective was all new.",
                "How the immune system is developed and works in the body. The biomaterials used to assist the immune response and immune cell interaction.",
                "You learn about the adaptive immune system and how it works, then applying that knowledge going forward, exploring vaccines and therapies in the field.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. I learned a lot about drug delivery models and ways that drugs are developed. I also learned about the factors required for developing a effective vaccine."

            "comments": [
                "More structured lesson plans with more sequentially organized presentation slides would be helpful.",
                "Strengths include the innovative approach and final project. The only major weakness is Professor Fannys tendency to go on long tangents about certain topics, leading to a non-uniform focus on immunological principles that many students need to understand but likely havent been exposed to.",
                "The strength of this course is the vast knowledge of the professor and his teaching style. He doesn't get caught up in the minute details but instead is fantastic at making us understand difficult topics and weaving them into our existing knowledge. This incorporates them into our way of thinking such that many of the thought processes become second nature, even if we begin to forget some of the facts. \r\n\r\nThe weakness of this class was its disorganization. And this is someone we all knew going in but it was still really annoying to never have any of the materials available when needed. The slides used in class would be uploaded weeks after they were used, with edits making them look unrecognizable at times from when presented in lecture. I would sometimes want to do readings ahead of class to better understand the material only to find out that he hadn't uploaded them, and would only do so several days later. Another thing that really annoyed me was the lack of punctuality. The amount of times he was late to class was simply inexcusable. And there were times were he would be even more late than usual and send a canvas notification 10 minutes after the start of class to say he would be a bit late. \r\n\r\nIf the professor could be a bit more punctual and more responsible about uploading slides and readings, I would have no complaints and would have absolutely enjoyed the class. Taking this into account though, I can say I enjoyed the class a lot and learned a ton, but was annoyed at times.",
                "The content and the structure of the class was consistent. Assignments were spaced out evenly towards the first half, then a slight lull leading into the final project. I wish the class had a clearer direction in the beginning. It seemed like the agenda was set during the class and we did not follow the syllabus. Reading could be enforced more, motivation to continue doing the readings decreased rapidly since the planned topics for the week were not reliable.",
                "strength: good fifth class, interesting material\r\nweaknesses: prof is super kind but very disorganized, grading took a while to get grades back, he came to class late often, wouldn't post lecture slides for weeks, \r\n\r\n\r\nstill a great class and can be improved with better organization",
                "Professor Fahmy is incredibly passionate about the topic and encourages students' participation and critical thinking. You learn a ton. At times the course was a bit disorganized, but Professor Fahmy is very understanding about deadlines. He also makes a ton of time to meet with his students.",
                "The lectures were not cohesive, they were presented in a format that did not look put together. The lectures were not uploaded ahead of class despite students asking for it. The questions on the homework required clarification. \r\n\r\nLots of information on the immune system, appropriate level of depth.",
                "The lectures are not structured super clearly, we often jumped around the powerpoint and topics. But the professor is very knowledgable of the subject matter and the development of the field. The way the information is presented was interesting and engaging, as he walks through the original experiments used to discover something in the field and where the field is now. \r\n\r\nA weakness is the wording of the questions in assignments, some were confusing or disorganized.",
                "I think this course was very engaging. The material was interesting and the exams were very reasonable as they are open-note and open book. The office hours were very helpful for completing homework and for better understanding material. The one weakness I would say about this class is that it is a bit disorganized."

                "Not really. If you want to learn about immunology, I would recommend MCDB 430 (Biology of the Immune System) over this course. This course focuses more on laboratory applications and methods, but the organization of the class is quite disorganized, so it's not very conducive to learning.",
                "I would recommend this course if you want to use immunology to help guide research and/or entrepreneurial ideas. The workload isnt too bad, but you mustnt be lulled into a false sense of security.",
                "If you are willing to put up with many minor inconveniences and have the patience to deal with the professor, I would absolutely do so. This class was one of the first to teach me what it means to be an engineer and how to go about thinking about problems. The class was extremely rewarding and I loved learning to think like an actual engineer and how to use that knowledge to approach real world problems. So yes but be ready to embrace the disorganization, it'll help you enjoy the class more.",
                "Yes! it was an interesting opportunity to dive deeper into the field of immunoengineering. The final project allowed us to explore something very specific and become experts at it.",
                "Absolutely recommend.  Tarek Fahmy is a really great teacher.  He thrives on student engagement instead of getting distracted or annoyed by it.  He is extremely fair in assignment difficulty, even if exams can be on the harder side. Anyone in BME should take this as an elective.",
