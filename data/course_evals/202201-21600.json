                "Strengths: course material was well-structured; the \"flipped classroom\" model worked well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: pace of the course was incredibly fast, and at times, didn't really have time to absorb the material before having to jump into new content; exams were on the more difficult side, and the grading scheme of no curve on exams made it difficult.",
                "It definetely was challenging to be expected to watch an hour worth of lecture videos before each class in addition to homework. It was also very frustrating when that same material is what would be taught in class making the pre-lecture videos essentially pointless but still mandatory. I like the amount of collaborative practice problems we did in class, and it was nice to have small sections. I think the psets were just the right level of challenging.",
                "There were resources provided in this class, not as much as for Math 115, but there was a good network of peer tutors. Also, learning material from online videos before class, though difficult and long in the moment, helped to learn the material better than a professor would under a time crunch, which allowed for the preparation of specific questions. However, there was a lot of the material was difficult and extensive (students need to be prepared for extensive work on problem sets and review of class material on a regular basis).",
                "I think that a day of review before each exam would have been helpful to iron out any confusion in classes.",
                "The bureaucracy of this course is terrible. It felt like everyone was working against me instead of with me in a lot of regards, even though my individual instructor was fine. The math department needs to get with the times and try and help students, especially those who are a) not math majors and b) not people with strong math backgrounds.",
                "It was very interesting but way too fast",
                "The course has a lot of content and materials that help you review, though the sections themselves do not add much to the content that is already covered in the pre-recorded videos.",
                "weaknesses- instructors not that great. basically self taught\r\n\r\nstrengths- resources to teach ur self are good. highly recommend using peer tutors and ximera",
                "Strength: many resources! PSETS, the class Ximera site, and practice exams were all great ways to access practice questions to help prepare for exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 85% of your grade is made up of your 3 exam scores, which puts a disproportionate amount of pressure on those days as opposed to the homework assignments and pre-quizzes."

Preparing for the course beforehand will probably allow you to perform your best, as well as staying on top of everything each week during the semester. It can be a lot of work!",

I think that there was a huge disparity in performance just based on professors which is unfortunately something the students cannot control.",

                "If you need this course for your major or think you might be interested in math at Yale, then yes! If not, it may not be for you, since the material is almost entirely out-of-context calculus problems, rather than material that explores calculus applications in other fields. Additionally, I would advise anyone considering this course to think about their own calculus experience  this class is a lot of work, and while there are many helpful resources, the need to individually review foundational material might set you a bit behind."
