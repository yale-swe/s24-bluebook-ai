What you come out having learned at this class is an unexpectedly large amount, especially since it doesn't feel like a lot as you go through the class. Dr. Wolenski and Nardos are two gems, and this class wouldn't be the same without them both. I think if you're not too comfortable with research but want to be, or haven't done a lot of research at Yale, then it is so important for your to take this class that I know you will enjoy!",
