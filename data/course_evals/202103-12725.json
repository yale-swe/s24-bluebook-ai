                "I learned about the impacts of various technologies on society.",
                "I learnt a good amount about the history and modern applications of various technologies, both in the context of Yale (there is a good amount of emphasis on Yale's policies and buildings, such as the CEID, Kroon Hall, and Yale Central Power Plant) and in the context of wider society. Though the course say 'public policy' in the name, the emphasis of the course lies much more on the science and history behind it. However that should not be too surprising given this is a science credit.",
                "I learned to have a deeper appreciation of the intersections between the actual science of modern technologies and the policy questions they pose. This is particularly true of the energy section -- we kind of come to realize that a lot of the decision-making in areas of modern technology is misguided at best and dangerous at worst. But you need to have an understanding of the science to see why that's the case -- and by the end of the course, you walk away feeling like you CAN \"get\" the science.",

                "Strengths: Extremely manageable workload and extraordinarily helpful TF (Talia is amazing). Prober is very understanding about extenuating circumstances (injury, sickness, time conflicts, etc.). Weaknesses: Prober's lectures (i.e., everything except four or five guest lectures at the end of the semester) are unengaging to the point of soporific. The midterm covered questions and concepts that lecture only briefly touched on (if at all). Course grades are not shown on Canvas (only grades for the psets, not for the midterm or for the presentation), so it's impossible to know what your final grade will look like at any given point.",
                "The material was interesting and I learned about many new technologies that I was previously unaware of. One improvement could be for the lectures to be more interactive.",
                "I know this may be a weird complaint, but I sometimes felt the course was far too easy. The homeworks resembled that of a junior high school class (with over-specific grading to match), and you would have known a good portion of the content if you just read the news. The lack of emphasis on policy is annoying, and I am sure there could be more discussion about policy whilst still keeping this class a science credit. \r\n\r\nThat being said, Prober is an expert in his field - his insights and comments on various topics - like Yale's policies, microfabrication, etc - were very interesting and were definitely the highlight of the class. There were many external speakers and 'field trips' that really added to the class, most of which tied in very well with the topics discussed. \r\n\r\nAlso, just be aware that though this is a first-year seminar, this class is very much lecture based. This may be a strength to someone and a weakness to others, but to me, I felt it was very much a weakness.",
                "Strengths: Fascinating lecture material, ample out-of-class help resources, helpful homework, really fun end of term project on pretty much whatever you'd like, work is front-loaded (which makes the end of term much calmer)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Could have benefited from more student involvement -- as a seminar, there's really the capacity to get students very involved in the actual lecture, and I don't know if that was there this term. Would also have liked a deeper exploration of the policy implications for some units (the computers unit was a good example -- I liked the historical overview, but want to also know how it impacts our policy choices today. Obviously, there isn't too much time, so that might be hard to do)",
                "Strengths: info helps me understand news related to energy \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the lectures were too technical and I would have rather been given the bigger picture than learn about the minute details of the technology.",
                "Strengths: interesting course topics, gives a thorough and detailed explanation of each topic, interactive course materials and tool kits (a mini steam engine, solar cars, windmills, etc!!), an amazing teacher\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: presentation slides were sometimes hard to understand"

                "Not at all. If you have no other options for an easy science credit, by all means take this class (the homework, comprising three \"Google the answers\" psets and an end-of-semester presentation, is extremely manageable, especially if you make use of TF office hours), but prepare to be bored out of your mind until the two or three interesting guest lectures at the end of the semester. Also, don't be fooled by the \"first-year seminar\" listing; this class is a lecture course with a small class size. If you're looking for an enriching or transformative \"first-year seminar experience,\" look to a different class.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because I learned many new fascinating concepts.",
                "It's okay. Given how many options for first-year seminars there are, and given there are so many more engaging ones, I would struggle to recommend this against the backdrop of the many incredible first-year seminars Yale offers.",
                "I would -- it really opened my eyes on some of the topics we discussed (particularly related to energy policy). Do know that the class is a LOT more \"modern technology\" than \"public policy.\" After all, it's a science credit. And while this was initially frustrating to me as a person who has struggled in science classes before, I actually think it is a good thing if you can push through. The course material is really fascinating.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit -- and I can't stress enough how helpful this is -- the work was super front-loaded. That is really helpful, and made the end of the semester much less stressful. For the second half of the term, there's no final exam, no hand-ins, and instead a project that we get a LOT of time to work on. That is super helpful.",
                "Yes, good SC credit. The professor is very helpful and approachable.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It gives one a general, yet a thorough and detailed overview of the major technological advancements that changed our world and its implications for public policy and vice versa. You also have lots of room for exploration and the opportunity to focus on a technology that interests you, too. The teacher also brought interactive course materials and tool kits to class, which made it really fun and engaging! It definitely helped me understand and visualize the course content better."
