                "I gained a number of skills and insights that I have immediately found applicable in my other academia, my social life, and my preparation for future career steps. It's been an exceptional education in networks and a very good taste of IR.",
                "I learned structural and connection-level details of networks and how to plot them using RStudio. Further, I learned how the structure of international networks affect power dynamics and geopolitics.",
                "I learned fundamental skills for coding in R and some basic network theory in the context of international relations. Genuinely found the information super helpful and really gave me some surprising insight into the world of international relations through networks. Now I can go into other courses with this information, with the coding in R being particularly helpful.",
                "I learned how to tie analytical concepts from networks science to international politics, spanning everything from financial crises to terrorist organizations to humanitarian NGOs. This course is a wonderful way to unite data science, and alongside it the empirical mindset of many economics / political science students, with contemporary global issues. We all brought in our own outside knowledge and current events into discussions, which was allowed for by the small class size and very engaging professors. This was a fantastic course for anyone interested in geopolitics and/or how to statistically analyze current events.",
                "Although not explicitly marketed as such, I came away from the course with a great introduction to the fundamentals of IR theory and various arguments for different sides. And of course, I learned so much about social network analysis: its functions, advantages in analysis, and a great variety of its applications in different fields of study. \r\nLots of fun practical skills in coding networks in R, basic data analysis, and finding the best way to represent visual data."

            "comments": [
                "The course is very informative, well-paced, and comprehensive. However, if students do not have prior experience with RStudio or data analysis, the first couple weeks are a bit of a gut check. The instructors were flexible and understanding with those of us that were less coding-inclined, but a little more instruction on RStudio would have been helpful.",
                "I think more consistent assignments utilizing R Studio could be useful as a lot of the learning for the language had to happen outside of the course material. More workshops in class could be helpful as well on this subject. I also think smaller scale projects building up to the final project could be helpful in allowing students to develop the skills necessary for the cumulative final project.",
                "The strengths of this course were its extreme relevance to current world issues, both those on the syllabus and those happening in real time, and its integration of data science into contemporary politics. Its true and sole international focus was unique among the political science courses at Yale and almost mirrored the analytical nature of Global Affairs or Economics courses here. Both Professors were extremely focused on students' interests and melded the course to fit what we wanted to study and discuss. It was an extremely engaging seminar that was often the highlight of my week. The only weakness is the slight lack of coverage of R concepts prior to the two problem sets, which could easily be improved with an additional session on R specific to network analysis.",
                "Fascinating readings; network analysis is a great perspective to approach the world  I liked how the course made a point to illustrate how SNA was relevantly applied to every major current event during the semester; the material was very well explained by Professor Pratt and Professor Stuster. Loved when the seminar discussions got intense, I learned so much from the other students. But there were some slow weeks where it did feel like we were merely summarizing the readings."

                "I would definitely recommend this course, particularly if it one day satisfies a QR requirement given the data-management aspect of the course. It is invaluable information for any student who is considering a career in international relations, working for an NGO, etc.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, especially those interested in international relations and wanting to learn how different software can complement it.",
                "Absolutely. It was one of my favorite classes at Yale, both in terms of coursework and professors. The syllabus covered extremely broad topics ranging from terrorist attacks to the antipersonnel mines ban to financial crises to US-China conflict, but still allowed for deep discussion into each individual area. The range of assignments (2 psets, final project, midterm and final exam) were very spread out across the semester and greatly facilitated student learning. I really enjoyed my independent project, where you can study anything in international relations with a networks lens. My classmates ranged from Chinese predatory lending practices to ISIS recruiting to high-skill immigration, which made for a very interesting end of the semester and an opportunity to dive into anything you find interesting. I also loved the connection to data science, with the analytical lens that many political science / global classes at Yale lack. Overall, this was a tremendous course with a very low workload and very interesting professors / discussion.",
                "Totally! take it. Aside from the final project, it doesn't take up much time outside of class but gives you lots to think about during the 2hrs."
