An interesting part about this course was that it really encouraged us to explore Yale and discover aspects of its history.",

I learned about a huge variety of things in considerable depth- calligraphy, typography, bookmaking, ink making, and almost anything you could imagine about the printed word and the mediums it could be featured on. Though this year was much different from ordinary semesters where we would have met in person in the JE printing press room, Professor Rose recruited some of the most knowledgeable people in their respective fields for us to listen to and see some of their favorite works. Beyond this, Professor Rose himself curated wonderful powerpoints and could talk endlessly (in a good way!) about each piece and artist he chose to feature. I now see the world through a different lens, and am able to critically examine each item of printed ephemera, signs, or old books I come across. A lovely course that I would recommend in a heartbeat."

                "This course was amazing. Professor Rose is incredibly supportive and truly has a passion for this course. Even for someone who does not have a strong artistic background, I felt like I had enough support to create pieces that I could be proud of. In all of the projects, there was a lot of room for exploration, and you had a lot of choice over the direction of the overall product. I found that everyone puts a lot of effort into this class, not because the class requires an extraordinary level of craftsmanship but because they genuinely enjoyed the class. Despite all of this, I would say that holding the class over Zoom was not the most engaging experience.",
                "Strengths: variety of speakers and general enthusiasm\r\nImprove: virtual critiques were sometimes confusing or unclear, just because there was no way to signal through pointing at the piece or demonstrating how it could have been done better",
                "Weakness: Obviously this is an art course, but I think it still would have been interesting and relevant to discuss the importance of printing for human society in general e.g. its impact on science, politics, religion. Even just a lecture on this kind of material would be nice. Otherwise I thought the course was very well designed.",
                "Any small issue I might have had with this course was rooted in problems I experienced in every class this semester, and is really just a symptom of online learning. I have no real qualms to report- this was my favorite class this semester and I loved all of my other courses as well, so this means a lot! The strengths of this course are the breadth of projects we were assigned- I loved many of them and especially loved to see what my brilliant classmates came up with each time, and Professor Rose himself, who is truly just so sweet, very supportive, and really cared about every one of us. If anything, I might suggest that the lectures be broken up a bit to allow for more time for us to really ask questions. At times it was hard to get a word in because Professor Rose was so absorbed in his lecture! Overall though, this may very well be one of my favorite classes I'll ever take at Yale."

Despite not being the experience I was expecting, I had a lot of fun with this course. The virtual field trips were a bit underwhelming because of the virtual format. At times, it was very hard to stay focused for the entirety of a 2-hour zoom call.",

I also wish there was more practice in design and composition, since we were unable to print in person.",

Each week, this course was a welcome break from the intensity of my other courses. Professor Rose is an amazing professor, and you will get a lot out of this course.",
                "Yes. Despite not being able to print, it was very interesting to learn about the history of printing and typography and trying to adapt to using materials at hand for projects. Definitely want to try printing in another year.",
                "Yes. It is not an easy course, but doing the assignments is still enjoyable. They require focus but are also often relaxing in some ways. I would say experience, both with making art and looking at art, is the most valuable takeaway from this course, not necessarily knowledge\/facts.",
                "This was a fantastic course to dip your toes into the world of art. Professor Rose was very encouraging even if you do not think you are necessarily good at art. This class helps you expand your creativity, and you learn a lot in the process.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student in a heartbeat, provided they have sustained interest in what this course teaches, and think they would be able to really dedicate themselves to the projects. I will warn that it requires a fair amount of extra money to buy supplies, (I'd estimate around $150) and that some of the projects were extremely time-consuming, but if you love what you're doing it is very enjoyable. It's also a great way to balance your schedule with different types of work; we only had one short reading, and all of our other work was project based with tons of creative freedom. Professor Rose is a gem. If you're lucky enough to get into this seminar, I would urge you to take it. I loved it."
