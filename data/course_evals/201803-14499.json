    "I learned a great deal about the conditions necessary for democracy promotion and delved deep into the conceptual foundations of successful democracies. The class gave me the opportunity to study the relationship of democracy promotion to human rights, gender equality, and liberal economic policy. It was an excellent seminar.",
    "This course provided us with insights into the ethical debates surrounding democracy promotion, the main tools of democracy promotion, and an understanding of many of the dynamics challenging the democracy promotion establishment today.",
    "This course focused on developing a deep understanding of democracy promotion and the issues surrounding it. Over the term we looked at various tools used for democracy promotion and later at some case studies of democratic transitions. The class really challenged my beliefs and understanding of democracy promotion and highlighted both strengths and weaknesses of current efforts in the field."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The readings and input from Professor Bush were fantastic. Her class organization was exceptionally helpful given her experience with the subject material and capacity to guide the discussion in the right direction. Additionally, the documentaries and speeches added a great deal to the class.\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked to spend a bit more time on the theoretical components of democracy and US foreign policy theory including democracy promotion. Also, sometimes we would have a lot of readings (200+ pages), and I think of lot of people didn't do all of it which may have inhibited discussions. A little more guidance on the final paper may have been better as well (or, for example, two shorter papers just to get a sense before the end of the semester).",
    "This course was extremely well-structured towards student learning, the reading load was very manageable and our class discussions were always really engaging.",
    "Strengths of this class are definitely its organization and structure. Personally, I wish there had been a few more case studies at the start of the semester, since I found them particularly useful for discussion. Other than that, great course."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. This is a great entrypoint into understanding US foreign policy, neoconservative theory, and the difficulties of democracy promotion. Professor Bush is also a real gem.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they were interested in the topic of democracy promotion (or skeptical about democracy promotion in general) and wanted to gain a nuanced understanding of the challenges surrounding democracy promotion.",
    "I would recommend the class. At first it may seem a little daunting with all of its readings, but Professor Bush is a great professor and really helps you understand the material."
