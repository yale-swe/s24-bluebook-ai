Working on the activity list and getting feedback on that will also help with that part of the Common App. But perhaps most useful of all was the little quizzes we had to determine what kinds of learners we were. They helped me learn new studying strategies (which I've already found useful), use effective strategies I was already using more confidently, and get rid of or modify strategies that weren't benefiting me very much."

It covered all the important areas in just 6 classes: the college application, the quizzes to determine what kinds of learners we were, studying strategies, note-taking strategies, exam-taking strategies, and so much more!\r\nOne of the things that could be improved is for the instructor to stay more up-to-date with the current (or most recent) Common App to provide the most accurate information about how things should be handled. It must be mentioned, however, that even if this is not done, most of the information is beneficial and the other minor details can be easily dealt with by the applicants themselves.\r\nAs an afterthought, I understand that time is a barrier, but would it help for students to also learn about the Coalition Application a little? If not in class, at least as a worksheet\/leaflet for students to go through after the course\/in their own time?"
