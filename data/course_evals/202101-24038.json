I really appreciated that there were so many resources to practice for exams, and that we had multiple attempts to finish homework assignments -- I learned a lot more this way. I was also consistently engaged throughout the live seminar. I can't really think of any weaknesses -- this is a great option for fulfilling the language requirement, and I enjoyed it more than 110."

I would just say be prepared to get frustrated with the Spanish department occasionally. The class is incredibly demanding, often for no apparent reason. The course was not flexible at all. Even for simple things, such as an extension, my professor would require a dean's note. There is no reason why the course shouldn't offer extra credit, especially during a pandemic. Besides those frustrating moments and aspects, I do feel like I learned a great deal of Spanish. However, I do think I would have learned more if the course had been set up in a more compassionate way."
