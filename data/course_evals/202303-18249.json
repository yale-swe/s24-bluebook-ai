                "Developed knowledge of vector calculus and related mathematical skills, up to triple integrals, flux, divergence and stokes theorem.",
                "I learned about vectors, tangent planes, partial derivatives, double and triple integrals, Green's and Stoke's Theorem in a much more applied and physics style. I learned to think in a much more abstract way when solving mathematical problems. There is much less plug and chug compared to high school math, so the average problem requires more time to understand.",
                "I learned about different math operations in 3D space. I studied various theorems and equations related to 3D space. I developed critical thinking and problem solving skills that we were supposed to apply to problem sets, midterms, and the exam.",
                "I learned how to analyze real world problems using multivariable calculus.",
                "Learned how to study better by condensing my cheat sheet into one page. More helpful to only be allowed a one sided sheet instead of double.",
                "I learned I could do mental math at a higher level than I imagined. And essential vector and multivariable calculus.",
                "Multivariable functions, theorems, and derivation\/integration. Honed my skills in self-learning and creative thinking.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: teaching style, ABD is a great textbook\r\nWeaknesses: PSETs too many and too hard. concepts would still click with less, easier PSETs. Another weakness is the location its so far",
                "Everyone has the same instructor, which makes the class quite fair in terms of teaching quality, unlike many other introductory math courses. The content is still difficult, though, so it's easy to get lost, especially if you don't go to office hours. Unfortunately, office hours with the professor are a bit cramped, as they are in his office, and not all of the teaching fellows are amazing.",
                "It was taught in a rushed manner and we needed office hours and supplemental hours just to get by",
                "Strengths: online slides and lectures provided by Vidvuds, practice tests are very similar to real exams, very helpful TAs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: unclear grading on exams",
                "The course does a good job at teaching the material but sometimes it is hard to learn and the workload is high.",
                "Very clear, the linked videos and slides for review are extremely helpful.",
                "Strengths: There are plenty of office hours with peer tutors, TAs, and Vidvuds. The class is very well structured with pre-lecture videos and quizzes, practice exams posted well in advance, and organized files on Canvas. There are non-cumulative exams and formula sheets for each exam. \r\nWeaknesses: It can be a challenging class for a student without Multivariable Calculus experience due to the pace of the course, the shortened steps taken by Vidvuds when he is teaching, and to earn higher grade in the class since many students in the class have experience.",
                "I liked how predictable this course was. I liked how Vidvuds lectured for the classes, we studied (especially through problem sets), and then we took three large tests on this content. I was able to have a solid understanding of the material by the end of the course as a result of Vidvuds teaching and his asking us to work through difficult problems.\r\n\r\nI think this course could be improved with more resources that could show us how to do problems in a different way than Vidvuds might do it.",
                "I wish that the course would place more emphasis on understanding the conceptual concepts (ex. what exactly does the Stokes Theorem measure; when do you use the surface integral instead of the line integral) in order to facilitate proper understanding of the subject. Also, the course meets during reading week, which can make it hard to attend other review sessions. That being said, multivariable calculus is a really fascinating way to view the world around us, and is very enjoyable when I understand it.",
                "Strengths were the COVID lecture videos posted before class so we had a better idea of what we would learn in class. Weaknesses are the problem sets during the week of the tests because our tests weren't on that material.",
                "Uhh no",
                "I really enjoyed this class! I would say that the review sessions could be a little more organized but other than that the class was great!",
                "Lectures aren't the most helpful; needed a lot of independent learning to keep up. Exams are difficult. However, learned a lot and advanced learners will thrive.",
                "Towards the beginning of the semester, lectures were very theory\/explanation heavy which did not facilitate as much learning and understanding of the content. It became a lot easier to follow once more example problems were worked out during class.",
                "Weaknesses - The entire class. Vidvudz basically implemented a flipped classroom strategy where we were supposed to come to class knowing this material, which is impractical and reduces his role in facilitating this information. The cheat sheet we were allowed on exams was only one-sided. \r\n\r\nStrengths - We were allowed a cheat sheet on the exams.",
                "Structured excellently; the pre-class quizzes are excellent for forcing people to use their resources (i.e. textbooks and lecture recordings)."

                "Possibly. Most people are probably trying to choose between this and Math 120. While I of course did not take Math 120, I have taken other math courses with an unhealthy variability in the quality of teaching from one classroom to another. In this regard, ENAS 151 is a huge improvement, as everyone is on the same ground.",
                "No unless you absolutely have to take it for your major",
                "Yes, but it's hard. The concepts are fun to visualize and satisfying when they finally click. You also get taught directly by the professor (as opposed to Math 120, where my friends have had mixed experiences with graduate students).",
                "I would recommend this course if you want to learn multivariable calculus or if it is a required prerequisite.",
                "Yes, if required for their major--it has many applications to engineering. Many students already had prior experience with multivariable calculus from high school which made the class not too difficult for them. However, it is not the easiest class especially for those who have no prior experience.",
                "Yes. It is very well organized, and the combination of online videos, the required quizzes, and the lecture itself, provides a good understanding of the topic. Although it is a tough topic, and studying is the most important for understanding, I don't believe it could be taught in a better way. Some given grade boosts are also well received and helpful.",
                "Yes, but if you are on the fence between MATH 120 and ENAS 151 it can be a tough decision. If you are an engineering major, ENAS 151 is a great route to go. If you are able to get a good professor for MATH 120, take MATH 120. There isn't a major difference between the two, one is not easier than the other. Both classes cover the same topics, but the ENAS problems are more applied.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because I really enjoyed the structure of the class. I think that students should be willing to work hard and take advantage of the resources available and will then have a very positive, educational experience with the class.",
                "Id recommend the course for people who enjoy quantitative problem solving and also dont mind (or are looking to improve their ability to) seeking out supplemental help through office hours and tutoring.",
                "Much better than Math 120 and definitely easier to learn since it is applied more towards physics.",
                "I would recommend this course because the professor is pretty lenient about grades and gives partial curves. Plus, there are office hours almost every day of the week.",
                "Yes - it's a requirement, but self-study from the beginning and do every practice exam\/question.",
                "I would recommend this course over Math 120 any day. As someone who took some of 120 in a previous semester, I believe that the grading and the exams were much fairer in the way that the content was assessed. The exams were much more straightforward and the textbook was wonderful supplementary content.",
                "No, but I suppose this class is better than MATH 120. Overall, the math department at Yale is abysmal, so theres not really good options here.",
                "Yes- it is useful knowledge."
