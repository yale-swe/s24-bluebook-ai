   "comments": [
    "Brilliant intro the queer culture and history, as well as to modernism as a literary movement",
    "I learned how to read texts more deeply and how to write more complex arguments.",
    "I was glad to have an introduction to modernism here, and thought that it worked really well through a lens of queer theory. I also appreciated getting my toes wet in reading sexology and also the biographies of authors alongside works, which often doesn't happen in other courses.",
    "I definitely improved my close readings skills and read the most fiction I have read in any course at Yale. Lectures were interesting, but often referenced theory that was never got exposure to through the course, which was frustrating since I definitely went into the course expecting to engage more with queer theory.",
    "This course takes you through the modernist literature of \"The Other\" - the way queerness, race, disability (among other traits) interact in the literature of the late 19th and 20th centuries. You learn how to read into subtext, and how to apply the lenses of race and queerness to works that might not normally be considered in that way, like Forster's A Passage to India. The course also helps you learn the process of writing an analytic literature paper; we were first assigned a short \"close reading\" assignment with no intro or conclusion, basically just the flesh of a literary analysis, and then slowly moved onto bigger and more complete papers throughout the semester.",
    "I gained an insight into modernist literature and the authors' positions in society",
    "I learned a lot about marriage plot narratives, the contexts of European queer subcultures around the turn of the century and into the 20th century, and the interplay between literary form and the narration of queer lives for which language did not exist.",
    "I learned about trends in British modernist literature and the construction of the queer subject in this literature. I also learned the historic context behind this literary trend.",
    "I learned a great deal about modernism, and this course definitely challenged my view of what \"queer\" means, especially in a modernist context. I increased my ability to close-read a variety of texts, and learned to create an argument out of these close readings. I learned that I don't really like modernist literature; that is, long-winded, over-wrought, punctuation-heavy, extended metaphor\/simile full pieces of writing--rather, I like shorter things, like the Hughes poetry we read. I learned about spinsters, the queer child, a little about the British Raj (in the context of Forster's work), about Oscar Wilde and the Pemberton Billings trials... however I'm not sure what I will retain of these concepts...",
    "I learned a lot about queer history and queer theory that I will bring to future literary analysis.",
    "Learned a lot about the literature from historically marginalised groups which I never got to study in high school, which was wonderful.",
    "I definitely feel like this class critically analyzed different works in the time period effectively, and I found myself challenging pieces outside the class with the same lenses we applied. It made me think more deeply about gender, sexuality, and the impossibility of writing about them.",
    "This course introduced me to a lot of key queer writers and theorists. The close analysis assignment made me a better literary thinker and writer. Professor Richards use of different media (films, photographs, court documents etc) helped to mix literature and history and look at the progression of queerness as both a literary and historical concept."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the lectures are wonderful and enlightening in many senses, and the readings are great.\r\nWeaknesses: the lack of connectedness from lecture to section to the writing assignments. There was a general feeling of discouragement at the fact that. no matter how much I enjoyed lecture and no matter how well I tried to read the books, the writing guidance that I would have liked was not present.",
    "Truly an awesome course, although the amount of reading was pretty high. Lectures were engaging and interesting, section was awesome, assignments were graded in a timely manner and feedback was great.",
    "I think the strengths of this classes are the novels! \r\n\r\nI think the most successful lectures were ones making an argument, vs. discussing the book. I also think it's a good writing credit and Professor Richard's assignments helped people develop writings skills at an appropriate pace.",
    "I think that the lack of engagement w critical texts was a huge deficit to the course. Reading more queer theory in which to ground our analyses of early queer texts I think would have felt way more meaningful that simply doing close readings of the text. Additionally, I felt like lectures lacked focus at times. Understandably, since each book only got one or two lectures, there was a lot of ground to cover, but I think lectures would have felt more meaningful if analyses were centered around themes or critical ideas instead of just disjointed comments about different parts of the book.",
    "Lectures for this course were phenomenal; Professor Richards is a great lecturer who brings a lot of interesting analysis and perspectives I would have never considered to each work that we read. The TFs also each gave a lecture throughout the semester; those too were very interesting and made me wish I was in every section at once, basically.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's a course that focuses a lot on intertextuality. The literature of the semester follows a shared tradition of alienation, loneliness, and their affects; other smaller supplementary texts helped me understand the exact context of what we were reading and what real-life events and trends the authors were responding to. Everything was super interesting.",
    "Lectures were phenomenal. I loved them! Could be nice to include a research component, instead of centering all assignments on close reading.",
    "Section was usually not particularly helpful, and often seemed unstructured. The professor often spoiled the endings of the novels in lecture before we were supposed to have finished the novel. At times it seemed as though there were other novels that would have been more interesting to assign that the professor mentioned in passing in lecture. Professor Richards was knowledgable on the subject matter and an entertaining lecturer.",
    "The lectures were excellent, and each was extensively prepared for by Professor Richards and the Teaching Fellows. Some might not enjoy the open-discussion nature of sections, but I enjoyed it.",
    "Strengths: There are a wide range of texts, covering a variety of authors, literary styles, literary techniques. Because it is designed somewhat as an introductory course, the assignments build incrementally and you get however much guidance you desire. Papers have prompts, too, so you aren't stuck coming up with an entirely original idea, unlike in other classes. Lecture is always exciting, and Professor Richards is always prepared to say something really enlightening about the readings. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The readings are long, and often hard to get through--and there isn't too much incentive to actually trudge all the way through them, unless you really enjoy reading them! Also, while we talked about this in class, that most of the pieces we read dealt some way or another with \"shame\" -- I would've appreciated a few more light-hearted reads. (Maurice, by Forster?) I also didn't understand why we read some of the things that we did read: Passage to India apparently has queer undertones. I still don't get it. How is infanticide queer? (Grimke's short story). The Hughes poetry wasn't blatantly queer. When I thought queer, I'd assume something not heternormative... maybe... well, gay? Lesbian? Trans? But some of these works didn't really have any of these elements, blatantly. (I understand that queer can simply imply difference or not \"the norm,\" but I'm not sure if that was the idea behind the course?)",
    "Strength: the lectures were a good format for teaching the historical background of these novels, putting them into context, and discussing wider themes and quotes. Sometimes Professor Richards let the T.F.'s give guest lectures when a topic corresponded with their individual studies and these were generally excellent as well. Section was when you did close readings and discussed the text with your peers.\r\n\r\nCons: a lot of your experience is determined by your T.F. in section, and I wasn't super happy with minethey lead the close reading exercises\/discussion in section and grade your papers. Unless you seek her out and schedule a meeting, there is not much interaction with Professor Richards herself.",
    "This course was generally very well-structured and engaging - the only weakness I can think of is that a couple of the texts didnt link too clearly with the Queer theme.",
    "Strengths: reading list, the amazing TFs, the engaging lectures, feedback on essays\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some lectures hit more strongly than others, and a couple of readings felt out of place",
    "This is maybe personal preference, but I wish Professor Richards relied less on class participation in lectures, since I think it would have been more useful to hear her interpretations of texts. I would have also loved to see her incorporate other critics & scholars' thoughts on the works we were reading. I think lectures usually took the form of some historical context + the class close-reading passages, which didn't always illuminate the texts for me, especially the more opaque ones (Orlando, Nightwood, etc). I understand that Professor Richards wanted to model close-reading for non-majors, but maybe the format could have shifted slightly after the beginning part of class.",
    "I think that the course could be improved by adding more people of colour to the syllabus. I thought the content was engaging and the course was organised well around specific themes."

   "comments": [
    "Yes because the content is amazing. Genuinely not a single week where the lectures weren't fully engaging. But not unless you've taken a prior course in intensive writing and analysis of texts. The style is very particular and many students seemed to learn the hard way. Not the easiest way to get a writing credit",
    "Yes, this course includes a wonderful (and diverse) syllabus and a super engaging lecturer. I would recommend to anyone who likes to read fiction, especially English majors as this is a class that stands out from the typical class that offers a syllabus rooted in the canon (yawn). This class was super refreshing. There also aren't too many English lectures available, and this is a great option!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in reading\/learning about modernist literature! This course takes a broad definition of \"queer,\" and many of the books\/readings did not deal explicitly with homosexuality; you're reading more for queer form than for queer content.",
    "Yes! I learned so much! Fascinating topic.",
    "I think this is a great class for people who like reading and want to get better by reading excellent novels and doing well-calibrated writing assignments. This is great for early-level English and humanities students, as well as for people who want to get a sense of modernism (not enough taught at Yale) or queer representations in fiction (ditto!). The works are so excellent that they accommodate interest from both introductory and more advanced students. It also doesnt feel like a closed canon, and I feel more equipped to go out and read on my own.",
    "Maybe. I felt duped because I really went in expecting more queer theory and less close reading (maybe its just me, but I absolutely hate close reading and wish I knew this would be the predominant approach to literary analysis for this class). If you have the same expectations, find a different class in the major. If youre super hyped about reading fiction written by modernist authors (some books are more queer than others), go for it. As a side note, almost every book is super depressing, so just be aware of that.",
    "Absolutely. If you're at all interesting in modernist texts through the lens of race, queerness, and the \"Other\", then it's an invaluable course to take.",
    "it's a good course with a mostly interesting reading list! english lectures can be kinda weird however - during most lectures Professor Richards would give really useful context to the historical background of the book and its author and then close read some key passages from the book. I also really enjoyed seeing the pictures and videos that helped flesh out the books. However, sometimes i became more confused by the lectures and didn't feel like i learned much from sitting in on them. Overall, I liked the course and feel like now I have a better understanding of the queer undercurrents of modernists literature.",
    "Such a fun course! Would recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about the formation of 20th century queer identities, or anyone who just loves to read novels!",
    "It depends. If the student has already taken WGSS courses and is looking for more complicated theory and material, then no. But as an introductory course, it would serve well.",
    "This is a very chill, fun fifth class. You'll get a lot out of it whether you read every book or not. Jill is a great, laid back lecturer. Just an overall good time.",
    "Yes! The syllabus is a lot of fun. Some of the best literature I read this semester was from this course.",
    "I would recommend this to someone who wants read works of Modernist literature. If you don't know what that is, I'd go look it up right now, because if this isn't your cup of tea, I would not enroll in this course. If you want to be able to perform close-readings and highly theoretical (perhaps) analyses, this course is for you. If you want to read a little gay stuff, here you are. However, be warned that some of these texts felt inaccessible to me, and I thought I was a pretty good reader\/writer\/English student. But if you want to learn things about queer politics and identity in slightly earlier literature, this class is great for that. Some of the books were actually really fun to read, despite the morose subject matter--looking at you, The Well of Loneliness. Others were just a straight up nightmare, like Barnes' Nightwood. So I'd say, just know what you're getting into when you enroll. The lectures are amazing, though.",
    "Yes! I learned a lot about queer history, there is a wide variety of texts (most of them fiction\/poetry but enough nonfiction historical texts to help put them into context), and the lecture format was well suited to help convey the historical side while section was reserved for close reading discussion. Professor Richards is wonderful. Note that most of the texts we read, while enjoyable and interesting, are pretty depressingthis is all pre-Stonewall, pre-\"pride.\"",
    "I would recommend it. It was super educational, and a great English class.",
    "Yes! It exposes you to so many fantastic texts which you may not have gotten to study otherwise.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone studying the early 20th century, or anyone who wants to deepen their understanding of queer literature. In fact, I would argue everyone could benefit from the course.",
    "I would, especially to non-English majors -- Professor Richards was great about making the class accessible to everyone. It was the first time the class was offered, and Professor Richards mentioned wanting to switch out some of the readings if she teaches it again, so I imagine it will only get stronger. It's a pretty non-demanding class as far as English courses go, and I wish Professor Richard's lectures went beyond historical background\/really broad readings, as I'm not sure how instructive lectures always were. But I enjoyed it! It was really cool to hear queer readings of (mostly) explicitly queer texts in an academic setting, which is why I took the class in the first place.",
    "Yes, the content is really interesting and Professor Richards is great!"
