    "I learned about the history of the Olympic Games as well as of Ancient Greece and how the Olympic movement has created and caused several controversial issues.",
    "I loved this course. I found the ancient material (history and myths) intriguing and relevant. Our discussions of the modern Olympic movement were fast-paced and filled with new ideas. The class helped my debating, reasoning, and close-reading skills. It is one of few courses I know of that thoroughly investigate's the athlete's role in society, ancient to modern.",
    "lots of knowledge about the past and present Olympics, and also some writing techniques."

   "comments": [
    "this course is definitely focused on the mythological olympics more, but it was an amazing class and prof Syrimis cares so much abut his students doing well",
    "This is an amazing course and I would not change it at all!",
    "Great topics for class discussions, there could be a little more organization with the assignments",
    "I love the seminar format filled with lots of athletes from different years, backgrounds, and sports to fill the discussions with personal inputs and experiences.",
    "Really interesting and enjoyable class. Would have been very helpful if more clear instructions for projects and papers had been given and put on canvas (page counts, expectations, citation style, subject, etc. Just more explicit directions.) Sometimes the topics brought up for discussion during project presentations got repetitive.",
    "This course in engaging, the discussions are insightful and fun, and Professor Syrimis is fantastic. Though there is a lot of assigned reading, it is either fascinating ancient history or modern texts on important issues.",
    "I think that this course was very dynamic and so was the teacher. It was very fun and I was glad that it only met once a week. I think it could be improved by having a couple more short assignments so that your grade wasn't really only dependent on 2 papers."

   "comments": [
    "yes take for sure if you are an athlete \/ interested in sports",
    "Definitely!",
    "I would recommend this course! Our classes were always stimulating, and we thought about questions that I would not have thought to consider, which left me feeling pushed intellectually the whole time.",
    "Yes! Very interesting course whether or not the class is in your major\/field of study",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this to another student.",
    "Olympic Games is a seminar for and of athletes. While open to the student body at-large, the class draws heavily from Yale's student athlete population. The questions posed in the seminar, however, extend beyond the realm of athletics. You discuss everything from race to commercialization to nationalism, and have the opportunity to explore more deeply topics that genuinely pique your interests. Prof. Syrimis stokes the conversation, but the quality of the class ultimately comes down to the level of participation of your fellow classmates - with active and engaged classmates, the seminar is quite enjoyable.",
    "As a student-athlete who deeply cares about the main topics of this course (the role and perception of \"the athlete\" in society, the Olympics), I would highly recommend this class. In fact, I have already suggested it to several friends.",
    "Yes it was very interesting!"
