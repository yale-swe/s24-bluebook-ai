    "I developed better speaking and writing skills especially. I also learned a vast amount of different tenses and really enjoyed the way the professor taught.",

    "Greater comfort reading, writing, speaking, and listening to Spanish."

   "comments": [
    "L3 had an exam\/quiz\/essay almost every couple days. it felt like as soon as one ended then you had to cram to study for the next one. I think more formative learning would improve the class.",
    "There is definitely too much testing. Students are constantly studying and trying to stay on top of homework, readings and testing\/ in-class essays were too much. Two ways to mitigate this pressure may be to provide the opportunity to drop a lower grade or to reduce the amount of testing altogether. I think the content is well organised and important, but maybe a little reading-heaving.",
    "The short stories we read were really so enriching to my understanding of Spanish-speaking culture, and I wish that the novella we read at the end of the semester were more reflective of classic literature in Spanish.",
    "the strengths are the amount of work and information. The weaknesses are sometimes too much is expected, for example, reading 50 pages of a book in one night.",
    "Having this course everyday of the week deters many students from taking it. 2 or 3 times a week for a longer amount of time would be much more effective and would inspire students to take spanish up to L5",
    "Some of the curriculum was quite boring like the book.",
    "Great variety of interesting materials. Useful vocabulary. Pleasingly even distribution of work throughout the semester (with a bit of an increase towards the end). The course could be improved by: (1) avoiding italic font in notebook readings (e.g. El sueno de Pluto); (2) assigning less weight to quizzes in the final grade."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they had a solid background in the Spanish language.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as I feel my Spanish has improved a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course with this teacher. Profesora Symons was OUTSTANDING, and I loved every morning of Spanish with her.",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student that is trying to fulfill the language requirement. It is a lot of work and meets every day, so it is not worth it to take the class otherwise.",
    "Yes, every student must fulfill the language requirement, so I strongly suggest taking L3 Spanish. It is a challenge but at the end of the semester it feels as though you can speak fluently in most tenses (past, present, future).",
    "I mean you have to take a language and I would recommend spanish because its relevant in America.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is fun and useful for improving one's Spanish."
