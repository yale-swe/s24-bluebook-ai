(he unnecessarily mentioned near the end of the term that he grades the homework hard on purpose). Not to mention his social awkwardness made it to where going to office hours would be a complete waste of time. Also lost his temper on a student that dared to ask a question. \r\n\r\nThe Material: We delved into some rather \"unconventional\" methods for understanding mathematical calculations. In other words, we explored how to further complicate math."

Honestly they should really get rid of this class a whole since it really serves no purpose. (If you are simply trying to fulfill your QR do this: Take Math 107, and the Structure of Networks.\r\nI thought this class couldn't possibly be that bad since there were only five students in the class. (More individualized attention right? Nope.)\r\nOf course the low enrollment should have been a giant red flag."
