                "I learned how to find the right people to interview, ask the right questions, and structure a good article. The real learning is outside the classroom doing the assignments, and Sue is there to hold your hand.",
                "I learned how to do journalism with passion, integrity, and a sense of mission. Sue is an amazing writer, editor, and teacher. It was an honor to learn from her every week.",
                "This course was supremely helpful in developing my writing ability, editing ability, comfort interviewing, and understanding of how to construct a piece of journalistic writing.",
                "I learned how to approach interviewing and explored how best to generate clear, compelling story ideas. Through dissection of a variety of journalistic pieces, we explored a range of ways to approach perspective and structure--weighing the pros and cons of each.",

            "comments": [
                "Sue invests an unparalleled amount in her students. She treated us with such dignity and respect, making us actively believe in ourselves and our abilities. For someone so accomplished in the field to make us feel that way was remarkable. The course was strongest when our class conversations were rooted in group readings. I thought that the second half of the semester dipped a little too far into discussing student projects.",
                "I think the courses strengths were manifoldthe free flowing conversation, Sues phenomenal feedback, the peers were so thoughtful. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were few and far between. Id say the biggest thing that was a challenge is the readings would change for each weak on sundays, so it could feel a little hectic at times.",
                "I really valued Prof. Dominus' honest, down-to-earth candor and practical advice. She was very focused and invested in the course and in our success as students exploring journalism. I think it would have maybe been nice if we'd all had a little more of a chance to explore the specific kinds of journalism we're interested in as students. Though we read a variety of pieces, there was a somewhat conventional framing we applied while examining them. I would have liked, at times, some less conventional examples of what journalism can look like.",
                "Strengths: covers a lot of ground in analyzing journalism. Loved covering the pieces that were assigned as readings and dissecting them.\r\nWeaknesses: mostly just that it's a new class! There were a few bumps like figuring out what to cover when, but I expect those will be smoothed out.",

                "I would recommend this course to a student who is looking to learn how to do journalism, and fast. Otherwise you could probably learn the skills and things on your own at a student publication over a couple years.",
                "Yes, yes, absolutely yes. Sue is someone you would be unfortunate to miss during your time at Yale. You should definitely try to learn from her because she will teach you so much about journalism, writing, and life in general!",
                "Yes absolutely! Sue is an extraordinary professor, the skills you learn are so helpful, and its so much fun to have a writing project you get to entirely own yourself.",
                "Yes!!! Regardless of whether you have a background in journalism (I did not), I think anyone can benefit from taking this course. The readings each week were amazing, and this was a great opportunity to just write and learn now to develop my own voice as a writer. Sue was an amazing professor, and was always so supportive of our development as journalists.",
                "Absolutely, especially if you're taking it with Susan. She is so attentive, caring, and obviously wonderful at what she does.",
                "Yes! Journalism is an AMAZING fundamental course.",
                "Yes especially with Sue/Professor Dominus. I appreciated the energy she brought to every class and how supportive she was of each individual student."
