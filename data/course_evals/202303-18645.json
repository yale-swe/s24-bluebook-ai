The course primarily centers around reading texts prior to class, submitting thoughts on the readings ahead of time, and then discussing the topic of the week in the seminar. The course itself develops what forms of government would be feasible in the United States and invites the students to conceptualize beyond what has previously been done at the large scale in the United States. Furthermore, with the Discussion Leader component of the class, you get to learn how to guide a small group and draw out participation from your peers as you're basically in charge of the class.",

It then moves into the theories in practice with studies conducted in a variety of contexts and geographic regions (such as labor unions in Europe and schools in South America). That said, at times, the reading can get heavy but it is essential to being able to meaningfully contribute to class discussion, so perhaps the readings could be condensed into smaller segments?",

People often just gave their general impressions and speculations, which I typically don't find as valuable. Overall, however, I enjoyed the course, and I got a lot out of the readings."

It also highlighted the importance of engaging politically with those in your immediate circles of influence rather than focusing on doing so at a larger level. I would highly recommend this course, especially to anyone interested in alternative forms of government and political philosophy.",
