I gained skills in reading and interpreting research in social psychology, as well as more philosophical works. Social construction, I learned, is a very flexible idea in terms of having a wide range of applications. At the same time, it's a very powerful idea because of the ways it can shape how we interpret and interact with elements of the social worlds we live in."

                "Professor Dunham is a wonderful strength of the course. He is knowledgeable, helpful and flexible. The discussion-based format is great. Being a senior seminar, the class naturally will be comprised of upperclass students in similar majors who can fuel great discussions. \r\n\r\nAs this was the first semester Professor Dunham taught the course, there are a few things that could be altered (which we talked about as a class), but overall it was a great class!",
                "Strengths: We had great discussions every class and there were never any boring lulls despite this class being a longer seminar. The assignments we had were fantastic. I want to specifically mention the Rabbit Hole assignment that gave us the opportunity to explore our own intereststhis is what university is about after all no? Perhaps overlooked, I was very happy with doing weekly reading responses because it kept us accountable but also gave us spaces to reflect, especially with feedback from the professor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As mentioned in class, the philosophy was pretty brutal. Maybe introduce the philosophy in class and initiate discussions as opposed to having students read the articles prior to class. Additionally, I may have went into the class expecting something else but I felt that there were not as many psychology experiments, quantitative work than expected.",
                "Super interesting course, good readings and the workload was manageable. Could have focused more on psychology readings rather than philosophy",
                "The reading responses were a strength of the course. They kept me on track with readings that could be a bit hard to follow at times due to the theoretical nature of a lot of the discussion. Professor Dunham also fostered great discussions in class.",
                "This course benefited from its discussion-based style, which encouraged student ideas and participation. The range of texts and topics covered was also a strength, because it gave a more thorough overview of the possible applications of social construction. Readings could have been made more diverse in terms of their disciplines and fields, and I think this would help broaden the applicability of the course concepts. Additionally, fitting the class readings and discussion topics into a more clear overarching structure or narrative throughout the course would help to contextualize the ideas covered."

                "Yes. This course is a great senior seminar with fun and challenging discussions. Professor Dunham is great.",
                "Yes, but do not expect your worldview to be changedwhich is what the class description elicits. By no means a true negative, but the class focuses a lot on defining social construction and arguing over what social constructs are. Because of this, there is some convoluted philosophy that gets involved that makes one go: \"why am I even thinking about this?\" Even then, a lot of the definitions are not used in our class discussions.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would say Professor Dunham does a great job of leading the class. From the assignments he makes (e.g. Rabbit Hole, Presentation), there were a lot of opportunities to engage in topics that we found interesting outside of all the definitions and philosophy. Professor Dunham also does a great job of mixing lectures and discussion time, allowing the class to engage in discourse. I wish there were more dissenting opinions throughout our time together.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students but mostly psyc/cogsci or other social science majors as it does require some background knowledge. All of the material is engaging and forces you to think about society and institutions in a new way.",
                "If you're interested in the topic, yes",
                "Yes absolutely! If you are student who is interested in using the tools of psychology to examine more theoretical/philosophical questions, then you should take this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to students of all backgrounds, but especially those with experience engaging with social psychological research. Some background in philosophy or more theoretical approaches to social science would also be helpful. The topics covered are highly relevant to various aspects of our lives (subjects discussed included race, gender, property, and money, for example) and the approaches taken to them are fascinating and unique (including evolutionary theory, philosophy, and developmental psychology, for example). To get the most out of the class, students need to be interested and self-motivated to explore the course materials on their own, as well as contribute to class discussions. Because of the social relevance of the topics covered, keeping an open mind to the perspectives discussed is also key."
