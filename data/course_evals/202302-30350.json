                "Over the summer, I developed a new view of acting and the way I approach it. In Text Class, I learned how to analyze a play, break it into beats, and the major elements of the plot. In Voice, I worked on alignment, vocal projection, and locating different resonators in the body. In Movement, I got out of my comfort zone and felt what it was like not to be prohibited by socialization. Finally, in Acting, I learned to follow a path of stimuli, listen/respond to my partner, truthfully chase an objective, and use my given circumstances to inform my character choices.",
                "- An understanding for the actor-audience relationship through clowning\r\n- Different resonators in the body and how to utilize the natural voice\r\n- Text analysis tools for different types of texts\r\n- Enhanced understanding of 'living truthfully under given circumstances' within the acting circumstance, and additional rehearsal tools to help enrich the experience",

                "I learned and incredible amount of confidence, ability to play, partner work, and overall improvement in acting.",
                "I worked with skills regarding clowning, text analysis of plays, the voice as its own instrument and its application to text, and also safe, truthful acting.",
                "I learned about who I am, who I want to be and how to get there. The course gave me insights into the life of an actor and what my life awaits if I choose to follow that path, but it also opened the possibility of a new career-path as a director, editor, cinematographer etc. I learned that each one is as important as the other to create the art of film and theater. In the skills department I would say I developed the knowledge to prepare my body and my mind for acting in a profesional way, they opened the doorway towards the technique of acting for me and I choose to step in and follow whatever comes next. I believe this course was very helpful for me and it was a taste of what my actual college life is gonna be like, that is exciting and also scary because it means there is no formula to acting, rather you take and you use whatever resonates with your craft. This course helped me grow in a way that I wouldnt have been able to do on my own, I overcame my fear of being judged while acting I front of people because that was a safe space to do so, thank you for that.",

                "A major strength of the course is the one-on-one time with TAs and instructors, especially in acting class. Due to the specific attention, I especially saw improvement during these times. Additionally, all of the instructors are incredibly enthusiastic and knowledgeable in their fields. My only comment would be to do more in Acting class. We were only able to do a one-page scene, a contemporary scene, and a monologue during the five weeks.",
                "I feel that it could be even more intensive with more acting classes/variety\r\nI enjoyed what I have learned, although I did feel like I was willing to contribute even more time to get as much out of the program as possible",
                "The courses were amazing! My only complaint was the condition of the dorm bathrooms.",
                "I loved it overall. I wish we had more acting classes or more similarities among the acting sections. I thought the multitude of classes was very helpful. \r\n\r\nI personally found some of the younger students at a maturity level in which they were not as dedicated to learning as some of the older college aged and post-grad students. I did find them to be a disruption in classes often, even the ones that I consider dear friends now. \r\n\r\nHowever, I truly loved the course and I do feel that I have grown as an actor and performer.",
                "I believe the only weakness is that during the whole program we dont get to interact with other sections. I was in section C2 and I never had class with Section A (except for the masterclasses and warmups) but I believed that led me into believing that maybe that was the reason I did not get along with them as much as I did with the other section I was in. But I also believe that is a strength because by making the groups smaller the attention towards our craft is more specific and detailed.",
                "I think a potential weakness of the program would be the fact that the two groups are so separated from each other and to my knowledge have quite a different experience. That being said (in my ignorance of how the groups were formed in the first place), I have heard that there was a general difference in terms of level of engagement amongst some students in the other section. The difference in age and experience is also a question that I have, because while I feel like that was not an issue in the slightest in my group, it could have a huge impact with another set of students."
