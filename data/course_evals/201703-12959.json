   "comments": [
    "Standard learning and memory course. Good mix of computational and psychological perspectives.",
    "This is a small class, but doesn't require discussion. Professor Brown is very attentive. The lab assignments are fun to do. Weakness: you need to memorize every little detail to do well on the exams.",
    "Some lectures were a little dry but overall it was interesting. Could use some more interactive activities especially since it was such a small class. A few seminar style discussions, especially at the end regarding free will would've been really neat.",
    "The lectures were for the most part very interesting - I think it would help to maybe limit the breadth of material covered in the slides and instead dig deeper into a few concepts, because it sometimes felt a little bit like a list of facts to memorize when studying for the exams. I really enjoyed the format of the exams, as they are straightforward to study for and cover exactly the material presented in lecture. However, while the CogLab labs were great, I think I learned little from writing the 2 lab reports for them and wish they were replaced with more interesting homework assignments like Memento.",
    "The course itself was a little too basic for its numbering. It should have probably been an introductory psychology course. Also, the tests were based on minute details, rather than bigger concepts."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you want an overview of learning and memory seminal studies.",
    "Yes, I would take this course. It is interesting and challenging. I think I've also been tailoring the way I study based on what we learned.",
    "This course is interesting and not too much work. There is no final, only three midterms which are easy as long as you look at the lecture slides carefully. Professor Brown is also an awesome person and really invested in making sure you understand the material and gives you opportunities to do well in the class. If you ask questions you will do very well in the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in neuroscience - a little background may be required but the material is explained clearly. The exams are pure memorization, but it is very manageable compared to other courses.",
    "A really interesting course and supportive, passionate professor! The exams were sometimes overly detail-oriented, and the volume of material was high, but the content and homework assignments were very engaging.",
    "I would probably not recommend this course to another student. It is not particularly challenging, nor do you learn a lot. However, there are a lot of assignments that take up quite a bit of time."
