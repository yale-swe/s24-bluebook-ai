                "One of the best surveys in 19th, 20th century Continental philosophy; freedom to think creatively about continental philosophy; an strong familiarity with Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud's key works and influences.",
                "Read excerpts from the major works of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud. Learned of a surprising number of similarities between the writings of these three, as well as lots of good context about the intellectual currents and debates they were writing in response to. I had never read Nietzsche before, but came away with a decent understanding of where he fits in the philosophical tradition and what his main ideas were.",
                "This course enabled me to think more critically about the history and genealogy of ideas in philosophy, and by studying Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud (and many other thinkers that came in between), to better understand the social and cultural roots of these ideas.",
                "This course was amazing! I was able to improve my reading skills, as the syllabus was rigorous. In terms of insights, this was the most thought-provoking class Ive taken. Not only was each philosopher rich in their own thought, but seminar discussion was inviting, and engaging far beyond the time spent in class.",
                "I learned about the specific philosophical worldviews of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud and how they inform each other.",
                "An understanding of the philosophies of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud that is easily good enough to get me through any cocktail party conversation, which is a low but essential bar for any philosophy class to clear.",
                "This is the perfect survey course. It is focused enough to be able to treat each author with the respect they deserve, and I feel after reading the substantial yet carefully selected texts that I have a firm grasp on some of the most important thoughts and innovations of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud. The same can NOT be said of many other survey courses at Yale, where the level of engagement with each text and author can be embarrassingly low.",
                "broad overview of 19th century philosophy. great introduction to philosophy essay writing and close reading."

            "comments": [
                "The seminar was conducted in a way that felt (in the best way possible) like a reading group: reading assignments were incredibly interesting, and we would come to class discussing what we thought was interesting and working through the texts together. There was a lot of intellectual freedom and room for creativity in this course.",
                "Strengths:\r\nWriting the papers for this class is the most fun I've had writing at Yale; the prompts were well thought-out and allowed room for both engaging critically with a work, but also relating that work to modern issues and ideas. The syllabus\/readings were great; wide enough in scope to get the broad project of each thinker, but also deep enough to  engage critically with specific arguments. Students were allowed lots of room to discuss in class which was helpful and enriching.",
                "This course has a great syllabus. Some of the material is quite difficult  but I think necessary to understand the later material.",
                "The class itself was a huge strength insofar that class discussions were always very inclusive and vibrant and fostered a healthy environment where people could voice their opinions without fear of judgment. Also, the three papers had many prompts that allowed people to write on topics they were passionate about.",
                "I loved this course. It was something like a book club on Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud with some of your friends, if one of your friends happened to be Dr. Brass, who commands the works of MN&F phenomenally. More aid could have been given for the readings, I think, but this is a problem with nearly all philosophy classes. Some guiding questions or a few prefatory comments by the teacher would have been welcome.",
                "The main strength of this class was its seminar format, where the level of engagement and brilliance from everyone in the room made the experience absolutely wonderful. A bit more structured framing of the texts could have been useful at the beginning of each session, but the balance between lecture and discussion is difficult to get right.",
                "professor was incredibly warm and insightful. beginning with Hegel creates a good background for the rest of the curriculum and all the work felt readable and digestible. great discussion culture in class."

Sebastian Brass was a great seminar leader and allowed students a great deal of freedom in exploring what they found interesting in the texts while remaining true to the direction of the syllabus.",

                "To anyone considering taking this class, you will not regret it. I learned so much about topics I thought I was already well versed in and enjoyed the entire process of writing and discussing Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud.",
