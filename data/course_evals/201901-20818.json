    "Strengths: You get a lot of feedback and workshopping opportunities, as well as interacting with many different types of written humor pieces. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There aren't a lot of chances for revision for most of the essays, also this class is sooooo work heavy.",
    "This is a fabulous class. It is a huge time commitment, but I really enjoyed the feedback and the emphasis on revision. The main improvement I'd suggest is a little more direction in terms of essay prompts!",
    "N\/a",
    "Professor Wepler has an airtight syllabus.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is how it took over outside the classroom. With readings, humor challenges, conferences, topical jokes, and writing letters to each other, Writing Humor was always on my mind.",
    "Strengths: Ryan is the best, the sheer amount of writing you do (it's a grind but definitely makes you a stronger writer), having a crew of very funny peers critiquing your work, workshops. \r\n\r\nImprovements: Maybe more time spent on line editing in class (do you think it would be funnier if ____ or ____ type questions)?"

    "It's really only gonna teach you how to write humor pieces, rather than right other pieces funny. So if you're interested in comedy writing, it's for you. If not, it's not gonna make you more funny.",
    "Definitely take it if you can get in. This is a great class! The workload is heavy-- you're writing constantly for the class-- but that's the best part. You learn by reading and by doing in this class. I definitely learned a lot.",
    "Absolutely. Do be aware that this class is a LOT of work, and Professor Wepler is not an easy grader. But it is so much fun, you end up having great in-class conversations, and you get to write about whatever really weird and fun topics you feel like! You get a lot of wonderful feedback on your writing, and the class is just a great environment.",
    "N\/A",
    "If you can get in, take it. Syllabus seems demanding but its great to do the homework so it never feels like its as much of a chore as other classes. Professor Wepler has an absolutely airtight class.",
    "It was fun and it was a lot of work but in the end I enjoyed it! Plus, Prof. Wepler puts in the time to respond to everything we put out, sending back comments and meeting with us etc.",
    "Yes. If you are willing to put in the time that this course requires, it is incredibly rewarding. This was one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Yale and I would recommend it to anybody interested in humor.",
    "Yes. This is probably the most fun you will ever have in an intensive writing course.",
    "Absolutely. Take this course. It's a ton of writing but definitely worth it. You'll get better, the readings are awesome, and if anything you'll get a good laugh out of class.",
    "Yes"
