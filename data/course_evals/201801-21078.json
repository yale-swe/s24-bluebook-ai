    "I had a wide survey of different types of French literature across centuries. I learned about their characteristics and their particular historical and social background. I learned how to analyse and appreciate French literature. And most importantly, the extensive reading has enhanced my French ability by a large extent.",
    "By taking this course, I expanded on my previous knowledge of French literature and essay writing. This class was a lot of fun because I got to read really interesting texts and practice my French. In addition, I feel like my French writing & analysis significantly improved by taking this class.",
    "This course was very helpful both in terms of speaking practice (discussions in class) and understanding French literature."

    "Covered great material and really enjoyed the discussion about the material",
    "Professor Pinzka is absolutely amazing!! She engages students to discuss in a meaningful way, encourages all of us to speak up, and provides insights that are incredibly inspiring. I don't think there is any weakness in this course - the reading and homework load might seem a bit overwhelming at first but you get used to it, and I can assure you it is definitely worth the effort because the more you put it the more you take away.",
    "Strengths of this course include the small size and engagement of the class; everyone in the class participated and made discussions interesting. Weaknesses of this course include imbalanced reading loads, but that's to be expected for every literature class."
