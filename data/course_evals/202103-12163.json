                "I gained an awareness of biology at the molecular level, especially relating to an idea we talked about in class, called molecular empathy. I gained critical thinking skills, especially because of the Mathematica-based problem sets.",
                "I learned a ton about biophysics, statistics, and coding.",
                "Understanding of a wide range of experimental techniques; computational skills needed to analyze experimental data; a ton of practice with coding on Mathematica; analyzing real datasets; thinking about how to collect real data",
                "I learned how to think about how biological systems at the molecular level more intuitively: learned about diffusion, how equilibria can be used to think about not just chemical reactions, but variation in different states of a molecule (e.g. isomerization or binding), we learned about how binding occurs at the molecular level (e.g. receptor ligand binding), technique that can be used to quantify binding, and how to conceptually break down complex cases of multi-ligand binding, an introduction to kinetics, a brief overview of statistics for biological applications, and single molecule experimental methods. Additionally, the course taught how to use Mathematica (i.e. coding) to solve, bootstrap, and approach data analysis and complex problems that would be difficult and strenuous to do by hand. Overall, this course provided a fantastic overview of biophysics, important foundational concepts that occur and underpin later course material (e.g. biochemistry, higher level bio classes), with an interesting emphasis and exposure to new tools (e.g. coding where we learned how to fit data for unsimple cases, bootstrap statistics and confidence interval analysis, collected and analyzed lab data, ran a simple simulation of particles, etc.)",
                "All about how molecules function at the cellular level, their kinetics, molecular simulations and modeling, how to use Mathematica, some statistical analysis.",
                "Learned to use Mathematica, which while useful for the course itself, was not very useful outside of it. I hope in the future that Matlab will be taught instead.",
                "This course introduced me to the MB&B major. It provided a strong background in principles of biology, biochemistry, and biophysics that will be instrumental to me as an MB&B major. Likewise, taught many important quantitative reasoning skills.",
                "Learned about the basics of biophysics, especially what it is about.",
                "I developed an overall greater understanding of the discipline of biophysics and how it differs from related, but distinct disciplines (biochemistry, chemical biology, etc.), and I developed a greater appreciation for life at the molecular level. I also developed greater insight into the experimental methods commonly used in biophysics and the target measurements for common biophysical assays. As such, I developed greater insight into how biophysical experiments/data can be used to supplement experiments of disciplines under the umbrella of biophysics and disciplines adjacent to biophysics. I also gained preliminary understandings of the role and importance of computer simulations/molecular dynamics in biophysics and for determining characteristics of life at the molecular level. I gained a preliminary understanding of fluorescence spectroscopy in both theory as well as application, and I learned about various fluorescence-based techniques to obtain biophysical measurements. Lastly, I gained a preliminary working knowledge of Mathematica and its functionalities, and I learned how to conduct basic statistical analyses using Mathematica's coding platform.",
                "I think this class was a great introduction to many biophysical concepts! We covered a little bit of everything, from diffusion within molecules to some statistical analysis, chemical equilibria, as well as the often overlooked pre-steady state equilibria. There were also some more specialized lectures about spectroscopy and some quantum concepts by Prof. Levine that were interesting. This class also utilizes the coding program Mathematica, which I think some people really gained an affinity for (I was not one of those people though).",
                "Introduction to concepts and techniques integral to biophysics. Gained a greater understanding and appreciation of biophysics as a discipline. Introduced students to Mathematica/coding and its utility for just about every area of scientific research. Learned how to read and analyze a scientific paper.",
                "I gained a good amount of insight into biology on a molecular scale, with more of an emphasis on physical aspects of biomolecules. The course was a great introduction into biophysics concepts, with some useful information on how to use Mathematica, a pseudo-coding program that has nice applications in the biosciences. I also learned a good deal about experimental methods for analyzing the topics that we discussed in class."

            "comments": [
                "Some of the strengths for this course are the reasonable workload, well thought-out assignments, and the clarity with which concepts were presented in lecture. Additional strengths of this course include the instructors' teaching, the availability of the Teaching Fellows and instructors to answer questions, and the variety of concepts present in lecture, from more theoretical concepts to more conceptual concepts.",
                "I really enjoyed the lectures in this class and the first half of the problem sets. I had more difficulty with the mathematica problem sets, as I had been unfamiliar with the coding system and coding in general. Perhaps more time spent on mathematica and statistics would have made solving the problem sets more smooth.",
                "Strengths: Amazing class! Professors did a great job making the material engaging and interesting. Problem sets were very helpful in re-enforcing the material. There was a ton of support always available both from the professors and the TAs. The relatively small class size also made for amazing interactions with classmates, and great friendships too! \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the Mathematica problem sets took a long long time, but it definitely helped us learn to code!",
                "The strength of the class was the way that it provided an overview of many important concepts in a fairly intuitive way, and that we were able to cover and learn so many new skills in such a short period of time. I also really appreciated how there course emphasized collaboration and was built on a fundamental value/premise on reasonable but thought provoking workthere were no gotcha questions, and the professors and TAs were very accommodating and willing to learn and work with you. I appreciated this and the community build element of the class. My only weakness for the course was that at certain moments it seemed like we were a little lost on course, but I think this had more to do with the fact this was the first time the course was being taught. No true complaintsthis was a fantastic course.",
                "The lectures were really interesting and kept us engaged. A weakness was that we did not learn all the things we were required to do on our homework assignments in Mathematica, so it took a lot of time and help to figure some things out.",
                "The strengths of this course were the lectures as they were very engaging. Weaknesses were the discussion sections and complete lack of office hours. Also it seemed a bit disorganized and the workload would fluctuate a lot towards the end of the semester. The workload especially during reading week was some of the worst Ive ever had, despite the class not having an exam.",
                "Strengths: Professors held fantastic lectures--probably my best at Yale. Class was structured well. Content was easily digestible.\r\nWeakness: First time teaching course so there were some hitches.",
                "well organized. able to meet fellow sophomores in the major. Able to interact with professors.",
                "Strengths: The professors truly want the students to do well in the course so they are very understanding and lenient with the grading. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The course is rather disorganized and the instructions are often unclear on psets and even exams. Though the instructors make up for it with the lenient grading.",
                "Strengths: This course exposes sophomore (and surrounding classes) undergraduates to specialized material that was otherwise not available to undergraduates until senior year. I believe this is extremely beneficial for a number of reasons. First, taking this course has the potential to change the course of multiple students' undergraduate education, as it did mine. The course goes in-depth into biophysical methods and theory in the first half of the semester, whereas the latter end of the course is more of a survey of spectroscopic techniques and basics of molecular dynamics simulations. While this latter end definitely brushes over a lot of things and is a bare-bones introduction to this side of the major, it is still beneficial for students to be exposed to these topics. After being exposed, they can then choose to explore these topics more in specialized classes found in the MB&B or Chemistry Departments. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Even though I did thoroughly enjoy the course, I did find it to have a fair bit of weaknesses, all said and done. First, I'd argue that the amount of statistical knowledge expected from us greatly exceeded the scope of the course, especially on the last problem set/lab report. I understand that part of the function of problem sets in this class was for continued learning, especially for Mathematica, but I do think asking us to determine a p-value just from bootstrapping is unreasonable when the conceptual interpretation of p-values was never really addressed in class (and in reality, we got one bare-bones lecture on statistics). My suggestion to address this is to either spend more class time going over statistical concepts or to make introductory statistics a prerequisite for the course. Additionally, I found the Mathematica instruction to be highly inaccessible at first, although this feeling subsided as the semester progressed. As someone who had not taken a computer science course since junior year of high school, a formal Mathematica instruction section, for those who felt underprepared when it came to Mathematica/coding generally, would have been extremely helpful (something more formal than the 7pm study halls on Tuesday's). Lastly, this course could perhaps benefit from a peer tutor or two so that all of the onus to answer questions about the problem set does not fall on the instructors or the teaching assistants. Generally, more office hours at accessible hours would also have been helpful throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: THE PROFESSORS. Especially Enrique De La Cruz. His lectures were so engaging, and he kept the classroom environment so open to questions and further exploration of the topics. But all professors involved in the course were really very focused on us genuinely learning and absorbing the material. They didn't care about us rote memorizing anything like a lot of other classes at Yale, but really wanted us to just understand the underlying concepts. The midterm exam was very fair as well. The professors also strongly encouraged us to work in groups (you couldn't do the psets alone) and get to know one another personally, stressing that science is a collaborative field that is made so much more meaningful by interactions with your colleagues. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The coding required of us... This class uses a language called Mathematica for many of the problem sets, and sometimes it was just near impossible to figure out. Even going to every possible office hours, pset questions would sometimes take 5-10 hours out of the week, and often you wouldn't even completely understand why you were doing what you were doing. I think some people got better at it than others, but on the whole this was the one downside of the class.",
                "The instructors really care to see that students are understanding the material. The teaching fellows/assistant were amazing, always willing to help and always able to re-explain concepts in a useful and meaningful way. While some of the concepts seemed pretty different from any other topics covered in other science classes I've taken up to this point, the professors always made sure to reinforce key concepts through problem sets. I very much appreciated how much emphasis was put on collaboration. I wish that lectures were recorded; being able to re-watch lectures is especially helpful because I always feel like I learn something new/catch something I missed during live lecture and solidify what I already know by re-watching lectures. I also would have liked more practice problems to be done/worked through during class.",
                "This is a really great course! I think dividing the class between 3 professors is really effective. I learned a lot from each and, considering this class is one of the first MB&B classes you can take, it's a great introduction to the department. Each of the instructors is truly so kind and encouraging, especially Professor Miranker. I don't think I've ever had instructors and TAs who are so considerate about our workload and stress.\r\nFurthermore they have a great philosophy about teaching and it really shows. They believe that exams should be written to be doable and that a curve should not be necessary, that exams should be well-written so a curve isn't necessary. This made the class way less stressful. Instead of looking at a C+ and having to remember it would eventually curve to a B, my grade was more or less accurate. Examples of the entire teaching staff's kindness include: I miswrote something on an exam and still got points because it was clear I understood the concept, they changed around the final exam upon realizing they were asking a lot of us, Zion stayed after her assigned discussion section each week to help us with Mathematica and other PSet questions even though she didn't have to. The instructors and TAs for this class really made an enjoyable experience and I learned so much from them.",
                "Weaknesses: I think, for its first offering, this course was pretty solid! One weakness of the course would be the discussion sections, in that they felt pretty unstructured, and the full hour was unnecessary, in my opinion. \r\nStrengths: The group nature of problem sets was a huge factor in the course's success. I think the opportunity to collaborate and share ideas was helpful to my understanding of the material. I also appreciated the change in the final exam format from exam-based to PSET-based. Lastly, the professors of the course were really great, and their personalities added a lot to the course as well!"

Although this course fulfills an MB&B major requirement, I believe many people would benefit from taking this course, if they have satisfied the prerequisites. I learned to think of concepts happening at the molecular level that I didn't have an understanding of before taking this course.",
                "Absolutely, I had fun and learned a lot in the process.",
                "Yes! I think this was a terrific course! There is such a great sense of community fostered by this class -- so much support and guidance offered by the professors and the TAs, and collaboration is 1000% encouraged on problem sets which made for some terrific discussions. Also a great class because the material spans a wide range of topics, both experimental and computational. Take this class as soon as possible if you know you are an MB&B major (sophomore year is best!). It helps introduce you to so many important and interesting concepts!",
                "Yes wholeheartedly, especially if you have any interest in biology!! I loved the way the course was taught, the way the professors engaged the students, and their emphasis on collaboration! The class is built to facilitate interaction and engagement with the material and thinking. And the class was centered on our learning (and in that way did not feel punitive, but rather encouraging). I also found the material quite enlightening and thought provokingit shed a new angle on how to think about biology, biological systems, and chemistry.",
                "Yes if you are an MB&B major or prospective MB&B major because it is a really interesting biophysics course. I enjoyed it despite not being a big fan of biophysics in the past.",
                "I wouldnt recommend this course to anyone outside the MB&B major.",
                "Yes. A great introduction to the MB&B major. The professors were extremely supportive, and they wanted to see you succeed.",
                "If you are an MB&B major or plan to take P-chem at some point, this course seems to prepare you for some of the ideas that will be introduced later in P-chem. There were definitely some inconsistencies/interruptions in the course since this was the first time the course was taught in this format, however this will probably be improved overtime. Also, if you do not have any coding experience, doing the PSETs in Mathematica could oftentimes be very confusing and time consuming, but going to the office hours and study hall would help clear up some of this confusion. Overall, all the professors seemed passionate about the subjects they taught and this created an enjoyable atmosphere in the classroom.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in MB&B",
                "Yes as the content is interesting. Though be wary of the fact that the course isn't exactly cohesive (but I presume this would be changed as this was the first year the course was taught)",
                "Yes! Great professors, really engaging lectures, a lot of opportunities to work with other students in the class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It covers very interesting content and offers exposure to biophysics, a discipline that I honestly never knew about and probably would have never formally encountered in an academic sense if I had not come to Yale. This introductory-level course reveals that biophysics, which seems and sounds intimidating from afar, is approachable and useful to everyone and anyone interested in learning about it.",
                "Definitely! It's really interesting and it's refreshing to take a small STEM course because most of the intro classes first years and sophomores take are much bigger lectures where the prof never learns your name.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to all prospective MB&B majors! It was an awesome introduction to some of the professors and the major's interests. It was especially nice to learn under Professors Miranker, De La Cruz, and Levine, since they were all so knowledgeable and kind. The material was never too hard to digest (if anything, sometimes it felt a little too dumbed-down), and the work was never too overwhelming. It's so important to collaborate on the PSETS, so just keep that in mind they would have been tough without it, especially the coding-based simulation ones."
