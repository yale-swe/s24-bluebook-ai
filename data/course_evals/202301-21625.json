Leaving Yale and entering the \"real world\" is a bit terrifying, but this course helped me discover what matters most to me -- and that knowledge will guide me as I move onto the next stage of life. I also met many wonderful people in this course, people I now call my friends. We had countless about not just the readings, but our personal visions of a life worth living. It was beyond enriching, and each of our three essays (Yale's vision of a life worth living, our peers' visions, and our own visions) helped me reflect on what matters in life. I adored this course. Thank you to everyone who made it possible.",

It also gave me significant perspective on what other people find meaningful and made me appreciate various other belief systems more, which I found surprising as someone who considers themselves not at all religious. One of the best courses I got to take at Yale, particularly good as a last semester senior course.",
