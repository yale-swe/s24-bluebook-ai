Prof very supportive.\r\nWeaknesses  sometimes class got a little long without a break but not really a weakness. Had a little trouble sometimes knowing if I really understood the content from the journals so maybe mid-semester feedback would be nice!",
                "strengths --> great environment and supportive. classes and content was pretty simple, which I liked\r\nweaknesses --> classes felt very similar each week, not much difference in classes. there were different guest speakers each week but it followed the same format which can be boring sometimes",
                "The readings were a lot and often were dense.",
                "Strengths - the most iconic teaching team! Professor Reid is an angel and Faith and Rebecca were both incredible TA's! Also the guest lectures were so cool and exposed me to so many interesting and new areas of performance studies that I had never heard of before--and now want to explore further. I hope with further interations of the class, there would be opportunites to do more fields trips/site visits/workshops with the artists or performance scholars who visit or are talked about. Weaknesses - the weekly discussion posts were often a bit stressful due to their length and the amount of reading required to complete them. Perhaps a lighter reading load or a shorter discussing length requirement would make things better.",
                "The structure and academic goals could be clarified early on, making it easier to comprehend such dense theoretical material.",
                "The course felt very unorganized, with not a lot of actual useful information. It was very concentrated on dance, which is not my area of interest within the TDPS major, so I felt like there wasn't a lot of academic benefit for me in the course. The 500 word weekly reading responses were way too long for an intro course, and section was really not necessary. The strengths of the course came in getting to meet other TDPS majors and faculty, and building those relationships throughout 111 was nice.",
                "The strengths of the course is that you are able to learn a broad range of information by the end of the course and are introduced to several different theories and scholars. A weakness is that it can feel like the course moves very fast and things may be confusing until time is spent organizing all of the different performance theories that have been introduced.",
                "The readings are very long, and it would be more productive to have shorter excerpts from the same sources. (I often found myself skimming.) It was sometimes unclear how what we were learning connected to theater and performance. \r\n\r\nThe organization of the course is great, and there is continuity between lectures."

                "No, but it is a prerequisite for the major. It has a lot of theory and readings about dance and performance and the theater world.",
                "I would if you are interested in getting a taste for performance studies or you are a Theater major, although it's not really as much about recommended as it is about required in that case. I really appreciated the direction Professor Reid took the class in, and I definitely learned a lot about performance as a mode of thinking. I also greatly appreciated a lot of the guest lectures, especially those that centered our own questions and opinions and worries about making art in the world. I thought the class was pretty good overall, and I feel it will only get stronger over time, especially with Professor Reid at the helm.",
                "Yes, I would. It is an opportunity for theater makers to interact and learn about material that they may not otherwise come upon, and it is instrumental to expanding the performance mindset to interact with so many different instances of theater.",
                "It's a great introduction to performance theory if you are interested in the subject.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to students who are interested in the performance theory and scholarship side of theater studies.",
                "Only to a theater major (or someone very interested in the politics of performance). I felt like there was a lot of busywork involved, so someone who didnt have the incentive of the major wouldnt want to do the weekly writing."
