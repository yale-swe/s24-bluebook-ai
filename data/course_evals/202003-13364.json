                "It is really awesome to hear Professor Bracken's insights on many emerging national security topics. The readings were relevant and interesting. The course was a little unstructured, but it allowed opportunities to have discussions and ask questions.",
                "The course covered some very interesting topics, but I felt a lot of class time was occupied with questions from students that didn;t necissarily pertain to th content that was being discussed in class, which became annoying at times.",
                "Very interesting and technical view of management and leadership, crossing lessons from the military and business. As a non-econ yale college student with no experience with business, some of the management\/consulting\/econ material went way over my head. This material wasn't super central to the course or critical on exams though, so it was ok. The military, tech, history material provided interesting insights into the defense world.",
                "Fantastic course. Bracken is a gem. Could be improved by more feedback throughout the semester to grasp how much you are absorbing but overall great course",
                "Strengths are the professors knowledge. Weaknesses are disorganization. The midterms and finals often have very tricky questions that are hardly discussed in the class. Some of the class terms are very vague without clear definitions.",
                "I loved how we went through each era and discussed the development of tech. I think if we went deeper into present day, I wouldve liked the latter part of the semester a bit more."
