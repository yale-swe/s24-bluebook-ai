                "This was my least favorite history seminar I've taken at Yale, and maybe even my least favorite class. There was no context or background information given for any of the readings, so we'd be reading about something really niche and specific with no background information. During the seminar Prof. Antonov often went on random tangents and recommended extra reading that had little to do with the material. We got no grades or feedback throughout the course because I guess the only graded assignment is the final paper, which is 18-20 pages. There's no actual assignment for the final paper, just that it has to be 18-20 pages, so I didn't know if I was supposed to be making an argument or compiling literature or what. I did almost all of the reading but don't feel like I learned anything, and I dreaded going to class each week.",
                "Strengths: good course material, time range is not long enough so you can follow along\r\nweaknesses: could use more of a textbook style reading just to give an overview for students that are not totally up to date on the basics",
                "The frequency with which we met was a weakness, but the teacher was a strenghht",
                "Strengths: Interesting material and readings;  organized assignments\r\nWeaknesses: Discussions are unstructured and frequently people talk over one another; little feedback is given on assignments over the course of the term, making it difficult to assess how you are doing",

                "I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone, even if you're very interested in the topic. It was incredibly boring, I didn't get any feedback, and I don't feel like I've learned anything despite having done all the readings. The topic for each week was confusing. The final paper didn't come with any instructions. I have no idea how I'm going to do in the class, having received no feedback on anything. Prof. Antonov is slow to respond to emails, misses appointments, and is generally difficult to access outside of class.",
                "I would recommend this class to a student that is really interested in Imperial and Soviet Russian history with a foundation of knowledge that is looking to garner more expertise.",
                "Yes, Prof. Antonov is one of the best history professor I have had and the class covers a crucial period in Russian history from a variety of perspectives otherwise overlooked by academia.",
                "Maybe. It's interesting material, and if you know how to approach the research assignment, it should not require a super heavy workload. That said, I felt that the discussions were too unstructured and too little feedback was given over the course of the term. This made it difficult for me to gauge my progress and hurt my satisfaction with the course."
