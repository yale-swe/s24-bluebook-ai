In addition, by learning some new concepts such as kernels, soft threshold, glasso, and attention, I know the wide application and power of various machine learning methods.

                "Pros: Professor John comes up with many examples full of insight and heuristics which leaves a deep impression on me. I like the blackboard derivation very much. Also, the Python codes provided by him are most helpful. \r\n\r\nOne thing I think needs to be improved is that the professor could talk about the development orientation and direction of these machine learning methods. I sometimes talk with som PhD students who come from CS majors and statistics majors about how to innovate these relatively widely used models, but I don't think they could reach a consensus on the topic.",
                "The strengths are Prof. Lafferty and his expertise. The professor is one of the leading ML researchers in the world and it is an honor to take a class with him. The TA's and TF's are wonderfully bright and they help students keep up in the course during office hours.",
                "great",
                "The course is not too theoretical and is very applicable",
                "Strengths: we try many different techniques and see their results. The professor is clearly passionate about the field.\r\nWeaknesses: gets very theoretical at certain point, like with reproducing kernel hilbert spaces and dirichlet process mixtures. Some students found it difficult to see how this could be applied to the industry.",
                "This class has many weaknesses. Unfortunately not that many strengths. \r\n\r\nUnlike other courses in the stats department, the field is very young, so there is not much standardization, or even many resources online that are accessible to someone who has the course prerequisites. This class ends up devolving into notation hell, and takes concepts from many other advanced math\/statistic fields e.g. measure theory, functional analysis, information theory, stochastic processes to try to explain the concepts. If I didn't have such a strong math background, I would have actually drowned in the complexity of topics. \r\n\r\nAlso, the course doesn't seem to have a clear objective. Only in the last lecture did Prof. Lafferty explain what the goal was: for him to be a sommelier of ML concepts. You taste a lot, but you really don't come to really appreciate or learn well any of the concepts. I did not expect nor wanted this course to be a survey course. \r\n\r\nGrading on exams are especially tough and oddly distributed, so even though you understand most of the course, you can still get your grades destroyed. Some very minor questions become worth a letter grade, while more complex problems are worth less than 3% of the grade. \r\n\r\nIf I were to give it one strength, I'd say it's the humor of this class. The captions and examples were amusing, but not enough for me to enjoy the course.",
                "This course covers a lot of material. It was hard to keep up at times. Overall, I think it's a good course!",
                "Strengths - This course covers a LARGE breadth of concepts in machine learning--many of which are very new and hard. The number of assignments and quizzes is reasonable and the overall course structure is good.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The course is very advanced and I feel like the recommended pre-requisites were not sufficient. In sum, this class covered topics that--to fully master and believe the material--required advanced linear algebra (at the level of S&DS 312), a foundation in probability theory and theory of statistics (S&DS 241\/242), introductory machine learning (S&DS 265), a general understanding of graph theory (MATH 244), some background in information theory (S&DS 364), and stochastic processes (S&DS 352). \r\n\r\nI would also say that many of the slides provided by Professor Lafferty were good but it was hard to find the main takeaway messages. I wished there was greater expansion of these takeaway messages\/big picture ideas.",

I liked the way the course was organized, with homework being weighted higher than exams, and I found the quizzes very helpful in checking understanding of the content. It did seem like a lot of content was covered in one semester, and perhaps some sections could have been their own stand-alone courses. All-in-all though, this and iML were genuinely some of the most interesting and rewarding (and also challenging) courses I've taken at Yale, and I'm honestly a bit sad the sequence is coming to an end.",
                "strengths: ML is super interesting and relevant; assignments are mostly interesting and demonstrate how the algos with well; TA staff is super helpful\r\n\r\nweaknesses: lecture would get high level too fast sometimes; would have been nice to have practice quiz questions",
                "a lot of methods were talked about but if there's more focus on theory behind algorithms, that will be great.",
                "Strengths: the first half of the semester, where we covered different types of regression and also nonparametric approaches to regression and density estimation. We went appropriately deep into these concepts, such that I would feel comfortable working with these topics on my own in the future.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the second half of the semester, where we covered different types of reinforcement learning methods and sequence learning methods. I felt that we only received a very elementary introduction to these issues. Prof. would sometimes go into the weeds in the math but not spend enough time there. Basically there was too much breadth and not enough depth in these topics. I leave the class feeling like I would recognize the names of the methods and vaguely know a couple things about each, but I would not feel comfortable working with them on my own or even in a different S&DS class. I would have preferred learning about just a couple of them and really mastering them.",
                "The material in the course is super confusing and not explained very well, in my opinion. there are a lot of very abstract and complicated statistical models that the course covers that would need prerequisites far beyond what is asked. This makes it hard to get a lot out of the class. That being said, the problem sets are not hard (a lot of copying and pasting demo code) and graded easily; the exams are hard, but also graded easily. \r\n\r\nOne thing that I will say is that the course staff was great - very helpful and always open to suggestions and to give extra help.",
                "Strengths include the overall choice of topics, problem sets, the quizzes to ensure we were following the material. I think presenting some topics with a little more mathematical structure could be helpful and then move provide intuitive explanations and demonstrations (e.g., defining a Dirichlet process formally first, before showing demos and showing prior vs. posterior). What would be helpful is if the TAs held an additional session to explain topics from a different perspective. The explanations about VAEs could have been clearer - the fact that it was voted off the final as a topic speaks to people's lack of understanding, even though there were deeper, more difficult topics such as Dirichlet processes. The demos shown in class including some of the online resources were quite helpful.",
                "strengths: extremely cooperative professor and TF \r\n\r\nweakness: I didn't find any weakness on the class",

                "I really like the code demo professor put in class. I think the class is perfect and professor Lafferty is able to explain concepts clearly .",
                "Strengths: some of the pset questions were interesting and I appreciated the more applied aspects, although they were rare. Weaknesses: almost all the material in the first semester was extremely theoretical\/ proof-based and not in an accessible way. Even on the most basic level, oftentimes terms were not defined or set in context so it was very difficult to understand; when we started proving something it wasn't clear what we were proving or why; and when he moved from step to step in the proofs he very rarely explained the justification. I think Lafferty has dealt so closely in these subjects for so long that he has no concept of the fact that almost everything he says is totally unmoored from what we are familiar with, and doesn't realize the extent of the contextualization and explanation we need.",
                "I know this isn't an applied class, but I think it would be helpful to see a few more applications of some of the methods just to get a sense of the sorts of situations in which each are appropriate. For the neural network methods this is more obvious, but it's less clear for things like Bayesian methods.",
                "Too technical and detailed right away. Lost sight of the big picture often. Professor paced the class for grad students leaving many undergrads scrambling to catch up.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Lafferty and Wendy are ridiculously smart and helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Every time the professor said \"this will not show up on the exam\", it showed up in the exam.",

                "Strengths: problem sets reasonable, professor very kind + knowledgeable \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class moved WAY too quickly and covered an enormous amount of material in only one semester. It felt like I was not prepared at all for this class despite meeting all of the prerequisite.",
                "Love the teaching team.\r\nIf the math part on the board could be delivered in a clearer way I think would be more helpful.",
                "Lectures are really good.",
                "The psets and lectures were excellent and direct. The office hours and the quizzes helped with keeping up in the course, which I greatly appreciated.",
                "Strengths: I think Professor Lafferty made an effort to include methods that are near the cutting edge of what's going on in machine learning today. I enjoyed the assignments as well, thought they were a lot of work! They did a great job of consolidating material from the course and making sure students had a good understanding. I also thought the quiz questions were fantastic and did a great job of solidifying understanding (often included really simple examples of concepts to make sure you could apply them). To improve, I honestly think there should be more quizzes, maybe 1 per week, but lower the weighting in the overall grade to 5% (could add the other 5% to the assignments?). This would be a great way to have them be low stress, but also a great way to solidify concepts. I often didn't even know what I didn't understand until I took the quiz and didn't know what I was doing on some of the questions! Not all material was able to be covered on the quizzes, but I would have benefited from a similar style of question. Another option might be to include optional quiz-style questions on the off weeks. Having practice exams was also really helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course needs to embed discussions of ethics more directly. I was disappointed, as it's clear Prof Lafferty is thinking about the topic (he hosted a talk with Brian Christian on his book, The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values, which discusses some of these issues. We had exactly 1 homework question that even began to explicitly touch on this. Given the ubiquity of machine learning in industry today, it's important students are aware of these issues when applying the methods. Unfortunately, the S&DS major doesn't have an ethics requirement (and it's not even possible to count any ethics course towards the degree). Given this, I think it must be incorporated into the course itself. Lectures were not always the most engaging, in my opinion. The most memorable classes were those with demos at the forefront (and I'm not even talking about Python code demos, the dirichlet process stick-breaking with the spaghetti was SO helpful and really memorable!).",
                "The course gives a great theoretical base. Some more effort could be given to the practical implementations of many of the methods, especially the bayesian ones.",
                "The strengths of the course were many. Professor John Lafferty it was fantastic, and all of the TAs and ULAs were great too. The coursework was very interesting and instilled a strong knowledge of machine learning. There were very few if no weaknesses to this course.",
                "This class is a comprehensive survey of the techniques used to approach statistical machine learning problems. It's strength is providing a strong theoretical foundation paired with programming assignments that allow students to gain practical experience.\r\n\r\nHowever, the material is oftentimes very dense and difficult to follow, even with a strong math background in statistics and computer science. Studying with a group and regularly consulting peers is an almost necessity to gain any semblance of true comprehension. In order to do well in the class, it does not take significantly more time than other high-level STEM classes. If you would like to truly understand everything, it will require a great deal of effort.",
                "I think the course thrives in its assignment. Instead of a final, it may be good to have a final project.",
                "The assignments were great practice, lectures were well organized and the exams tested our knowledge and understanding well.",
                "It both",
                "Strength: Clear logic, wide coverage, advanced knowledge, containing both theory and intuitive understanding\r\n\r\nWeakness: The explanations for linear regression and CNN are a little bit redundant. (that's might because I have done some research on these topics and know them well) I would like to reduce these parts to save time to get a more detailed explanation of the topics after the midterm.",
                "I feel like some of the more technical\/conceptual ideas are not very well explained. It would be helpful if we had more clear notations regarding exactly what we are defining and trying to compute. Moreover some of the notations\/approach are a little inconsistent between notes, lectures and TA officer hours",
                "It is sooooo hard",
                "The course covers many popular topics in machine learning, including both supervised and unsupervised machine learning and also some reinforcement learning. The assignments and quizzes are interesting and helpful for understanding the concepts.",
                "Prof. Lafferty needs to be able to explain the concepts in a simpler and clearer way. I think the main points and how different points connect together get lost. It takes a lot of time to slowly piece together the scattered bits of information he talks about during lectures. Wendy, the TF, is the greatest strength of the course. Her review session slides make the concepts so much simpler and more understandable. It's surprising how convoluted Lafferty's slides are.",
                "The instructor really puts students success first.",
                "It was difficult to take as someone without much of a stats and coding background, but this was in the prereqs. I would say if there could be more coding practice it would be great, as the assignment problems required very few lines of code and I would have benefitted from more coding practice."

                "Yes, it provides a unique experience to learn and use various ML techniques.",

                "Yes.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn a lot about ML and who is ready to be challenged.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, the material is very useful",
                "NO! Please do not take this course. It's a shame that Sekhar is being obstinate and requiring this course for the BS. This will become the CS323\/CS365 weeder that the CS department has, but it's taught worse and it's not (really) necessary for modern statistics. A new generation of S&DS majors will suffer, just like I have. Think 20+ hours a week of work (if you actually want to understand the concepts). \r\n\r\nI'd recommend this class to the following student: someone who has taken measure theory, functional analysis, information theory, algorithms, and stochastic processes. (if you don't even know what these things are, then good luck!) Fortunately, I had a strong enough math background to parse through much of the concepts that included these topics, but often times, I'd just be overwhelmed on how much advanced math there is in this class. It's really cool to understand all of this, and to see these recondite concepts being applied to something very useful, but it's definitely way above the actually prereqs for the course. I doubt many stats majors going into this class will feel very comfortable with many of the topics. Perhaps the grad students were okay with them. \r\n\r\nHonestly, this class has turned me off from ML. I thought it was really cool, but after this class, I think I learned I should pursue something else. It's a lot of working through the notation, trying to understand the concepts at a high level, then not really knowing how to implement it or how it actually works. It feels like an intro course since a lot of the concepts are hand-waved away and you as a student must accept it as truth. Felt kind of bad, but perhaps the engineers in this class are used to it.\r\n\r\nI know there are going to be some very positive reviews of this class on coursetable, but I challenge to go up to any of them and ask how to implement a GRU from scratch with the neural net. Or even a CNN (without tensorflow packages). They won't know. Those people who enjoyed this class are those who put in minimal effort (the psets don't take super long if you go to office hours and find the right portion in the demos) and luckily got an \"easy A\", whilst being satisfied with not knowing much about ML. If you actually are trying to scratch beneath the surface a bit (only just a bit), then the course becomes behemoth to conquer. \r\n\r\nAlso note: it's not easy to get an A in this class unlike what you may hear (I doubt people will be saying this after this iteration of the course). There are a lot of wild card questions on the exam which can propel someone with little knowledge to an A range with just a little luck and put someone who understands the concepts well at an F with just a bit of bad luck. A high type II error if you ask me. If you're a gambler, I guess you can take your chances! Yay probability and random chance for grades! Maybe they should sample from a multinomial distribution and gives us our grades that way. \r\n\r\nGrades aside, this class is a time sink. You can put in a lot of time, and end up getting very little out of it. I should have taken some other hard class, like CS366, where at least I know if I spent a lot of time, then I could walk away with a really good understanding of algorithms. \r\n\r\nPlease don't bother with this class. Those who are pursuing a BS should petition to Sekhar to not make this class a requirement. Or maybe, a new DUS will show up and remove this requirement. If he wants to require this class, I'd propose requiring S&DS 400 or 410. Those classes are a lot more crucial for grad school in my opinion. And students will get more from this. I took this class through my own volition, and I don't want others to be forced through this class.",
                "Yes! This is one of the more engaging and well-taught courses that I've taken in the S&DS department. I believe it'll also be required moving forward...",
                "Yes and no. Yes, if you want to learn advanced machine learning. No, because the material covered is so large in breadth and hard to completely follow. I spent in the ballpark of 20 hours a week reviewing the material and working on the problem sets. It is extremely demanding if you want to really learn the content!!",
                "While John is such a nice professor this class is the hardest class I've ever taken and I've taken Math 225. Unless you are interested in machine learning avoid it if you can.",
                "Definitely. Any course taught by Prof. Lafferty is great.",
                "yes",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes",

                "Honestly yes, and for students in all types of majors\/ programs, because ML touches on many different disciplines and there are interesting potential applications across various fields. I honestly wish I could re-take this course a few more times myself, because I would absolutely still learn new things each time, and the lectures always leave me feeling interested in and inspired by so many things related to how the world works. In recommending this course to other students, though, I'd include the caveats that my answers to the last two questions about intellectual challenge and workload were \"much greater\" relative to other courses I've taken at Yale.",
                "I'm not sure -- the content was very interesting but I felt confused most of the time and lectures felt hard to follow. The TAs, especially Wendy, were super helpful in answering questions though.",
                "Yes because it's a better S&DS course and the material is super fascinating, but with the caveat that there are some issues with the course. If you are not a math whiz, be prepared to go to office hours to get help on the math parts of the psets. The grad student population of the class will make it seem like more people know what's going than actually do, so don't be intimidated by them. Find a group to work on psets with -- that will pull you through.",
                "Yes. They will be introduced to a lot of topics tho.",
                "I would not recommend the course to someone looking for an applied cs-type course. The course is heavily based in statistics and statistical concepts - beware of this.",
                "I would recommend the course to students with some mathematical background (good grasp of probability, statistics, and linear algebra) who are interested in ML. Some of the topics are difficult to get a grasp on, but many are quite useful for ML applications and the course does a good job of introducing them.",
                "Yes if you like challenging yourself and are ready to put in the work",
                "Absolutely. This class, when taught by Prof. Lafferty, is so great. The material is so interesting and is presented very well. This is a wonderful class for learning machine learning techniques as well as the math behind them.",
                "If they love and understand machine learning.",
                "Yes. You will definitely learn a lot from this class if you want to do research in the future.",
                "Emphatically no. Honestly, RIP the S&DS students who will have this forced on them from here on out. As someone who has taken several high level stats courses as well as proofs based courses like discrete math and algos, I have NEVER been more confused by lectures in my life. The first semester especially was incomprehensible. I'm sure the math Lafferty's doing checks out, but it's not fun having proofs\/equations written out for you and processes dictated to you when you don't understand the parameters you're working with, where these equations fit into anything, and why they are necessary. There's a reason why, before the final, we still had basic definitional questions on Ed like \"so what is F0 exactly?\" And half the TFs were clearly as confused as the students.",
                "No. I found that the TA and YouTube videos about the topics are more useful than the actual lectures.",
                "Only if you have a really strong background in CS and math",
                "Only if you're REALLY willing to sit down and do the math.",
                "Yes! Take a class with John before you graduate. You will not regret it.",
                "Yes but only if you have already had a considerable amount of exposure to machine learning topics. It was extremely difficult for me to follow the material even after having taken all of the classes in the stats major.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, a brilliant course that put together many modern topics in machine learning",
                "Yes. I learned a lot.",
                "Absolutely. This course takes you closer to the cutting edge of ML than most courses offered here.",
                "Would recommend (and strongly if you're an S&DS major). That being said, I'd recommend coming into this course with a strong understanding of statistics (at the level of S&DS 242 or higher, or be willing to put additional work in to learn) in order to have the best experience. It was definitely a lot of work (~15-20+ hours per homework assignment for me, but I s'pose there were only 4 of them). I found the exams challenging as well. I thought the homework assignments were really interesting, as well. I think Professor Lafferty taught the course well on the whole, but I have to give a big shout-out to the course TAs, especially Wendy. She was on Ed Discussion answering question and question promptly, especially in the lead-up to due dates and exams.",
                "If one is very interested in the mathematical theory behind modern machine learning, definitely (something CS470 [Artificial Intelligence] lacks). This course (esp. if taught by Lafferty) is very heavy on the math and statistics, so come prepared.",
                "Yes. This is a phenomenal coursewell taught, great material, lots of resources to facilitate learning.",
                "Great class. Would recommend for someone interested in machine learning and application in any discipline.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they are really interested in machine learning. Otherwise, it can quickly become a great deal of effort and time for a math-heavy course. A strong background in statistics and computer science will be a great boon for any prospective students because it helps clarify the math and assignments.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in machine learning, this class is a solid exposure to techniques beyond the common convolutional neural networks or deep learning frameworks that currently dominate. Even if you may not apply them on future problems, I think it is important to understand these techniques in order to be a well-rounded machine learning scientist.",
                "Yes, the teacher and staff were excellent.",
                "Yes, anyone who has a chance to take this class at Yale should take it. It is pretty challenging but we learn a lot a Professor Lafferty is such a great lecturer.",
                "Yes! it while displays the charm of machine learning, and also renders me rationales behind algorithm.",
                "Definitely yes. This course includes many topics I was wondering for a long time, but these is no other course discuss about them in detail (like variational inference, non-parametric Bayesian method and reinforcement learning). Besides, this course can also serve as a great introduction to other more topics in ML.",
                "Yes for those who want to know more about machine learning; A good course for a broad survey into each of the topics.",
                "I think its a good course but have the potential to be much better",
                "yes",
                "Yes definitely, if you're into machine learning and want to learn some really cool (albeit difficult) topics this is for you.",
                "You get an overview of several aspects of current machine learning algorithms.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in machine learning. I think this course covers many interesting and popular topics in the field of machine learning. The quizzes and assignments are interesting to do.",
                "No. Do not take it unless you need to for your major. The topics that you learn in this course are not practical for the normal person. When one thinks about \"machine learning\", the first thing that comes to mind is not Dirichlet mixture processes. If you really want to learn machine learning, S&DS 265 or the CS department ML course will be more practical.",
                "Yes, the course is a little challenging, but it teaches a lot of important ML concepts.",
                "Definitely! Fantastic course, professor and TA's were phenomenal, and required work\/structure of course was excellent."
