                "Strengths: This course is incredibly information dense, and if you keep up with the content, you will learn a lot just by virtue of being around professor Klein, who is incredibly knowledgeable and kind. The readings and writings are long and will force you to work hard and you'll learn to write long, information-dense papers. I actually felt like a historian taking this class and I am far from being a history major!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I was caught off guard by the enormous workload of the course, the readings were long and the papers took a lot of time, especially around finals period. The readings amount to such a large amount of content that it's very hard to focus, and the discussions thus are very dense."

                "Absolutely. Hard class though, but Professor Klein's really good at leading discussions.",
                "I recommend this course to any student interested in American history with regards to labor and civil rights movements, housing, urban environments and the division between capital, people, and the government. Regardless of what you're interested in regarding urban history, it will likely be covered in this class -- as well as a bunch of other things, so be incredibly careful. Maybe take this class during a lighter semester. It's incredibly content and information dense, readings are difficult and the writings are not easy either. It's an incredibly difficult class, but incredibly rewarding -- I enjoyed it even though I struggled a lot.",
                "I wouldn't recommend this course unless you are willing to put in 2-3x the amount of work you'd normally put in for a history seminar."
