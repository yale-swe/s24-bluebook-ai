Additionally, this class was very helpful to me in learning how to write an empirical research paper  I had never written one before and it is a different sort of animal. Having the guidance and structure of this class was very helpful in that process.",
                "I learned how to more critically analyze the role religion plays in politics. Importantly, I've learned that there is a difference between religious identification and personal religiosity, and that one must specify what exactly they mean by religion/religious when making an argument. I've also learned about different religious traditions, even though this was not the focus of the course. Another incredibly important skill I've gained through the course is learning how to critically engage with texts and challenge claims authors make."

                "No complaints!",
                "Really great, diverse readings. Great discussion and feedback from students. No real complaints",
                "Prof. Baldwin forces you to engage with the content, requiring you to either lead a discussion or write a reading response every other weak. Even though this is a big part of your grade, it's essentially graded for completion and just a good way  to make sure you're on top of your readings and engaged without being too stressful. It's a great system. She also includes little lectures so you're actually learning from her expertise instead of just participating in a socratic seminar, which is great. The feedback part of the course, where we read eachother papers wasn't particularly useful though.",
                "Strengths: Professor Baldwin is so kind and lovely. She really wants you to thrive and succeed and structures her class to make that happen. As someone who was newer to the research paper processes, this class was great. She devotes a lot of the class to preparing for the final paper  in fact, the entire class is structured in a way that helps you write your final paper. That way, youre not thrown into the deep end without any plan. I really appreciated that. \r\nWeaknesses: I cant really think of any. It was an enjoyable class.",
                "The clear strength of this course was the effort invested in helping students to refine their approaches to the end-of-term paper. A wonderful class for those interested in pursuing meaningful research.",
                "Professor Baldwin is a huge strength. She's incredibly knowledgable on the topic and facilitates classroom discussions in such a way that there's very little awkward silences, and everything flows smoothly. I thought the response papers were another strength; having to choose which dates to submit a paper at the beginning of the semester made it so much easier for me to space out work and not get overwhelmed towards the end. The entire structure of the final paper process was also a huge strength, especially the workshops towards the end where we get feedback from our peers. I also thought it was a huge plus that the last two weeks of the class had no readings and were dedicated solely towards our papers; it made everything much more manageable. There are no major weaknesses I can think of; the only one I can think of is that sometimes, since there wasn't a specific number of questions the lead discussant had to ask, we would spend a lot of the time on the first discussant's questions and relatively lesser time would be left for the last."

                "Yes, it was super interesting and engaging",
                "If you want to learn how to write a research paper, there's no better courseProfessor Baldwin is excellent at walking you through how to write an empirical-style paper. However, if you're looking to learn about material and not the process of writing, it's probably not the best course. It's really great if you're preparing for grad school and if you're an upper level student and you've figured out the topics you're interested in.",
                "Yes, although I wouldnt recommend it for everyone. There is a big focus on the empirical study of religion and politics (obviously), so if you arent super jazzed by empirics, religion, and politics, dont take it. That sounds obvious, but think about it before taking the class, cause otherwise you will be bored if its not your cup of tea.\r\n\r\nOne other good thing! She does a lead discussant system where you are in charge of discussion for one of the readings twice a semester. That is actually very helpful, because you obviously focus on doing those two readings, but then know there will be someone else leading on all the others, so there is less stress.",
                "Yes! I think it's a great seminar, if you're able to get in. Professor Baldwin is a phenomenal instructor and you get a lot of feedback! The class atmosphere is fairly comfortable and encouraging. You learn a great deal about religion and its role in politics from lenses that are typically overlooked in mainstream media."
