   "comments": [
    "I learned about political and historical thought mostly in Greece and Rome from around 300 BCE to 1200 CE.",
    "I learned to analyze texts in depth and derive meaning from seemingly insignificant passages.",
    "I developed the skills to tackle thinking about big historical and philosophical questions by using small scale pieces of evidence and arguments.",
    "How to think critically about a historical\/political writing as well as how to write an essay in a short timespan.",
    "Knowledge: ancient Greek and Roman history, the important stories referenced throughout writing of the Western world. Insights: New perspectives on democracy, on historical thought. Skills: reading closely and quickly through huge swaths of text, writing quickly, writing well.",
    "I learned about a mixture of political and historical thought starting from the foundation of Western thought. It's really nice to see an idea introduced in Plato and see it revisited by medieval scholars after a millennium. Studying this syllabus really integrated with the DS philosophy syllabus, really giving me the impression that I was getting excerpts from the entirety of intellectual history.",
    "I have developed a robust dabbling of political history and political philosophy in antiquity.",
    "Critical thinking and reading and writing skills",
    "Learned about some of the great thinkers on political philosophy",
    "I learned a LOT about early Western historical and political thought (Herodotus to Aquinas). Professor Garsten drops amazing insights in section (but he's never flashy about them), so I learned some good tidbits there. I learned how to read interesting texts for the most interesting bits (especially when I was short on time). I also feel like my paper-writing skills improved, even though they didn't improve a ton.",
    "I learnt how to write papers, how custom and rational thinking is parallel to the struggle of democracy and aristocracy."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is an excellent introduction to much early political thought. Additionally, the extra-curricular opportunities that students organized to relate the curriculum to the present day was very interesting and helpful. It might be nice to more openly and directly encourage placing the various authors in the course in conversation with each other.",
    "I think the strengths of this course consist in the seminar itself. We had really good discussion and Prof. Garsten was really good at directing without overwhelming the conversation.",
    "The strength of this course lies in its ability to bring together sources from the ancient and medieval world that pose questions still relevant to the current era and offer possible answers. There's a lot to explore in each work on its own, but the experience of all of them together is extremely rich. I particularly enjoyed the smaller (but important) stories in Livy, the Plutarch, Agricola, City of God, al-Farabi, and Aquinas.\r\n\r\nI would encourage the H&P professors to try to cut down the readings even further, since we only talk about certain moments in each text (and after a certain point, people give up on gigantic readings -- I think this issue was most pronounced for H&P). For example, after reading the summer reading on Herodotus, we were assigned to read Book 8, but never discussed it in class, which meant we didn't get much out of reading that portion. I understand it's difficult to strike a balance between assigning the most important parts and assigning coherent readings, and in allowing each student to choose what is most important to them, but I was frustrated at several points by the amount we read for the payoff we got from class. In general, it's hard to find relevance in historical details if they are not told in a way that adds to a larger vision -- for this reason, I would suggest removing a lot of the military history (especially in Herodotus and Thucydides, except when accompanied by the speeches in Thucydides, which are excellent). Herodotus and Thucydides could be frustrating for this reason. The Politics was more coherent, but there was too much of it to cover in a mere 3 classes. There was too much to read in City of God (some of it also seemed a little redundant). Guide of the Perplexed could have been cut down or given more class periods to discuss. It would be nice to have the electronic readings printed out in packets for us (it's difficult and costs money to print them ourselves).",
    "The seminar-style of this class is definitely a positive. It ensures that everyone is engaged and draws upon the different backgrounds of various students. Professor Garsten definitely provides a good balance, really allowing our discussions to become deeper and more complex while always keeping us on topic and giving mini-lectures if the topic or work is slightly more complicated.\r\nI would really recommend that DS H&P(T)  re-adopt Polybius into the syllabus again. The emphasis on fortune and factual history synthesizes Herodotus and Thucydides quite nicely, and Book VI with the Roman constitution gives a more concise and intuitive idea of the revolution of political systems and the concept of the mixed constitution, concepts that Aristotle covers in Politics. The idea of a Roman national character Polybius provides translates much better into Livy and Tacitus as well.",
    "It laid great focus on key ideas of the text while providing ample room for students to speak.",
    "My reading and discussion skills have been greatly improved but we go over the readings too fast and we dont really have time to digest",
    "I just don't like the things we read for this course. Not particularly interesting to me. But I think that's a personal thing.",
    "I appreciated our frequent focus on smaller passages and sections of the works we read, though I might have appreciated more structural and thematic connections in section. The lectures were usually phenomenal, and good handouts (shoutout to Professor Garsten's Aristotle handout) made a big difference. I feel like I am also not as qualified to respond to this question as others because I often did work for my other three classes before the reading for this one, and as a consequence had less command of the text and lower-quality citations than my peers. The reading load (especially for City of God) was quite heavy, which usually meant that I couldn't do it all; if that is by design, then that's perfectly fine. Overall, I feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to take this course.",
    "The large reading load means we don't always get to spend as much time discussing as I would like to, but this is pretty standard for a DS class. In general, the course is well structured in a way that makes the same themes come up again and again in reading."

    "Absolutely. Professor Garsten is really an excellent instructor and brings the syllabus to life. Perhaps the most important thing about the course is that you will get out of it whatever you put in. The readings are heavy and often dense, and often it seems like completing them is not necessary to doing relatively well in the class. While this may be true, the readings are the core of the instruction and the reason the course is compelling. Take the course if you want to read the works that have defined much of our history as a country and a force in the world. Then hold yourself accountable to reading them, for no reason other than they are important and fascinating books to read.",
    "Yes! Garsten is an AWESOME professor.",
    "Absolutely, I learned a lot and class was very fulfilling.",
    "In the context of recommending Directed studies to a student who seemed to be a good fit, I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes-Garsten is an amazing instructor.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to broaden their perspective on history and political systems (particularly our own democracy). I would warn people that if history is not their favorite subject, certain readings might feel a little pointless -- in this class, of the three DS classes, it felt particularly important to have a professor to point out key passages and what is relevant about the work. This course felt most rewarding at the end, after studying the texts in conversation with each other (before the end, I wasn't quite sure what I was getting out of a lot of it). For me, this was the most difficult class of the three.",
    "Get an education, so yes.",
    "I would, because professor Garstens techniques are helpful in developing ones writing skills and conceptual notions.",
    "Yes if you would like to do humanities",
    "Yes! Professor Garsten is a phenomenal professor and the syllabus is excellent from start to finish!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student, especially as taught by Professor Garsten. We read truly fantastic books, the section was vibrant and mind-opening, and the professor was exceptional. I would take this course just for Herodotus and Thucydides, and we get so much more!",
    "Yes, your life will be changed",
    "This turned out to be my favorite DS class, though I didn't expect that at first. Over and over again, I ran into subjects which were extremely relevant to politics today. It was fascinating to see how the issues and opinions we encounter today have existed for thousands of years, and it gave me insight into recurring political conflicts throughout history."
