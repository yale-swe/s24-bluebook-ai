                "I greatly improved my writing in this course. I also gained skill in close reading/analysis of media- especially video games (obviously), but also film, video, and news. I also learned a lot about lots of historical and cultural movements I'd never been able to study before, especially with respect to modern warfare.",
                "Through the course, I gained a profound understanding of various video game techniques by examining them through the focused lens of media analysis. This approach allowed me to closely scrutinize and interpret the nuanced production choices made by developers. Additionally, I honed my critical thinking skills, which became instrumental in dissecting and understanding the rationale behind the myriad of creative and technical decisions that arise during video game development. Furthermore, the course provided me with valuable insights into the synergistic relationship between art, technology, and narrative, culminating in a more nuanced view of how these fundamental elements blend together to craft and enhance the player's experience.",
                "The course really opened my eyes to the powerful possibilities of liberal arts education. Discussions in class among classmates of all backgrounds developed my understanding of field of media studies and Slavic culture and literature.",
                "Knowledge of how video games and culture have influenced one another, especially in sociopolitical contexts.",
                "As someone with extensive background in playing videogames as a child, I was pleasantly surprised to learn a multitude of skills involved in Ludology (i.e. study of video games). With topics ranging from narratology all the way to assessing video games both as art and a \"tool for change\", War Games will give you an opportunity to learn not just about really cool and obscure video games, but also how to close read both their gameplay and the implicit messages they hold within themselves. I also found myself becoming a much better researcher over the course of the semester, as I learned how to perform close reading of visual media, and eventually even perfoming interviews for my final research project.",
                "I really got to improve my analysis of socio-political messaging in media, learning how to view works as propaganda even when initially its political stance seems unclear.  I learned more about adaptation and how to comparatively analyze different works, along with learning tons about the game industry and its history with the military industrial complex.  I also improved my ability to analyze games in an academic context, something I have never done before and absolutely loved doing."

                "Strengths: discussions were incredible, variety of media was shown or discussed in class, tied all discussions of video games to broader cultural contexts, well-organized\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "This course is fantastic at taking things that interest many of us-- video games-- and using them as subjects of analysis in a way that actually means something. This means that most students will necessarily be engaged with minimum effort. The instructors are also incredible at making everyone feel involved and further engaged with the material, as well as making us feel supported w/ paper review meetings and plenty of office hour time. \r\nMy one suggestion would perhaps be for there to be a week of material that serves as a bit of a \"wrap-up\". While I learned a lot in this course, and I can't really come up with really pressing weaknesses, I'd really appreciate an extra week of discussion on why the issues we discussed matters, etc.",
                "There are far too little weaknesses and far too many strengths to include in this evaluation. Marijeta and Spencer are both incredibly compelling lecturers and deeply knowledgeable in their areas of research, which came to an enthralling and immersive fruition when they had all students hanging on to every word and contributing to the class discussion. Marijeta and Spencer authentically compounded and synergized each talking point the other had, and while class discussion was often a clear extension of their own private conversations, they thoroughly welcomed any and all insights the students had to give--with the chance of them following up on the students' comments in the next class.",
                "This class cannot be improved. By far, this class has been one of the best I have taken so far. The teaching, the organization, the execution, the discussions, and the material were all amazing and completely thoughtful and constructive. A true masterclass.",
                "The strengths were Marijeta and Spencer's engagement and support, the class discussions, and weekly game nights that informed our understanding of our discussions. Everyone was very passionate on the topic of video games and it's a great intro class to more political contexts.",
                "I cannot think of any particular weaknesses that this iteration of the course has had. Despite the fact that this is the first time that the course has ever been taught at Yale, it was INCREDIBLY well organized, and only left positive emotions after each and every section. It was clear right from the get go that both Marijeta and Spencer cared deeply about both the topic and the way we discussed all of the information, and I particularly enjoyed the weekly routine we established as the semester progressed. Whereas Tuesdays were dedicated to providing context for the videogame of the week, Thursday were spent reflecting upon the game night sessions we had ever Wednesday. Speaking of those, I absolutely LOVED THEM. I found those nights to be the strongest reason behind my constant engagement with the course and its material, as it allowed to not just engage with the material, but also discuss it right away and form strong bonds with my classmates.",
                "Honestly, I have almost no complaints about how this course was structured.  The discussions were lively and deeply engaging, with the professors beautifully weaving in our discussion posts, the readings, and relevant examples.  Almost every time class ended there were people waiting to say more because there was just so much we had to say.  Speaking honestly, I do not always do the readings for every week for most humanities classes, but I went out of my way to do every reading for this class.  I never felt like my time was being wasted; whenever we were asked to read something, it was for a purpose and clearly helped progress our thinking about the topics.  I absolutely loved the class's \"game nights\" too; they allowed for a lot of cross talk and helped us experience the games we were analyzing in a way that gave us a lot to think about.  Compared to the average film class, I learned a lot more about each game than I would from the equivalent film screening because it wasn't just silently consuming the media; the professors helped guide our thinking.  Truly, this was a near perfect humanities course."

                "EVERYONE should take this class! I'm so happy that a course at Yale is finally taking a critical look at video games, which are so commonplace in today's pop culture. For students who are already interested in games or have played a lot of games, it's a great way to learn more about the medium and have the chance to critically assess some of your favorites. Students who haven't played a lot of games before would also thrive in this class, as it doesn't take much prior knowledge to get accustomed to game terminology and ludology. People who don't even like games should also consider this class, as it isn't just a space for gaming but a space for analysis of media in general. The instructors are so wonderful at providing feedback and the seminar nature of the course alongside our \"game nights\" made the class feel like a group of friends. \r\nOne of my favorite classes I've taken!!! Please take it!!!",
                "Yes i would. The professors were excellent.",
                "Absolutely, one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Not only fun, but equally engaging and thought-provoking. A real gem thanks to Marijeta and Spencer. Class was always a highlight of my day.",
                "Yes. War Games was a fantastic opportunity to delve into video games (new and old) using film and sociopolitical analysis methods, and every class conversation was compelling and and every class section was fun. 10/10 my favorite class",
                "Yes, I would 100% recommend this course to anyone it is the perfect fit for all disciplines and for the reasons I listed above the teaching, the organization, the execution, the discussions, and the material are all outstanding.",
                "Absolutely - probably one of the best classes I've taken at Yale! We got the chance to explore a field related to video game studies of our own choosing for our final project, and I learned a lot about different game genres and theory.",
                "YES, YES, ABSOLUTELY YES! If you hold even a MARGINAL interest in learning more about videogames as more than just enterntainment, then this is a course YOU MUST take at least once in your Yale career. You will learn so much about ludology, get to speak to amazing professors and researchers, and (most importantly) get to geek out about a medium that rarely gets talked about in academia. Professor Bozovic and Associate-in-Teaching Small (who is probably won't be teaching the course again for a bit) are INCREDIBLE and will provide you with an immense amount of feedback, helping you become a better writer. If I had the chance to take this course again, I would do so in a HEARTBEAT.",
                "Absolutely!  This is hands down my favorite class I have taken at Yale and I absolutely loved every minute of it.  Even if you don't have a huge interest in the material, I promise you the class is worth your time and will prove to be interesting.  My only note against it is the workload is not nothing, though I do think it is very manageable and there are only a couple of \"major\" assignments."
