                "Strengths: great psets, very thoughtful and helpful professor & TA. Interesting material. Weaknesses: the 2 hr class time chunk is pretty long and perhaps could've been used a little more effectively--personally I think it would've been nice to spend more time on the theories and a little less on code / specific aspects of the psets."

                "If you are looking to go into computational modeling and want a very hands-on course that forces you to understand it to the degree of implementing it into a project yourself for further research, I would highly recommend taking this course. It is a big grind for an undergrad, even one who has done general research, especially at the end. However, if you have coding experience and can dedicate 6-8 hours across your Wed/Thur, the psets are very manageable. You learn a lot from this course, as it's a graduate level course, and leave feeling really accomplished at the end!",
                "Yes, great course! Professor and TA are thoughtful and smart. Psets are difficult but worthwhile--always interesting and analytical. Pretty heavy workload but not bad if you're used to CS courses. Would recommend for S&DS / CPSC majors interested in psychology -- as someone kind of between those two majors, this class was totally worth. Great way to apply stats knowledge to an interesting application and learn matlab (surprisingly, a pretty intuitive and useful language)"
