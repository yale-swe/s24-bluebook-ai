Connections between that debate and the active-contemplative life debate, the humanities-sciences distinction, and the specialization of expertise.\r\n- Consideration of whether there is anything good about using rhetoric (intrinsic good), whether rhetoric is necessary to do good (instrumental good), or whether mastery of rhetoric requires moral virtue (incidental good).\r\n- Writing papers that analyze both the content of a text and the rhetoric of its delivery in order to evaluate the consistency, hypocrisy, irony, or deception of its author"

                "This course had many strengths. The central question of if rhetoric and philosophy are opposed was interesting and well developed through the syllabus, engaging with writers from antiquity to the present day. Professor Stoner had a great level of expertise on the topic at hand which made our discussions more interesting and productive. The readings were engaging and furthered our understanding of the question at hand, but were not overwhelming. There were no weaknesses that I can think of.",
                "All of the Classical readings (e.g., Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian) were particularly great--approachable, focused, and interesting. Gorgias was a highlight; I'm glad to have had the chance to read it. Quintilian was also a gem, and something you're not likely to see on any other syllabus. It felt like progress slowed down in the Christian rhetoric section. I struggled to connect the Corinthians letters to the earlier readings or to the central question, and I felt like I got more from the two classes on Phaedrus, for example, than I did from the three classes on Augustine.\r\n\r\nThe class draws people with a variety of interests, which greatly enriched discussion. The length of the readings was perfect--enough to fill class without leaving anything important undiscussed (most of the time). Similarly, having a seminar meet twice weekly for 75 minutes was more manageable than the once-weekly 110-minute standard format, in terms of both reading load and maintaining energy in class. The distribution of short papers across the semester made a manageable workload and prompted engagement with more authors than a single- or double- midterm paper schedule might have.\r\n\r\nOverall, a great class that I'm glad I took. I had a lot of fun and I'll be thinking about the material for a long time."

It is a great way to examine a specific question from many different angles, allowing for deeper thinking. The writing assignments are not overwhelming and actually work to help you understand the material better. Professor Stoner is so knowledgeable and kind.",
                "Yes. First, this class connected unexpectedly with questions about the purpose of education and the content of a good life. The syllabus asks whether rhetoric is a good thing, but answering that question requires thinking about what kind of thing rhetoric is, and what makes something good; and these are much more general questions. Second, if you're interested in rhetoric, then this class explores it approachably and well, with ample room to think more complicated thoughts on the subject if that's what you're looking for. The workload is manageable and the content is worth it."
