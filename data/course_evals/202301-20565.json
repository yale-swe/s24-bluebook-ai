                "The HomeWorks and some of the quizzes need proofreading for incorrect spellings and office hours should be distributed instead of doing 1 day becuase there were so many people that had class conflict with office hours (not me).",
                "The strengths are that the concepts generally build on top of each other and that the weekly quizzes are a good way to break up the class into parts opposed to just waiting for a midterm. The discussion sections are helpful when it comes to exploring more specific topics that may comes up on the homework. A big strength is that the final project is done throughout the whole 6 weeks of the course, so its not very stressful. One of the weaknesses is that the lecture videos can sometimes not be clear on what information is truly important. There are key concepts, but sometimes they do not capture specifics that are needed for the quizzes. And the slides could be more detailed. Looking back at the slides can often be confusing because they dont go into much detail or explanation. Some of the quizzes contained confusing errors or lacked specificity, so that was one issue that came up.",
                "I liked the recorded lectures, but there were some inequalities in grading of the benchmarks and final project. For example, some mentors graded based off effort and others off quality.",
                "I think that the course content was very well taught through the recorded lectures. I liked how I was able to watch the lectures and learn the concepts at my own pace. However, I think that the quizzes for the class were not a reflection of the students' knowledge. Every quiz we took had some form of typo or error which caused lots of confusion on which answer to pick. It seemed like the quizzes were trying to trick students with obscure wording rather than actually testing the understanding of the concept. Furthermore, the disparity between the TA grading was very clear. At first, I had a TA who graded very harshly, while my friends had TAs who graded on completion.",
                "Strengths: workload is reasonable, recorded/asynchronous lectures are well structured and you can easily go back to rewatch them, feedback on assignments was helpful\r\nWeaknesses: quizzes were badly written (often, questions were thrown out and quizzes had to be regraded), Profs are not very engaged with the class since it is asynchronous, discussion sections were not very helpful",
                "Strengths: It's nice that it's asynchronous, which grants students a lot of freedom with how and when they want to interact with the course. The lectures can be a little dry, but they're generally quite engaging and can be sped up if you're low on time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The weekly in-person quizzes had either a technical difficulty or severe typos which impaired students' ability to understand the questions nearly every week. The homework also occasionally had typos or mistakes in the questions.",
                "Some strengths are its use of primary sources, engagement with scientific information, and Prof. Kabeche. Some weaknesses are that the experiences with the teaching fellows are extremely variable and can be negative, especially when the teaching fellow is disorganized and not actually in the field (mine was in chemistry).",
                "The lectures could be more introductory and have better explanations for complex concepts",
                "The online structure was not conducive to learning for me. I would have preferred to attend lectures.",
                "Strengths: the discussion sections are actually really good, amazing even. You get to learn about some really cool scientific papers that revolutionized biology, but also get to unpack and talk more about materials in class. Make sure you get a good section leader though. It's also a very manageable workload.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I would prefer this course to be in person. Even though the videos offer a lot of flexibility, it is actually quite boring listening to the lectures",
                "I liked how we had mentors for the final project. However, I did not like how we had to watch the lectures online. It just added to the workload of the class.",
                "strengths - asynchronous, final project helped me develop my scientific writing based on good feedback\r\nweaknesses - little attention was paid when creating quizzes and homework, several typos that made questions incomprehensible, very broad overview of all topics",
                "A strength of this course was that it was asynchronous, so I was able to rewatch the lectures whenever I wanted. This course could be improved by improving the teaching staff of this class and fixing the malfunctions and wrong answers in the automated quiz grading.",
                "The strengths of this course were that there was a variety of learning activities for students and that the lectures helped the learning process. Some weaknesses are that there was frequently a lot of work on top of many typos on the quizzes.",
                "expectations were clearly laid out (strength), but often typos on quizzes which were frustrating",
                "This course would be improved by not being composed of asynchronous lecture videos. I find they are not conducive to student learning, and also that this style of course is not what a student signs up for when they choose to attend an institution like Yale. The course was fine overall, and the projects were fun, but I found the set-up of the class horrible. The quizzes also had numerous typos or were very difficult to parse.",
                "I believe that it being asynchronous was a bit difficult because there was less accountability in terms of watching the lectures but it was also good to watch it on my own time instead of attending a lecture multiple times a week.",
                "I think the course could be better organized, especially regarding the quizzes that often had msitakes.",
                "The strengths of the course were the content, and the number of resources offered to help",
                "Strengths: liked the partially asynchronous format, class difficulty was very manageable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Weekly to-do pages, problem sets, and even the quizzes often had many errors. These errors made parts of the class very annoying to navigate and sometimes completely changed the meaning of questions or broke them entirely.",
                "This course gave a great depth of information, but the organization was not always ideal. There were frequent errors in the quizzes which led to a great deal of frustration, but these errors were fixed and credit was justly awarded in all cases.",
                "Weaknesses: Many moving parts. Out-dated information and unorganized communication with students.",
                "Strengths- taught asynchronously, one on one support available\r\nWeaknesses- poorly organized and run, lots of unnecessary busy work, doesn't teach you much about actual biology, very redundant and uninteresting for people who have taken any level of biology previously, Saturday night deadlines, lots of typos on quizzes and problem sets, outdated lectures, didn't seem like professors cared or put energy into the course, waste of time for people who already known the basics of biology, lecturers were obviously unprepared",
                "The strength was that I feel like it exposed me to a significant amount of content at a quick pace.",
                "The strengths of this course were the independent project that allowed me to dive deep into one topic and the ability to drop assignments. The weaknesses of this course were numerous and tainted my introduction to the biological sciences at Yale. This course was extremely disorganized, overwhelming, and frustrating. I assert that no subject when taught well is too hard or difficult to comprehend. Thus, I resent the attitudes of the instructors of this course (and the sequence in general) that believe that biology is generally a difficult subject and use that reasoning as an excuse for any issues that students had with the course. First, when building a Canvas page, less is more. There were so many resources and extraneous information that proved overwhelming and unhelpful. Remove all content and instruction that is not immediately relevant to the course at hand. There were syllabi and suggestions that were left over from a previous version of the course that was immensely confusing to students in the current version of the course. While helpful resources for students include labeled folders, a calendar, and a running list of upcoming deadlines, this information should be easily accessible. When first reviewing the course material, each page I accessed redirected me to a completely new page, making me open some ten tabs to find the answer to my question. I found the To-Do List pages confusing and irritating due to the long list of tasks that did not vary between weeks. Second, in comparison to other introductory STEM courses, the use of recorded lectures suggested that there was more content to be learned in biology than in other courses (a sentiment that continues in the sequence). Furthermore, having pre-recorded lectures made the course feel like an online class; however, the demand that the lectures be watched between Monday and Wednesday restricted the freedom of students that is usually tied to that style of learning. As someone who has taken online courses in the past, this juxtaposition of online material with strict deadlines was very difficult for me to navigate and tackle. For lectures in general, aim to present material as clearly and simply as possible but avoid being condescending. Third, there were too many assignments and deadlines. Having six pre-recorded lectures to watch with mini-quizzes, a homework assignment, a discussion section paper, a benchmark for an independent project, and a quiz every Monday makes this course overwhelming. Having Monday quizzes forces students to cram every weekend and creates unnecessary stress. I would suggest eliminating the quizzes and replacing the homework assignments (normally quite tedious) with quiz-style questions designed to confirm understanding. Fourth, for me, generous grading across the course does not excuse poorly-designed assignments or act as a substitute for real-time feedback and improvement. Provide more specific feedback on all assignments; the lack of feedback on almost all the assignments, including the final project and the final quiz, made everything in the course seem meaningless. It is very difficult to find the motivation to do the coursework if you do not receive feedback that provides a sense of direction and improvement on top of a grade that is primarily based on completion. Sixth, the discussion sections were uninteresting and the one-on-one meetings were awkwardly placed and forced students to meet an arbitrary course timeline. Finally, as a student who took AP Biology in high school, I felt that this course did not meet the one-size-fits-all mentality that aimed to introduce biology to students with varying backgrounds in biology. Several questions on the exam required prior knowledge and I felt that not having my background in biology would have made this course very difficult indeed.",
                "The disorganization of this course was appalling. Between the multitudes of errors in the quizzes and questions designed to trick rather than assess, I was very displeased.",
                "Strengths: loved the online format that allowed us to go at our own pace, quizzes seemed a fair evaluation of our progress, key concepts/terms made it easy to understand what we needed to study. \r\nThat being said, I can't believe this course is an \"introductory\" biology course if I hadn't taken AP Bio, it would have been very difficult to keep up. The pace is crazy fast, I could have used more support from peer tutors/homework help sessions, and there's a lot of work involved, on top of the homework, etc."

For students that must take it as a prerequisite, be aware of the structure of the course beforehand and plan accordingly. I suggest keeping a running list of assignments and carefully reading all test questions. If pre-recorded lectures continue, I recommend resisting the urge to pause the videos: watch at \"single speed\" and type your notes. This is NOT my preferred method of taking notes for class; however, I found it the only doable technique as the course progressed. Overall, there were so many flaws to this course that interfered with my learning of content and excitement for biology and led to an excessive amount of stress during the first half of the semester.",
