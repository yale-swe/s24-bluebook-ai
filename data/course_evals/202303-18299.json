                "Strength: I thought the lectures were very informing and I really liked how we would walk through the excels together and give them broader context through the slides. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times it was confusing to do some of the excels without any prior knowledge on what to look for or how to do them. We would get excels asking for things that we had not yet discussed in class. Then again, I think this forced me to try to learn by myself (so I actually enjoyed it...).",
                "Strengths are many problem sets to get repetitions on the subject matter. Assignments can be a little redundant and less emphasis on memorization of key terms than I would have liked.",
                "Very clear in delivery, easy to learn from the professor",
                "Overall, pretty confusing. I felt like I got very behind very fast even though I attended all the lectures.",
                "Strengths: Professor is brilliant at accounting and very approachable. Always willing to help students and answer questions. Workload low.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes hard to navigate the bigger picture and how each topic ties into that. I.e. if professor explained a roadmap of the course more often that would've helped. Assigning homework that uses methods not yet learned made it difficult to complete the homework. So would prefer to go over the techniques and theory in class before having the homework due.",
                "The structure of work assignment was strong, I enjoyed the challenge of taking psets before class and adding to my accounting skills. I think one thing that could be improved is incentivizing class participation more.",
                "homeworks are clear and easy to follow but sometimes confusing because they are often new stuff we have not seen before",
                "Very low workload throughout the semester, which can be a plus or a minus depending on how you learn. Hearing about Prof. Antle's stories is always a good time. I didn't appreciate that a single mistake in the final exam can take you from an A to a B+, so it is a good class to Credit/D/Fail. Further, the final was pretty much unlike everything else we had done in the semester, so it was hard to prepare for.\r\n\r\nI would strongly encourage Prof. Antle to make more meaningfully graded assignments throughout the semester, count them towards the grade, and make a more typical grading scheme (e.g. 94 for an A, etc).",
                "i thought this class was really helpful and I enjoyed taking it. For me, a weakness was the grading system. The description of how your final grade is calculated seemed very ominous to me and I was really worried about Credit/D ing the class because of the strange description.",
                "The professor is excellent and the content is very important to know if you are interest in finance.",
                "Better feedback on homework. Having discussion sections would help the course.",
                "I would rather have fewer small assignments and instead something each week that tests my knowledge from class. A lot of times we had homework due before a class where we were learning the material in the homework, which was difficult.",
                "Strengths: Professor is great and organized and has personal experience\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Could go over homeworks more and help with final exams to get an A",
                "Strengths:\r\n1) Example based hands on training\r\n2) Very helpful and patient professor\r\n3) Access to course recording and attendance not being mandatory\r\n4) Resource page with additional files for help\r\n5) Online exams with a deadline \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n1) Required some student study groups (some group activity or assignments, especially in the graduate class would be very helpful)\r\n2) Not so helpful TAs - Not a personal experience. However, other students who consulted the TAs did refer to having a tough time getting their doubts solved. A prior student would probably be better able to explain in layman's terms to the students.",
                "More practice sets and discussions will hep gain more experience",
                "I hope all assignments could be provided with solutions after submission deadlines for students to study further. As finals drew near, TAs constantly changed their office hours last minute, making it difficult for some students like me to plan for office hour visits.",
                "The Excel workbooks built by Professor Antle are very helpful because they have built-in feedback, and it was nice that there was continuous practice assigned, although sometimes we had to do things before they even taught and there was no feedback on our work after.",
                "The course brought to light many nuances of accounting and how accounting principles can be applied in different situations. Most importantly, it showed how accounting can tell the unique story in a business. The resources were very helpful.\r\n\r\nThe professor should review the teaching method by first of all demonstrating the accounting principles of journal entry in its simplest form. There should be lots of tutorials.",
                "Very interesting content, the knowledge gained was definitely a plus. However, being offered in the morning and oftentimes a reverse-classroom course, it required a lot of self-learning and discipline to be able to attend class and make the most of it. More could be taught on accounting investments and how those choices are made instead of soo much reading & journaling.",
                "Strengths: professor was very knowledgeable. weakness: You have to teach yourself in this class. The professor is really knowledgable but does not structure the class in a way/ teach in a way that helps students learn. He has homework due before class on the day we learn a given topic and so you pretty much have to guess the whole time. I felt like I really had to teach myself in this course.",

                "Absolutely! However, if you are looking to get an A, I would discourage you from taking this course. All of your grade is dependent on the last part of the final, which is unlike the rest of the semester (parsing through a 10K)",
                "Yes, I would. I think it was a good way to learn more about accounting.",

                "Yes, very useful for any potential finance major",
                "Please do not take this course. Regardless of how much prior experience you may have with accounting, the way Prof Antle teaches it is far different than how it is traditionally done. The grading scheme is wack and I ended up having to Credit/D/Fail due to uncertainty around my grade. A headache overall and the course is an 8:45 at SOM.",
                "Yes. It is a foundational course for a lot of finance related courses. As an introductory course behind how financial statements are built has been very well taught through the course by Rick.",
                "Yes. if you are taking it up for first time its important to take this course.",
                "Yes, it is good for students like me who do not specialize in business yet interested in learning about business basics.",
                "This course covers material that is important for students interested in business/finance, especially undergrads because such courses aren't offered by Yale College, but this material is probably better learned elsewhere if it's possible. The concepts aren't difficult but were somehow made more confusing for me in this class, although I did appreciate the hands-on learning style and the built-in feedback on assignments. There is a lot of homework that is ungraded but usually due before every class. The course's grading structure can be relieving for some students but makes it difficult to earn an A in, and from what I observed, overall engagement was low with many students not attending class as the semester went on (probably because it was at 8:45 am).",
                "Yes. But the student must be ready to go above and beyond to grab the concepts.\r\nIt's a lot of hard work, but once you understand it, you will be fine.",
                "Would recommend if you are looking for a (non gut) class to learn about the fundamentals of accounting and finance, and are vaguely interested in the topic. The teaching is questionable at times as Rick uses his own textbooks/methods, but in the end they are all valuable insights. Getting above a B+ would require some previous financial work, or dedication to learning/practicing problems not taught explicitly in class.",
                "Probably not. The topic is super valuable but I didn't think it was taught well.",
