The tests aren't especially difficult as long as you keep up with the textbook readings. Michael is a funny dude and made sure to make the class fun and engaging every single day. My only complaint is that I wish we had gotten some more grades back so I had a better idea of where my overall grade was at heading into the final exam.",

                "Definitely. I'm not that great at learning languages and really only took the class to satisfy the language distributional requirement, but nonetheless Michael made the class enjoyable and engaging. Although the class meets four days a week, I didn't find the workload to be overwhelming or anything. Michael is a funny guy and would have the whole class laughing at least a few times during every single class. Would recommend to anyone interested in learning Italian (or to anyone just interested in a chill, fun class to satisfy the language requirement).",
