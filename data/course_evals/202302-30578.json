                "A very comprehensive look at the history of the Balkans, with well organized lectures and multiple excursions to different historical sites and museums.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of S.E. Europe and the culture in the region, and got to do through through interesting readings, lectures, and I think most importantly, the exursions and self explorationgetting to interact with others, see the cities and sites, see how life is structured in the various places we went to (e.g. with food, work, city layout, types of stores, everything). It was really engaging and interesting! I also will say, the way the history lectures are structured are so so illuminating! I initially wondered whether all the segments of history would fit together (since we covered so many periods), but they absolutely intertwineit is so so hard to understand even some of the most recent history without really taking in the full picture! So amazing!\r\n\r\nThe course is an amazing starting place for all this history and getting a cultural framework that enhances this historical learningeach segment has so much deep history to dive into!",
                "Enrolling in this course provided me with a fresh perspective on Southeastern Europe, a region I had limited familiarity with. The class delved into a comprehensive history of the Balkans, spanning from the Illyrians and Ottomans to the Yugoslav Banates to Communist Yugoslavia. The readings were notably intriguing as they dispelled many prevalent misconceptions and myths surrounding the Balkans.",
                "While taking this course I developed a better and broader understanding of Southeastern Europe and its rich cultural history. I believe that I gained this understanding mostly outside of the classroom, on our weekly excursions to other villages and communities within the Balkan region. These excursions essentially allowed the class and I to interact with experts and locals who were elated to shared their knowledge with us.",
                "An understanding of the fall of Yugoslavia and wars and genocide which succeeded it",

                "I hope the lectures doesn't contain that many names because it's hard to follow.",
                "The course was really great in the way it combined historical context with excursions so we could see the history and culture of Croatia and Bosnia as parts of S.E. Europe. It really enhanced what we were learning. And It was so so so cool to get to see some of the many sights and relics that we talked about about in class out in real life (e.g. we saw impacts of Ottoman influence in Bosnia with the mosques and markets, and architecture). And it was soooo cool to get to see influences from all periods (e.g. Roman ruins, seeing Dubrovnik and its Mediterranean state old town and museums, art museums, seeing one of the archives). And I loved the amount of free time we got to explore and do a little bit of historical digging our selves. Was phenomenal, and I liked how the responses were geared towards allowing us to combine and synthesize these two experiences together.",
                "This course's notable strength lies in its immersive nature, allowing for immediate real-world application of learned concepts. The excursions, both relaxing and enlightening, provide valuable insights into local cultures and contribute to a richer understanding. The course effectively exposes students to the vibrant culture and diverse cuisine of Croatia and Bosnia. However, a weakness in the class was that the final paper felt a bit rushed and lacked clear, detailed guidelines. Additionally, I wish we would have spent more time covering the sociology of the course in learning more about the sociological perspective of the region outside of genocide.",
                "The instructor did a wonderful job of immersing the students into the daily lifestyle and culture of Croatia  she is incredibly understanding and make the experience feel welcoming. I learned a lot about the region and the instructor truly amplified this experience with their knowledge and input.\r\n\r\nThe history portion of lectures are dense and a bit fast-paced. I don't believe that this is a weakness of the course by any means, but rather, a reflection of the convoluted history of the making of modern-day Southeastern Europe.",
                "Strengths: Trip to Sarajevo, really put things into perspective in an important way",
                "More opportunities for discussions/seminar style-- I often found myself zoning out during lecture, but was immediately re-engaged when I had the the opportunity to speak more conversationally with the professors (both within and outside of the classroom)",
                "Strengths: the class provided many in person experiences which allow you to immerse yourself in the culture of the balkans. It is impossible to leave Dubrovnik without feeling like you understand the ways of the Balkans.",

Europe, which are often overlooked but central and important in understanding the region and how various historical players all interacted (e.g. Romans, Byzantines, Hapsbergs, Ragusa, Venice, Ottomans, Communists, Yugoslavia all were in the region and played left influences) and influenced culture, and it was sooo soooo amazing to get to see life in S.E. Europe in the present, get to go on excursions that supplemented our knowledge with time to see museums, swim, see life in the region. So so wonderful! And at the same time you have so much time to enjoy Dubrovnik and Bosnia on your own and with friends who are on the trip! Perfect balance of work and exploration and free time!",

It is a great opportunity to explore a lesser-known yet captivating region, fostering a deeper understanding that is both enriching and interesting.",
