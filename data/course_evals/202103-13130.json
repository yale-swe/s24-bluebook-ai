It was a great introduction to concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, and many more. There is a strong emphasis on applying basic concepts from class and basically, problem sets were a way of using problem-solving skills and methods to code much more complex codes. Overall, you learn how to split the problem into smaller sections, code those in chunks, debug each section before moving on, and finish or clean up the code for efficiency.",

                "I felt like the course was very organized, and the concepts built on themselves in a very natural and clear way. I also felt that there was a lot of support which enabled us to do difficult work without it feeling overwhelming. One small thing I might have liked help with was that I like to take notes on paper. I wasn't sure how to take notes for this class, so I ended up not taking very many. I didn't feel that I needed them outside of class, but I think taking notes would have helped me remember the material and stay more engaged in class, so guidance on how to take notes might have been helpful. Overall, I thought this was a great course.",
                "Strengths: this class is taught by Dr. Beth Anne Bennett, so you already know that the lectures were very informative, clear, and organized. Feedback was quick, office hours and drop-in help sessions, particularly those headed by Dr. Bennett herself, are very helpful. Problem sets and tests are well organized and naturally build off each other; some are much more difficult than others, but you get advanced warning. \r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were sometimes a bit dry, though I really didn't have a problem with that. After a few years at Yale already, I really appreciate and would much rather have dry but clear/informative lectures over passionate but uninformative/unclear lectures.",
                "Strengths: This course was extremely well organized. There were numerous outlets to learn the material, plenty of office hours, useful lecture slides and sample codes, an Ed discussion message board, and the single most well-organized Canvas page I've seen. Moreover, Professor Bennett is extremely understanding, accommodating, and fair.  The PSETs are manageable and very doable within the given timeframe, and the midterms and final project are very fair.\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing glaring. Sometimes style comments could be a bit frustrating when the code seemed to otherwise work, but I think the expectations were generally very well laid out.",
                "Professor Bennett is definitely the strength of this course, and excellent professor willing to help wherever it is needed.",
                "Professor Bennett is one of the best teaching professors I have had at Yale!! She breaks down the most complicated topics into simpler everyday words and reads through every single line of code in her sample codes to make sure everyone understands. She holds plentiful office hours over Zoom (I think keeping office hours and help sessions over Zoom is a good idea), and sometimes, she knows the answer to your question before you even ask it. She cares about each student individually, making sure to meet at least once with every student via 15 minute Zoom chats. One weakness about the class is that almost everything is coded in QT, which I don't see much use in the future because a lot of the coding I've done before is on Visual Studio Code or the thought the command prompt window.",
                "Strengths: very well organized, lots of office hours, great instruction, friendly teaching staff, very prompt grading. Course material was very detailed (videos, sample codes, homework and exam descriptions, etc) and probably the key to my own studying/homework. Really couldn't have asked for more!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: (1) occasionally long wait times for office hours (but Prof Bennett and the teaching team were very proactive about this). I think having a final exam, final project, and (the very difficult) Pset 9 was kind of a lot at the end of the semester. Not sure if it necessarily something fixable since it does help having a diversity of grades. It would be helpful to simplify either Pset 9 or the final project (maybe the former would be most helpful). But I also would understand if that doesn't happen because both projects try to incorporate everything that has been taught, so of course they'd be challenging!\r\n\r\nOther: I really appreciated that this class was offered in the fall. As an engineering major, I've surprisingly had a lot of conflicts with this class and other required courses to the point where I had to postpone 130 all the way to my senior year! I do wish I had been able to take the class earlier because it would've helped with my major classes as well as my own personal exploration or projects.",
                "Strengths: extremely organized and easy to understand/follow, dedicated professor \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: time consuming psets, a jump in the challenge of the sample codes and the psets",
                "A strength is the helpfulness of Dr. Bennett, as well as the TAs and peer tutors. They explain things clearly during help sessions. Especially, Dr. Bennetts hours are very valuable for PSET help. The lectures are very clear and engaging, but sometimes just long for my personal attention span. I would have retained material better if this was a 3x a week 50 minute class as opposed to 2x and an 1:15. Sometimes office hour queue can be difficult.",
                "The course is very well structured; the flow from module to module is very nicely done. The slides and tutorials are also presented with great clarity!\r\nAs for improvement suggestions, Id have loved more time spent on MATLAB.",
                "The course is very well structured. Professor Bennett, who is certainly the course's biggest strength, is always timely with updating resources (slides/previous semester recordings/sample codes) and schedules plenty of office hours/peer tutor sessions that are always helpful. The problem sets are challenging enough such that take a good amount of time, but are interesting. A side-effect of having such a plethora of resources was that some Lectures, especially those just covering syntax/introducing certain concepts, were not really required to still get a good sense of the content. Certain lectures which go through the more involved sample codes are good times to ask questions.",
                "Tons of support is provided for those with no background in coding, and the psets are fun and accessible for non-engineers (while providing a foray into the kinds of problems that engineers can solve efficiently by programming)",
                "The biggest strength of this course is Professor Bennett! She makes this course attainable for every student and has structured the course perfectly. Her lectures are so detailed and thorough that it's very difficult to get lost, and if you do she is always willing to put in time to help you. The only weaknesses might be certain peer tutors/TA's who could sometimes be rude/unhelpful."

I felt like the languages we learned were pretty clear and straightforward. I also felt that the course had a lot of support built in.",
                "Absolutely! If you want a general introduction to coding but you don't have a ton of experience, and you also want to see applications based in engineering/science, this is absolutely the course for you. Regardless, by the end of the course, you really end up with a solid foundation in the basics of coding beyond a purely engineering-point-of-view. Other courses probably in the computer science department probably delve deeper into particular concepts and theory (this class crams three languages after all).",
                "Definitely! If you're an engineer, you have to take this class anyway, but IMO it is definitely not something to be dreaded or feared. That said, I came into this class with a decent chunk of programming experience, and I can imagine that it would be more difficult for someone who has never programmed before. For those who are not engineering, it's a good class to introduce you to C/C++/MATLAB and the general framework of computer programming without tons of work.",
                "It is definitely an amazing intro class. Depending on how comfortable you are with coding, the workload varies",
                "This course is so well structured and organized that I have no other words to explain it better. There are plenty of office hours, and Dr. Bennett cares very much about her students, making sure they understand the concepts. Don't hesitate to stop her during lecture to ask questions. Even though the problem sets were quite challenging -- getting to the end result and finishing the assignment has got to be one of the best feelings.",

                "Yes, taught under Beth Anne Bennett it's a phenomenal introduction to coding, very engineering based so if you don't have understandings of certain base-level physics/maths it could be more difficult",
                "I would. As someone who took it with no coding experience, it is doable. It is challenging, but very rewarding and you will feel accomplished at the end. Take this if you would like a basis for C, C++, and MATLAB.",
                "Yes, its a great introduction to programming fundamentals.",
                "Absolutely! This course offers a clear foundation in modern CS languages which are useful to know. Students leave the semester with a strong set of skills and are prepared to go on to either 201 or 223, depending upon their comfort with the material. Its also a wonderful intro class for students unsure about what they will ultimately major in. (I've actually already recommended this course to three or four people.)",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn programming and has little to no experience.",
                "Yes. If you are not a comp sci student and need/want an intro to programming, take this course over the other options.",
                "Yes! less intense and more fun than other cs courses. Pset and midterm grading is tough, so it is a challenge and expect to go to office hours each week",
                "I absolutely would recommend this class, its one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, especially for STEM. The biggest strength of this course is Professor Bennett! She makes this course attainable for every student and has structured the course perfectly. Her lectures are so detailed and thorough that it's very difficult to get lost, and if you do she is always willing to put in time to help you. The psets and tests are difficult but fair, and theres lots of resources to get help when needed. Overall a great class, and even if you don't have coding experience like they suggest you can definitely take this class and succeed."
