                "Much of the course is student presentations. Would've been helpful to have some analysis from the teacher at the end of each topic. Another problem set would've been nice to help us demonstrate or apply what we'd learned",
                "Strength: Professor is so kind and smart, the contents are very useful\r\nWeakness: intensive math and the introductory lectures can be more",
                "The strength is that its semi interesting if you can understand what you are reading. The weakness is that the Professor does not teach anything, every week a student presentation occurs and you are expected to take notes and at the end, understand what the paper is saying. But the problem is that almost all the students dont know what they are really presenting on and the Professor has to come in and explain the rest of the presentation because nobody understand what they are saying.it could be improved by having the Professor actually teach and explain the papers without having to interrupt students because they are not properly explaining the paper. There was a lot of time wasted in this class by having the students try to explain the papers in their own words.",
                "Highly organized course. Very interesting papers assigned as reading each week. Assignments fun and manageable. But felt like slightly too much time during classes was spent on student presentations.",

When you are not presenting (which was once a semester) you only have like twenty pages of reading a week with no checks on whether or not you read\r\n\r\nGame theory is super interesting and is applicable to all decision making. This course just introduces you to new game theory thought",

                "Yes! It was a fascinating deep dive into game theory, which I had never learned before, with assignments (presentation, critical evaluation\/literature review of papers) that help internalise the material.",
