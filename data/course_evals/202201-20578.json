                "SO MUCH!!! This is an AMAZING course. You learn a lot about the nuances and fallacies of the way humans think. What's most beneficial in this class is thinking about interventions and how we can not fall to these fallacies. It gives you a lot to think about, and is really relevant to a lot of issues we see on a daily basis.",

                "Strengths: Professor Ahn is an incredible lecturer, and she's also incredible at leading discussions. I had a lot of fun learning from her, and honestly, this course is worth taking just to experience her teaching. I also enjoyed learning about all of the fallacies in our thinking--I'm a lot more aware of these in my own thinking now, and our discussions were helpful in coming up with ways to avoid succumbing to these fallacies. I also think that the structure of the class was great--we had response papers every week and not too much reading, so we could really focus on summarizing the studies concisely. We also had a quiz at the end of every class after lecture, which is fine as long as you pay attention. Overall, a really fun seminar! Weaknesses: No real weaknesses! Sometimes the response papers were a bit tedious to get through, but they get easier once you get the hang of them.",
                "N/a",
                "Strength: organization (so easy to understand what we need to do and when), Professor Ahn (amazing professor and so passionate about her work) and style of the course (discussion + lecture so it is very balanced) \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not much. Grading is a bit tough on the discussion questions, but Prof. Ahn allows for corrections and gives really helpful feedback. By the end of the semester, grades improved a lot",
                "Its chill and not stressful at all - I like that we do the quizzes right after the lecture so we dont have to worry about them later. I also like the seminar + lecture format",
                "I was hesitant to like the quizzes at first, but honestly they were good at reinforcing the material and keeping us engaged. The workload was great and aimed in a way to foster learning. (No unnecessary assignments or big-information overload exams)",
                "Strengths: the material is very interesting; the course structure is logical and promotes learning, with lectures containing examples/videos/interactive games that made learning the studies and concepts much more engaging; Professor Ahn is a great and kind instructor. Weaknesses: none!",
                "I can't think of any weaknesses of this course. Lectures and discussions were both structured in a really accessible way and we actually had time to digest concepts and ask questions, which is rare at Yale."

                "YES!!! Take this course, and take it with Prof Ahn. It's a senior seminar but is so interesting. Students of any major would benefit from this course. Very interesting material and great space to be in.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! Definitely take this course. Its a fun and engaging class, even if you arent a psychology major!",
                "Absolutely, take this class if you are interested in how we think and learning how to recognize when that thinking goes wrong! I took this class as a non-psych major purely out of interest and did not feel left behind or otherwise excluded in anyway. The course features quizzes after each lecture that are easy to ace if you are paying attention. Don't underestimate the weekly discussion questions, as they demand that you think critically on the readings which -- in hindsight -- is one of the strongest elements of the course, as it reinforces fundamentally important skillsets.",
                "I absolutely would. This class is not a gut, because you actually learn a lot of new content, but it is reasonable because Professor Ahn only gives you reasonable amounts of work and a lot of time to do that work and process it. As a result, you learn and retain a lot and never have to cram."
