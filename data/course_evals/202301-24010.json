                "I really grew as a scholar in political science, because Professor Brancati walks you through all the steps to developing and investigating a research question. It's great practice for a thesis.",

Professor Brancati is amazing at helping with constructing arguments, finding sources, research methods, and writing papers. It also covers every aspect of Peacebuilding within conflict and the post-conflict phase. Truly an amazing syllabus!",

                "This course's strengths lie in how Prof. Brancati has shaped it to prepare you for your final paper. The assignments are such that the paper is a cumulative work not a new work. She helps you develop a question\/puzzle, formulate an argument and methodology, execute a proper literature review and present your findings at a poster session. This course is also strong in the diversity of papers we read.\r\n\r\nIts weaknesses are largely in how we do not look at case studies to the level of depth I thought necessary. I simply believed that we would have a bit more depth of our study of individual cases.",
                "Well structured assignments leading up to final paper. Readings were interesting. Did wish there was some more instruction and critique on writing style.",
                "I cannot fault this course. Professor Brancati is absolutely amazing, the syllabus is fantastic, discussions are always great, and the readings (although there are a lot of them) are all extremely interesting.",
                "Strengths: really interesting material; Brancati gives clear instructions for the assignments and maps out exactly what she wants you to do; she's also always willing to answer questions over email or Zoom; gives great exposure for the types of research papers you would be doing in a polisci career\r\nWeaknesses: the reading load is heavy and dense, which is only a weakness if you're not willing to put the time into it; sometimes I could get a little lost in the discussions",
                "Its main strength is the guidance professor brancati gives throughout all of the project.",
                "This course covers a wide array of topics and really pushes students to critique the arguments they are being presented with. This was intimidating at first, as I had never been asked to think so critically and independently for a class at Yale before, but Prof. Brancati walked the lass through it until I felt more comfortable doing it myself. The course also had a really long and intimidating final paper, but the way Prof. Brancati broke it down into lots of small assignments made it manageable. The only weakness of this course would be its high workload, but if you are prepared to take it on you will get a lot out of it."

                "Yes! Dawn Brancati is a very funny Professor, and while she is a bit crazy, she gives a shit about the students and gives fantastic feedback. The course touches a lot of different types of material as well, and the way she approaches analyzing the reading is very refreshing in the Political Science department. The readings are diverse and very interesting.",
                "The course is great to learn research methods! Professor Brancati is very smart but she expects a lot from you and can be intimidating. Lots of opportunity to conduct your own research!",
                "Yes, especially if you haven't had much experience before with critically discussing and writing about academic papers. If you've had lots of those classes (ie you're a polisci major) then depends on if you're interested in the subject material.",
                "Absolutely! This was the best class political science class I have taken at Yale. Professor Brancati is absolutely fantastic and always enthusiastic to help! The freedom of the final paper makes it extremely interesting, the syllabus is amazing for anyone remotely interested in peacebuilding and democracy promotion.",
                "I would, but only if you're 1. truly interested in the material and 2. willing to put in the work. The readings are dense, and there's a lot of them, and you can only really engage in the class if you've actually worked through the readings and thought about them. Brancati will know if you haven't, and the papers aren't really skimmable. The final paper requires a ton of work, but the smaller assignments that you do over the course of the semester help you pace yourself and work towards it incrementally. Brancati gives loads and loads of feedback, and will always give more if you want it, so it's really easy to perfect individual parts of the final paper during the course of the semester if you want to. Brancati's teaching style takes some getting used to: she works really quickly and can be hard to follow sometimes, and she really pushes you to think harder and deeper about things. Sometimes her mannerisms can come off as a little rough, but if you really engage with her, you can learn a lot.",
                "I would if the're interested in peacebuilding. I tis very reliant on current academic research.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student that wants to learn how to conduct real social science research and writing and is willing to dedicate a lot of time to the course. It is rated with a high workload for a reason, as we had biweekly assignments that all led up to our final paper, in addition to weekly readings. This course is also great if you want to develop your way of thinking about readings; more precisely, it encouraged me to not take things at face value just because they're peer reviewed and published, but to continue questioning arguments and looking at them critically."
