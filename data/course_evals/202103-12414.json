                "William Hawkins (course director) is the highlight. He is so responsive on Ed, leads great sections, summarizes all of the lectures, etc. For me, the course would have been a disaster without him.  The peer tutors, though not always up on the material, also care a lot and do their best. They didn't always seem prepared to offer the support needed on the psets though. \r\n\r\nLectures were not too helpful.",
                "The sections were very effective, and the p-sets did a good job of testing our knowledge of the material. The lecture was sometimes a bit dry, but the course also had plenty of office hours for accessing extra help.",
                "Lectures were hard to pay attention to. Problem sets were similar to the exams so you had an idea of what could be asked.",
                "The quizzes were a great way of practicing concepts in a low-stakes environment, generally a lot of support from the TFs and course director.\r\nHowever, there was very minimal professor engagement.",
                "Prof. Hawkins is an absolute gem and ought to be teaching this course. Prof. Kortum is a smart academic but not a serious educator. \r\nYale prides itself on good teaching; this course was a huge disappointment.\r\n\r\nProf. Kortum's explanations were overly-technical and self-critical to an extent that was harmful to learning. A good educator guides students and helps them see the forest for the trees; Prof. Kortum takes his students into the deep, dark wilderness and once there, abandons them (leaving it to Prof. Hawkins to rescue them in office hours).",
                "Overall, the course was engaging, but I wish that the different parts of macroeconomics we learned were more explicitly connected. It feels like we learned a lot of different things that were never connected, so I feel that my understanding of macro is fragmented.",
                "Lecture was pretty dry most of the time, but the review sessions before exams were super helpful and made the concepts make a lot more sense.",
                "The biggest weakness of this course is the lectures. I found them very confusing.The strengths of this course are the peer tutors.",
                "This class's discussion sections help a lot.",
                "I really appreciated the \"In the News\" section at the beginning of every lecture, as it helped me stay grounded in why it's a good idea to take this class.  I also appreciated the incorporation of a brief break into lecture, but the break was usually so close to the end of lecture that I hardly found it to be worth it.  I think taking a break around the 45 minute mark would be more effective.",
                "Lectures were a bit confusing to followlots of tangents instead of explaining the content at times.",
                "The material range was great as well as Professor Kortum's ties with real world events.",
                "This course was in general lacking from a direct method of teaching that felt consistent and engaging.",
                "The course materials and instructors are great, but the lecture recordings are of awful quality (camera seldom captures writings on board or laser pointer on slides, making instruction hard to follow.) Gradescope rubrics can be hard to read at times.",
                "The course director and TFs are helpful during sessions and reviews. The lectures are less so.",
                "I thought that the class could be more interactive during the lectures.",
                "The strengths of this course were the many resources that were given throughout the semester from clarifying Ed discussion posts to amazing peer tutoring like Grace Miller. I really appreciated the help that has been offered and I would really reach out to these resources. However, the weaknesses would have to be that in class, the slides are a bit hard to keep track of and I can't seem to understand the flow of the bullet points. Short, concise, and complete slides with the examples that have been shown in class would be really great!",
                "I like how the quizzes and problem sets helped foster my understanding of the course material, but the lectures were often not engaging and I found myself losing focus occasionally. Another strength was the TF sections and the section materials, as well as the review sessions that occurred before each midterm. Also the peer tutoring was very helpful!",
                "I would say that the course is fine if you have no background at all. Will prepare you for the intermediate sequence.",
                "Strengths: Structure and flow of the course was well thought-out  progression of materials felt appropriate and made logical sense.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were not designed to convey course material effectively  at many points the lecture content went too far and actually complicated the material rather than clarified. Too much math on slides that were not tested and many graphs were not included in the slides and only drawn on the boards.",
                "Strengths - We take time to talk about current events, and professor Kortum always ties it back to the material we're covering. The midterms were fair. LOVE the online quizzes, they're just quick check ins that provide practical help for problems\/ concepts. Tons of practice material\/ old tests to work with.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Sometimes we talk about so much real world things that it can be a little confusing what exactly will be tested. Sometimes the application is a little unclear. The final was very hard compared to other tests\/ psets in class.",
                "The sections are the biggest strong point of this class. The classes largest weakness is the lack of succinctness of material. Many of the lectures contain material which will not help in my analysis of macroeconomics, making my understanding of the lectures muddled and the time I have to spend watching them too long. The sections counter this by delivering only the essential information from the class, cementing my understanding of the various equations and models I learn into something far more concrete.",
                "Strengths: My advice would be to use all of the resources given to you. From lecture summaries to office hours, all of the material you need to succeed is available if you manage your time well enough to review it all.",
                "strength: Psets and quizzes are conducive to the understanding of the material. \r\n\r\nweakness: lectures are sometimes a bit unorganized.",
                "I appreciated Prof. Kortum's direct application of the content to current world events\/news, however, I feel like more time could have been spent on explaining the content itself as opposed to the application.",
                "Psets, quizzes with unlimited retries, and lecture summaries greatly aided in my learning. The lectures themselves were a bit confusing in the way the professor would explain things and include unnecessary information. Sections were also very helpful.",
                "Excellent",
                "The structure of the course, and information included, was good. I think that if the lecture slides were more animated, colorful, and interesting, this would help to keep students engaged throughout lectures. (Sometimes it felt as if all the slides and therefore all the information was just blending into one).",
                "The lecture slides were not very comprehensive, much in-class time was often wasted on current events that did not appear on psets or exams, and the lecturing over-all was not amazing.",
                "instructor lectures are very disorganized and not very comprehensive to follow; additional resources like office hours and sections act more as main resource to learn the material rather than reviewing what we learn during lectures",
                "This course required a reasonable amount of work and the lectures were clear and concise in presenting the information to class.",
                "Good section long lectures",
                "the support staff of this course is very abundant and quite helpful in terms of answering any questions students may have.",
                "Lectures were a little slow, but professors\/faculty were incredibly helpful.",
                "Perhaps one of the main strengths of this course is that there are many opportunities to get help with the material in case youre struggling. Some of the main weaknesses have to do with little details which ultimately matter; for example: exam review slides that have misleading information. I also found that sometimes the lecture material was rather scattered. Overall this course definitely provides good foundation for studying macroeconomics.",
                "The big lecture layout makes it difficult to ask questions in class and get to know the professor.",
                "I thought that the amount of resources that were available to us was a huge strength of the course. From Lecture summaries and comprehensive review sessions to the number of office hours available, the resources were extremely helpful. Professor Hawkins is great, and the peer tutors and TFs were also fantastic. I know that these resources are so good, because I had to lean very heavily on them to learn the material. Unfortunately, that learning did not happen during lecture. Professor Kortum is clearly very passionate and knowledgeable about economics, but I found the lectures quite confusing. I think this is because a lot of the most basic things seem so basic to someone whose life is spent doing economics that it seems to them that they don't need to be explained or only need to be explained quickly. As a result, the lectures often skipped over the basic definitions of what we were talking about. I think it would be very helpful if the next person who teaches the course works with TFs, peer tutors, or others who have learned the material more recently to make sure the slides cover definitions of the most basic things.",
                "A strength of the course were the tfs and the office hours. I also found the lecture summaries extremely helpful and the canvas page was well organized. The communication was good as well. The main weakness was the lectures, they were often hard to follow and hard to engage with.",
                "The strength of this class is Professor Hawkins and the Peer tutors, specifically Grace.  Professor Hawkins was my TA, and I felt I gained more from his 50 minutes TA sessions as well as one Peer tutor session with Grace a week than attending lectures.  Lecture was often dry with powerpoints that often held block texts that were tough to understand even when returning to the slides or videos.",
                "k",
                "Only bits and pieces of the lecture material actually concerned what was on the problem sets and exams, so it definitely felt like going to lecture was not fully necessary.  The class would be better taught if there wasn't so much time spent on the excess material.",
                "Weakness was that the lectures were not helpful and the slides were awfully made."

                "Definitely, this course gives you knowledge about prominent and core macroeconomic topics that appear in daily life, public policy, and finance, and it is a great segue into econometrics as much of its key material is originally drawn from large datasets.",

Macro is more closely aligned to what you think when you think about economics on a national\/ global scale. Kortum is a great professor and always answers questions. I took this class for EP&E, but I might have taken it regardless.",
