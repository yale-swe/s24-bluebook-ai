We got to visit the Beinecke several times, as well as the Cushing brain collection at the medical history library and the Peabody! I also improved my ability to read Old French spellings and grammar.",

                "Strengths  kind, knowledgeable professor who led the seminar efficiently and effectively \r\n\r\nWeaknesses  little to no clarity on grading\/standing throughout term",
                "The field trips were by far the best part of the course! I do wish we had made our own cabinets of curiosity in addition to studying ones we had learned about, I think it would have been cool to put curatorial skills to the test.",
                "Strengths: the combination of field trips and lectures was really good! The field trips were especially really fun and I learned so much from visiting each collection. For our essays, we focused on tracing the history of one particular object or type of object through catalogs of Renaissance curiosity cabinets. The format of getting to choose what object we wanted to focus on and doing this independent research was really fun! Weaknesses: at the beginning of the semester, there was a lot of reading for each class, but Prof Brancher lightened the load later on and the class became very manageable.",
                "The readings were fascinating, and the structure of the course (with its many visits to museums and libraries around New Haven) was brilliant, unlike any other course I've taken at Yale. I genuinely looked forward to this class  it felt like I was going on a little intellectual adventure every Wednesday, whether or not we were in HQ. \r\n\r\nMy one gripe: I think it's always tough to have the first assignment receiving any sort of feedback or grade come in the middle of the semester (or even after the halfway mark). We had one presentation and two essays, all (at least in my case) on the same topic, so it felt largely like one project stretched over the final month or two of the fall, taking a few different forms. I didn't receive feedback on my presentation, which would have been nice. But there were clear guidelines for this work, and we were provided with so many interesting documents and sources that it was fun to do, genuinely."

                "Yes!",
                "Yes! It was a really fun time, and Prof Brancher and TA Louise are absolutely incredible instructors and human beings. The visits to the Beinecke, medical history library, and Peabody were definitely highlights, and the way the class is structured around your own independent research project about an object of your choice is very cool. If you're fluent in French and looking for a non-literature course in the language (as I was), I totally recommend this course.",
                "Yes! It was small and engaging, and the material included some of the most bizarre and surprising stuff I've encountered as an undergrad. (Think kidney stones, plants that look like people...)"
