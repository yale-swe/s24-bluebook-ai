                "The professor and TA were awesome! The strength of the course was that it was very creative and flexible, unlike most other courses at Yale. You could take photos of whatever interested you and the professor and TA would help you with it. I also really appreciated the critiques.",
                "Strengths: Tremendously fun course, Ted is great and Hobbes is an amazing TA. Class feels relaxed and you can really dive into any type of subject matter. Weaknesses: the beginning half of the class is kind of slow (so meeting twice a week for 2 hours each feels tedious), but the second half of class when printing for final crits feel rushed",
                "Strengths: lots of freedom in deciding what to take photos of, 1-on-1 support in class from the professor and TA whenever we asked for help, cool studio visits in the art school\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish that there had been clearer feedback during the critsobviously art is subjective, but I liked whenever the professor told us when he thought a photo was strong or when he thought it needed improvement and why. As someone relatively new to photography I would have appreciated more guidance."

It was really enjoyable to be assigned 100 photos every week of whatever we wanted, and to practice photography on an everyday basis."
