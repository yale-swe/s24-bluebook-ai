We learned about the history through the study of primary sources, acknowledging both what the primary sources tell us about history and also what we can't know from them. A focus is placed on understanding the biases that come from many of the sources, and cross examining various written accounts with each other and with archeological evidence.",

This course has given me the insights to understand the meaning of various depictions of Egyptian rulers and the events that took place under the reign in the context of the larger time period and historical development of Egypt as a whole. I also developed a healthy understanding of the timeline and history of Egypt from the 3000 BCE to 31 BCE.",

We have much to learn about perseveration and from the religions of the ancient Egyptians.",

                "Huge strength is the teaching. Both Professors and all the TAs massively improved the courseso much so I'm considering taking more of their courses. No weaknesses.",
                "The lecture style is not very conducive to learning, I prefer slides with bullet points over two professors jumping from topic to topic randomly",
                "No weaknesses. Great course.",
                "I think the lectures could be a little more structured, just because sometimes I struggled to get down information properly and understand where we were in time. However, I think the sections were structured very well.",
                "strengths: like the dialogue/conversational style of lecture, weaknesses: little incentive to pay much attention to lectures because we didn't need to know any of the material for the class assignments",
                "Like the format, needs to be more structured",
                "I find Egyptian/ ancient history fascinating, so I found the course generally very interesting. Sometimes, the lectures seemed a bit disorganized. I think the class should focus more on the chronology of ancient Egypt in the beginning, and then shift towards the end to be more about broader concepts uch as 'environment'. I felt like I learned a lot that would have been helpful to know earlier in the course as i was studying for the exam, so I think it would maybe be better structured with a midterm exam and a final essay or project as opposed to essays and then a final exam.",
                "In lectures I would've liked the profs to talk more about things that showed up on the final rather than just having conversations for lecture",
                "The TAs are a very good strength of the class. They are always available to explain the content in more depth, review your assignments, and help prepare for exams. I thought the more conversational lectures were a little bit of a weakness because it made it difficult to understand all of the content, leading to a lot of extra preparation for the final.",
                "Ability to understand an ancient civilization is very different than studying more modern history, this is achieved in this course",
                "The course was a bit too broad/somewhat too much information to cover in one semester to go in depth",
                "Weaknesses: Lectures were a bit disorganized. However, very interesting. Relatively lower workload\r\nStrengths: the TA's 100000%! They were amazing, always willing to answer questions and stay after for help. They recognize how disorganized this class is and tried their best to make up for the shortcomings of the class. Huge shout out to Jasmine who organized a 4-hour study break, Camille for 6 hours of study session (w/ Olive the best dog ever! & homemade cookies), and Georgia for her 5 hour study session. They were amazing and really helped for the exam.",
                "The strengths of this course is numerous with phenomenal TAs, professors, and interesting and intriguing course content. The lectures were engaging as the professors delved into their work and explained their findings in the context of the topic of the class. They provided numerous insights and minor factoids to pique students' interest throughout the broader themes, a tool that worked. The only weakness is the lack of organization at times during the lecture due to the spontaneity of the professors, yet this was not intrinsically bad.",
                "Too much to cover to really get in depth on anything",
                "The class was very organized and engaging.",
                "This course was very strong in its individual engagement as there were opportunities every week to ask the professors specific questions that they would answer at the end of every lecture. Also, the TA's were extremely engaged and beneficial to the course as they were extremely fast with their communication and the discussion sections often consisted of very educational and engaging activities to help us understand what was happening in lecture that week.",
                "This course is taught by two professors, both of whom seem to be unwilling to create actual lectures and instead ramble for 50 minutes twice a week. The TFs are excellent, but their role is largely to make up for a lack of investment on the part of the instructors themselves. The professors' lack of investment was made more evident when neither were in attendance for the final exam (the TFs were left to proctor the exam). The TFs were fantastic, but I would struggle to recommend this course without knowing that the TFs would be returning, as they are the only reason the course was able to run.",
                "The subject material of the course and its sections are interesting, and the essays practice different skills (artifact essay, historical analysis essay) which was helpful. I appreciated how the course had an archaeological, literary, and historical lens when approaching the history of pharaonic Egypt.\r\nThe course could be further improved by integrating more of the details from readings and topics necessary for exams/essays directly into lectures.",
                "I felt the course of was disorganized and I struggled to connect the class content. I enjoyed the course material and the emphasis on different research methods like historical sources vs. archeology.",
                "Strengths: All of the professors and TAs were very passionate. The course taught me a lot about ancient Egypt.\r\nWeakness: The course lacked cohesiveness. Lectures focused on primary sources that professors thought were cool, instead of themes. This discouraged student engagement."

                "Yes! I learned a lot about ancient Egypt and found myself more interested than I actually expected. However, you need a lot of discipline for this class because of a lot of learning falls on you to read the textbook (lectures didn't really give information, just looked at cool pictures)."
