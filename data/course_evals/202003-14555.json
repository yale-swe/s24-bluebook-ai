                "strengths: Amar and Ben are both brilliant, lots of ability to shape class discussion via Canvas posts, very open academic environment, great balance between historical analysis and tackling hot political questions\r\nweaknesses: lecture material was sometimes repetitive",
                "Strength: Amar is a genius. Even though he can be difficult to follow he really is the expert in his field and it is pretty remarkable to have him as a professor. \r\nWeakness: No class structure at all. No syllabus. Readings are not required and it's pretty clear nobody did them after the first few weeks. Amar picks favorites pretty early on and the class slowly turns into a discussion between him and them. Useful if you're gunning for law school, less useful if you're taking the class purely to learn about the Constitution.",
                "Strengths: we get to talk about whatever we want. discussions were always interesting with a good mix of obscure hypotheticals and relevant, contemporary issues. Flexibility within the course framework made the class better (which is not the case in all classes that don't strictly adhere to a syllabus).\r\nWeaknesses: Course would be greatly improved by introducing scholarship from other authors. The kind of students interested in Con. Law and the methodology of constitutional interpretation would probably benefit a lot from arguments that are at odds with \"the amar method.\" \r\nWhether it should be considered a strength or a weakness, some of my favorite class moments were when someone brought in outside material in a discussion post and we got to evaluate others' arguments and compare them to amar's books.",
                "Professor Amar is the biggest strength of this course. His knowledge of history, caselaw, other scholars' work, and current political events is astounding, and one is guaranteed to learn many new things--from arcane trivia to critical constitutional principles--every single class. His books cover a wide range of subjects and are highly informative and valuable to read, given that on many issues he has unique philosophies that do not align with conventional wisdom. Furthermore, the opportunity to read and discuss books with the author is in and of itself a special experience. Because Professor Amar is relatively flexible with the topics for each class, this course provides students with an opportunity to discuss contemporary constitutional developments with both him and other students. These discussions are facilitated by discussion posts, which allow students to flag intriguing topics for discussion and practice constitutional analysis techniques learned in the course.\r\n\r\nThe only potential weakness in this course is that not every class features robust discussion between students. Sometimes, this is because Professor Amar has a lot to say on the subject or gives very thorough responses to questions (which are highly informative). On other occasions, students do not necessarily choose to speak up. However, Professor Amar makes an effort to invite all students to participate, and ensures that all the discussion posts are discussed in class at least somewhat. Furthermore, he makes a point of stating that students need not agree with him and he entertains responses to his arguments, even if he does robustly refute them when he disagrees.",
                "Strengths: Professor Amar is absolutely amazing and knows so much about the Constitution and other subjects.  He made the discussions very entertaining and let us pick out the topics for the day that we would talk about through Canvas discussion posts.  It was great to be able to ask him about anything we wanted to.  Amar also hosted optional lunches for us before class once a week, and those were amazing as well.  Nice and casual format for those where we could just talk about whatever was going on in the world.  He even held them after class ended into reading week, exams, and break too, and those really helped.  Amar cares so much about his undergraduate students and that meant so much to us, like we could literally just have phone calls with him or the TA and talk about anything, and that was neat.  The nicest professor at this school by far!  Our TA, Ben, was also great and very helpful with answering questions about class or just advising in general.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none really.  It was truly an amazing experience.  I guess maybe he never graded our midterm papers, but that's okay with me since he was \"saving our democracy\" because it was right during the 2020 election so that's more important, busy guy.",
                "Strength - Professor Amar is THE leading constitutional scholar of our era. It was an amazing to take his class as a college student. \r\nWeakness- I think this course needed much more structure. Our class discussions revolved around discussion posts that were unrelated to the readings and we oftentimes went on tangents, which made it very difficult to participate.",
                "Although the Professor highlights the importance of reading a plethora of sources on a topic before forming an opinion, the reading list for the course does not support this ideal. Students are only exposed to the Professor's own arguments and do not have enough time to read related literature and to complete their other obligations as students.\r\n\r\nThe course claims to be accessible to students from all majors, yet unless you have extensive prior knowledge of the course themes, you will be excluded from the discussion. You can do all of the required readings and still be unable to participate. If the Professor wants to have such high-level discussions, he should not advertise the course as introductory, or he should require a pre-requisite. Alternatively, he should explain unfamiliar terms and provide context when students bring up outside material.\r\n\r\nWe also rarely received feedback on our work. Professor Amar never returned comments or grades on the midterm paper, which was due in October. If he doesn't have time to read students' work, then he should rely on his teaching assistant to complete the grading. The fact that we still only know our \"preliminary\" grade on the midterm paper and will likely never receive any feedback on our final papers is inexcusable."

                "In order to compensate for Zoom technical difficulties, classes often extended beyond the time given in the schedule (by at least fifteen minutes), although students were not obligated to stay. I personally benefitted highly from this practice, as I had more time to listen to Professor Amar's comments. Additionally, I thought that a seminar via Zoom was still highly engaging, as we could see everyone's reactions. So I'm not sure that I have many substantive comments to share with respect to the pandemic-induced aspects of the course; there were no special innovations, but whatever was done seemed to work well.",

You kind of just sit through Amar's train of thoughts and see where they lead. The gems of this class occur when it coincides with current events and you get to hear Amar's insider view (this course was during the RBG death and ACB confirmation).",
                "Absolutely; There's a reason why akhil amar is akhil amar. He's a brilliant scholar who can only be appreciated by studying with him. Most of the reasons people give for not wanting to study with amar are true, but they do not justify not learning with him. Even if you come out disagreeing with amar or even disliking him, you'll be a much much better person for studying with him. He has a lot to offer and really wants to offer it to undergrads. An amar education is part of a yale education.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The opportunity to learn constitutional law with the leading scholar of his generation is one of the key benefits of a Yale education, and this course also connects students with peers who share an interest and passion in the subject. The workload of the course is quite manageable, yet the readings and discussion posts are highly informative and educational. One should be aware that this course does not heavily discuss caselaw--although many cases are mentioned and discussed--and focuses more on constitutional first principles.",
                "YES!  I would definitely recommend this course to other students!  Professor Amar is amazing and so is the TA whoever it is.  Be warned though, you get as much out of this course as you put into it, so please make sure to really be engaged every single class, do all of the readings, go to the lunches, schedule phone calls with him or the TA, post on Canvas some, etc.  Make it a point to really connect with the class and you'll do fine.  It's a great course for those interested in law school and those that aren't.  The paper can be hard though if you've done constitutional law before, but I did fine on mine.  I just had to really work harder compared to some of my other classmates (the ones that already took PLSC 233, ConLaw lecture) to understand the basics conlaw, but that's part of the reason why the TA is in the seminar.  To be honest, it might be better in the long run to take this course first and then take Amar's lecture course because this really gives you the basic foundation, and the lecture is curved.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless someone had already taken Professor Amar's Con Law lecture and had dedicated a significant amount of leisure time to constitutional law. It is definitely not an entry-level course and it is not a supportive environment for students who are only starting to learn about constitutional law.",
                "No, I would not recommend this course. If you want to learn about the Constitution, this course provides a fine overview of the document and its history. However, as conducted by Professor Amar, the course is not conducive to student development. Students are not supported in sharing their viewpoints during class and do not receive feedback on their written work."
