I found the lectures and sections to be incredibly helpful for me, as I would often go from a state of deep confusion when first reading these texts to, I realized when studying for the final, a level of understanding of which I am proud.",
                "I learned how to write a thesis based philosophy paper, as well as the modern foundations of wester philosophy!",
                "This course exposed me to philosophers who challenged my analytical skills and my assumptions about epistemology and ontology. I come away with a passing understanding of the different philosophical theories we encountered and a better ability to distill ideas and points of comparison from dense texts.  I wish I had been able to improve more as a writer during this course.",
                "I gained great skills in analytical thinking. Reading rich philosophical texts and being forced to write essays on them moulds your mind in a certain way to ensure that you can really understand, evaluate, and ultimately critique the texts. This course really changed my way about thinking about some of the deepest questions.",
                "I learned to understand complex philosophical texts. I came to appreciate the insights of the western philosophical tradition. I learned to develop clearer philosophical arguments.",
                "The syllabus is amazing, you get introduced to some of the most exciting writers discussing some of the most exciting ideas, gain writing skills, and the ability to think clearly and critically about the texts.",

                "I think this course was quite good in terms of my knowledge acquisition - every day, coming to class, I felt confident I would know more than I did before, and that is a great feeling. Sometimes, I wished the class could have been somewhat more discussion-based, but I understand that that is somewhat of a tradeoff with ensuring that the students can reach a level of understanding of these difficult texts.",
                "I think that class structure was sometimes a challengethere were times when the class discussion was really good, but other times when the issues were so confused that it was hard to have good class discussions because I felt like nobody really understood what was going on (including me) but everyoen wanted to prove to everyone else that they absolutely did understand.",
                "The syllabus is interesting, if packed. I wish we had more time for the later thinkers, like Beauvoir and Anscombe. I was grateful for Professor Billet's handouts, which she had clearly worked very hard to craft for us. They were crucial in preparing for the exam, and I think they should be distributed to every DS student. \r\n\r\nI felt that classroom discussion in this class was a bit unproductive and hard to break into. Professor Billet kindly insisted on letting everyone be heard and encouraged students to direct the discussion. At times, however, the discourse felt like a clash among students eager to hear themselves talk, and I wish more had been done to prevent that. The \"lightbulb\" moments always came during  Professor Billet's explanations, not during group discussions.",
                "The strengths of the course are the earlier thinkers. Each can be easily identified as traditional philosophy, and you can see how the thinkers construct their arguments. However, as you progress later in the course, the thinkers are slightly less easy to follow in a philosophical sense, and maybe belon in the H & P stream of Directed Studies.",
                "Strength - the syllabus, the writing curriculum\r\nWeakness - the token women philosophers. I think they shouldn't add in women just because they're women, only if they actually fit into the curriculum, or if they're in explicit dialogue with the other philosophers we've read.",
                "Strengths: reading these texts in the order they are presented was thrilling. I really felt the first semester of DS philosophy pay off. Also, Prof. Billet's detailed comments really helped me improve my philosophical writing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: of the three DS tracks, this one suffers the most from the rapid pace in the second semester. There were several philosophers whom I felteither as a result of Prof. Billet's teaching or simply because of time constraintsgot short shrift.",
                "There is very little connection between this course and lived experience. We spend so much time analyzing the exact word choice of the author, but very little time actually applying it to anything meaningful. Whereas H&P and Literature immediately connected to, resonated with, and explained our day-to-day life, Philosophy felt like it required wrote memorization of information with zero application or reward."

            "comments": [
                "I certainly would recommend this course to another student. While I sometimes found the philosophy we read to be somewhat esoteric and removed from my daily life, some of it felt quite personal, and even the odd philosophy was fun as a mental exercise and a challenge to work through, a challenge which I think has made me a sharper and stronger thinker.",
                "I would! I think its a very important class, and its integral to understanding modern thought.",
                "Yes, although I did find that Philosophy was the only section in DS where skills from the first semester didn't seem to transfer in any linear or useful way. In  my first semester, I was probably the most vocal participant in classroom discussion and felt like a master of the material. This semester, I struggled to feel similarly empowered and engaged. I don't know if the material was simply more difficult, or if the change in instructors had an impact.",
                "Yes, it's a great way to put modern philosophy in perspective.",
                "Yes! It was awesome to get introduced to the philosophers, the other students in the seminar are super engaged and interesting.",
                "Definitely, for the reasons I'd recommend all the other tracks of DS. It is an intellectual experience of a lifetime. Reading an excerpt of Kant or Descartes in another class simply would not be as rewarding without the solid foundation DS provides.",
                "I would absolutely recommend DS if you are interested in the humanities, regardless of you previous background. I have never read a single book in philosophy before taking DS, but by the end of if I have learned so much. While literature is my personal favorite among all three courses in DS, I also became intrigued by philosophy after taking DS and would even consider taking more courses in philosophy. In short, although the pace is really fast so I really can't say I understand everything, DS philosophy provides an amazing introduction that made me curious to learn more - and that's the most important.",
