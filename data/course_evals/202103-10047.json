                "Strength: class discussions were great! I learned a lot from my peers. \r\nWeaknesses: most of our 45 minute presentations could have been reduced to 15-20 minutes.",
                "The class is student taught, everyone is part of 3 different 45 minute briefings on the topics were supposed to learn in the class. It seemed to work out pretty well, but you sometimes have no direction as to what you're supposed to teach or how in-depth to go. Because all the topics are new to you too, you're not sure If you're teaching or learning the right stuff. Also, it would have been nice to get grades or feedback on the briefings as we never did. The daily discourse is great, but it could get really hard sometimes to get a word in with the size of the class and how heated the discussion could get and you'd finally get a chance to talk but it'd end and you'd be stuck. Daily discourse when there was a topic sent out was much better as when it was random or thought up on the spot most people wouldn't have the background knowledge to comment.",
                "I really liked the way the class was structured. I actually looked forward to the daily discourses, and having the students present the topics allowed us some creativity in how we engaged with them. For a class that could have just been a very basic, boring lecture, Maj Moen made the most out of it.",
                "The daily discourse is a huge strength. I really appreciate this addition.",
                "It could be improved by allowing us t get Yale credit for it. We spend 3 hours a week in class, have homework, and writing assignments. We learn. We present. We test. We improve."
