                "I think the field portion of this course is extremely rich. Sometimes the readings felt dense and somewhat random or unrelated to class. The Tuesday class slots felt best used when we got to do group work to discuss the readings. The Thursday field time was always fun and enriching! \r\nI also found the field lab write-ups to be slightly challenging because they were so open ended, yet we still had to conform to the lab report format. Perhaps if there was a secondary option for these reports that could be more research based but less focused on the experimental part, or one that was more experiment/statistics based...",

                "The lab reports for this class are very interesting and important for learning how to write scientific papers. However, many students did not have experience writing this style of paper before the class. Having more structured writing time for the first lab report (i.e. having students submit their introduction and/or questions before the full paper is due) would be helpful as students work through these reports."

                "Absolutely! This class is a fantastic way to engage with the natural environment in CT. This is a chance to be both hands-on in the field, and to practice writing lab reports and formualting interesting scientific questions in a natural science context. The small class size and wonderful professor also creates a wonderful class community throughout the semester.",
