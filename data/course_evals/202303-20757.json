                "So much!! This course really made me appreciate how broad SEL is as a field, and how it intersects with a lot of other current and relevant debates in ed studies the role of SEL in critical race theory, diversity equity & inclusion, ideology & values in schools, etc. \r\n\r\nI learned how to critically evaluate papers evaluating SEL interventions (which can expand to educational interventions as a whole). I learned about measurement in SEL and psychology, its impacts on students and various programs being used in schools, and what the field needs going forwards...",
                "What SEL is and how it is perceived, how to know what types of SEL are good and evidence based, the current thoughts on SEL and its intersections with policy.",
                "I learned so much about social emotional learning (a field I did not know much about previously)! I was taught what it meant and whether it was useful. We also engaged in critiques about how SEL could be improved to engage in discussions of race, gender, ableism and much more. I learned how difficult it is to implement education programs like SEL but I also learned how vital it is to fight for this implementation. SEL is such an important field that we should all be learning more about!",
                "Critically reflecting on reading materials and relating them to the real-world events happening around us; having meaningful and respectful discussions with classmates on important topics",
                "I learned how to think critically about SEL with regards to the education system as a whole, as well as with regards to issues surrounding equity and justice.",
                "I developed my ability to read scientific papers and write opinions. I learned so much from my peers in this course and attribute the atmosphere for ripe sharing and discourse to Professor Cipriano. It was so awesome to hear from and discuss with my fellow classmates."

                "Strengths: I loved the discussions in this course and felt like it was a safe space to engage and truly learn! So much content being covered and the student presentations were great \r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was more of a chance to engage with other forms of SEL through the course (i.e. learn more about the policy side of the class) but I do understand that it is a psychology class so the primary focus should be on that aspect of the course... on the other hand I would love to learn more about how institutions and government are affecting SEL",
                "The course overall was great and I would definitely take it again as it is. Dr. Cipriano definitely is the biggest strength. She is so supportive, caring, and knowledgable, all the qualities that all professors should have but that unfortunately not all do. She will go the extra mile to help you if you need to, she really wants you to succeed and is passionate about the topics she teaches. The only weakness I would point out is that the class felt repetitive at times, and the conversations were circling back to the same points. I feel like the depth could be a bit less to zoom out and study other educational topics tangential to SEL, instead of solely focusing on SEL, given that most students taking this class will not go into the SEL field afterwards. But overall it definitely was a great class!",
                "This course was the perfect amount of work. I was engaged in the readings, excited by the flexibility in responding, and always looked forward to class discussions. It was important that this is a seminar and there was space to discuss. Moreover, this class emphasized sharing and bringing both knowledge and questions to the table. I was so impressed with how open everyone in the room was to sharing and asking and learning."

                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in education studies. What made this course so compelling is that everyone in the room was invested in the stakes of education. For this seminar to be its best, which it was, every student should feel invested in the material being shared and open to learning from others. You don't have to study education to be interested, but it does require you to at least have interest in education to begin with."
