                "The lectures for this class covered the impact greenhouse gas emissions have had and will have on the environment, and then delved into high level explanations of the science behind each major form of usable energy generation used today. The homework assignments required reading more into the textbook, but reinforced the higher level explanations given in class by having application questions that required gaining more depth to do calculations. Overall, this class provided the baseline knowledge and analytical skills necessary to look critically at upcoming energy technologies and assess whether they are feasible from a scientific point of view.",
                "While I came in to the class with some knowledge of climate science and energy physics, this class really gave me an in-depth overview of all energy sources, both renewable and non-renewable, with specific focus on the physics or thermodynamics of each source.",

                "We learned how bad the situation is now and what we need to do to achieve the least bad outcome. Understanding the actual numbers and science behind global warming, framed as an energy crisis. We learned how to do calculations of real-life solutions to and causes of climate change."

                "This course does a great job introducing technologies used for electricity generation, but did not have the time to get into as much detail on renewable sources for non-electricity applications. Having a second course with that info would be amazing.",
                "Strength: engaging lectures, strong overview of many topics, course relevant assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not much; maybe lack of grade transparency",
                "This course was great, but the content was taught very fast and sometimes was hard to follow.",
                "All the course material was extremely relevant, sometimes surprising too.",
                "Incredible amount of content which was both a strength and a weakness. It was great to delve deeply into climate physics, engineering, and a little bit of chemistry. On the other hand, it was very difficult to follow along during lectures (and subsequently do well on the quizzes) because of the extreme pace of some of the lectures. This course was quite a lot more difficult than I anticipated and I honestly wish I Cr\/D it. Many of the psets were quite challenging (especially for a non-engineer). The final project was very rewarding and also extremely time consuming."

The class itself is interesting and informative on a broad range of renewable energy technologies that I have always wanted to learn about in a formal setting. Although it required a bit more work than your average class, the work was always fulfilling. This class has inspired me to work with these technologies as a career. Easily the best course I've taken at Yale.",

                "Highly! Everything here is super relevant. You will not be bored, and it feels good to actually know the science behind climate change."
