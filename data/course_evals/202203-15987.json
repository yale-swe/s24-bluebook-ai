Be prepared to learn a lot on your own - fortunately there are lots of great resources online.",
                "It could be improved with another professor and a slower pace",
                "The course itself was good. The curriculum was a good introduction to general chemistry, and tied ideas together well. However, Dr. G was the weakness of this course. Material was not sufficiently taught, and it felt like we were hardly covering the necessary topics even though we were consistently behind schedule. The efficiency and method of teaching of this class were the main weaknesses, and the class was much harder than it needed to be because of this. The information itself was not too complex, but it was taught in a way that made it much more difficult.",
                "Strengths: the lectures were well organized and offered room for questions. The demos also helped me better understand the material \r\nWeaknesses: I wish more examples of questions were brought up in class",
                "I was in Dr. G's small class and he often moved too quickly saying things like \"this should be easy\" when it was actually very difficult for most students. This made many of us feel stupid.",
                "I took the small section of this class and I thought the biggest fault was the instruction. After every examination we were told that he was disappointed in us, he called us out in class negatively, and many things of the sort. During tests, we were told we cant ask questions about the questions even if it is for clarification (and yes there were typos that confused the concepts behind the questions), and for the same class (the larger section) students were given note sheets with information they should know for the exam and we were not given the same. This felt unfair, and as if we were being robbed as we all had to work harder for our grades. As for the strengths, though there was poor instruction behind it as well, the practice problems given in discussion had great content. The psets could also help as they had good content, though it was dissimilar to the concepts we were covering in class.",

The class was taught horribly, and he was consistently demeaning to students who didn't understand topics immediately. General chemistry is a good science class to take, and for those who need to take it I'm sure with another professor it would not be that bad. But don't enroll in Dr. G's section.",

                "My answer to the question above is more or less an explanation of my issues with this course, but no I wouldnt ever recommend the small section of the course by any means. It was posed as increased resources and a more 1-on-1 experience, but out of all of my instructors I felt most disconnected with him. It made me feel distaste toward the subject of chemistry which I cared for initially, and I also feel less prepared than my large lecture classmates whom I will be joining in the coming semester.",
