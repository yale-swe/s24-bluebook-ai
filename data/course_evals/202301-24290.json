                "Strengths: The ASL program is such a welcoming, fun environment, and I was excited to come to class every day. That was certainly helped by the 4-day-a-week structure of the class, which compassionately lets students take Fridays off in exchange for writing in a journal and working on a fun service project. This semester there were lots of games incorporated into class, which was a huge improvement on last semester! \r\n\r\nWeakness: None, except that I know a number of folks struggled with their main service project. I love the idea of having service projects, but communicating/coordinating with large groups of busy Yale students to plan things can be very difficult. I don't want to suggest putting any extra burden of organizing service projects on the professors; maybe we could have a more formal option to do an independent research project/presentation instead?",
                "This class is truly one of thr best at Yale as are all thr ASL courses. The professors are fantastic, the structure makes it easy to learn, and it's very easy to be engaged.",
                "I think the course itself is really great the one thing I would potentially reevaluate is the project as a part of the final project."

                "Absolutely  learning ASL has given me the opportunity to communicate with more people, expand my understanding of Deaf Culture, and create more inclusive student environments on campus. As a graduating senior, this is the best choice I've made in my entire academic career.",
                "Yes! ASL is a fantastic way to fulfill the language requirement!",
                "I would absolutely recommend that all of my friends take ASL! It is useful, inclusive, fun, and totally worthwhile. I would also recommend taking it with Andrew; he is one of the most compassionate and understanding professors I have ever met, and he makes learning ASL so much fun!",
                "Yes! The class is great. It's not incredibly difficult, but you learn a lot.",
