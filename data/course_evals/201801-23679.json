    "I gained a way more advanced knowledge of Spanish. My pronunciation improved and so did my grammar. I am way better at thinking in, reading, writing and speaking Spanish now. I learned a variety of different verb tenses, vocabulary, and more. This class helped me skyrocket my Spanish abilities.",
    "I learned a good deal about Spanish culture and Spanish literature from this class.",
    "You learn a lot more pronunciation and oral skills in L4 than L3.",
    "I was able to develop my skills in Spanish to the point of being conversationally fluent. I learned a lot of new information about grammar."

   "comments": [
    "Taught well.",
    "Strengths= small class size facilitated student improvement of fluency; weaknesses= difficult grammatical concepts were often not explained well by the textbook or the instructor, difficult to improve writing based on lack of personal feedback. Course could be improved by asking professors to not only edit essays using the symbol key given in the course packet, but also asking professors to leave personal comments on how to improve sentence structure and organization. More assistance is needed on how to improve speaking skills.",
    "This course is hard to have 5 days a week.  Although it has a lot of information, I think a lot of the topics could be condensed into fewer days a week.  However, it is very helpful in learning how to speak better with the language.",
    "The course was well organized. It could improve by having more sections so less students are in each class and having consistent grading between sections.",
    "The course covered a lot of material very quickly, which is both a positive and a negative. I'm not totally sure how that would be improved. I think all the oral activities were helpful in making me think and speak in Spanish. I also enjoyed reading the book.",
    "A strength of this course was the discussion format. I found this useful in building connections with other students in the class while also keeping things fairly relaxed. \r\n\r\nHowever, this strength also contributed to one of the biggest weaknesses of the class: the disconnect between evaluations and what we learned in class. By and large, I found myself teaching myself Spanish which really made class time feel wasteful. I would say 40% of our classes were spent doing the exact same exercises that we completed the night before for homework. This did not help me learn Spanish. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, examinations were not weighted in the most fair manner. The actual grammatical content of each test and quiz was often worth the same as random sections that did not related to what we learned grammatically. These sections were honestly quite a toss-up when it came to grading. Sometimes  I could make several mistakes and still receive a perfect score, while on others I could miss one or two spellings and suddenly lose half of the points. The tests could be improved by implementing more consistency.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there were very few ways to actually improve from mistakes made on graded work. I found this issue particularly apparent in the compositions. I was often left wondering why something I did was marked as incorrect, yet there were no real ways to address this issue.\r\n\r\nLastly, I would suggest giving three chances on the supersite homework. Some of the instructions on those assignments are so poorly described that trying to answer confusing questions in two attempts is close to impossible.",
    "I think the daily participation makes it easier to understand the language. It could be improved by getting rid of busy work.",
    "It was repetitive--we did the same exercises in class that we had done for homework."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, Spanish is a very interesting subject.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Meeting everyday makes it easy to keep up on your practice of Spanish and the small classroom environment makes the experience more fun.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the course to a student who wanted to better their conversational skills in Spanish.  L4 was much less writing based than L3, but it was great for oral practice.",
    "Yes to the course, no to the teacher",
    "Yes, it is a well organized language credit.",
    "Yes, if someone wants to learn to speak Spanish this course is extremely helpful.",
    "I would really only take this class if you have no other options. Compared to Spanish 130, this class was a big disappointment. I truly and honestly think that I am worse at Spanish now than I was going in to this semester. Assignments are largely arbitrary, and examinations are a pretty poor reflection of real knowledge of the material. I came in to college open to an exploration of fields outside my comfort zone, but this class has made me incredibly skeptical and critical of the language requirement. There were very few days when I walked out of class feeling that my time had been spent well. With such little time at Yale, I was thoroughly disappointed that I had to waste so much of it on a class that was not interesting nor helpful. If you can, take L3 and L4 in the one semester intensive class or get credit for them both through a summer program.",
    "Yes, anyone who wants to understand the Spanish language.",
    "This course teaches a lot of really important grammar, and does a good job of reinforcing it. The short stories and movies were interesting. The quality of the course really depends on which instructor you get.",
    "Not with my professor. I have liked every single Spanish class I have taken at Yale except for this one. Professor Santos was not a good professor. She was not available during office hours (she implied that I should leave after 5 minutes), explanations about grammar rules are not clear in class, participation scores are low regardless of how often you answer questions and raise your hand, and it is clear that she plays favorites, particularly with the boys in the class."
