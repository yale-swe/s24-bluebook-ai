    "Creative writing skills, life skills, listening skills, basically everything necessary to life a happy and fulfilling life.",
    "I have developed a keener sense of self, of empathy, and of what it means to write. I have grown more over the past 5 weeks than the rest of my nineteen years combined.",
    "It is with pleasure that I fill out this course evaluation! Dr. Hopper's class provided the most transformative writing workshops I've ever been a part of--more than refining my writing, I felt I could be deeply vulnerable and from that place of vulnerability access profound truths that I expressed through the creative nonfiction assignments. I am incredibly grateful for the community that Dr. Hopper created over Zoom, which surpasses the strength of any bonds I have formed in community either in-person or online. In the midst of the pandemic, looking forward to our twice-weekly classes gave me a sense of purpose, fulfillment, and connection.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that every student has the privilege of taking this class--or another of Dr. Hopper's courses. My writing has improved dramatically, and the feedback from my peers, our course assistant, and Dr. Hopper has facilitated my growth as both a writer and a person. I voluntarily wrote about extremely difficult familial relationships and experiences. I would not have felt comfortable writing in such an intensely personal manner were it not for the support from the other students in the class and the sensitivity with which Dr. Hopper guided us through the writing process. \r\n\r\nI am extremely sad that this class is over, as I feel that my experience over the past five weeks has been invaluable. This class has altered my sense of purpose by helping me reengage my love of writing. I am touched to have had the remarkable opportunity to engage with creative nonfiction essays that exposed me to a range of perspectives and enhanced my capacity for empathy, as well as my writing abilities. Dr. Hopper's brilliant selection of works for us to read in this class as well as the bi-weekly Canvas discussion posts allowed us to engage deeply with readings and reflect personally on the significance of topics--such as place, family arguments, and social and political issues discussions--in our own families. The short responses we wrote before each class were also therapeutic; they transcended intellectual analysis and became a site for creativity and personal reflection.",
    "I learned of some really cool and dope authors, writers, and artists! Also continued to work on writing personal narrative and using \"documents\" to center and ground pieces of writing.",
    "I learned about different techniques to approach creative writing.",
    "It was an amazing few weeks learning how to write about family and write non-fiction personal essays generally!"

   "comments": [
    "The professor is great not only in organisation and selecting readings that build on and inform what we can accomplish in our writing, in addition to getting a chance to talk with some of the authors themselves, but in ensuring everyone's voice in the class is heard and validated, making each person feel uplifted and able to share as openly possible.",
    "This course has every strength and not a single weakness. Singlehandedly the best course I've taken in Yale and that is taking into consideration that we were limited to zoom calls due to Covid-19. Despite only physically being connected through a screen, this class had the most amazing community and the bonds I created supersede any in-person seminar I have taken.",
    "There is no way to improve this class other than for it to last longer. To highlight any one facet as a strength is to undermine every other quality, all of which are equally exemplary.",
    "There are no weaknesses of this course. From the syllabus to the close attention to detail in workshop, Prof. Hopper has designed this course to be one of the best I've taken at Yale thus far. This class is inclusive, and I truly felt a sense of family (despite never having met anyone in-person, since it was entirely on Zoom). Prof. Hopper's approach to writing is insightful and supportive. My creative nonfiction writing has exponentially improved having taken this class, and there is truly no other course like \"Writing About Family.\"",
    "The only way in which I feel this course could be improved is if it were longer than five weeks! Dr. Hopper made the most of every single class discussion, which I walked away from with a heightened awareness of writing techniques I could apply to my own work, empathy for my peer's experiences and perspectives, and a level of personal growth I did not believe an academic setting was capable of fostering. \r\n\r\nOne of the strengths of this course were the three visits from guest writers: Jodi Foster, Vanessa Martir, and Minh Vu. Before these writers joined our class, we had read their acclaimed essays and prepared questions for them. To have the opportunity to converse openly about our writing process with incredible, published authors is rare. I benefitted enormously from the insights they shared, such as narrative techniques, how they revise their work, and how they decide which works to publish and when to keep their writing private. \r\n\r\nAnother highlight of this class were the two collaborative essay workshops. In the first workshop, each student read all of the other students' drafts and commented on all of them; engaging in the revision process as a large group enabled me to both provide and receive specific feedback. One member of our class even highlighted a favorite quote from everyone's pieces in her comments. The second essay workshop was more intimate, as we read and discussed our drafts in smaller groups of three. The opportunity to spend more time with each other's essays and provide feedback in a conversational manner was no less meaningful than hearing the entire class' commentary. In addition, Dr. Hopper provided us with an opportunity to raise questions about our writing process at the beginning of every class, so that we could learn from each other's writing process. The \"Elements of a Non-Academic Essay\" handout she provided was also helpful as a framing tool when giving feedback.",
    "Strengths:\r\nThere is a lot of flexibility in this course, so whatever your experience with creative writing, personal writing or writing about family, might be, I feel like there is a lot of space to grow and explore. Professor Hopper chooses readings that are excellent examples about how different writing techniques, styles, etc can be used to tell a story, part of a story, or to retell a story in a new way. Dr. Hopper creates an environment that allows you to genuinely focus on the writing instead of checking off boxes, which I think can be necessary in confidence building for new writers or people who are exploring\/re-exploring creative non-fiction. \r\n\r\nThere is a lot of open \"space\" in the class. And by space, I mean flexibility in the assignments but also class discussions, and you don't have to subscribe to one notion of \"family\" throughout. Write about multiple families, if you'd like (I most certainly did!). That space also leaves room for people to learn about and acknowledge relative levels of privilege when it comes to storytelling and who has a voice, is allowed to have a voice, when telling the stories of their family. It can be used for some to be exposed to biases they didn't know that they have, and there seemed like to me to be space to begin the process of \"unlearning\" (especially for cis white women, which I'll elaborate on below).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\/Things to be aware of:\r\nThis is the type of class where who's in it plays an important role. There is no pressure from Dr. Hopper to be \"vulnerable\" or to tell intimate details about your life, or to subscribe to a particular notion of family when you choose your writing subjects. But this is the type of class where you read and workshop other people's writings, and so be prepared to potentially deal with some intense emotions and extremely intimate details of other people's lives. My class did pretty okay self-governing ourselves when it came to be being a \"safe space\" but it's totally dependent on who is in the class. Not quite sure how Dr. Hoppper would have dealt with someone coming to her about feeling overwhelmed or out of place due to heavy content that was sometimes discussed; I think that is something you should be aware of when considering this course.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to be aware of is your positionality in relation to the rest of your class members. My class was full of predominantly cis white women--it was incredibly uncomfortable, and sometimes annoying, to listen to cis white women talk about families and parenting styles in Black families, Black queer families, etc. (as a non-cis Black person). While I think it can be important and useful to engage with discomfort, at other times it is just emotional labor. For example, one time one of my classmates mentioned that since English was not their first language they would like feedback on their transitions, and at least two or three people (aka, cis white women) responded with something along the lines of \"omg, never would have known English wasn't your first language! You speak it so well, your writing is so good,\" etc. Moments like these, plus constantly being misgendered and people not owning up to it\/acknowledging it made the class a bit of a drag. A lot of the white women did not seem to realize the privilege that they have in being able to trace their family history back multiple generations, something that those of us whose histories have been stolen or hidden from us due to colonialism, racism, and imperalism, cannot. \r\n\r\nImprovements that I'd like to see:\r\nMore intentional discussions about race, class, gender, and violence. This class is called writing about family, but I felt like not all of the short writing assignments (particularly the reading responses, which were only about a paragraph) needed to be focused on writing about our OWN families. I would have preferred if we engaged the diversity and complexity of works we read and had specific, centered discussions on those four issues.",
    "Honestly I was so happy with this course; I don't have any constructive criticism.",
    "The biggest strength of the course is the wonderful group of people and the discussions we had together based on our readings. Could seriously not think of a way to improve it."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend, even if that student is not experienced or as familiar with creative writing or creative non fiction, as there is something they can learn and benefit from in how they can use their own studies and experiences to channel and create a unique and impressive piece (you certainly won't feel alone!).",
    "Absolutely. There is an overwhelming sense of community, bonding, and care that is developed within this course, all under the guidance of a very empathetic, thoughtful instructor.",
    "Absolutely. Everyone should take at least one creative writing course in their life and this class is it. It was so emotionally validating to share our family experiences and writing in this class and receiving amazing feedback to even further our writing abilities.",
    "This is the best academic experience, perhaps one of the best overall experiences, I have ever had. I implore you to take this course.",
    "YES! It is a safe space, which is very important for the subject matter of the course. I felt comfortable sharing my own personal experiences and felt connected to many of the writers (some of which came to speak with us!) on the syllabus. I also felt a deep sense of connection to my classmates, who were comforting and kind.",
    "\"Writing about Family\" should be a required course at Yale! No other course has provided me with the opportunity to develop not only my writing craft but also such a profound sense of empathy. I believe that empathy is the most important quality we can have as humans, and the world would be a better place if everyone in it took this class. Understanding our families is central to understanding ourselves; even if one does not intend to pursue creative nonfiction writing beyond this class, this style of writing is has tremendous benefits, including skillful self-reflection, the cultivation of empathy, and an awareness of social issues, that transfer to many other areas. \r\n\r\nI was not considering being a writer before this class, even though writing is something that I have always enjoyed (albeit less so in other settings other than this class). Now I feel that writing is something I have to do for myself and others. I feel privileged to have been in community with such talented, kind, and brilliant writers through this class. While I do not believe that the community Dr. Hopper fostered through this class can be replicated, I will certainly attempt to recreate the magic of this course in the future.",
    "Short answer, yes.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a humanities credit to take during YSS, this is a good class to take. The workload is not demanding, the professor is understanding, and you will probably learn something about yourself through taking this class, whether it's about your family, how you feel about writing, or how you feel about reading other people's writing about their families. It was a not-too-exhausting class to taking during this pandemic.\r\n\r\nLonger answer:\r\nI would only take this class if you have a goal that needs to be met. Do you want a humanities credit? Do you want something to kick start you into writing for yourself? (again or for the first time?) Do you have extreme writing anxiety and want a constructive and support space to practice writing (even if creative non-fiction is the type of writing you want to do, knowing that the writing process, including feedback, does not have to be a harshly judgmental process can be uplifting to experience and build confidence)? Because if I didn't have a goal\/reason to take this class, I can honestly say that I wouldn't really have liked it\/bordering on hating it lol. I wanted a humanities credit and I was intrigued by the writing assignments and readings, and being able to focus on those two things was sufficient motivation for me to continue to somewhat actively participate in the class. The biggest drawback in the class for me was mostly my other classmates. Which would be the only other thing that I would suggest taking into consideration: who else is in the class. So many cis, white women to talk to for 4 hours, twice a week, was a lot. I don't ever need that energy in my life again. Especially as someone who's family and life story is \"complicated\" I felt like I had to do a lot of explaining (culturally) for my writing to make sense to others.",
    "Yes. Especially during the pandemic, the course was not only engaging in terms of what I was learning, but became a real community. I loved it; would recommend to anyone else looking to take a writing course.",
    "100%!!! TAKE ITTTT. This is seriously a must-take course if you're looking to improve your writing and have meaningful conversations in an open and honest setting. The group taking the class is pretty self-selecting, which is what makes it great - you are going to take more out of this course if you're prepared to share things you would not normally share in a Yale class, but this shouldn't be scary at all. Dr Hopper is fantastic and I could seriously not recommend this class more if you have the chance to take it."
