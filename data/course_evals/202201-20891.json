            "comments": [
                "Professor Vaccaro's excellent teaching style and presentations are the course's greatest strengths. In terms of the material itself, it's quite exciting to see complex quantum mechanical models being built up practically from first principles. The homework assignments are also conducive to learning while not taking an inordinate amount of time. The exams were fair (NB: I haven't taken the final yet) and we were given ample time to complete them.\r\n\r\nIf I have one quibble with the course, it's that the first two weeks of lectures on chemical equilibrium felt unnecessary and out of place - it was pretty clearly a holdover from unfinished first semester material. In my opinion, skipping that would have made the course feel more coherent as a whole and would also have let us get through more of the material listed on the syllabus, which would have been nice. Everything prior to introducing the wave equation could maybe be condensed as well, since we only returned to it sparingly or not at all.",
                "I'm really having trouble coming up with the strengths of the course. You begin the course with material that you thought you had left behind last semester. The material in the course has so much potential to be interesting and I trust that it is interesting when applied, but it's just shoved down your throat the entire semester so you don't really get to think about it or consider its usefulness or its applications. The professor never goes through any examples with you. All you do in class are proofs and the proofs you don't do in class you get to do on the problem sets. Someone else who can better engage the class and inspire the students to learn should be teaching this material, because the way it is taught right now makes it impossible to feel connected or to get excited about the material. The exams are difficult, very fast paced even though you get 3 hours to complete them, and the final is even more so. The problem sets don't help you to prepare for the exams. If you want to do well in the course you have to put in a ridiculous amount of time such that you are spending any potential free time you may have on this course. This course actively discourages students from entering the field of physical chemistry or engaging with any of this material in more solely because it is taught in a way that makes it so inaccessible. At the end of the course I'm left questioning whether we didn't go into enough depth since we never applied any of the concepts we learned or whether we went into too much depth since many of the exam questions were written to trick you and referred to one-liner comments Prof. Vaccaro orally made during the lecture. In all, the course isn't set up in a way that encourages learning and it actively kills any and all intellectual curiosity you may have had. I honestly think Prof. Vaccaro has been teaching for so long that he has forgotten what it is like to be a student and therefore assumes that because the material comes naturally to him after having taught it for so long, it must be simple for us, too.",
                "Strength: helpful discussion sections\r\nWeaknesses: length of the psets, difficulty in preparing for exams",
                "The strength of this course is definitely the organization. Professor Vaccaro has impeccably organized the entire class and his lecture slides are incredible. It's relatively easy to get help if you need it, and it's super helpful that he posts all the slides to Canvas in advance. He's also the best lecturer I've ever had in the chem department hands down. He makes a complex topic way more comprehensible, and the course would not be the same without him.\r\n\r\nIn terms of improvements, I think that the exams do not need to be as demanding as they are. The two midterms each take three hours (even though the professor claims that they are written to be completed in an hour and a half), which is just too much for a midterm that is taken from 7-10pm. Just logistically, I don't like walking down Science Hill alone that late, but I guess I understand the desire to give us enough time. However, this is completely thrown out the window with the final which has nearly double the questions but the same time constraints. There are other ways to test your knowledge that don't totally ruin your day. Also, I think that the course could be more accessible! I had COVID this semester, and missed a ton of lecture content. Professor Vaccaro claimed that the room was not equipped for classroom recording, but I have had other classes in that exact room recorded without any extenuating circumstances. I think investing in incorporating recorded lectures is a good use of time, especially since class lectures are not all reflected in the slides and Vaccaro's explanations are often way more clear than the textbook or other sources.",
                "A lot of the material taught in lecture seems to be rushed; in particular, in the later half of the semester, there is a lot of math and derivations of concepts that the professor goes through very quickly that is hard to understand. A strength of the course that balances this, however, is that office hours are incredibly helpful and the problem sets guide you through the concepts that you might have missed in lecture.",
                "Strengths: Professor Vaccaro is an excellent lecturer and really tries hard to make the course as clear as possible, no matter how difficult the material is. I highly enjoyed learning the material in the clear format, and the sections were extremely helpful -- far more than last semester. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the final felt like it was hard to manage within the time frame alotted.",
                "The course relies heavily on mathematical derivations and sometimes fails to explain certain concepts. However, there is a plethora of information found in professor's Vaccaro's documents (besides his slides).",
                "This course is well-designed especially compared to the first semester. Only real weakness is paying for a textbook we didn't use. It would be good to get through more material but I love how in-depth the material is covered",
                "So much content crammed into this semester, connections to why this all matters would be good",
                "Strengths: Clear lecture notes, powerpoints, and helpful office hours. \r\nWeaknesses: Tedious, unengaging lectures",
                "This was a very good course overall. It clearly and thoroughly teaches the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and their applications in chemistry. Both the problem sets and exams are interesting and appropriately challenging. My one critique would be that the course spends multiple weeks discussing the details of experimental results that disproved classical mechanics. While some discussion of these is helpful, I would have preferred to spend a bit less time on the history and a bit more time discussing the formalism, either through alternate mathematical formulations (maybe an introduction to matrix mechanics) or a further exploration of approximation techniques such as perturbation theory.",
                "The course does not have any weaknesses; the difficulty of topics can be reduced through sessions of office hours and peer tutoring.",
                "Vaccaro is an amazing lecturer, and the organization of this class was excellent. Though difficult, the material is interesting and is approachable if you put in the time for it.",
                "The course is very well organized and expectations are clearly communicated. I have a weaker background in math and thought that at times it was hard to follow the derivations in class and sometimes unsure about what math to review for the exam (just focus on derivatives and integrals, no need to worry about differential equations and fancy serendipitous substitutions done in class).",
                "Strengths of this course include the way the material is taught towards the beginning of the course as the mixture of Powerpoints and writing on the board kept me engaged. However, towards the end of the course it became mostly looking at Powerpoint slides which diminished my engagement. Another weakness of the course is the amount of homework given. I think homework is reasonable and to be expected as it helps us prepare for the tests. However, some of the problems where we just calculated different values for various isotopes of an atom may not have needed to be as long to still allow us to learn the material. Another weakness of this course was the optional problem set at the end of the semester that has a possibility to help ones grade. I think having an optional pset is okay and I appreciate the boost it could have towards ones grade but it was very unclear how much it actually affects the grade. Also, the fact that it may or may not help the grade only works if there's clarity on one's grade so its clear how much it will help, but there is not that much clarity as the Canvas grades didn't factor in our exams or any potential curve."

                "I learned more from this class than from any of my other courses this semester combined; I think this is a wonderful, yet incredibly challenging class. That said, if you don't enjoy chemistry or quantum mechanics, you will absolutely not enjoy the class.",
                "I would recommend this student to anyone considering the chemistry major or the MBB major. The class is super difficult, but also super interesting. You learn a lot about quantum systems and how systems interact with each other, as well as a lot of mathematics that are at the core of quantum chemistry. Professor Vaccaro is a tough professor but is also very clear and helpful.",
                "To be honest, yes. I really enjoyed the material and going to Vaccaro's office hours is really beneficial",
                "No I would not, unless you have to. Then good luck.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! Do not be scared by the reviews-- the workload is about the same as first semester, and I actually found the material much easier to understand. All of the necessary math is developed in the course, and the problem sets and exams present an engaging but manageable level of challenge. From what I've heard about the physics department's intro quantum course, this might even be the best class for anyone interested in that subject (although there are a few classes on chemical equilibrium at the beginning). In summary: take the course! It's totally different from Pchem 1 and very interesting material.",
                "I would only recommend the course of required, as it is incredibly difficult.",
                "Yes, it's a great course. However, most people who are taking this course are usually taking it for major requirements. Don't let the work rating scare you away. The weekly workload is very manageable, but be prepared to set aside a decent chunk of time to study before the exams. Having taken linear algebra (or having previous knowledge of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues) will help a lot with understanding the earlier portions of this course.",
                "Most students in the class are Chemistry and Chem Eng majors, with a few MB&B majors sprinkled in between. So if you are looking at this course, you probably have it as a mandatory requirement (or at least can satisfy a requirement). I enjoyed the second semester better than the first, especially with Prof. Vaccaro who is just so knowledgeable about the content and so prepared for the students' questions. I don't know much about the alternatives but I would say that this class gives solid understanding of the math and background in lecture but also tests more conceptual understanding and application of model systems. It was satisfying to finish the course.",
                "If you are looking to learn more about the theoretical foundations of quantum mechanics, I would recommend this course. Most likely, students in this course have to take it as part of their major. If a student is a Chemical Engineering major and not in ABET, I would not recommend this course as it is mainly useful in the theoretical sense and may not have that many applications to their major."
