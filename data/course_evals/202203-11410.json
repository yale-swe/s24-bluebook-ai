                "Strengths were the interesting design projects (type design, line compositions, visual identity), weaknesses were the long (and a bit tedious) hours outside of class spent working on the projects. Improvements could be to allocate more class time for work time and for more regular canvas messages on what is expected for each class period.",
                "I do not think that any course at Yale should be offered earlier than 9:00am. The timing of this course was the main detriment to my learning in it.",
                "This was one of my most, if not the most, favorite classes at Yale. Henk is a state of the art professor and we need more professors like him at Yale.",
                "i enjoyed the compositions by hand. i would change the visual identity project to something that more effectively applies the skills of the composition exercises. i think that the final critiques should've been more empathetic/supportive and i think that hard work should be rewarded because i honestly spent too many hours on my work for this class out of sheer passion and desire to improve--though it feels like this sabotaged me in the end. by the final assignment, the process was unrewarding because i had put in a lot of effort, and it was jarring/upsetting to have a guest come to our final critique who shot down my work. Especially as someone who is a lower income woman of color and already intimidated by the art world, this experience deterred me from taking more graphic design classes here because it was a very discouraging experience to have in an introductory class (I had taken Basic Drawing the semester prior and the experience was always uplifting as it was critical/constructive). This being said, the final critique was the only negative experience i had with this class; i really appreciated my professor and my tf. At the same time however, feedback from either of them made us as a class change our designs to fit their tastes i believe moreso than to help us strengthen our own creative voices which is definitely a nuanced/gray area when it comes to receiving feedback on any creative work."
