   "comments": [
    "I gained a lot of knowledge on modern theater, learned new means of defining plays and understanding the context of theater, and developed critical textual analysis skills.",
    "We learned how to critically analyze newer theatre works and track the trends and changes over the recent years. Also, examined what the plays are asking of us as the audience.",
    "I learned about less mainstream theatre and broadened my understanding of what works have been created more recently. Hearing my classmates share individual reactions to plays provided a fascinating insight into how everyones experiences influence how they view a work of theatre.",
    "I learned about the art of dramaturgyspecifically, analyzing recent developments and movements in American and European theater. I honed my writing skills, and learned stronger ways to communicate about theater. I feel much more comfortable in terms of my ability to discuss and evaluate theatrical productions going forward.",
    "I gained an extremely good insight into contemporary and avant-garde US and British theater:  the course delivered \"what it promised on the can\", which is what I wanted.\r\n\r\nI considerably developed my critical analytical skills in relation to text and in understanding how theatricality brings text alive.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of plays written by contemporary black playwrights served to develop my understanding of the ways in which black people look at the world and the challenges they face.  \r\n\r\nThe new modes of theatricality employed by playwrights studied on the course have inspired me and made me think about the possibilities for any creative writing in which I might dare to engage.  \r\n\r\nIn these senses, it is no exaggeration to say that the course had a meaningful, life-changing effect on me.  \r\n\r\nThe course was truly and wonderfully educative.",
    "I learned how to tackle reading a play. I had read plays before, namely Shakespearean plays, as well as some older American pieces (A Raisin in the Sun, The Crucible) and even several centuries old English drama (The Beggar's Opera), but I'd never read a piece of modern drama--American or British. My view of \"what\" modern theater is was fairly limited. I wasn't really aware or knowledgeable about the modern theater scene when it came to straight plays; my knowledge lies in musical theater. I learned to and have gained an appreciation for many of the playwrights that we discussed and whose work we read. I also learned how to craft an analysis of a piece of theater in performance and also in written form."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: engaging, great syllabus, fantastic and kind teacher\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Needs better trigger warnings",
    "Maybe a clearer delineation of how all the plays fit together? Or why it is important to read? (but then again that's kinda the point and the question we as a class had to discover).",
    "The selection of plays was very strong and made for very engaging material as the basis for our discussions. The course could be improved with slightly more structure in the conversations that would allow more students to participate more easily. Break out sessions with less people is another way that students could have more time to discuss in a class period.",
    "I loved this course. Simply put, each class was exciting and wonderful. The discussions were fruitful and the lectures were very informative and entertaining. Each class held my full attention, which is no easy feat with three-hour long Zoom classes.",
    "The strengths of the course were quite simply (a) Professor Marc Robinson's inspiring teaching (addressed further in section 9 below); and (b) the particular curation\/selection and pairing of plays each week. \r\n\r\nThe \"weaknesses\" of the course are simply the shortcomings inherent in on-line teaching (obviously necessary in a pandemic) which deny easy opportunities for informal and anecdotal interactions between instructor and student, and among students - over beers or coffees or outside the seminar room, etc.  The course is fairly intense and this is likely to reduce opportunities for students to discuss matters on-line outside the classroom except through the Discussions page, but the Discussions page will inevitably inhibit casual expressions and explorations of views because it feels like a showcase even if posts are not graded.  I didn't notice students sharing personal emails. But perhaps they did. The upshot of this is that - maybe - personal interactions outside Canvas should be actively encouraged to try to replicate a bit more of \"the student experience\".  \r\n\r\nIt is less than ideal to study any play without seeing it, at least in a filmed version.  But of course theaters are closed and not all plays are available to view on video.  It would be unsatisfactory to exclude the study of plays merely because they are not available to view on video. Thus I am not advocating for plays on film only.  That would be unrealistic and self-limiting.  In fact, I think the course provides a good selection of plays that are available to view.",
    "Strengths: Marc really tried to incorporate a large breadth of modern theater. I really enjoyed reading works from all different points in time, given the restricted timeframe of what would be considered theater \"now.\" The workload is very manageable; blog posts were a great space to vent\/discuss\/ask\/ponder, and provided a great springboard for discussion in class. The papers were very open-ended. I also enjoyed the opportunity to watch some of the plays, especially given our COVID restrictions and inability to see the plays in person--we made it work, and I appreciated that a lot!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not much. I think there was tendency for specific individuals to dominate discussion, and it felt like Marc would consistently engage with these students time and time again. Their discussion posts were the ones who merited discussion, so-to-speak. As such, it made it difficult for me to speak up and come up with something interesting\/valid\/meriting speaking, so I didn't do a whole lot of talking in class. Needless to say, I enjoyed listening. But if there could be a more concerted effort to make sure everyone is included in the discussion, that would be great. Because it did feel like a lot of dominating. My other critique, in the papers. While I had no issues with the writing of the papers, I feel like \"choose your own adventure\" is not really my style... what I mean is, I'd appreciate guidance\/a prompt\/cursory details regarding what the paper topics should be. Otherwise, I don't feel like what I'm doing is super productive, if that makes any sense... Like, I sign up for courses and then the papers are all \"make up your own prompt\"; I didn't sign up to do that, I'd rather be showing my knowledge of a subject within the instructor's framework. That's not to say, again, that this is a problem. Just my two-cents on the whole concept of not providing prompts!"

    "100%. Its a great way to become more educated on modern theater!",
    "Yeah! It was great to get more acquainted with modern theatre literature.",
    "I would! It was a very interesting class and I looked forward to coming each day.",
    "I would recommend this courseor any other taught by Professor Robinsonto anyone interested in drama or literature.",
    "Yes.  I would recommend it to any student who has a passion for theater and, crucially,  the commitment,  time and intellectual rigour to engage in it fully.  The relatively small class size and the instructorship of a leading Professor mark it out as a course of the highest quality.  It creates pressure to keep up.  It takes time to read and process plays; the course requires intense consideration of at least 4 plays a week.  It is certainly not a lightweight summer course of the type that some universities might provide.",
    "Absolutely, without a doubt. I'd say you'd have to have a cursory desire to learn, or an interest in theater, whether it be plays or musical theater works. You'd also have to prepared to read 'controversial' material -- and I put this in quotes as, is anything *really* controversial anymore? You have to be prepared to be uncomfortable, perhaps even repulsed. But that's the joy of reading these plays. They'll surprise you every time. You might not \"get\" them, but you'll enjoy reading them. I didn't like every play we read, but I certainly learned something from each."
