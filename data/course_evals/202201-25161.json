                "This class encouraged a lot of thought on creative design. The various ways you can approach design like with diagetic prototypes, starting with the material and working towards a usage, prototyping, and iterative design. As opposed to Making It, it focuses less on creating a tangible end product that can be marketed out to a target audience, but rather focuses more on using your imagination to just make something work in a short period of time and then iterating on that same product and seeing what new divergent or convergent paths you end up taking with it.",

                "i thought this was going to be a course about strategies for solving engineering design problems. instead it was a bunch of theoretical nonsense that didn't actually help or improve the way i solve problems. it wasn't even really about engineering at all, so that felt misleading. i also found the fast-paced play\/explorative approach to design to encourage wastefulness with materials, and did not teach anything about the actual process of developing a plan to create something. the projects were all self-directed so it was nice to work on things i was interested in doing, but sometimes more guidance about what they were looking for would have been appreciated. the timeline for the final project was also way too compressed, and time earlier in the semester could have been better organized to give more time at the end. there are a few group projects,  but they are very manageable and it was actually really helpful to have a group to depend on for those projects. although there was group critique each week and lots of verbal feedback, there has never been any concrete graded feedback at any point during the semester, so it is impossible to know how you are doing\/if you are doing enough.",
                "Strengths were creating different and interesting projects every week and receiving feedback from other students although some feedback would just make me feel better about what I created.\r\n\r\nI think that the criteria for critiquing others projects should be greater that way every student can improve their design skills",
                "Strengths are that the project are open ended so you can really do anything.",
                "This course did a good job in giving us super open ended projects, so everyone in the class would create really different and interesting projects. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: didnt get any grades back, unclear what kind of documentation was expected every week, the classes were 2 hours long and we would critique everyones projects rather than discuss or learn new class material.",
                "This course teaches you a different way of thinking. It's very hands on, very student-driven, very project based, very reliant on student interaction. That is its core strength: a different way of teaching that allows you to explore ideas, build off of other people, and be a part of a creative, inventive environment. There are very few \"rules\" or guidelines for what you need to do, which gives you so much freedom to just take something and run with it. Its main weakness is a lack of organization or clarity. You don't really know how you're being graded or how you're supposed to be documenting your work.",
                "Strengths: hands-on learning, supportive environment, experience getting critiqued, different from most other yale classes, creativity encouraged\r\nWeaknesses: lack of clear instructor feedback, overall structure\/arc of class could be more clearly defined"

                "I didnt learn much from this course, to be honest. It was far too open ended in my opinion. The assignments were frustratingly vague. I thought we were going to learn tangible problem solving strategies and prototyping techniques, but there was really zero formal technical instruction. The only way you could have learned a lot from the class would be if you deliberately chose projects to push yourself. This sounds good on paper, but in practice most students have a crazy schedule and if you give a super vague prompt they wont choose to give themselves a bunch of extra work for no real reason. The professors didnt seem to treat those who put in a ton of work on projects any differently than those who just slapped something together. This kind of everyones work is equally good treatment discouraged students from pushing themselves I think.",
                "This class was really cool and definitely one of a kind. You will absolutely learn a lot. However, the end projects are very arduino heavy so if you dont like arduinos this may not be the class for you. Also theres virtually no feedback regarding grades at all so if you are someone who cant stand not knowing where they stand this may not be the class for you. Projects were very interesting, although you can expect to dedicate a large amount of time outside of class time to working on projects.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone else excited by the idea of completing projects from start to finish every week. Every project is tailored towards making you think through the design process from the technical components of the project to the ultimate usage\/goal\/audience of the end product. Although, the stakes generally aren't too high, and projects don't necessarily need to be fully fleshed out since it's understood that  a week is hardly enough time to make any sort of perfect project. Although I didn't feel like I learned much tangible elements of design, I did have a lot of fun just being at the ceid and getting to use the resources to its fullest to make whatever project I could think of (with some limitations). Joe is willing to give you whatever resources you need to make your project happen. So while the first few projects are a little restrictive in nature, by the final project you were basically given free reign to make anything you wanted. It was a lot of fun, even though it was stressful having to think of something new every week. But if you love the idea of spending class in the ceid and getting the opportunity to work on project after project all semester long, this is the class for you!",

                "Yes, if youre interested in design or being creative with engineering.",
                "Yes. This is such a cool course for someone looking to get exposed to the tools in the CEID and learn about building things. This course is not for students that need step by step instructions on what to do: it gives you very little guidelines, allowing you the freedom to explore whatever ideas you find interesting. A lot of it is figuring things out on your own, which is challenging and fun. You also are with a selection of really cool students with a mix of experiences and expertise, creating an amazing environment to work together and build cool things. As long as you put in some effort and care about the course, you will do well.",
