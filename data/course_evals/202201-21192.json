                "Because this is the first year Prof. Berry is teaching the course so it was a bit all over the place. We didn't really devote much time to actually learning the software so that was a bit stressful for me. Our TA Johannes was incredibly helpful in providing guidance.",
                "The course moved quickly, and we'd often have to learn a tool and use it to create something in a span of only a few days. However, I would say this is probably more of a feature of the class and not a bug - it was incredible to be able to tinker with new tools, and most times in groups, to create fun and interesting things.",
                "Strengths - a fun class\r\nWeaknesses - you do not really learn a lot. most classes are just lectures and have no room for sharing your thoughts.",
                "It was amazing how many guest speakers we got to meet! I really enjoyed hearing from practicing artists about their creative process. I also really liked listening to Justin talk in class, whenever he would bring up his own art or other artists' work. I wish we had more classes like that where we could discuss specific works in the context of technology and arts practice. \r\n\r\nI also wish the 4 main projects had been more evenly distributed throughout the semester. It felt like we spent up to half the class doing Altspace VR with Unity, and then we had 3 projects in the second half of the semester, which felt super rushed. Nonetheless it was great to get exposure to the IFmagic interface and to an AR project that was actually deployed in the world, and to work on a final project that we had 100% freedom with, so I wouldn't want to sacrifice any of those experiences. Maybe the photogrammetry or Unity portion of the class could have been shortened. It was kind of easy to disengage from in-class software demos in that earlier half of the course. Maybe those classes could be reformatted as lab sessions with a partner, where we collaboratively work through the steps of a tutorial. Then everyone would be paying active attention and it might go a lot faster!",
                "The course material is very interesting and informative, but it here should be more workshops during class.",
                "Strength of the course was Justin's knowledge and the discussion we could have. Weakness was the pacing of the course and lack of assignment time.",
                "Passionate lectures always, love to see him talk. Need more help/structured tutorials on the technical side. Also the class could benefit a lot from a better classroom. With that amount of people inside, the lack of ventilation or sunlight drained my energy almost every time, not to mention the clowns upstairs."

                "Yes I would recommend this course. The professor is very understanding and helpful",
                "The course would definitely need to be improved. In theory the content and skills sounds really cool and exciting to pick up, but in practice, Prof. Berry ended up going on a lot of tangents that were mildly interesting but it was difficult to pay attention sometimes as the class is 2 hours long and he would sometimes talk the whole time. He is a super kind and caring person, and it was his first time teaching the course, plus there were a lot of Covid things to deal with so there's that to consider too.",
                "Yes, highly recommend.",
                "Yes, but only if it is revised so more focus is placed on the projects and learning",
                "If you have no prior experience to Unity, then this class would be a pretty good introduction. If you already know how to develop for VR in Unity, then it might not be the best use of your time to sit through a bunch of classes which are just software demos. If you've worked in Unity and you like it, then you'll enjoy this class. The exposure to photogrammetry, AR development, and expanded interfaces was also accessible and interesting. I would probably recommend this class to art students who are interested in working with technology in their arts practice!",
                "Yes! I learned a lot and this course provides an excellent framework to understand our digital world.",
                "Yes, I would. Although this course could benefit from increased organization, it was the first time Professor Berry taught this class, and in the future, I expect the class to benefit from this as he has a great teaching style. Professor Berry is one of the only professors I've had that makes you feel truly comfortable in the classroom and he really knows how to create a space where discussion is easy and fruitful. Although the course was a tiny bit all over the place, I did enjoy going to class, and felt welcomed there.",
