    "There was little to no oversight on my project, with considerable disorganization within the research group. I did not receive much guidance from the PI, or other graduate and post-doctoral students in the group. I would have learned and accomplished a lot more if I had been paired with a student or faculty member who could guide me in the complicated theoretical components to the wet lab work. It was extremely difficult to digest manuscripts independently because the learning curve of the material was extremely steep."

   "comments": [
    "I believe there is a version of this semester of research that is quite smooth and intellectually satisfying, however I did not have this experience. In order for the semester to be successful, the research should be overseen more closely by post-doctoral students or faculty. I enjoyed learning on my own in the wet lab, but would have been able to accomplish something more meaningful with guidance."
