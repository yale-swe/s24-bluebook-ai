                "I think that the exercises in the Coursepack did not help my learning at all. Rarely did I feel like they aligned with the exams, which led me to independently study the modules and grammar on top of any Coursepack materials. I think that this course could be improved by updating the coursepack or honestly just going without it (the audio exercises, which are a bulk of the coursepack, were long and I don't think helped to improve my French fluency whatsoever)",
                "I dont feel like a I learned a lot of new material for the amount of work I did. I think it was good the class met every day but it was tough that the professor didnt use the syllabus or show sympathy for students who followed the syllabus after she decided to change the homework later on.",
                "The course itself was fairly well organized as each unit covered a specific book or movie, but I felt that the inclusion of grammar was random and poorly integrated as it would seemingly not tie into anything else that was being taught.",
                "The teaching of grammar was very clear and easy to understand. Also the clips for Jules et Jim (final film of semester) really helped push me to the level of understanding the spoken French in that movie a lot better. The weakness of the class was that there wasn't enough time to practice spoken French I think this is my weakest aspect of the language and I struggled to improve it relative to other aspects."

                "I would not recommend this course to another student because I feel that other language departments have better workloads and grading policies. I find it very arbitrary that the French dept. grades anything below a 95% an A-, when other depts. usually deem grades above a 92% or 93% as an A. This is especially difficult to grapple with considering that the highest grades offered on many assignments aren't even above a 95% (like a 94 being the highest grade on some Redactions) , so how is anyone expected to receive an A in the class? So, unless the student does not care about their GPA, I would not recommend this course to another student.",
                "No, I would only take this class if you feel that you naturally excel at French. This course is pretty fast paced, and the tests are really difficult. Reading comprehension is a big part of your grade. If you have time to carefully go through each chapter of the books assigned to understand it, then yeah take the course. The audio sections of the tests are pretty fast-paced, so if you struggle with listening do not think this class will help you. Self-study or get a tutor to help you in the areas you struggle in and then come back. I especially don't recommend taking 5.5 credits while taking this class.",
                "There wasnt a lot of choice for French four so here you are.",
                "It is difficult for me to say if I would recommend the course to another student because it is hard to separate the course itself from my professor. The course itself is what I imagine most L3 language courses to be like, but my experience with my professor was poor enough to not have enjoyed the class whatsoever."
