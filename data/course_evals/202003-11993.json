                "I think the deadlines were a bit early. I liked when the deadlines for homework got moved to Saturday.",
                "Having pre-recorded lectures to allow students to watch the lectures was excellent such that students could pace themselves.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are far too many problems with this course. The first few quizzes were written absolutely terribly will little to no clarity. Considering this is a biology class that values conciseness and clarity, it felt antithetical to have questions that could be interpreted in various ways. Grading among TAs seemed inconsistent and there was no mention whether or not grades would be scaled based on how a TA grade. (For example, in CHEM 222L\/223L (Organic Chemistry I\/II Lab), grades would be scaled based on how harshly a particular TA graded but there was no mention whether or not this applied to BIOL 103.) [In brief, there is a general lack of clarity behind grading.]\r\n\r\nInstructors and\/or teaching fellows oftentimes muted Piazza posts asking for clarity about when quizzes would come out or how grades would be determined and this can be extremely stressful for students. On the first day of class, Prof Irish announced that the top 20% of students would achieve an A in this class. This arbitrary cutoff can only make students feel more stressed about their performance to do well in the class. Given that assessments were open note, students' grades were probably going to be in a tighter distribution than if closed book examinations. Further, this only promotes a competitive environment where students feel less inclined to help each other as grading is relative to peers. \r\n\r\nAnother major problem with the course was the lack of preparation for quizzes. I understand one goal of the BIOL sequence is to teach students how to write a research proposal. However, not providing students PSETs\/practice questions for quizzes makes it especially hard for students to feel prepared before taking a quiz. Thus, the class could be improved by providing practice problems\/practice quizzes. If the class would like to continue with a research proposal assignment, I would recommend better pacing and perhaps making example grants available to students. Alternatively, asking groups of students (2-3) to write a proposal and having PSETs similar to BIOL 101\/102 would better prepare students for quizzes.\r\n\r\nThis course could be improved by providing students with greater clarity in the grading and changes in assignments (as aforementioned).",
                "the lectures often covered too much information, and it was hard to gauge what was relevant (due to various examples, concept, etc.).\r\ngrading of quizzes was often slow, and you wouldn't know how you did until last minute.\r\nthe quizzes themselves often had oddly worded questions, it was hard to know what each question was actually asking. in this way, there seemed to be a gap in instructor expectations and student results.\r\nthe teaching team did a good job organizing everything given the situation!",
                "The structure of the class was odd (each week had lectures, an open note quiz, and a discussion section), but that was probably inevitable for distance learning. I think more clarity on the grading structure would've improved the experience and made it feel less \"cutthroat\" when the quiz distributions were released (maybe I was the only one who felt that way...)\r\n\r\nI didn't find the proposal writing homeworks interesting or helpful (for me they were more frustrating, but perhaps that can be chalked up to my personal preferences). I definitely would've preferred more standard problem sets that engaged directly with the material.",

Piazza was a good tool to clear up some confusions that may have come up during lecture\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the quizzes were poorly designed - oftentimes misleading distribution of points and confusing wording of questions. Discussion sections didn't feel very useful and felt unnecessary",

There was a lot of great structure (thanks to Prof. Lin) which made the course go smoothly.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The Quizzes were on either extreme. They were either pretty easy, or had random, in depth questions that really weren't a good reflection of the lecture. The quizzes take a lot more work than you think to study for, and its hard to get a good grade on them for those who don't have a strong biology background.",
                "The grading had a pretty quick turnaround and clear expectations at the very beginning of the semester. However, a few weeks in the grades started to come in very slowly and we would often be 2 weeks behind on quiz grades which made it really difficult to evaluate our performance in the course. In addition, there was not much response to feedback. The lectures were interesting, but the course organization was a bit odd.",

My TA was also fabulous and was so responsive to emails and questions. Professors and TAs are very active on Piazza. \r\nWeaknesses: Because this class was online and the lectures were pre-recorded, I think there was a disconnect between Professor Irish and the students. I wish there had been an informal office hours of a Q&A section during normal class time so we would have some in-person contact as opposed to just pre-recorded lectures.",

We often had to research the technology available outside of class which sometimes led to confusion",
                "Strength: The prerecorded lectures were good.\r\nWeakness: Some quiz questions were very vague and could lead to multiple interpretations. For some quizzes, I spent many hours studying, but got full questions marked wrong because I interpreted the questions differently. Also, I feel like some questions have multiple possible answers, but if your answer doesnt match the answer key, then its completely wrong. However, I was scared to do a regrade because I of the chance that I might get an even lower score.",
                "Even though the course was remote, there were many opportunities to interact with faculty and TAs which it made it much more personable.",
                "Strengths: very well-organized. I never felt as though I had to struggle to find resources to support my learning. I also thought the content was pretty interesting. The homework assignments, while challenging early in the semester, were very interesting and fun. I found the grant-writing portion of this course to be super rewarding. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Quizzes were extremely stressful, in part because they were open-note and the average was generally pretty high. As a result, the distinctions between A\/A- for this class will largely be arbitrary (very easy to slip to an A- by misreading 1\/2 quiz questions). So in that regard, it was a frustrating course to take, although I doubt that these issues will carry over when the class is in-person again. It was an odd choice to refrain from answering most logistical questions on Piazza. It was also suuuuper aggravating to take quizzes without knowing our scores on the previous  2 quizzes.",
                "Weekly quizzes are a huge strength over midterms. However, I found the course highly inaccessible without enrichment (Sam Lin is amazing) and I feel like it could have been more accommodating for students in hard situations.",
                "I wish that there had been more interaction with Dr. Irish, such as maybe doing half pre-recorded lectures and half live or doing a live Q and A session.",
                "The course was organized well and all the resources were easily accessible. The TA's were fantastic and the lecture was very clear.",
                "Strengths- Samantha Lin loves her students and any course she is involved in is wonderful. \r\nWeakness- Pre-recorded lectures that are nothing but powerpoints are the hardest to pay attention to. I dreaded going to the media library to watch another boring Powerpoint lecture.",
                "Prof Irish's lectures can be kind of disorganized. I spent a LOT of time trying to give them structure to make sense of them in my mind. Really relied on the excellent peer tutors.",
                "I liked the asynchronous aspect to it, it allowed me to learn at my own pace, while the discussion sections offered support for the readings. The homework was engaging and challenging, but fair.",
                "Strengths: amazing prof and teaching team! content was super interesting, great way to learn how to write a proposal\r\nWeakness: not enough chances to apply knowledge from lecture because psets were all about the proposal",
                "The only strength that I found for this course was that the pre-recorded lectures allowed us to work at our own pace.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I did not enjoy this course at all. Professor Irish's explanations were not always clear. Many times, students would be left extremely confused after the lecture videos, often having to resort to Piazza or other YouTube videos to learn about the lecture content.\r\n\r\nThe weekly quizzes were extremely stressful and confusing. Most of the time, I would have to guess at what the question was asking. These questions seemed to be designed to trick students. Even if I had studied every day for 10 hours, I do not think my quiz grades would have improved at all. Instead of having us spend so much time on research proposals, I think we should have received problem sets that had questions similar to the quizzes. At the very least, we should have gotten practice problems. The quizzes were 60% of our grade, and I thought it was extremely unfair for us to have to take these quizzes without any practice.\r\n\r\nI also thought it took way too long for our quizzes to be graded. Many times, it would take TWO WEEKS for us to receive our quizzes back. This was very inconvenient because it made it hard for us to learn from our mistakes in time for the next quiz.\r\n\r\nWe were also left in the dark about the grading policy. At the beginning of the semester, we were told that only the top 20% of grades would receive As. This led to a very toxic environment, as students were not always inclined to help others, as their own grades depended on their peers' grades.  \r\n\r\nBefore this class, the field of genetics seemed very interesting to me, and I even thought of pursuing it as a career path. However, this course gave me 6-weeks of unending stress, and it has caused me to lose almost all interest in genetics.",
                "Some strengths of the course were definitely the research proposal we wrote and discussions of different papers since that really helped us develop scientific reasoning and questioning skills. However, the quizzes were often extremely confusing and stressful. Lecture content always seemed straightforward, but we never had any chance to practice our application of that knowledge, making the quizzes really difficult. I don't have a problem with the fact that the quizzes often made us extrapolate or apply the knowledge in an experimental setting, but I do think that it is unfair to do so without giving us any resources to practice these skills. \r\n\r\nReleasing grading for the quizzes was also slow, so we weren't getting feedback quickly enough on where we stood in terms of our understanding. Sometimes, it would take up to 2 weeks to get back our 30-minute quizzes. The grading curve was also super unclear, adding a lot of additional stress. Also, quizzes made up 60% of the grade, greatly outweighing any other work, and further adding stress to students.",
                "Due to the circumstances, the class would have been more helpful if they were synchronous.",
                "Strengths:\r\nRubric for HW assignments was posted promptly at the start of the semester\r\nTAs were accessible and the course coordinator did foster class community sentiment by hosting lunches\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nAt time, quiz grading seemed more based on the ability of the student to guess what precise terms the instructors wanted rather than an understanding of the question. The class also was not well-integrated with the other biology modules such that the HWs and quizzes reflected a cumulative understanding.",
                "They were very accomodating with the current circumstances of the pandemic. I think what could be improved is a quicker turnaround time for receiving quiz grades back because I was very unsure of how I was doing in the class and didn't realize until too late that I needed do a lot better on future quizzes.",
                "The quizzes weren't necessarily always fair provided what was taught in the class.",
                "Strengths: \r\n\r\nI really liked the homework assignments, the TF's were really knowledgeable and helpful, Professor Lin and Professor Irish were always incredibly accessible and helpful, and the course was really well organized in terms of content and material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n\r\nI would have preferred if at least some lectures were synchronous, rather than having them all be recorded. I feel like that would give the class more of a real classroom feel.",
                "Strengths of this course is how organized it is and how much support students are provided. A weakness I believe was the ambiguity of the quiz questions that made it difficult to get good scores at first as I wasn't sure exactly what the questions were asking, and if I thought I did I always seemed to be missing a specific detail that ended up losing me points.",
                "The strength was definitely the format of the homeworksI loved how they built on each other and that we have a final product that Im very proud of! I think I learned a lot that is very transferrable to actual biological research that Im excited to use in my research lab.",
                "The lectures were very good, I would have liked more direction with the quizzes and studying for the quizzes. Also, the HW is inherently confusing, but not sure how that would be fixed.",
                "It was pretty ok, more live engagement would have been nice",
                "Professor Irish did a great job making the Zoom material engaging and accessible. However, because it was a Zoom course, it definitely felt impersonal.",
                "I thoroughly enjoyed the course, the instructors made sure to have resources available and known, which made it extremely strong. There were no weaknesses.",
                "Professor Lin kept this course extremely organized for me, and Professor Irish did a great job of keeping the lectures engaging and interesting through an online format.",
                "The powerpoint were not exactly engaging, but the course was well-formatted, and the material was presented clearly.",
                "The topic was engaging; however, especially towards the beginning, this class was very stressful  with so much homework and difficult quizzes that would have been much better if we were given more time.  (timing of quizzes got better towards the end of the class).  Grading of the quizzes in this class was oftentimes harsh.  My regrade requests received no response.",
                "The lectures were pretty straightforward and there wasn't a lot of lecture material. Most of the quiz questions were fair but some probably should have been read over a few times by people looking for ambiguity before releasing them to students. They did not set grade cutoffs prior to the course and so it was clearly competitive. It's entirely possible they scaled down as they were ambiguous in how letter grades would be assigned from the beginning. I sincerely hope they rethink this competitive policy in the future, as it is not supportive of collaboration and potentially drives students away from STEM at Yale.",
                "I thought some of the quizzes were excessively difficult and did not really recapitulate what we learned in class. More classtime could be spent discussing how to apply the information and facts we learned to solve actual genetics problems before testing us on it.",
                "This class was well set even remotely. I dont think there were any weaknesses",
                "I think Professor Irish and Prof Lin both did a good job with the lecture content and helping the students in whatever way they could with the homeworks and understanding lecture content. SInce most of the class hasn't written a research proposal before, the profs were very understanding and wanted us to know that we were going to be confused since it was our first time, but Prof Lin really did help through additional sessions. However, I do think that the quizzes were kind of very specific and asked of us things that I didn't know we were supposed to explicitly mention, but otherwise the class I think was overall well done.",
                "The strengths of the course were the topic materials and the lecture information by Professor Irish. It was difficult to take the quizzes due to the wide range of interpretation for each question. I found myself spending more time trying to decipher what the questions were asking than focusing on thinking through the question. Similarly, I found that studying and course engagement did not correlate as much with the quizzes as with past bio modules. This could be improved by adding more problem-set based questions or going through more content during discussion section. The course could also be improved by including a semester feedback tool or something similar. It was difficult to have no place to give feedback until the end of the semester.",
                "It was online when I took it, so it wasn't as good as an in-person class. However, it is was still an amazing course and well-organized.",
                "This course was structured very well and I want to acknowledge the work that the teaching team did to adjust this course to the online format.",
                "I would have appreciated more interactions with the professor as well as more opportunties to ask her about the lecture.",
                "The professors are really engaging and open to feedback.",
                "I would like to learn more about plant development and other non-human animal development.",
                "I think this course was executed well given the tribulations of COVID.",
                "I loved the straightforward lecture and quiz format. It could be improved by revamping the quiz preparation. I don't think we were always well prepared to do what the quizzes we're asking us in regards to experiment analysis.",
                "This course was phenomenal. The lectures were very interesting.",
                "I really enjoyed the structure of the class. It was very consistent never had any big surprises. I wish we had a review session at the end of the week so we can ask questions. Piazza was a great addition!",
                "The quizzes were unfair and graded harshly. However, the instructors were kind.",
                "Strengths: teaching team and willingness to adapt to students and really help students learn.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes quiz questions seemed very obscure, but this was mostly changed towards the end of the course.",
                "The course was taught well considering online school. Practice quiz questions could have been available.",
                "Professor Irish is a very good lecturer, even online, and I did enjoy her recordings. Out of the four aspects of this course (lectures, section, homework, and quiz), the lectures were by far and away the best part. \r\n\r\nThat being said, this class was lacking in actually engaging the students in the class. I'm not so certain, but I don't think that a single lecture a week + boring section that talks about a paper remotely related to the topic of the class + homework that doesn't relate to the material is the best way to teach the course material, especially when it's so technical and difficult. The class was too ambitious, in my opinion, in trying to make the students develop their own hypotheses and conduct their own research. Maybe an entire BIOL class dedicated to biological research would do this job justice, but trying to do that AND teach genetics is too much. In addition, section, like in previous BIOL sequence classes, felt too disconnected from the main material and was even outright boring at times (though this may have to do more with the section leaders than the material).\r\n\r\nAnd don't get me started on the quizzes. Other than Q4 and Q5, the other 4 quizzes were outright confusing and convoluted. I'm not sure exactly what changed between BIOL101 and 103, but the quizzes in 101 were much easier to comprehend and answer. The quizzes in this class felt like I was deciphering an enigma code before answering the actual questions. I appreciate that you are trying to really test our understanding and not just surface knowledge, but there's only so much deep understanding you can examine in a 10-question, 30-minute quiz. If you want to do that, why not add midterms and finals to the class, where we can have much more time? I think it's not fair to the students to disguise these quizzes as quick and easy tests of knowledge and throw out extremely convoluted questions, where the tiniest mistake can get you 3.5 points out of 4 off. \r\n\r\nFinally, the grading in this class. I'm writing this after the grades have been released, but I can't view it yet since I haven't submitted this form yet. A genuine concern that I have is that I might not end up with an A in this class even with a 96 average. This could be a stupid fear to have, but valid when considering that this class is percentage based in grading. Why make an introductory class 20% A when most of the students are also premed? Do you understand the kind of culture you create when you do something like this among the most competitive portion of the student body? Without a doubt, BIOL103 was the most toxic class I've been in. \r\n\r\nMaybe the class is more engaging and enjoyable when live instead of remote. However, I kind of doubt it. The only thing that would severely be affected by being remote are the lectures and sections, and the lecture, as I said, is the best part of this class; and section, from my experience in 101 and 102, aren't really that much better live. And unless something is done to change the culture and atmosphere of the class, the class will continue to be a cesspool of toxicity and unnecessary competitiveness that shouldn't belong in an introductory class.",
                "It felt like the quizzes were disproportionately more advanced than the extent to which we covered them in lecture. The topics themselves were very interesting though.",
                "Strengths - very clear lectures, maps well to quizzes, much support from teaching staff, homeworks all lead to final project so had constant feedback\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - not very engaging if not very interested in the topic",
                "I thought the lectures were structured great but I felt that what could have been nice was practice problems for the quizzes because then we could have a better sense of what to expect",
                "This course presented information in the lectures very clearly. The one way that it can be improved would be fixing the wording of quiz questions so they are less vague.",
                "I thought the lectures were effective at explaining the material and the papers for discussion section made valuable ties between course material and real-world experiments. The research proposal was an intense time commitment and I think the Saturday extension was really helpful. It was hard to know where to draw the line between real-world evidence and research for the proposal and more hypothetical or arbitrary connections between for instance our gene of interest and the transcription factor. I think it was a valuable way of learning how to work with genetics databases and do background research and learn methodologies, but it would be helpful if the expectations around the project as a learning exercise versus a realistic proposal were more clear.",
                "Working on the research proposal in addition to the many lectures and quizzes was very overwhelming at times.",
                "Especially online, the bio 103 team did a wonderful job of organizing all the information and required things for the class. The weekly email laying everything out was really helpful.",
                "I thought the course was very well organized and taught very well. I thought Professor Irish's lectures were well put together and the slides were very informative.",
                "Comprehensive study guides, grading rubrics, and helpful TAs made for a smooth course.",
                "The research proposal was a major strength. I felt that the curved grading system was a weakness as the quizzes generally had little spread on scoring. I would like to see solid cutoffs for each grade made available at either the start of the year or at least midway through the course.",
                "I think this course was really well taught, especially in the circumstances under which all students are due to COVID-19.",
                "The class was well-taught and provided a very accessible teaching style. This lack of a need for background knowledge made the class easy to follow along but at times left me wanting a bit more information.",
                "Strengths  the course coordinator was very good! I always knew what I was supposed to do and when. The transition into 104 was smooth."

                "I don't think it was a particularly fun or interesting class, but you're probably required to take it. It wasn't a bad class, just alright. Much of the content may be familiar if you've taken AP Bio or such.",
                "Yes! Very very interesting but a lot of biology, so you should be interested in the content.",
                "I wouldn't recommend this course unless it was to fulfill a major\/pre-med requirement because given that it is an intro bio course, there are less opportunities to engage in specific fields of study.",
                "Definitely! I would say it's the best module of the Intro Bio sequence - content wise. Very interesting, great teaching team, and so well organized.",
                "If the course is required, then you don't really have a choice. Otherwise, I would in general not recommend the intro biology sequence.",
                "Certainly. By far my favorite course in the Intro Biology sequence.",
                "This is honestly my favorite biology course out of the intro sequence so far. If you're taking intro bio, it's likely for your major or pre-med requirements so you'll have taken 101\/102. For non-STEM people, it's unfortunate you have to take 101\/102 as prereqs because this would be a great class to learn how to write a grant proposal.",
                "Yes because it was the best-taught module in the bio sequence so far, in my opinion.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in studying biology as it provides a good basis for an important part of the field.",
                "definitely, especially with professor Irish.",
                "yes, good course",
                "Yes because the science taught is important to know and understand.",
                "If you have an interest in biology and also want an introduction to independent scientific writing then I would recommend this course.",
                "If you want an intro to genetics, sure. If you're taking this class, it's probably because it's a requirement. Definitely don't take intro bio if you're looking for a science gut.",

                "Only if you have to complete the intro bio sequence or are interested in genetics.",
                "Yes. Professor Irish has good intentions and cares for her students. However, the online format with the powerpoint lectures were a problem for both her and her students. I feel though this class would have been EXCELLENT in person!",
                "I would recommend this course to most stem students. Obviously as a fundamental bio course many stem students will need it but for non-stem majors the focus on scientific research might be much.",
                "Yes it's a good, interesting intro to developmental biology",

The content is definitely interesting, but the amount of stress this course caused me was significantly greater than any other Yale STEM course I have taken.",

                "I would recommend this course. Of the intro bio sequence, this has been the best part. Professor Irish is a great professor who does truly care about her students and wants to get to know them. The material is engaging and has really sparked in me a greater love for genetics. It offers a great overview of genetic principles, and I feel prepared to take upper level related courses as a result.",
                "Yes! The professors are always available to help, and are not condescending at all when giving it.",
                "Unless you like the topic; I found the course material to be interesting, but I would warn the student to be prepared for frustration.  I did end up getting used to it and the intensity waned towards the end of the class.",
                "I would recommend only if it's part of a premed requirement, otherwise this class is quite a bit of work and stress.",
                "Definitely... the teaching team is amazing and the concepts taught are necessary and very interesting",
                "I know that this class is a prerequisite for several majors and for Premed, so likely a lot of students are taking this as a requirement, but I would recommend students to take it if they do enjoy learning about development and how it is influenced at the genetic level.",

I would only allow a friend to take this class if they were a bio major, premed, or Credit\/D\/Fail'ing this class (and only if they had a genuine interest in genetics). If they didn't have to take this class and weren't super interested in the course material, I see no reason to take this class; in fact, I don't think that the amount of stress that comes with grades in this class, along with the lack of engagement, is worth it for anyone.",

                "This course is very solidly organized, assessment style is not very stressful and the final project is made easy to complete by the weekly check-ins through homeworks.

                "Yes, the lecture content is very interesting and explained pretty well.",
                "The information is very interesting, but it is a lot of work if you don't have to take it. The style of homework to create a proposal is very time consuming and challenging and ends up being most of the grade. The homework is not even based directly on class content.",
                "Yes, but if you're taking it, it's probably a requirement. Definitely take it with Professor Irish if you can.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, since it's broad approach to its subject matter leaves students with a robust knowledge of a very intricate field. The homework can be complicated at times but chatting with a TA will get you back on the right track.",
                "I would. The understanding of gene expression is invaluable to biological researchers and writing the proposal was an important, if enjoyable, experience.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student that needs this as an requirement or can take this as an elective. I really liked the material presented in this course, but the workload is heavier than several of the other classes I have taken, especially the homework projects.",
                "Yes, absolutely."
