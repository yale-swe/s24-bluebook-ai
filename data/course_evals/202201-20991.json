                "I had never taken a musical theater class before despite having performed in musicals for years! It was shocking to me how much I had been flying on pure instinct until this class--I felt like it gave me a much stronger handle on how to analyze a musical theater text and use it to craft a performance (and more broadly, the questions to ask myself when I'm approaching a musical theater song), how to create an authentic performance, and most importantly, the confidence to be myself more onstage and in an audition room. We have the ability to sing with live pianists every week, and meet/perform for a variety of professionals from the theater world that Annette brings in to give us a sense of what a dance call, audition call, or working with a music director is like.",
                "I learned how to take the next step when working on songs before I enter the room.",
                "I took THST 226 as a choreographer/director, so my experience in the course was different than the performers. I learned how to work with actors to create movement with intention, give notes concisely, and develop my skills in the rehearsal room. If you are a performer/director/choreographer, take this class! Annette is brilliant and cares so much about her students.",
                "This class helps you situate your approach to musical theatre performance in a deep tradition of composers, lyricists, directors, choreographers, and other performers.  I improved my own ability to tackle new material, but I also learned a lot about directing by watching Annette work.  If anything, I think I learned more about how to give good, concise, effective notes by watching her than I actually improved my performance skills.  Overall, I think what you'll get out of this class depends a lot on how work you do to prepare, and how much you've done workshop-y type things outside of Yale.",
                "I learned so much in this course. The way I look at a song and how to perform it has grown immensely. I learned about the way to approach learning a song, how to mine character from lyrics and music, and how to connect myself to my performance. I also learned a lot about the professional audition process and how I can put my best foot forward."

                "The strengths are that everyone gets to perform and workshop a lot of material that's new to them which is nice. Sometimes there can be a time crunch in regards to time per person's performance, though.",
                "She is incredibly in touch with her students, she is so wise, and she is so succinct.",
                "The way that Annette structures this course is amazing. She brings in a bunch of guests, people who range from choreographers to casting directors to music directors to actors. Their involvement is a huge strength of the course--hearing from them and performing for them (in a strictly learning/workshop capacity) was not only a super unique opportunity but also helped give us a sense of how the professional theater world works, in New York and in other places. I also thought that working with live pianists was a huge plus, and the ability to workshop pieces by stopping and starting and getting feedback and integrating it was very conducive to learning. Also, just working with Annette was a huge strength of the course. She's super smart and gives very helpful feedback almost effortlessly. \r\n\r\nThe time period of the course is just a little long for me--it's ok if you bring snacks. I definitely feel like I could have benefitted from another short break instead of one in the middle), but honestly that's a nitpick.",
                "I really liked how we each were encouraged to give thoughts on other classmates performances.",
                "Strengths: every student gets a lot of attention and feedback, the guest teachers are incredible. Annette is one of the best professors I've ever had. Take this class!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Covid created lots of issues with technology/Zoom performance, but Annette created solutions for every problem!",
                "Countless strengths. Amazing professor, very engaging class. My view on musical theater and the way I look at performing a song has grown and changed in a way I didn't even think was possible. The one weakness would be time management. On some days, the first person would have over 30 minutes to work their song, while the last person would get under 10. I think having a timer in place would be helpful. Otherwise, I have only positive things to say!"

                "YES! Hands down the most practical, interesting and fun theater class I have ever taken. Definitely for those who are not too shy about performing a whole song in front of classmates regularly, or for those who are shy but are willing/interested in trying to stretch their comfort zone in that way.",
                "Absolutely. Thus course does so much for your development as a performer.",
                "If you want to pursue choreography, performing, or directing, take this class! Each students receives so much attention and feedback.",
                "Yes.  If you are intersted in musical theatre, either professionally or otherwise, you will learn so much from this class.  Annette is an amazing professor.  She combines a very focused professionalism with a very comforting understanding that we all have lives outside of her class.  Highly recommend taking this class, as long as you are prepared to put in the work to make it worthwhile!",
                "100% YES. If you are able to get a spot, TAKE THIS COURSE. Learning from Annette chan ged the way I view musical theater performance. I was really able to push myself and grow in a way that is different from other performance opportunities at Yale. I also was exposed to new music and writers. I loved being able to watch my classmates perform and learn from them as well. The work I was doing for this class was always the highlight of my week. Annette created an accepting space that fostered growth. Could not recommend this course enough.",
