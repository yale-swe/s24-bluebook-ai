                "Basic knowledge of species counterpoint, thoroughbass harmony, and analysis of pieces through those tools. Learned how to compose counterpoint of various kinds to accompany a Cantus Firmus, and how to break down larger pieces in terms of their counterpunctual components.",
                "We learned counterpoint (4 out of 5 species) for the first half of the semester. Doing the counterpoint exercises, helped me become better at reading alto and bass clefs. Then we learned thoroughbass analysis and form analysis, specifically of binary form pieces. This class has made me more comfortable with form analysis, but I wouldn't say I'm to do it easily by any means.",
                "I developed skills in writing and understanding counterpoint, functional harmony, form\/structure, and analysis of all these elements combined. One of my favorite general insights was the contrapuntal basis of so much music, and the formal analyses were especially elucidating in this regard.",
                "Strict counterpoint, composing with thoroughbass figures, and formal analysis.",

                "This course offers a comprehensive survey of early contrapuntal music; first, the class begins with a fast-paced introduction to the various rules and species of counterpoint and how they interact in two, three, and four voices. Then, it moves into a greater discussion of harmony, introducing figured-bass (thoroughbasis) notation and expanding upon a general understanding of counterpoint. Finally, at the end of the course, it combines these two concepts to analyze pieces from the Baroque and Early Classical movement, focusing on binary form while also incorporating a little bit of music history. \r\n\r\nThis class was a great opportunity to dive into musical analysis for one of the first time -- amidst all of the knowledge of early music that is taught, one learns important skills of formal analysis and the ability to break down larger works into smaller, more manageable musical ideas. Many assignments involved also composing counterpoint melodies against a set musical idea, known as a cantus firmus.",

                "While we learned a decent amount about how to compose counterpoint, thoroughbass and perform form analysis, the way the class was structured (with all of the graded assignments piled on at the end of the semester) made the class more difficult than is probably deemed necessary. The assignments were difficult and class lectures alone did not provide the proper guidance needed to complete the assignments to the level expected of us. I wish there were more homework assignments earlier in the semester (on all of the things we would eventually be tested on) so that we could get some feedback and understand how we were going to be graded.",
                "The pacing of the class felt slightly off. We learned counterpoint way too quickly and it felt like we spent too much time on form analysis. It probably gives a good foundation for future theory courses.",
                "I imagine this course would have been much more enjoyable in person, in that we could have sung or played together, or watched the instructor play the piano, or do other interactive things like that. The early stage of the course was very difficult and fast-paced because we were zooming through species counterpoint, and it got much easier towards the end, so I think evening out the workload a little bit would make the class more enjoyable. The way the grades worked was a little stressful.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Harrison for sure. His insights and grasp of the material were astounding. Weaknesses: The pacing of the class. Especially when learning counterpoint, we only were able to practice each new species 1-2 times (max!) through the homework exercises, so my grasp of the content was never solid. But at least for counterpoint there were textbooks we could reference. For the harmony\/form, I only understood the material when I was rewatching a lecture 3 weeks later. In real-time, it basically required a miracle for me to understand what was going on during class.",
                "Strengths: taught me a lot about the technical aspects of counterpoint (I feel like I improved a lot in that regard), it was also nice to have exposure to how counterpoint and thoroughbass techniques can be used to analyze and break down pieces by famous composers. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I feel like the class didn't do enough to encourage collaboration or hands-on learning that much; it was mostly lecture-based, which is fine for content-heavy classes, but as a skill-based class I think some of the class time may have been better allocated to group work on the skills being taught\r\n\r\nHow it could be improved: include more group activities in class that involve practicing the skills that are being taught (i.e. group counterpoint challenge)",
                "The pacing of the units felt right consistently, and class lectures were always lucid and engaging. Doing the readings, completing the counterpoint exercises, and meeting the 12p deadline definitely took some getting used to early on, but worth getting the direct\/live feedback on people's work during class. Also, I thought thoroughbass practice could have been compressed a bit to leave more room either for Mount Parnassus or for more explanation of formal analysis (for example, I am still curious about labels such as \"rondo\" and \"sonata\" and wanted to see more of them in practice) -- although this could very well be that I came in already with some knowledge of thoroughbass. All in all, the quality of the exercises and teaching left no stone unturned and gave me a wonderful introduction\/foundation in the material.",
                "Strengths: You'll learn to more insightfully analyze the form and structure of music and learn how to write counterpoint that sounds good. Weaknesses: The speed of the course was too fast in the beginning. It would have been more helpful to spend more time on learning and practicing the species of strict counterpoint and less time on formal analysis. Because it was so fast in the beginning, the workload felt way too much for an intermediate level theory course.",
                "Due to the intensive work on counterpoint you will eventually become versed in the complex rules, however due to quick class pace and homework load it is difficult to keep up and learn everything quickly,",
                "Strengths: this class is extremely well taught, and the material is introduced in a way that is easy to follow; assignments are given after every lecture that apply lecture material, and the general structure of the class allows for a logical progression from easier musical ideas to more complex contrapuntal and harmonic analyses. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This was the first time the class was taught in its new form, and so at the beginning, it moved at a very brisk speed; a slightly more gentle approach at first may have helped foster a stronger sense of understanding earlier on. The professor, however, became quickly keyed into this and adapted his assignments\/lectures accordingly. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the course, through lots of practice and work, the class became much more manageable and easier to understand. Lastly, with regard to the assignments, a clearer understanding of the grading\/assignment structure at the beginning of the course would have been helpful.",
                "The layout of the course was a bit confusing and unhelpful: I think if we had started with harmony and figured bass before going deep into species counterpoint, the material might have felt more cohesive and cumulative."

                "The Zoom format worked surprisingly wellapart from the very occasional internet\/audio issues where are to be expected.

                "I would recommend this class to another student with caution. Unless some changes are going to be implemented next semester, this class is not suitable for people looking for an introduction to music theory (which is what many people come into the class thinking it will be). This class requires a lot of work and dedication and the student has little control over their grade (as all assignments are out of four points), so unless the student is willing to put in a lot of work and not care about their grade, this class will be frustrating.",
                "You should take this class only if you intend to take upper-level theory classes. I think this class only works for people at a very specific stage of music theory knowledge. Do not take this if you don't know intervals or chords, suck it up and take 110 first. If you're a musician and you want to take a fun music class, maybe take something else. Counterpoint is hard and thankless.",

If you are not interested in the course material and only want to satisfy the Lessons for Credit co-requisite, this may not be the course for you.",

                "I would recommend this to anyone with baseline music appreciation and instrument\/composition interest deeply invested in understanding classical music at a deep level. The class is fascinating and provided an excellent contrast with other music classes for me as someone interested in a vast variety of music.",
                "If you are interested in composition but don't have much experience, this is a good class to take to learn the basis of harmony in counterpoint and strict counterpoint. I would not recommend taking this class if you just need to fulfill a major or other requirement.",
                "I would only recommend this class to people who are deeply interested in learning counterpoint because the workload was very intense.  The amount of work and the results I got didn't match with my expectations. Not only that, people who already have a very good understanding of music theory would do well in this class.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student who desires to take a challenging, fast-paced class in counterpoint, harmony, and form. The course opened my eyes to a whole new world of musical analysis that was largely absent from my general lesson studies. The class is very well taught, and by the end of the class, you will feel like you have learned a great deal about music theory and general music history. \r\n\r\nIf you are planning to take this course, you should know that it is a lot of work, more than the typical course at Yale. Many nights were spent trying to find ideal solutions to counterpoint practice assignments and challenges, and the beginning of the course -- when you are trying to figure out how to use note processors, read different clefs, follow all the rules etc -- can be challenging. Do not be mistaken -- this is not a repeat of an AP music theory class. \r\n\r\nThat being said, the course gets much easier as you practice more and more. Professor Harrison expects a lot from his students; however, the reward is deep understanding of the basic framework of music. It has changed the way I examine works of musical literature, and I very much enjoyed applying the learning to various pieces by Bach, Beethoven, and other Baroque\/Classical composers. I highly recommend the class, just make sure that you have enough time in your schedule to allow for the workload it demands.",
                "I would take this course if you already have a strong grasp of intervals, can read alto, treble, and bass clefs without hesitation, and are highly interested in 1500-1800 music. Interest in music theory is crucial for this class--it's the only thing that makes challenging counterpoint homework feel more like intellectual exercises and less like frustrating chores.",
                "If you're really interested in the details and mechanisms of what makes Western classical music tick, take this class. If you're not excited by the prospect of poring over 12-measure cantus firmi three times a week in the homework assignments or don't want to be limited in scope to ~200 years of European music, take something else."
