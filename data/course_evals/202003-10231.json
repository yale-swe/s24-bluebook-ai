                "Strength is that the professor is very intelligent, communicative, and thoughtful. The workload was not high but I came out of the class feeling like I had learned something about a subject that I had previously known very little about. The use of movies (however sparingly) was also productive. The main weakness is the he does not invest very much in individual students. I didn't find a mentor or even someone who seemed to take any particular interest in me or my thoughts as an intellectual. Regardless, an enriching class. Just don't expect a hands-on experience.",

                "It is honestly hard to improve it. Students are kept engaged both by discussions with each other\/Prof. Phillips as well as by the requirement to present one text each over the course of the semester. I also liked that there weren't unnecessary papers during the semester - only one 2-pager to take stock of how we felt about the material. I'm excited for anyone who gets to take this in person.",
                "The syllabus was wonderfully constructed, and Professor Phillipss insights about each work were thought-provoking and illuminating. I wish we had more feedback on our written work throughout the semester, but then again, the major assignment was our end of term final paper.",
                "I didn't always feel like there was enough time allocated for students to discuss the works. I would have rather spent less time on the student introducing the work and more time on close reading and interpretation. Sometimes, it felt like Prof Phillips was trying to steer us towards his interpretation of the works, rather than facilitate open-ended discussion.",

Could not recommend more highly! One of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale.",
