I think my speaking skills particularly improved, though my writing, reading, and listening did as well. I now feel well-prepared to spend most of my summer in Taipei living and studying Chinese.",

                "Strengths - Sun Laoshi is amazing at giving examples for vocabulary usage. Just from attending lecture, you get a very good intuitive understanding of these new vocabulary words. She is also very patient and understanding, and excited to incorporate personal details that she knows about her students into the lectures.\r\nWeaknesses - I think there could be a little more focus on writing. There are only 2 or 3 essays/writing pieces a semester and maybe one or two more could be really helpful in making me more confident in writing.",
                "Strengths: course structure, TEACHER!!, in-class discussions, homework structure. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had received more feedback on our in-class speaking - sometimes tones/ungrammatical sentences would not be corrected, which made me confused on what the correct way to say something was.",
                "Strengths are the teachers and faculty",
                "Strengths: enthusiasm of teacher, variety of exercises, greater relevance to my interests and real world than CNHS 150, passion of classmates\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: In one sense, the schedule of this course was reliable in a comforting way. But sometimes the structure of class time felt repetitive, and I feel that we could benefit from more frequent class discussions rather than simply going through the lesson text, vocabulary, and grammar structures.",
                "Strengths: Sun laoshi is the best teacher ever and makes the class super engaging! The course material is super fun to read. The class includes so many different types of assignments so it doesn't get boring. Learned a variety of skills. Lots of detailed feedback that is really helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: way too much homework, which doesn't allow us enough time to engage with the material as much as we want to. Sometimes have to rush through homework so you don't spend all day every day doing Chinese homework."

I am super grateful to have studied Chinese with her and cannot sing her praises enough. I learned a lot through this course and it has inspired me to continue learning Chinese.",
