                "Learned about the role of music in the lives of women in 18th and 19th century Britain, and learned about the importance of music for social politics of the upper classes. This provided a wonderful historical context as we read Austen's Sense and Sensibility, Emma, and Pride and Prejudice. Throughout the class I developed analytic insights about Austen's works that made the readings so much more fruitful.",
                "Learned how to to look closely at literature through one specific lens",
                "I learned a lot about the inner workings of what happens in Jane Austens novels. I really liked taking things from the perspective of women, music, accomplishments, and social interactions between genders. I learned how to look at the novels and supplementary readings in a new way!",
                "I greatly enjoyed this course as I found it to be a combination of two of my favorite topics: literature and music. I loved gaining in depth knowledge on Austen's time and how it may have influenced her works. I learned more about the 18th century Britain and the role of women during that time. I gained knowledge regarding the music and culture of that period as well.",
                "I learned a lot about music as a domestic activity in the late 1700s and early 1800s. We discussed a lot about the role of music in gendered performance and the \"accomplishments\" race. Of course we also talked about Jane Austen, and how music features in Sense and Sensibility, Emma, and Pride and Prejudice, as well as various adaptations of these novels.",
                "I appreciated all the secondary readings and how they deepened my appreciation for the complex social dynamics of the novels. I learned about the nuanced role of music and accomplishment in women's lives during the 18th and early 19th centuries. I gained an appreciation for the difficulty of adapting a popular novel to the screen; I learned about the considerations that go into determining the soundtrack, casting, and setting.",
                "I learned about the role music played in signaling class and gender in the era of Jane Austen, and about how intwined it was with other modes of accomplishment and performance. I also learned how to think about big ideas through the lens of music, and how to write about music.",
                "Learned about the connection between music and class\/gender. We read Austen novels much more thoughtfully than I would have on my own and learned of the importance of music in the time."

                "Strengths: engaging seminar discussion, wonderful instructor, passionate students, fun topic of conversation\r\nNo weaknesses",
                "Its a very fun course, I loved the assignments, but discussions felt a bit repetitive sometimes",
                "I really liked the selected readings and the topics\/organization. I really liked it how we had groups of students lead the discussionsthat made it feel like we had more input and I liked how it made us engage with the material in a new way. For the week we led the discussion, it challenged us to really dive deep into the material and come up with our own questions. I also appreciated being graded on ideas and not our writing abilitiesthat made me feel more free to write what I wanted and not write just to get a grade. I also appreciated having a break in the middle as the seminar was two hoursthe once a week structure was great!",
                "Strengths: Professor Peritz is so lovely and kind and chill. The class is very fun -- very student-focused, engaging, and discussion-based, but with no pressure to say complicated or fancy-sounding things. So enjoyable to just read Jane Austen and talk about it, and listen to music and talk about it!\r\n\r\nWeakness: The only weakness I would say is that it would have been fun to replace the second-to-last week's reading (which was a bit on the dry side in my opinion) with some adaptation-watching instead. I was hopeful that we would actually watch and get to discuss an entire movie of one of the books we read, since the movies are so fun and wonderful.",
                "Strengths: Professor Peritz brings energy, warmth, and excellent secondary sources to the table. She is incredibly knowledgeable and kind. You can tell she really cares about her students in all she does! The Austen novels are of course, excellent reading material too. Peritz is determined to make them accessible to the whole class, and I really loved that. \r\nWeaknesses: Not enough technical discussion of music or attempt to explain it its historical importance to nonmusical students in the class; if we didn't have a background in music, we didn't understand those readings\/references. I would have appreciated a more technical and detailed presentation so I could catch up to the students who had already studied music. Professor Peritz was I believe not trying to stress anyone out and make the class a bit easier, but it could stand to be a little more rigorous. Another weakness was that we had very similar discussions every week.",
                "The biggest strengths of this course are Professor Peritz and the syllabus shes crafted. Prof Peritz guides you for the first few classes while giving a solid grounding in the bigger ideas of the classmusic, gender, performance, and class in Georgian Englandand then lets the class explore them deeper when the novels begin by having students guide the conversation. This structure, where you learn about the overarching topics, then read novels, and then take a step back is great. I truly cannot think of any weaknesses in this class.",
                "Strengths: Discussion is very engaging even if you're not a music student. The class is very well organized and you always know exactly what to do\/what is due. Professor Peritz is a passionate teacher, and she is very easy to communicate with. The Austen books are a fun read.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings are really long and the points made could maybe be condensed or read a range of pages. For 6 weeks, you read 3 novels (half a novel per week), and the books are long so it might take a while. I personally really liked the Austen books, but just know it could become a lot of reading.",
                "Strengths: unique interdisciplinary focus, each class having a 'theme', AMAZING prof, so many opportunities to lead the class, interesting reading and multimedia assignments which were paired with film\/TV\/musical adaptations during class, lots of freedom in essays and seminar leading assignments, tight-knit class community, very accessible, super fun last class with Regency dances!\r\nWeaknesses: Readings would sometimes feature some more complex music theory and literary ideas which were often skipped over during class. I would have loved to delve deeper into these ideas, even if it required a music theory primer for the class."

                "Absolutely, it was so much fun to analyze some of my favorite novels through a different lens.",
                "Yes! Its chill and fun",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anybody who is interested in thinking about the regency period in a new way. Whether you love Jane Austen, music, or are simply interested in exploring the Regency period from the perspective of music and womens lives. Its an approachable course for those not necessarily majoring in humanities or comfortable writing as Professor Peritz grades on ideas rather than writing style. Its a really interesting course for anyone to take!",
                "Yes! I definitely would. I loved taking Music and Jane Austen. It was lovely to combine music with novels. I loved all the reading and listening we had to do and the high level discussions the seminars provoked.",
                "Absolutely! I think anyone would have fun and learn something taking this class, whether you're a diehard Austen fan already or you've never read a book of hers in your life. Both demographics were present in our class and everyone seemed to enjoy it and be engaged and interested! It's truly wonderful to mostly spend your time reading Austen's novels for homework.",
                "I would recommend this class to any Yale student who is a fan of Austen and wants to learn a new dimension of her work. I would note to the student (not that this is a particularly good or bad thing) that this is probably the easiest course I've ever taken at Yale. If the student is looking for a rigorous literary analysis of Austen's novels, or a rigorous technical analysis of Austen's music collection, this is not the class.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class! Professor Peritz and the course are gems, and this has been a highlight of my Yale experience. Even as we delved into complicated topics, the class always almost had the feel of a book club, where everyone was excited to read and talk about their thoughts. I often found myself wishing class was longer so we could talk about even more. Professor Peritz also encourages exploration in the writing assignments and allows you to try things out, which is especially great for such a rich seminar. I truly cannot recommend this enough. If you get a chance, take it!!",
                "I would 100% recommend this course. It was such a fun class, and the weekly discussions were very easy to participate in.",
                "YES! If you have any interest in Jane Austen, the Regency Era, music, or looking at gender and class in interdisciplinary ways - this course is for you! This is the best class I have ever taken at Yale! Professor Peritz cultivates an extremely welcoming classroom that will encourage you to connect with your peers and share your ideas often. This class is also very accessible to all majors: around half of our class was composed of STEM majors."
