    "I learned a lot from writing my term paper for this class and from daily discussions. You will learn a lot more or less based on the time you put into doing the readings. you can participate in class without doing the readings but then the class is much less interesting for you.",
    "Learned a lot about the history of Muslims, Jews, and Christians and their relationship in Europe and Arabia from biblical to medieval times.",
    "How to write a historical paper and analyze primary sources.",
    "I learned a great deal about how to read primary sources and gather both primary and secondary sources to produce a massive research paper.",
    "This was the first time that I engaged in a long term research project. During class we had to work with almost exclusively primary source material and that was a skill I had not developed previously.",
    "I gained a working understanding of the interactions of medieval Christians, Jews, and Muslims throughout Europe and the Mediterranean.",
    "The primary skill that I developed by taking this course was the ability to research and work with primary sources, and piece together historical information when few sources are available.",
    "I learned about this history of medieval Jews, Christians, and Muslims in the Arab world.",
    "In this class I really learned how to work with primary sources and do historical research on my own."

    "I love Professor Marcus and he makes each class interesting. The 25 page paper takes a lot of research but you have enough time to do it. Sometimes it is hard to meet with him since he is not here every day of the week. Overall, I enjoyed it.",
    "It was a very informative class, and he split up writing the paper very well throughout the year, and Professor Marcus was more than willing to give advice on the class and paper.",
    "Its a great course, just not really a seminar.",
    "I thought professor Marcus was great and I was fascinated by my research paper topic. I wish, however, that the weekly readings were somehow more integrated into the course (maybe they could be somehow connected to the research paper or there could be a separate paper about them). Also, I wish more background information was provided in class about the time period we were studying. A lot happened in medieval Middle East, and at times I felt lost\/overwhelmed without the background information to ground me.",
    "It is what you make of it and how much you engage in the readings.",
    "Strengths: Marcus was really helpful with the research project and the readings were often very interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: Discussions were never really mind-blowing"

    "If you enjoy the subject matter I would suggest this course. Also be prepared to not get feedback until the final. Overall, i LOVE professor Marcus.",
    "Yes, I would if you are interested in combining history and religion.",
    "If you want to learn to write a history paper then YES!",
    "Depends. Professor Marcus is great and the research paper is super rewarding and fascinating. However, the classes that didn't involve the paper were at times dry and difficult to enjoy. We basically just had a massive stack of readings to do during the semester, but they didn't necessarily relate to the final research paper, so it was sometimes hard to feel motivated in class. Also, if you didn't do the readings well enough (the readings are also hard b\/c they're most primary sources), it was difficult to follow what was happening in class.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the history of the Arab world and the early development of religion.",
    "Yes! Marcus is just really fun to work with, and I especially recommend him if you are afraid of writing a longer research paper like I was. He has a great sense of humor that livens up the course."
