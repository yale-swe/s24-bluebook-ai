The class put a strong focus on looking for motifs and thinking about their effects on the works that we read. I now find myself looking for motifs in literature/songs/movies and it's made me gain a deeper appreciation for the arts.",

                "I learned that Bacchic frenzy is an excellent excuse for doing some seriously crazy stuff. Just kidding. I actually learned a lot about how to talk and write about literature this semester. I learned how to put the authors we were reading in conversation with each other, made easier by the fact that they were all copying each other's material all the time. Virgil stealing from Homer, Dante stealing from Virgil, Ovid spicing up Genesis, the list goes on. I think that's the beauty of DS though; I got such a good idea of the different influences on all the authors we talked about.",

                "I learned how to read, deeply, for meaning and understanding. Or, at least I learned how someone can read deeply, even if I'm not quite there yet. I learned how to write close reading essays and try to zoom into specifics of the language and narrative to understand how authors move you to feel a certain way."

                "The real strength was training me in the skills to read these texts closely. We did seem to be moving very, very fast through the texts, but it was a great introduction to all of them. The course was very focused on themes and meaning, but I would have liked to engage more with the emotional and aesthetic aspects of the texts.",

DS is an incredible program and even though it definitely has its faults, it's probably the best program a first-year student could take if they're interested at all in the humanities. Of the three strands, Literature has the best books and lectures. It's made me change the way I approach texts and analyze language.",
