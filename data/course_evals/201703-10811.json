    "This class was amazing! Kamens is incredibly insightful and amazing to listen to, and will make you interested in whatever you happen to be going over in class at the time. Definitely make sure you're prepared and awake for class--it makes discussions way more stimulating and cool. This class is also a rare occurrence--Kamens is a leading voice in his field, but the class is small and discussion-based. You really get to hear and think about a lot of interesting poetic topics in this class."
