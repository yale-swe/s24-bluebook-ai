    "Some high school presentation skills. I did learn about some of the Yale resources for starting businesses...not sure if anyone in the class will take advantage though.",
    "I learned about scientific writing and presentation skills.",
    "The visiting lecturers were quite helpful, and I did gain a better awareness of the biomedical industry as a whole. I really appreciated the time spent highlighting start-up ventures as well as other paths in biomedical engineering that are not as traditional\/academic. I learned a little bit about tips for making better scientific writing and presentations.",

   "comments": [
    "This course should just not exist",
    "Just 2 assignments and some guest speakers. Could be organized better with more useful material. Group project was fine. Received no feedback for individual assignment. Fun way to hang with the BME class for the last time though. Speakers were nice.",
    "I think the idea of the course was good. The execution just felt off. Maybe it should be moved to earlier in the academic career. I think more engagement from everyone or structure  would be beneficial.",
    "I think that this course, in concept, has some great goals. Much of the biomedical engineering major focuses on research but few students actually intend to stay in academia. This course strives to paint a better picture of the biomedical industry as well as foster creativity in research topics. While I think the goal of the class is a strength, I think the class fell short of its hopes. Since this course has an \"exploratory\" feel to it, I think that embracing the class as a seminar (instead of a lecture) would be helpful. It would have been nice to play more games (perhaps posing a hot topic in the field and have small groups \"hack\" at the idea for a couple of class periods before presenting)  or have more engagement in small groups. There's a lot to learn from one another, especially when we're all planning out our futures, but most of our time was spent listening to lectures that could be quite dry.",
    "A bit more clear organization and feedback from assignments would be helpful for the students."

    "No. BME senior requirement",
    "Unfortunately, I wouldn't. The class should only be taken if it's a requirement for your major. It seems like it will improve with time, but right now, it's quite dry and unengaging.",
    "Its required for BME majors",
    "Yes!"
