                "Lectures were very good! They provided typically an informal and illustration-forward introduction to new concepts, and primed students well for further reading in the text for rigorous details. The assignments and exams in the course are very challenging! Assignments were issued weekly, with every other assignment collected and graded. Typed solutions (mostly proofs \/ derivations) for each assignment typically reached about 10 pages. My major grievance with this course is that lectures are held only once per week. If we had 2 lectures (or 1 lecture, 1 recitation) per week where on day 1 we develop theory and day 2 we see examples and applications it could help concepts feel more tangible. This course is definitely more theory-heavy than I was expecting, but it is well worth the struggle."

                "Absolutely! The course content is very interesting and well-organized, topics interweave throughout the semester to make a beautifully orchestrated curriculum where concepts build consistently build upon one another, even if it isn't so obvious right away how they are related. You can expect to build a strong background in optimization methods that can be very helpful for understanding the theory of modern machine learning models."
