                "I learned about early modern European practices of collecting and how that led to the creation of the modern museum. I also learned about how to design a museum exhibit and engage critically with existing exhibits.",
                "I learned how to critically analyze how museums and collections are presented to the public, and how to have a more informed perspective on the history of the boundaries between art and scientific study. \r\n\r\nThe readings were extremely helpful toward building my ideas about how to mediate the tensions between colonialism, scientific experimentation, and artistic representation when it comes to observing a museum exhibit or even creating one. Not only did I feel challenged by the class' content, but I also felt like the other students provided incredible insights in class discussions.",
                "I gained a historical perspective on the development of the cabinet of curiosities, as well as its metamorphosis into the natural history\/antiquities museum. I furthermore gained skills in museum curation, including learning about the structure and flaws present in various iterations of display. Such skills would prove useful to somebody interested in curation.",

                "Strengths: the discussions were interesting and helped me understand the readings better. The projects were very engaging--they gave the chance to work creatively with the material and concepts we studied. With the projects, you can really learn by doing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the feedback on the projects was not always clear. Also, since the projects were all quite different, it was hard to apply feedback from the first one to the second.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bertucci is incredible! She guided the class discussions so well, speaking when she wanted to push the conversation in one direction, but also letting us express our own opinions. I felt like the class was extremely well structured, with readings that gave us a lot of comprehensive historical background, but assignments that let us be really imaginative. \r\nWeaknesses: Obviously because of the pandemic we weren't able to actually visit any museums, but honestly the class was taught so well that I didn't feel like I was missing out on much (that would have happened in previous years).",
                "Strengths: Fascinating readings that facilitated discussions; flexible prompts for papers\/presentations so everyone could find something they were passionate about to write on; a caring professor who was truly excited to be teaching on this topic\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the weekly asynchronous assignments (designed to take 20 minutes) took a lot longer than 20 minutes, despite being only a small portion of our grade. The assignments were always interesting though, so I didn't mind that much. It just made budgeting for time some weeks to be rather difficult; I also wish we had more time to give presentations and solicit feedback in class, but I understand how with so many students in a limited amount of time that wasn't really possible.",
                "This course differs from how it is typically offered, and was limited greatly by COVID restrictions--typically it would be significantly collections-based. Its weakness, thus, was how this was rectified: there was a dramatic shift towards simply reading about almost all of the artwork we were missing, with minor opportunities to view virtual works. While I understand that a collections-based analysis of this material was not possible this semester, I can't help but feel that Professor Bertucci's decision to not encourage more virtual collections analysis, especially during class time, was admirable in its admission that virtual analysis is not a surefire substitute but also too rigid in its application. \r\n\r\nBesides such restrictions, I did find the seminar enjoyable, and felt as if the writing assignments were fair and quite fun compared to other assignments I have undertaken at Yale (and indeed a major strength of this course). As such, it is still one I would seriously consider taking, especially for students interested in a look at less art-heavy curation techniques.",
                "The essay prompts Prof. Bertucci assigns were really cool and relatively low pressure as far as the presentations went. The assignments were fun to write and think about, rather open ended each time. I especially loved the \"curate your own collection\" presentation and paper! Generally I enjoyed the format of doing the readings and then just coming to class ready to talk about them, without the stress of a reading response every week.",
                "Strengths- organized, work load is manageable but still engaging\r\nWeaknesses- certain topics garnered less class interest than others which made discussion a tad boring on occasion"

                "The professor did well to accommodate the time spent on asynchronous activities; it helped prevent Zoom fatigue. Also, I really appreciated how we started each class just checking in with everyone and saying something about our week. In online classes, it can be hard to connect with your classmates--this made the class feel much more friendly.",
                "I don't have much to say about virtual engagement (I thought the class was great in that respect) but I will say that the restructuring of the syllabus to acknowledge the fact that we couldn't visit any museums\/collections in person but still work towards getting the same academic fulfillment from the class was helpful.",
                "I appreciated that none of the papers required you to do extensive research, though the option was there if you chose to take it. This was helpful for students who didn't have full access to the university library this semester. They still required some research, but not so much that it felt impossible if you were remote.",
                "As mentioned elsewhere, I was sufficiently disappointed by Professor Bertucci's hesitancy to utilize any form of visual aid, including scans of collections. I believe that the virtual medium, although flawed, would be better than doubling down on the readings. Besides that, I do find her flexibility to COVID-19 and the fatigue it generated to be quite refreshing (especially in relations to paper extensions), and I always felt as if this seminar was a welcome respite from my other courses in relation to how truly interested she was in creating active, informed discussion.",

                "The \"asynchronous assignments\" sometimes took a lot longer than 20 minutes which was a little annoying but otherwise good! I didn't feel overwhelmed by the workload at all generally. Overall though it was still quite an enjoyable class even with the pandemic ensuring that we couldn't go about the normal agenda of visiting museums. Visiting museums online really doesn't compare, so we didn't do too much of that--I'm sure the class is honestly quite different in normal years but I thought the adaptation was really smooth."

                "Yes! It is a fascinating subject--there are lots of colorful stories in the world of collectors. If you are considering pursuing a museum career, this course is a great way to start critically engaging with the history of museums and the imperialism\/colonialism they perpetuate in the present. The projects are a lot of fun, since you get to be creative and solidify your understanding of the material.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student!! Not only is Professor Bertucci amazing, but the class itself is also fascinating. Especially if you are interested in art history, the history of science, collecting, museum studies, or curating, this class is for you. Even though this is a 400-level course, it is easily digestible for even those who have no background in the above topics. If you were to take only one HSHM seminar, let it be this one!",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student, even in its current form. However, I would be much more enthusiastic about taking it in a non-COVID year, and encourage students to wait until in-person activities are possible if they have the years left at Yale to do so. With the current discussion and writing assignments in an in-person, collections-dependent setting, I would be far more enthusiastic about my recommendation of this course. Professor Bertucci especially is a lovely teacher, and I would be interested to see how her class thrives if offered as normal. In its current state, however, I would warn students that it is very dependent on dense readings, some of which more enjoyable than others.",
                "Yep! Take it if you find collecting, natural history, early modern European history, or just curious objects interesting. I felt motivated to do the readings, excited to come to discussions, and had a great time thinking about all of these topics in a small class setting, even as a non-major.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in art history or museums.  The background knowledge that you gain from this course really changes your perspective on a lot of things regarding the collection and display of items."
