                "Strengths: Interesting and useful material, and the programming often helped understand exactly what the formulas are doing. Weaknesses: Lectures were sometimes confusing, and there was nothing on the psets that you couldn't just google.",
                "The strengths of this course are the depth of material we learn and a good balance between theoretical and practical knowledge. I learned a lot of computing alongside traditional statistical theory, which allows me to not only write code but understand how the functions work on the basic level.",
                "Strengths: learned a lot of material, problem sets were challenging, but helped to solidify class material\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes lectures went too fast to follow",
                "Strengths: office hours, available resources\r\nWeaknesses: often it felt like we weren't covering important topics in great detail. Prof. Chang would spend a lot of time explaining stats processes and then gloss over the R functions needed for them, which would have been helpful for the psets.",
                "One strength is that I learned a lot from the class and it helped me build a strong foundation for data science classes I will take in the future. One weakness is that it was a bit disorganized and there was not a clear syllabus that we could refer to for grading distributions, late homework policy, etc.",
                "This class was easy to approach at first, but quickly ramped up. I feel as though it was not adequately paced.",
                "I felt as if there could have been a clearer connection between the concepts discussed in class and what was asked of us in the homework. Although I felt as if the exams were mostly fair, at times the psets were much more complicated than we were reasonably prepared for. I also wouldn't describe this course as exactly introductory, having never taken statistics before, I definitely struggled with the pace and what was asked of us in the psets.",
                "Everything was well-explained and paced, and the professor was clearly very knowledgeable. But the pacing of assessments didn't always make sense, especially having a computational exam one week before the timed final.",
                "I have only strengths for this course. There was (in my opinion) a perfect balance between teaching with slides and with R script, and the two modes of learning complemented each other very well. Concepts were introduced and followed up with specific examples, so this course avoided some of the more mundane aspects of an intro statistics class that I've heard many people talk about before. Most importantly, everything we did had a purpose. Not once did I wonder why we were learning what we were learning, and I was always interested by the practical applications of the subject matter.",
                "Weaknesses: Poor communication with Professor Chang and TAs, ED discussion took an average of 5 days to be responded to, and PSet grades took forever to come out.",
                "The PSets and lectures were good. I only wish there had been office hours on the day that PSets were due, after 10:30 AM.",
                "The psets were usually quite enjoyable to work on. In particular, I always enjoyed the more R-focused questions (as opposed to the calculations-by-hand type questions from the textbook). The content covered by the course felt mostly comprehensive, but I would be interested in knowing what other foundational aspects of statistics were not covered.",
                "A strength was the positivity of the teacher. A weakness was that we didn't get at ton of practice with some concepts covered in class. Office hours were not particularly helpful either.",
                "I liked the class. It was good. It took a while for us to get some of our grades back.",
                "Great class. No glaring weaknesses",
                "Weakness: Prof Chang. I have never had a professor that cared so little about his students. Honestly the amount of support in this class was so bad that at some point you start feeling incredibly frustrated. Professor Chang is also a TERRIBLE writer, like he would write problems that literally you cannot understand because it is not proper English, and when you email him he will tell you to post it on Ed and he will then respond AFTER THE PSET IS DUE(like wtf) \r\n\r\nStrengths: When you can read the problems and make sense out of them, the psets could be fun.",
                "This course could have included more applications of statistics which would have made it more interesting. Also I would have appreciated some structured group work or in-class discussions - basically an opportunity to apply and think more generally about all the specifics we were learning. Strength is that it covered a really wide variety of statistics topics"

Also, recordings were often not posted in a timely manner, which could be frustrating. Finally, it was hard to get info about important aspects of the course (exam timing being a notable example), which was extra frustrating during COVID.",

It also doesn't deal a ton with data manipulation, so if that's an interest of yours, there are other classes better suited for that.",

Now I'm equipped to perform any basic analysis in R and understand what lies behind p-values, R-squared, etc. The problem sets were also great, and many of the questions focused on the practical application of statistics.",
                "Yes, great introduction to statistics and R. I feel like I learned a lot more than I would have in a non-intensive stats class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any major because data science is such an important tool. Compared to normal introduction statistics classes, this one includes a good amount of R, which is incredibly useful in any field. You will learn a lot of practical knowledge from this class.",

Although it is often described as an introductory course, having never worked with R or studied statistics in the past, I definitely faced difficulties throughout the course because of the pace and the material.",
                "Yes -- overall a great way to get a solid statistical foundation",
                "Absolutely. It was a challenge at times, but the challenging problems on psets were the most interesting ones. Plus, learning R is so useful and makes statistics that much more interesting and insightful.",

                "I would if Professor Chang teaches it. He is super helpful and willing to explain concepts. The class is a super good Introductory Stats class for people who are interested but do not have any prior Stats experience.",
                "Yes! Great intro to stats that gives you the tool to apply it and actually use it. Professor chang is great!",
                "Yes, for studying the basics of statistics in a practical manner",
                "NO NO NO NO NO NOOOOOOOOO! I must admit this class could be a very good class, the psets sometimes are good, however the professor is TRASH.  He literally could not care less about his students. FIRST of all he is a mess in lecture, he is using slides that he made a few year ago, and he gets them messed up all the time, also they are not even good. The lectures go everywhere, literally one second he is using his slides, the next he is coding, and the next he writes stuff on the board ( in our class one-note).  SECOND he is a horrendous writer, I have sometimes spent more time trying to understand what he wants in a pset than on the actual damn pset. Why don't I just email him? He does NOT TAKE EMAILS, he will send you this huge email that he copies and pastes, which basically says \"just post it on Ed\", this would be fine IF HE RESPONDED TO Ed, which HE DOES NOT. This guy has literally answered questions about psets 2 weeks after they were due, it is actually infuriating. The worse thing about all this, is that during exams he simply IGNORED our emails. THIRD: He is condescending to people who ask questions in class, I mean many times he has responded with an almost angry tone to people's questions, both in Office Hours  and in class. I liked the class, but it was also very frustrating and disliked professor Chang a lot. I would ONLY recommend this course if he is not teaching the class.",
