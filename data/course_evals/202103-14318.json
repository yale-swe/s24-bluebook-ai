                "I gained understanding of the beginnings of the Western canon in literature and the various ways in which the texts spoke to each other and built off one another. While none of the texts were in English, through the seminars and lectures I gained some appreciation for the style and language that the authors used to craft their works. And I worked on deep, pointed analysis rooted in text, while also thinking about how the texts were rooted in various historical-political realities.",
                "Insight into many authors, texts, and literary traditions from Homer to Dante, along with a basis in close reading and analysis that serves as a useful basis for future study.",
                "I have much more familiarity with the Western tradition and have improved my literary analysis skills and my ability to contribute to class discussions.",
                "I gained much insight into not only the classics but the greatness they have in their native language thanks to Professor Freudenburg. You can see the dialogue between different authors and their influences as the course progresses, which was a new concept to me. I loved the comparative literature side to our readings and it made everything feel extremely cohesive. My ability to pull from multiple works and have focused analyses greatly improved this semester.",
                "Read some seminal texts of western literature from Homer to Dante, Greek antiquity to the medieval ages. Learned how to approach analysis of complex texts and close reading. Developed cultural understanding and context to gain a deeper appreciation for the works with the synchronized learning from the other two DS classes.",
                "I learned how to analyze passages of ancient literature and write papers. I gained insight into the ancient world and the significance of its literature.",
                "I improved upon my ability to read and analyze large amounts of texts in a short amount of time. I gained a lot of knowledge about Greek history and thought and its evolution into Roman and later philosophies.",
                "how to talk about something you just read (either 15 minutes before class or during seminar when someone points out a passage you didn't really pay attention to)",
                "Having taken this course I better understand how to approach close-readings of historical texts, taking into account specifically the translation of each word and possible other interpretations, calling into question both the author's and translator's intent. I learned how to analyze the text, drawing on the word-choice to then extrapolate towards larger themes such as the author's intent during a politically turbulent time. Most important, however, was my ability to form connections. With the literary background this course provided me, each text became more and more engaging as I saw more and more connections and allusions being made to prior texts and movements."

            "comments": [
                "My main wish for the class would have been, as tricky as it is, more time spent in seminars on detailed analyses, like examining closely the beginning of a text or a certain crucial simile or passage. Those were always the most engaging sections for me, and while I appreciate the need to cover a vast amount of material in a broad sense, I felt our most engaging classes involved drilling down into the specifics of these works, for they are all so rich.",
                "Because so many texts are covered, very little time can be spent with each one, bit Professor Freudenburg is particularly good at balancing broad and rapid coverage with close analysis and interesting deep dives. Feedback on papers was prompt, detailed, and useful.",
                "Strengths: Class was always engaging, especially because of the interesting cultural insights Professor Freudenberg would sprinkle throughout our discussion of the works. I felt comfortable speaking up and felt like Professor Freudenberg truly valued our thoughts on the works.\r\nWeaknesses: The only weakness I can think of is that the breadth of the course often left me feeling unsatisfied with the amount of time we were able to spend on certain works.",
                "Sometimes we got caught up in abstract thoughts and often the same people were called on. I wish the class had a better balance of participation and constructive commentary",
                "Course was amazing, no complaints. The close seminar style format helped build a strong sense of community and helped us hear different perspectives.",
                "Kirk is an amazing professor, he was extremely engaging and DS on a whole is super interesting. His PowerPoints always added so much to the class, he is extremely knowledgeable about these texts.",
                "More breadth than depth, would love to go deeper into some of the pieces but that is of course the nature of the program.",
                "Very engaging but a few too many people. It was hard to have discussions and the final exam seemed to contradict the purpose and edict of the program.",
                "strength - immaculate PowerPoints, frequently available for office hours or just to drop by his office if you email him, also recites Latin lines in class for fun, easy to contribute to the conversation in section",
                "The biggest strength of this course is by far the professor. Freudenburg did an exceptional job at making each text dynamic and engaging, and every word he delivered in class served the very specific purpose of bringing interesting components of the text into the spotlight that we as students did not have the tools or literary background to explore.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of this course is its structure, and how it is incorporated in Directed Studies as a whole. I often felt I could not give each text its due diligence, as I felt rushed to keep up with work of my other DS readings, on top of having to turn in an essay every week. I enjoyed the readings most and engaged with them the most on the weeks there was no essay."

                "Yes do DS",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially with Professor Freudenberg. It has given me a great background in a wide range of foundational works, and I truly enjoyed discussing and writing about the works along the way. The class also fostered a great community because of its rigor.",
                "Yes. If you are genuinely curious about the cultural origins of western literature, this course is great for you.",
                "Yes! I would recommend both DS and Professor Freudenberg's section! It was an amazing way to start my first semester of college. The class is super fascinating and super fun.",
                "I would recommend this course IF a student is genuinely excited about the material. DS, particularly literature, has a page count so high that it is possible, if one chooses, to spend hours with the texts daily. On the other hand, only a small portion of the reading is ever discussed, used as an essay topic, or tested on the final, so it is just as easy to get by doing the bare minimum of reading. Most people are not at either extreme but pick some point in the middle, but I would advise someone considering the course to pick a level of reading and commit to at least that, rather than starting too high and then burning out and slipping.",
                "Yes.",
                "I enjoyed the DS Lit readings, so yes.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. I feel confident talking about cultural cornerstones and being able to keep up the great literary tradition of the classics."
