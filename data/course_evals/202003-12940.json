                "This course not only taught important technical skills in the in-person portion, but in the online portion, there was also a great deal of focus on theory, which I actually found was an important supplement to the biochemistry lecture that I was taking. By learning about specific experiments and their effects on the field of biochemistry, I left the course with a much greater understanding of foundational topics in biochemistry that had been covered in the lecture portion of the course.",

This class actually helped my formulate my grant proposal for my research seminar in MCDB. I knew almost exactly what to do in order to set up and carry out my experiment, perhaps only having to change certain reagents based on my own protein of interest, which was ACE2 receptor, instead of Staph nuclease, which we used in our lab.",

The in-person component allowed me to put some of the theory we learned about in the virtual lectures in practice. I learned how to write a comprehensive lab report. I also learned about conducting multi-step research experiments with controls.",

                "Strengths: organized, flexible, amazing level of knowledge, really fun lab, great professors\r\nWeaknesses: Very long class once a week, difficult over zoom to focus, lectures not super clear, some of the assignments are not in good english and thus hard to understand",
                "Course was amazing, especially considering the circumstances. Dr. Pawashe is the best.",

                "Strengths: I gained a deep understanding of the theory behind common biochemical techniques thanks to the extensive \"lecture\" component. The quizzes were fair and motivated me to stay engaged. The virtual Labster labs were fun to do. Although the in-person wet-lab component was very limited due to the pandemic restrictions, the opportunity to actually perform some experiments and practice the techniques we learned about made a huge difference. My TA, Kevin, was very helpful and willing to answer all my questions during the wet-lab. Lastly, the structure of the course as a semester-long project definitely helped me to see how all the different techniques we learned were relevant.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it was very difficult to stay engaged during the virtual labs, especially when the virtual component occupied the full 4 hours. The final lab report was very time consuming. Due to the pandemic restrictions, we used data from last year for the lab report, and so the disconnect between what we actually did in the lab and what we were writing about made writing the report feel a little disingenuous.",

                "Strengths: the in-person lab component went well in my opinion. I felt completely safe the whole time, and I was still able to gain valuable laboratory experience. The breakout rooms, in-class activities, and discussions during the virtual labs helped to break-up the long 4 hours.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 4 hours on Zoom was too much at one time. Even with the breakout rooms and in-class activities, I still had a hard time staying engaged.",
