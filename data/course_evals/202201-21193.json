                "Yale art students are chronic procrastinators, so I hope in the future more firm deadlines could be set to keep us on track, especially for the rotoscope project. However, I think there was great strength to the course in that Mike showed us a lot of historical animation as well as contemporary animation and provided a lot of guidance in our own projects. We watched and analyzed a lot of animation, not just from large studios but many from smaller creators as well.",
                "Amazing teacher great assignment",
                "The curriculum pacing is just right, so the workload does not feel too overwhelming even though it is a lot. The professor well-understands the labor that animation requires and is understanding of students while spurring them onward. I really like how most classes are demonstrations or critiques. It keeps students motivated to keep working on their projects and get feedback from classmates and the professor. Professor Rader tends to let students talk more during critiques so depending on whether you like to know what the teacher thinks in particular, this may be good. Either way, I recommend approaching him after class to discuss your work more in detail to learn more from his expertise. One thing I wish is that all the in-class demonstrations of how to use software or how we analyzed some examples of animated films were uploaded to Canvas so that I could've reviewed them when working on my projects.",

There were times when I felt I could have benefited from spending time working on my projects instead of some of the class activities. the material was interesting, just sometimes a bit too condensed into one period."
