                "Grand Strategyhow it originated, how it has been applied to various political contexts throughout (mostly US) history. Spheres of focus include war, international relations, governance, electoral strategy, economic policy, and social movements. The course also takes a good amount of time to question the legitimacy and utility of the whole venture of \"Grand Strategy\" itself.",
                "This course helped me piece together concepts from political philosophy, history of civil rights movements, and war strategy that I hadn't necessarily linked. Understanding connections between important tactics in social movements and war helped me better understand the world.",
                "Where to begin? This course has absolutely blown me away. What an amazing combination of texts that are carefully curated to interact with each other. I like to think I developed a set of tools to help me achieve large ends/goals within my means/resources. I've had to critically think about the complexities of war, peace, power, social movement organizations, and guerrilla warfare to name a few, and understand historical events, not through an anachronistic lens.",
                "A broad overview of many political writings/figures/movements through a grand strategic lens.",
                "I have learned so much about strategic thinking and theory that will stay with me for long after my time at Yale.",
                "This course was an excellent introduction to the ideas and practice of grand strategy. I really enjoyed thinking through more applied aspects of political science, history, etc., throughout different historical situations.",
                "How to analyze history and politics through the framework of grand strategy: actors, means, ends. Specific understanding of case studies and some theory.",
                "i learned about major global debates across time and the different ways that scholars define grand strategy.",
                "I developed an understanding of grand strategy and how it applies to contexts of war, foreign policy, and social movements.",
                "Grand Strategy taught me about several important moments and figures in history from ancient up until the 20th century  the Peloponnesian war, Machiavelli, Kant/Hume, the slavery abolitionism movement, the civil rights movement, etc. I also learned to write a historical paper analyzing an event through the lens of \"grand strategy.\" I'm not sure I came out of this class with 100% understanding of what exactly Grand Strategy is; its definition and what constitutes an example of it were ongoing questions throughout the semester that we students tried to answer along with the professor and guests. I think I would have liked to engage with these questions even more directly during class time  I feel as though some classes focused more on the history than the strategic element. This course definitely has good books and texts (Gaddis' On Grand Strategy, Sun Tzu's Art of War, Machiavelli's The Prince, Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals stand out) and I appreciated the opportunity to engage with these important texts. Lastly, I think the dinner sessions with guest speakers produced unexpected insights, especially in terms of figuring out what sort of career I'd like to have and how to get there. Professor Brenes always asked great questions of the guests, which I really appreciated."

            "comments": [
                "First, let me say that the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses. This has probably been the most engaging Yale course I've taken so far, and its focus on real-world application is a welcome departure from other history seminars that can at times feel quite dry and academic.\r\nStrengths: fascinating readings, guest lecturers, great contributions from other students\r\nWeaknesses: discussions at times too structured/Q&A\r\nThe workload is high, particularly the weekly reading load, but it's interesting enough to be manageable, and if nothing else it teaches one to skim efficiently.",
                "Strengths: Interesting material, great events, lots of perspectives represented in class.\r\nWeaknesses: Large class size made it a bit difficult to have a good conversation. Some readings were hard to understand out of context. Writing assignments were not always explained very clearly.",
                "One of the strengths of this course is that it keeps evolving, and so does its syllabus. What my class read this year might not have been what the class three years ago read. I think Professor Brenes is a brilliant moderator and instructor; his insights allow a conversation to flow and create thoughtful conversation.",
                "Really interesting readings, and the speaker events were always really engaging and informative (definitely a highlight). For the amount of readings, class discussion is rarely centered on a close reading of the texts, but I nonetheless felt them helpful for my own personal knowledge and as a useful background for the discussion.",
                "I would like to see more free form/small group discussion in the class",
                "This course is generally excellent. At times, I think there could have been fewer/shorter reading to aid with comprehension (by focusing more closely on the most important onesas our conversations often did), but this is a relatively minor complaint.",
                "There are really cool guest speakers who come for dinners and roundtables, which is a great experience. Each class is co-taught by Professor Brenes and a guest professor, and it's nice to learn from their perspective and expertise each week as well. Overall, the program is really cool and the topics week to week have a lot of variety. \r\n\r\nSometimes seminar sessions felt like they were just Q&A with students asking questions and the guest professor answering. It would be nice to consistently have discussions with the guest professor and Professor Brenes guiding, rather than sticking only to a question and answer format.",
                "Strengths: If you're at all interested in connecting to theory to practice, then you should take this class. There's a real diversity of opinion in the classroom and the guest speakers are nothing short of fantastic. Really wonderful, immersive class experience. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course could include a bit more cross-student discussion, we discuss such a range of topics and current events and it would have been great to have more small group discussions about these things.",
                "Strength: good discussion!\r\nWeakness: I wish that I could hear more from Professor Brenes before we discuss. He is always knowledgeable and insightful about the topic, so it's helpful when he gives us a broad historical overview before discussion. I also hope that we stuck closer to the time next semester. It was difficult when class and events when I had other meetings afterward.",
                "Getting to engage with guest professors from a wide spectrum of backgrounds was enriching, and the readings and discussions overall were very interesting. Because of the sheer quantity of readings covered each week, the discussions sometimes felt a bit unfocused. The large size of the class also made it hard to be fully engaged in discussions.",
                "Grand Strategy is a legendary course, and it was a lot of fun, but I think it could certainly be improved for future iterations. Strengths: The lessons with Gaddis and Kennedy; guest speakers for dinners such as Jing Tsu, Derecka Purnell (everyone LOVED her), Daniel Kurtz-Phelan; Josh, the TA, who was super helpful with papers and summer proposals; the assignments, especially the strategic autobiography. I can also tell Professor Brenes works incredibly hard on preparing for class, and he asks insightful questions of the guest leaders of the seminar sessions. Opportunities for improvement: Overall I felt that some of the class sessions were disconnected from the larger themes of the course  the guest speakers had deep expertise on the history, but didn't always engage with the idea of \"grand strategy\" that structures the course. I would have liked more direct engagement with questions like, what really constitutes grand strategy, and what are distinct strategic lessons we can mine from these texts? In addition, we students could have been more proactive in raising these questions ourselves. I feel like there was a bit of a hesitance to raise hard questions about the nature of GS. Another small improvement would be to toss out the discussion questions and just let students reflect on whatever strikes them in a text. I noticed that sometimes the posts would get repetitive as we all answered the same questions; allowing for more freedom to reflect, wherever our minds take us, might produce new & interesting insights."

Be aware that the class will require a lot of work and engagement from you to get the most out of it!",

It's a great opportunity to meet other students in that arena, and a great opportunity to dive deep into topics that interest you.",
                "Yes. You engage with course material to an unprecedented level in this course. I really enjoyed the readings and the discussions, and more over the extra discussions we had.",
                "Grand Strategy is a very special opportunity, and I would recommend it primarily because of the opportunities and access it affords students. The funding for summer projects, insanely interesting/important guest speakers, and \"clout\" the program gives are undeniable. The students are also some of the smartest students, especially in the social sciences, at Yale  I really appreciated the diverse, accomplished cohort. I also really enjoyed the reading list  all super important texts that have a lot to teach us. I can tell that Professor Brenes and Josh worked really hard to make this class a good experience. Overall, I was on the fence about GS but was ultimately glad I took it. It really is a pretty special experience, one of things that make Yale what it is."
