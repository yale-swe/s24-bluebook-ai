                "This class mostly consisted of grammar rules and new tenses. While learning those things, we practiced our Spanish in class. Daily work on VHL central, presentations where we had to memorize the script, and activities. There was one final project (presentation) that we submitted in multiple parts. I would say the class was very reliant on memorization of random rules rather than truly getting to practice the language.",

                "This course had a very manageable workload; given that it is a 1.5 credit language course, it is inevitable that the workload is going to be higher than other courses. Learning languages is all about constant exposure and practice. However, I do feel that this course was very reliant on memorization rather than actually practicing the language itself. At an L2 level, most do not feel giving presentations off the top of their head, so it ends up being script memorization which doesn't actually help speaking skills much. I wish there were more activities that could help natural speaking; the Linguameetings did help with this, however (weekly meetings where we got to speak with a native speaker for 15 minutes about the unit we just learned). I do believe these consolidated our knowledge of the previous unit, which was helpful. I also feel that some of the units were things that new speakers shouldn't be focusing on; analyzing abstract paintings, plays, and discussing the healthcare systems and environment in Spanish didn't seem like something that was very helpful to learn in contrast to more everyday things.",
                "Strengths - good immersive course, and LinguaMeeting conversations were helpful. Learnt a lot more grammar and feel like I can have a basic conversation in Spanish now.\r\nWeaknesses  because the class was conducted purely in Spanish, there was miscommunication about assignments and exams and we did not always understand what was expected of us or when things were due.",
                "I thought this class was overall strong. I was practicing Spanish everyday and felt better about my grammar and ability to use the language after every class. I loved my professor and felt super comfortable in my class."
