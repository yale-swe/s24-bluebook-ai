                "We developed relational\/comparative (rather than parochial) analytics of the many different manifestations of (U.S.) colonialism, including Indigenous genocide and land dispossession, the enslavement of African Americans, immigration policing, military operations in Southeast Asia, and military operations in the Middle East and North Africa. To give an idea of the \"thesis\" of the class, eliding the differences between these mutually constitutive forms of colonial violence is less helpful than situating all of these forces alongside each other in shared, ongoing histories and systems of (U.S.) empire and racial capitalism. We also learned to consider these themes in a truly interdisciplinary setting as we put into conversation primary historical sources, theoretical papers, literature, and works of visual art.",
                "This course is a critical genealogy of the past and present of the US colonial constellation, spanning settler colonialism, enslavement, and global imperialism. We engaged with the polymorphous deployments of destruction, debilitation, displacement, disembodiment, and disavowal used to resuscitate US empire, and the various strategies of countermemory, creativity, protest, revolution, and care that colonized populations used to maintain their sovereignty and existence in the face of colonial violence. We performed close readings of artworks in addition to a variety of literary and theoretical texts, including Beloved by Toni Morrison and The Round House by Louise Erdrich. I emerged with a greater capacity for decolonial analysis and a new understanding of the intertwined relationship between liberal political philosophy and colonial violence.",
                "This course was excellent. I gained an excellent survey in the language of empire and grounding in  decolonial literature.",
                "Skills of critical thinking, analysis of many academic mediums, including historical and fictional literature, visual art, music, everything else. Skills of researching and writing a historical or other academic paper. Truly gained skills in applying historical sources to contemporary problems, recognizing historical throughlines, understanding contemporary ramifications of historical phenomena.",
                "This was absolutely the best class I've ever taken during college. Prof. Lowe's insightful and careful treatment of our course material made me think about Third World reckoning with colonialism in an entirely new way-- I learned so much from my classmates as well."

                "Strengths include: The choice of readings and viewings, which were at once insightful and diverse in their topics and approaches. The opportunity to not only read some amazing literature but also to put it in conversation with our historical, political, and theoretical readings. Prof. Lowe and the opportunity to learn from her. The workload is standard for an upper-level seminar: a few papers or part of a book plus a discussion post each week, a student-led discussion one week, and a 10-12 page final paper. Weaknesses: None.",
                "When you get into Yale, they tell you youll get to take classes with the best professors in the world. This class proves them right. Professor Lowe is the most brilliant teacher Ive ever had the honor of learning from. Her class-opening mini-lectures had me scrambling to transcribe everything she said as to not miss a word of her transformative analysis. She is as understanding, kind, and funny as she is excellent at facilitating, engaging her students, and pushing us to craft more nuanced and incisive analyses. I wish the seminar was slightly smaller or met more often in order to allow more time for student discussion, but otherwise, Im just grateful to have had this experience.",
                "The breadth of topics\/texts meant that we had a very interdisciplinary and engaging curriculum. The knowledge we gained was cumulative; each week we built on the texts we had already read. The one downside to this was that it was difficult to engage fully with every text we were assigned, especially during weeks where we had 4+ separate readings.",
                "The syllabus was well selected. The readings covered a vast areas of literature while thematically connecting in important and interesting ways. The readings covered diverse areas of studies on colonialism. Professor Lowe was wonderful to learn from!",
                "Lisa Lowe is the biggest strength in this class. She runs discussions effectively and efficiently but creates a fun, low-stakes academic environment while doing so. She makes space for all students and encourages open discourse in a friendly but academically rigorous way. One of the most important strengths of this class was the many mediums we studied, namely fictional literature. I am a history major but have never studied fiction as a means of illustrating historical phenomena. Recognizing fictional writing as a legitimate and powerful method of historical re-telling is a major strength of this course and a major skill gleaned from the class.\r\n\r\nI think at times, the class was so abstract and philosophical that I got lost. There were instances wherein discussions detached from the texts and got much more aspirational. I certainly appreciate that, but the discussions became hard to follow and connect to course material at times. Another logistical weakness was the length of the discussion posts, at 500 words. I often found myself stretching my responses or involving otherwise irrelevant sources and examples simply to meet the demanding 500-word requirement for weekly posts. However, given that the only writing required was in the final paper, more weekly writing to balance out makes sense. \r\n\r\nI think I would've appreciated a few more historical sources in our study. We certainly read historical literature and this is likely a greater reflection of my historical background than the class itself, but I think focusing more on historical literature may ground the class at the times when it feels philosophical and harder to track.",
                "I loved our collaborative discussions. I really believe this was the perfect course and the two hours always went by so quickly."

This class has an amazing syllabus, and will leave you grappling with questions that will linger far beyond the end of the seminar. The best seminar Ive taken at Yale so far.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Like many seminars, its a very reading-heavy class, and it moves at a quick pace, but the benefit to this is being able to bring in many different readings and texts, especially as the weeks go on.",
                "Yes if you are interested in a broader survey course for colonialism studies.",
                "I certainly would. Especially if you are interested in contemporary discussions of colonialism steeped in historical literature but also alternative mediums like photography, art, and fiction. One of the biggest strengths of this course is the way it uses fiction to articulate historical examples of colonialism, so if there is any interest in that I would recommend. Also a very low workload class with a great discussion environment and professor.",
                "Absolutely, the course was de-hierarchical, and I felt very excited and welcomed by my classmates, many who were upperclassmen.",
                "Yes! Professor Lowe is a generous and kind professor. The readings for the course were all carefully selected, and I enjoyed having a balance between creative works. I also appreciated that Prof. Lowe substituted a collaborative presentation and leading class discussion for the midterm."
