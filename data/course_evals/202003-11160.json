                "This class was a huge struggle. The Professor often started class late, assigned homework inconsistently, and exams were by no means fun. It was hard to study for exams since the lectures, Psets, and textbook had completely different emphasis on a topic so broad as materials science.",
                "One strength of this course was the homework. It was a good balance of short responses and quantitative problem solving, which forced students to think about qualitative factors in materials science, as well as the math behind it. \r\n\r\nThe main issue I had with the course were the exams. It wasn't that the material was that difficult. Rather, the exams were written with too many questions for the allotted time. I think students would have performed better and been able to prove their understanding of the material if there was more time given to think through the problems.",
                "Weaknesses: The course was very disorganized. Communication between the TA and professor was minimal based on going to the TA's sections. The open ended writing assignments dispersed throughout the semester were introduced in the lecture PowerPoints, often lacking key information like due dates and length. These same assignments would be uploaded to canvas, often with additional requirements to sources and length, closer to the deadline. This should be improved by having the assignment in full detail posted to canvas at the same time as when it is discussed in lecture. The tests are unreasonably long for the time we're allocated; 10 pages of questions in 75 minutes is absurd.\r\nStrengths: The open ended assignments required individual research outside of what was taught in class. This had its negatives, but a lot of the subjects were quite interesting to delve into and learn more about.",
                "Strengths - the open ended responses were useful in helping me understand broader applications of the course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -  terrible instructor, terrible deadlines, terrible TA, etc.",
                "It is a ton of material to learn in a very short period of time so it was hard to get a real understanding of what is happening.",
                "The course spans a wide subject area without feeling too watered down in any particular topic. However, the lectures usually do not give you a strong understanding of the topic and in my experience reading the book was far more helpful than lectures. Additionally almost all of the research assignments were too focused on technical things like word and source counts and I usually spent more time trying to fulfill requirements than learning anything. I could have a strong understanding of the topic from my research but still have to spend 2 hours searching for more sources because I did not have 3 published research papers in a 200 word response on a subject that has been well understood for sometimes over a century. Additionally, all of the problems on the psets are taken from online and there usually was a disconnect between what we went over in lecture and what was on the psets.",
                "I thought the content was very interesting, but the homework assignments occasionally were not too related to what was covered in class and often required a lot of digging around on the internet. The book only helped so much. Lectures were information-packed but each one spent about half its available time going over concepts covered in the previous class."

                "This class did not translate well to the online format. The professor struggled with the technology aspect of it, did not really encourage questions during lecture, and never uploaded the recorded lectures, making it quite inaccessible in the online format.",
                "Test taking was horrible. The professor highly suggested that the tests be printed in the small window of time between receiving the pdf and starting, which was unfair to those of us without access to printers. If we could not print, we had to draw relevant graphs and figures on our own which put us at a severe disadvantage compared to the other students. For our first midterm, the professor gave us the option of open vs closed book. Every student voted for open book, but by the end of lecture he had convinced us that closed book was preferable because otherwise he would have to re-write the exam and make it \"nearly impossible,\" while also removing the formula sheet he had planned to give us. So both midterms were closed book, and on the first he provided a formula sheet that was almost entirely words (substituting symbols we should know for multi-word descriptions). This made skimming the formula sheet for the information you needed next to impossible.",
                "The instructor wasn't super understanding about the pandemic and how that affects students ability to complete tasks. He would extend deadlines, but not nearly as generously as my other professors.",
                "This course did not do well virtually. The lectures had little to no discussion or engagement, the PowerPoints that were posted online were often not uploaded until after the homework covering that content was due and they usually were missing most of the important information as the PowerPoints utilized animations to bring the notes onto the screen, but the files uploaded were PDF's which only showed the first stage of each slide (basically many slides would have a heading or a question but none of the notes or equations). Additionally, the lectures were recorded but never posted so the professor discouraged people from asking questions during the lecture because of the recording, but did not allow students to use the recording. Lastly, the exams were significantly more difficult for those who did not have a access to a printer in the location they were taking their exam. The exams were posted and students were allowed 5 minutes to print it out before it began. If you did not have a printer where you were taking your exam, which was especially a problem for the many sophomores enrolled remotely, you still had to angle your laptop down at your answer sheet so the proctors could see it which made it very hard to read questions, and you were required to draw diagrams that were on the test which students with printed versions did not have to.",
                "Overall, I thought this class was alright. The method of administering tests was pretty jank -- I didn't have any other classes that required us to focus our computer webcams on our papers while we took our exams live, but maybe this was more normal than I think."

Lectures were not engaging, exams were kind of tough, and the assignments themselves were pretty dry and also time consuming. The only motivation to really engage with the class and learn the material is if you're truly interested in the material and won't mind reading directly from the textbook to gain most of your understanding.",
                "I don't think you'd be taking this course unless it were required of you by your major. If you're just interested in materials science, I highly recommend taking ME 286L instead. You learn the basics of material science in the first 4 lectures, and then apply it with practical experiments.",
                "No. It's required for the mechanical engineering major, but it was taught really terribly both this year and last from what I have heard from my peers. I used to be interested in materials science and the way this class was taught killed any desire I had to study materials science. Unless you absolutely have to take this class, or it's entirely restructured\/a new professor is hired, don't take it.",
                "I would be extremely hesitant to recommend this course. The content covered is very helpful if you are considering going into material science as it gives a good background into the various fields within the subject matter. However, if you are not required to take it and you know for certain you want go into material science, it is not worth the headache of dealing with the structure of the class. On the other hand if you are uncertain of perusing material science, this class may very well push you away from it. Realistically though most of the students who take this course need it to graduate.",
