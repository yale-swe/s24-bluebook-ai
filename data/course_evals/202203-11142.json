I found myself discussing topics like inattentional blindness and sharing demos with my friends after each class and took away a few lessons about how people behave that I'll carry with me.

PSYC 130 was one of the most unaccommodating classes Ive taken at Yale by far, and I wish I had known that it would be so at the beginning of the semester. After taking challenging PSYC courses, like the Human Brain, as well as PSYC 150 and a higher level Research Methods is Psychotic Illnesses, I know that to understand course material may take some new adaptation and strategy on my part, yet I still never had to worry about failing any of these classes. This is not the case with Brian Scholls lecture, and it's not because the material is harder, I actually found the lectures talked about similar topics I learned about in PSYC 110 and PSYC 150 in the past.",

It also helped that professor Scholl is super knowledgeable and had a lot of personal anecdotes that worked well with the fascinating material from various studies and readings. Overall, I would highly recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in how the human mind works and how people think and act.

                "I think that the strengths of this course are the super insightful lectures. However, a weakness is the lack of structure of these lectures -- the posted slides have very little information, so you must pay really close attention to lecture. I think that it would be helpful to have improved slides for the class. I also think that sometimes the readings for some days can take a long time. I think that those who assign readings should pay attention to the word count of each reading rather than page count (as some readings have very small font and take much longer even though the page count is low).",
                "Strengths - lecture is interesting and the course is very much a rehearsed production\r\nWeaknesses - the course would be much easier to engage with were it to use Canvas and were Prof. Scholl to upload the slides without transitions. There is no reason this complaint should have to keep coming up in the reviews year after year.",
                "Every lecture was extremely engaging. I love Brian Scholl (he reminds me of my dad lol). Even though I had this lecture immediately after another lecture, I could still stay focused because of the interactive and engaging material. Some lectures were more boring than others, but overall I enjoyed them. The biggest weakness of the course is how we are tested. The point of testing is to make sure we understand the material, but with a real sense of what an exam will look like, it is easier to prepare correctly. Other classes (one people compare to this is Psyc 110) have much more straightforward exams, so knowing definitions\/concepts is more than enough. Scholl's tests are much trickier than this. Definitions can be enough for some questions, but a lot of questions combine subjects in a way we haven't seen before. I would change the course by having more smaller quizzes (e.g., on canvas even though Scholl hates canvas) throughout the course so that students can test if they understand the material or not. This could be worth little to nothing, so students can choose how much they get out of them, but I think they would be super super helpful. Moreover, the singular essay does not allow students to improve their \"thought paper\" writing skills. I think the course should 100% have two essays, or at least students should be required to submit an initial draft for their essay for a first grade, and then be able to make corrections for the second grade. Not being able to improve on the first (and also not even getting the grade until after anyone would care to improve on what they did poorly) seems dumb to me.",
                "Strengths was the material was very interesting. Also, I honestly did not feel bored during the hour and a half lecture. Weaknesses was how the grading system is set up. Like it took forever to get our midterm grade back and never got our essay grade back. So I have no clue how I am going to do in the class. The professor is kind of a strength and weakness. I think he teaches cognitive science well and knows his stuff, but tries to set up the class in a way that can be very annoying at times.",

                "Strengths: Very engaging instructor and lots of access to TFs to ask questions.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The instructor had it hard to know what was going to been the exam, and there was so much studied that it often became overwhelming to know what I should be studying for the exam.",

Weaknesses: Readings are way too long, exams are very hard since we do not have recordings of classes, and there is a bit of lack of empathy when it comes to missing class. You cannot miss under any circumstance cause you will not do well if you do not go to class.",
                "The strengths of this course is it covers a lot of different concepts in cognitive science but it does not go into depth. A huge weakness is that the professor does not use canvas so you do not really know what your grade is.",
                "Strengths: Lectures are interesting and engaging, and readings provided extra insight into both the various fields of cognitive science and interesting studies that examined these fields.\r\nWeakness: little feedback was given throughout the semester and only had the midterm grade back by the time we had to decide whether or not to Cr\/D\/F the course, which made it difficult to make a fully educated decision. Lectures are not recorded and the posted slides often don't match what is discussed in class.",
                "The course is entirely too broad. It can be interesting, but it has little structure. Not a good representation of the cognitive science major.",
                "The structure of the course could have been much improved, such as the addition of lecture recordings or detailed class notes. The lectures, although interesting, were especially difficult to catch up on if they had been missed for any reason, including (especially) sickness or injury. There was also very little feedback on the reading question responses or other grades (my final paper still has not been graded as of yet).",

                "Strengths: Professor Scholl's lectures were very engaging and made me eager to learn about the various topics, and the vast array of topics covered gave a good overview of the field of cognitive science. Weaknesses: due to the large amount of topics covered, we almost never went in-depth on any specific idea, instead skimming over many topics and picking out specific points that we would have to know for the exams. This led to some strange points where we would have to understand specific and technical concepts without spending much time learning about them and with no other training in those fields (Turing machines and case assignment). The exams often seemed to pick out very specific points from the lecture rather than testing broader understanding of the material, and there is very little individual attention paid to students unless you really go out of your way to get help.",

                "Workload and assignments were fair. There was no feedback on writing assignments and they were never graded or discussed in class, so it was tempting not to do them as their actual application wasn't really visible.\r\n\r\nWe were expected to come to lecture and actively take notes, but the online content uploaded to the class website was terrible -- all figures \/ graphs \/ images were removed from the slide deck and it made it very hard to use them as study material. \r\n\r\nExam content was fair and it was nice that it was completed before actual final exam periods.",

                "strengths: everything; fair exams, not too much work, interesting readings, great professor, good TAs",
                "This course was extremely interesting both because of the fascinating nature of the material and the engaging packaging of the material by Brian Scholl. He is awesome! One of the few weaknesses is how difficult it is to prepare for tests. It is never really clear what is going to be on the test. You can kind of guess but this ends up encouraging you to study everything even if you dont have to. This could be a good thing but it does make it difficult to study. You feel like you just have to read the instructors mind.",
                "Strengths: Interesting topics and the professor was pretty fantastic.\r\nWeaknesses: if you missed class, it was quite difficult to catch up as the lectures were not recorded and the slides posted after class only really made sense if you were in lecture.",
                "Strengths: interesting topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I never knew what was happening in the class or what was important during the lectures.",
                "The class covers a lot of interesting material, but does not go into depth with it. It's hard to get engaged\/interested in the information when each topic is covered so briefly, but Professor Scholl did warn us about this on the first day of class. Overall, it wasn't too much work which was good, and was interesting. The main weakness, as stated, was the focus of breadth over depth. More resources could be provided for exam prep as well, such as practice problems, review sessions, or even more engaging homework assignments that help increase understanding of course materials.",
                "The lectures were engaging but condescending at times. The reading questions did indeed get me to read, but only the articles for which there were questions and only to the extent necessary to answer the questions. The course could be improved with less fluff in introducing materials (such as reviewing the course roadmap every lecture), but the content that already exists is interesting and reasonable comprehensive.",
                "This is a very well structured overview of the major but it is definitely breadth over depth. The only weakness was that we could not cover more topics and specifics!",
                "strengths: lectures were super engaging, exams were fair\r\nweaknesses: I have no idea how I am doing in this course since I only have the score from my first exam. I never got any feedback for my Morning Pages, so I don't know if I did them right.",
                "Some structure could be appreciated in review sessions. I first noticed that in the in-person review session the night before the midterm, the handful of TAs we had were just standing around and looking at each other, clueless on who would or how to answer questions students had prepared. Further, for simple accessibility measures, lectures or at the very least, review sessions, should be available for students who are unable to attend synchronously for any reason.",
                "No strengths. Weaknesses: it was formatted terribly, no gauge of grade, professor was not good",
                "too broad and a bit disorganized- it was hard to know what to study for the exams and I didn't like the thought paper",
                "I really liked the lectures, as they were very interesting and covered lots of different topics. I would appreciate more feedback on my reading responses.",
                "strengths: \r\n- good breadth of interesting cognitive science topics covered \r\n- enthusiastic and engaging lecture style \r\n- instructor is happy to talk with students after class, and even held an emergency review session when the TFs who were supposed to run the session were unable to do so! he is clearly very committed to this class and the ability of his students to understand topics in cognitive science\r\n- readings are well chosen, are of an appropriate length, and clearly relate to the course material \r\n\r\nweaknesses: \r\n- lack of Canvas usage impeded course organization, especially given that you still need to log into Canvas to view the readings\r\n- instructor seems very stubborn about some things without giving a clear rationale (e.g. not using Canvas, designing longer and more difficult make-up exams, not posting slides with large images)\r\n- I understand that is impossible to delve into each topic deeply, but the last lecture on sex & attraction felt very reductive to me and almost feels like it did more harm than good. I felt like a lot of the lecture talked about certain beauty standards and explained why they were universal due to evolution, and I feel like not enough attention was given to dismantling the idea that people should aspire to certain beauty standards (even though this was explicitly stated by the instructor, it still felt like he was unintentionally promoting the beauty standards). Also, when he referred to certain faces in studies as \"attractive\" and \"unattractive\", assuming that we would all agree with him, it just felt like we were upholding and naturalizing conventional beauty standards, which is harmful to people who do not fit into those beauty standards. I think that this portion of this course offers intellectual value, but should be re-evaluated and further nuanced if it is going to be included in the future.",
                "The lectures were captivating and you can tell each word is carefully selected. My only critique would be to have more engagement with our Reading Question responses.",
                "Strengths: Amazing guest lectures, and great in-class exercises that retain engagement.\r\nWeaknesses: Dense reading and archaic forms of collecting\/submitting work.",
                "Its quite all over the place and the methods of communication and submission for assignments felt unorganized",
                "I personally believe that Professor Scholl is a fantastic lecturer who clarified almost every topic we discussed. The lectures were engaging, interesting, and accessible for the most part.\r\nThe course was not made for the convenience of students. Professor Scholl's refusal to use Canvas or any other submission format besides email and print makes it super hard to organize and only caters to his preferences.",
                "If the slides were more organized and has actual content",
                "Found it very enjoyable. Fun lectures and fascinating material. Would have preferred for some parts of the course to be a little faster paced. Would also have been nice to have at least some feedback for the weekly writing responses  and maybe a higher bar.",
                "I think the greatest weakness of this course is the methods of assessment. There are no tests\/quizzes besides the midterm and the final, and Professor Scholl refused to provide any example questions for us, so we had no idea what the midterm would be like literally until we sat down to take it. I felt like I didn't know how to study for the midterm, and so the outcome didn't reflect the amount of work I put into the class day to day. This would be fine, but the two exams make up 60% of your final grade, which seems really high for an intro class. I didn't get any feedback on any work except the midterm, which was frustrating when trying to navigate the requirements of the class. Weighing the exams less, giving more feedback on reading responses, or providing even a handful of example questions could make this class a lot better.",
                "Strengths: I liked the topic matter itself and I liked having to respond to the reading response questions so I would stay on top of the readings.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Having office hours immediately after class was not helpful because it would not give me enough time to reflect on the lecture and ask questions. I also would be tired after the hour and 15 min long lecture so would not want to stay back. The lectures are not recorded and there is no Zoom option so if students are sick or cannot attend class for a personal reason you have to rely on others to get the notes. The lecture slides are also not posted in their entirety so it is hard for students to catch back up. I also was not really entertained by the lectures and would get annoyed by the random interludes of random jokes and corny videos but that is just my frustration with the teaching style. There also is not a practice exam so it is hard to study for the tests.",
                "It is super engaging, but not giving us the full slides was quite mean. Personally, I would still attend all the lectures anyways, but I would really appreciate to see the slides as they were later again would be really helpful.",
                "Strengths: Brian is a good lecturer, so the lectures are engaging\r\nWeaknesses: Tests are so specific that even my TA said he doesn't know how to help students prepare, tests also depend on regurgitating certain phrases Professor Scholl likes to say in class, only the words of the lecture slides are posted online so they are practically useless, the topics listed on the syllabus do not match up with the topic titles of the lectures",
                "Strengths: Very engaging lectures!! Good pace. Fantastic material covered. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would be great to have the lectures recorded!! When studying for exams, it would be so useful to review the lecture and rewatch some of the in class demonstrations presented on the screen.",
                "The strengths of this course all come from the professor. He was an excellent lecturer, always energetic and passionate, and his slides were clear and flowed very well. There were many demos and practical examples (i.e. visual illusions during the vision unit) to keep the class engaged, despite it being such a large lecture. The big weakness of the class came from the lack of feedback on, well, almost anything. Apart from the midterm, you get no feedback on anything else until after the course is already over.",
                "doesn't seem like its actually much of a survey course for the major, although was fun and all. Sort of feels like the CS50 of cogsci.",
                "Strengths: This is a survey course executed to perfection. Some specific strengths are the reading responses, clear organization for such a large class (both large number of people and large variety of subject matter--it's structured to handle both of these), and very engaging, hands-on lectures (including some great jokes). No weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Engaging class with easy-to-grasp material, personable professor, low workload\r\nWeaknesses: Little to no interaction or feedback from TFs or professor, likely due to large lecture format",
                "By far my biggest gripe was how long it took for things to get graded and the lack of transparency.",
                "I would say that this course is extremely interactive with its many brain games\/wow moments.\r\n\r\nHowever, I know many students who struggled to catch up after missing a lecture because the teacher does not include the images in the slides he shares with the students. Because most of the slides were images, the students were left not knowing what to do. This wouldn't have been difficult to fix.",
                "Introduction to the topics, methods, and studies in cognitive science. I liked that it was lecture-based and that there were no sections. The required reading responses were good because I ended up doing all of the readings.",
                "Strength: probably the most interesting class I took this semester. I always looked forward to sitting in lecture the material was never dull, and professor Scholl is a dynamic presenter (with some very clear enthusiasm for the topic). \r\nWeakness: in such a big class, it's hard to receive feedback or really test your understanding of some of the concepts. I also wish there was more depth, but I don't see any other way the class could have been taught. Finally, the lectures sometimes felt more performative than substantive  again, this is not necessarily a problem (and perhaps a necessity considering the type of material covered in this class).",
                "A weakness of this course is how unaccommodating it was. It was frustrating how Professor Scholl would only upload the bare templates of every slide (only some text, no images which were the majority of the slides) which made it hard to review content for exams. Further, even when I had COVID, I couldn't access any lecture recordings since the lectures aren't recorded, and I had to wait an extra week for Professor Scholl to post the bare templates which were unintelligible to someone that couldn't listen to the lecture. This harsh treatment also extends to missing exams if you miss an exam because of a legitimate reason (illness, religious holiday, anything covered in a dean's excuse), Professor Scholl punishes you unfairly by giving you an exam entirely different and much more difficult than the rest of the class (no multiple choice, no short answer, only long responses, no skips). \r\n\r\nI understand Professor Scholl's worries about students taking advantage of the system, but there are many instances where students can't help but miss lecture\/exam, and it is his responsibility as a professor of a large lecture course to provide fair exams and slides\/recordings.",
                "Strengths were the cool reading assignments, the low workload, and the way complex concepts were explained. Also take advantage of the teaching fellows if you don't understand something, they're great. It could be improved by going a bit deeper into computation and Turing machines, still didn't really get the relevance to the human mind. But it is an intro course!",
                "strengths: pretty interesting lectures\r\nweaknesses: a lot of the course seemed to be premised on presenting some experimental result or observation and then interpreting it from a cognitive science perspective. Sometimes this seemed a little bit obvious and repetitive (although the experiments themselves were really cool) to just say \"instinct blindness\" for example, but this was overall not a very big issue with the course.",
                "Professor Scholl is a remarkably passionate and detailed lecturer. He explains concepts in a way that makes complex material easy to grasp at first exposure.",
                "Strengths: I saw a lot of people on course reviews saying how they disliked the breadth of the course, which I personally find confusing. That's THE strength of this course, an opportunity to be introduced to many, many ways cognitive science is used in many fields, of which you are then free to choose whichever you enjoy! Embrace learning about so many different things that may not appeal to you at first, and pick the parts of cogsci that you like most to study in the future because it is an absolutely fascinating field! Also, professor Scholl, in my opinion, is an absolutely amazing professor in what he does - the structure of the lectures is great, and he keeps you engaged throughout the hour and 15 minutes. The material is amazing too, the way he has picked the readings is just challenging enough so you're always learning a lot, but also not stuck on any new themes he introduces. Moreover, I am a big proponent of learning in class instead of just from the slides right before the exam, so a lot of criticisms about being difficult to study for exams I did not experience at all. I couldn't make it to 8 lectures in total but still got a good grade on all exams by virtue of asking friends what he talked about in the lecture and going through the slides together.\r\nWeaknesses: Not many for my style of learning, that is, little cramming, much utilization of lecture time.",
                "Be careful when deciding to take this course. It is an intro level course, but I wouldn't necessarily describe it as being an easy A. It's a gut that's a gut until it's not a gut.",
                "Strength: covers a lot of materials; everything low stakes\r\nWeakness: the slides posted doesn't have pictures so it's hard to go back and review",
                "Strengths: reading questions helped to solidify reading materials in my mind, humor and demonstrations throughout each lecture kept me very engaged, tips on how to change how we study based on the first midterm were practical and useful, reading materials familiarized me with high-level scientific writing\r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish we had received more feedback on our only thought paper automatically, but I recognize that the size of our class is incredibly large and makes this difficult",
                "The readings were unnecessarily long. Didnt like there wasnt much to help one really study for the test.",
                "The curve is very generous; if you at least go to lecture you'll do just fine. Class isn't recorded, though, and the lectures slides are not very helpful or representative of what he talks about in class.",
                "While this course covered some interesting topics, the lectures often moved too fast and didn't allow students to internalize any of the information they learned.",
                "Brian is a good lecturer but doesn't have his students' best interests at heart.  He deletes content from the lecture slides before posting them and doesn't provide support for students who are struggling or have questions.  His solution to most problems is \"make a friend in the class and ask them for help.\"",
                "Strengths: interesting lectures\r\nWeaknesses: lot of content because of nature of survey course, hard to follow\/understand bigger pictures, could be organized better; for those reasons preparing for the exams was difficult. there was no way to practice application problems before the exams",
                "A strength of this course is that the information is interesting and the Professor seems excited about it and interacts with the students, which makes the material easier to learn. A weakness is that if for some reason you miss a lecture, you miss out on important info since the exam is solely based on information covered in lectures and lectures arent recorded.",
                "Strengths: The material is interesting and covers a nice overview of the different areas of cognitive science. The workload was manageable.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The lectures were very confusing.\r\n- It felt like the professor did not care about student success.\r\n- I think the class could benefit from a weekly discussion section.\r\n- I wish the lectures were recorded and posted online afterward.\r\n- It was entirely unnecessary and confusing that the course had its own web page when Canvas would've worked just fine. This course should use Canvas in the future.",
                "Strengths: fascinating content, engaging professor, very rewarding if you put in the effort.\r\nWeaknesses: The class requires students to be self-motivated to succeed. Theres little accountability for actually reading the readings, and many students just skim them, although I would recommend actually reading at least half of them. You can easily get away with BS-ing the reading responses.",
                "I loved this class so much. No weaknesses. Strengths were the way the class was structured and brian scholls way of lecturing. Exams were hard but fair.",
                "The readings in this course are research journal articles, which while difficult to read, are very interesting to read. In addition, the case studies presented in the course make learning in class very fun. One weakness of the course was that the lectures at times did not feel connected to one another, making it difficult to follow along. This can be possibly improved by giving overviews of the days lecture at the start of class."

                "I would recommend it to freshmen looking for a fun and interesting course. Prof. Scholl is a good lecturer and has this course down to a science.",
                "If you are interested in cognition \/ the way the mind works I would 100% recommend this class. Even less, if you have any interest in one of the sub-disciplines of Cognitive Science, I would recommend this class. Scholl is an engaging and exciting lecturer, and the material will keep you on your toes (at least 80% of the time).",
                "Yes if you want to learn how the mind works. You may think the brain and the mind are the same thing, but you will learn so much about the mind and about yourself if you take this class. Also, if you are debating this class or the human brain, definitely take this class.",
                "Definitely recommend this as a great social science!!",
                "Yes, very interesting.",
                "I would only recommend this class if you are seriously considering becoming a Cognitive Science major.",
                "Absolutely - so interesting and basically a bunch of fun facts about how our mind works. Also Brian Scholl is a very engaging lecturer and funny.",
                "Maybe, I might tell them to take it and credit\/d\/f the class since it has a weird turn",
                "Highly, this has been one of my favorite courses ever.",
                "Yes - great intro to Cog Sci- be prepared to write down everything he says in class.",
                "Not really unless they really want to study Cognitive Science. It is very very hard, will take a lot of work, you cannot miss lecture for any reason, and although it is interesting, there are other interesting classes where you will have a better experience, such as Intro to Psych.",
                "If you like the concepts then you will probably really like the class however if you're using it to get rid of a social science credit, maybe try something else. It was fun, just did not like the format.",
                "Absolutely. This course serves as a broad survey of a number of areas of cognitive science, allowing you to get a sense of each and possibly find your own specific passion that you can then explore through further classes in the field. The lectures are some of the most engaging I had this semester and Professor Scholl is funny and entertaining to listen to.",
                "I would not. The TFs were not engaged, and the class was not structured to engage students either.",
                "I wouldn't recommend this course unless you are really interested in cog sci (and even then I would probably recommend you to skip this course if you can). There is simply too much and the structure of this course really relies on memorization for learning.",
                "I would - it's a good intro to the interdisciplinary field of cog sci",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in the mind or possibly interested in any of the fields contained within cognitive science. It is a good class to see which of the topics interests you the most so you can explore taking classes in that specific department.",

                "Yes if you are willing to do the readings, at attentions in lecture, take good notes, and go to office hours",
                "Yes. It was a very interesting course that is well worth ones time",
                "I would. It's a fascinating topic in my view and I loved how interdisciplinary it was.",

                "Its a good overview of cognitive science but pretty shallow and can be a bit of an eye roll.",
                "Good as an intro if you plan to continue in the major. It could fairly be compared to Intro Psych 110, which I found to be a much better introductory course than Cog sci, regardless of future major plans. There were sort of a lot of busywork assignments that I didn't feel I really benefited from.",
                "Yep! If you are at all interested in cognitive science, this is a great course to take.",
                "YES! absolutely--honestly think this is one of the best lecture courses at Yale and everyone should take it to learn more about the mind",
                "I would thoroughly recommend. It is not too demanding and the readings are very interesting. I loved every lecture and found myself talking about the material to friends in and out of the class. Brian Scholl is extremely engaging and lovable as a professor.",
                "Yes. It is interesting and the lectures are very interesting.",
                "I would recommend it. Easy workload class with interesting topics.",
                "If someone is genuinely interested in the human mind and how it works, I would recommend it. I just say to be weary if you're looking to learn about topics in depth. This course covers many topics very briefly, so if that's something that still interests you, then I would recommend it. There is a lot of interesting information, and the homework is typically very easy. Exams are pretty tough, but there are only two (non-cumulative).",
                "I highly recommend this course, especially if Professor Scholl is teaching it. The class itself is interesting, though not all that distinct from an introductory psychology class. Scholl's lecture style is pretty great though, so it's worth it for that alone. If nothing else, it's a great chance to take a cursory look at an i interesting field.",
                "yes for sure",
                "IF the student is already comfortable with the style of social science courses and can absorb a lot through lectures, then yes, I'd recommend this as an interesting, low-stakes source of information that's worth showing up twice a week. If the student struggles with memorization or does not have experience in psychology, then this is still a worthwhile course but should not be treated as a gut. I know many students were studying down to the wire for the exams because of the density of examples and information necessary for modified regurgitation.",
                "Absolutely. Especially with professor Scholl.",
                "yes for the lectures, but the grading is a bit rough",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This class helped me become aware of the interesting and unseen behavior within my own brain that I otherwise had no understanding of.",
                "No. I am not the only student with these grievances on the structure and evaluative methods on this course, but unfortunately I only met students with disabilities like mine and learned about how unaccommodating the course was for them in the last couple of weeks of the semester, once it was too late to change anything.\r\n\r\nThere are other courses that offer similar information on what is provided in this course, in a better and more accommodating way. It is unfortunate that this is one of the only PSYC Social Science major fulfilment attributes being offered at any one point in time.",
                "No I would not. Unless you are truly interested in it, do not take. It is just stressful and although some topics are fun, the exam feels way too difficult for what was actually taught (it was as if trying to answer based on such a small specific answer that did not seem possible). In addition, the professor is not good",
                "only if its required or you're looking to be a cogsci major\r\nif you're looking for a fun social science there are better less stressful ones out there that are more engaging",

                "Yes, I would. I think learning about the mind is really interesting, and this class provides a great introduction to lots of different areas of cognitive science - like neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, psychology etc.. Professor Scholl also makes lectures very entertaining. I would also recommend taking advantage of office hours, which I regret not doing. I think I would have gotten more out of this class and gained a deeper understanding of the material if I had talked more with the teaching fellows.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning about cognitive science and how it intersects with the various disciplines covered within the scope of cognitive science. If you are only interested in one or two subfields of cognitive science but don't want to learn about cognitive science generally, this course might not be for you. This course is a fair bit of work as there is usually a reading response or two due before class, but the workload is reasonable as long as you manage your time well. You definitely have to study carefully to do well on the exams though-- the TFs are a great resource if you have questions!",
                "Yes. If you have any interest in the human mind or asking tough questions, this is the class to take.",

                "I would not recommend this class as it was harshly graded with no clear instructions or support.",
                "Yes! Mostly for prospective cognitive science majors who are interested in this topic.",
                "Yes, even if they dont intend to major in cogsci. The course could be helpful for many disciplines",
                "Totally! Even if not a cog sci major. So many relevant and interesting topics, and not too stressful",
                "I absolutely loved this course. If you're interested in cognitive science, it's a broad and engaging introduction to the field. Kind of like going to a TED Talk every day.",
                "If you are considering a cog sci major, yes. This class was interesting, but the methods of assessment (midterm, final, paper) do not make any sense. If I wasn't a cog sci major, I would only take this c\/d\/f.",

                "Only if you're interested in cognitive science or majoring in it. The exams are very hard to do well on, so this class is not an easy A. There are plenty of easier Social Science courses to take that are still interesting if you're looking for the distributional requirement.",
                "YES. decided I'm going to major in cognitive science because of this exact course. Cogsci was not even on my radar beforehand; I thought I was an EPE major! Love Prof Scholl and the material is genuinely fascinating. You will learn so much about yourself!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course, as it's a fascinating, and an excellent, not-too-work-heavy introduction to a lot of psychology and cognitive science. However, you have to be prepared for the very little feedback you're going to receive, and be ready for the midterm to be vastly different than you expect.",
                "yes, if youre considering taking a survey\/intro course. its a fun course and has some interesting info. although, it doesn't seem like its super representative of the cogsci major, and also brian scholl is questionable.",
                "Yes I would. It is awesome for anyone regardless of their major or interest.",
                "Yes. The lectures were always engaging and fascinating.",
                "I'd highly recommend this course to anyone. You'll learn lots, and even if you find some subjects are less gripping than others, the nature of a survey course is that you'll soon move on from it. The workload is light, but at the same time, the work you do outside of class feels like it really counts and is worthwhile.",
                "Yes, it is a low-workload class that is interesting and takes you through a ton of different real-world relevant ideas and explores them briefly but well.",
                "Yes and no. Great capitvating lectures but the grade you'll get is super ambiguous.",
                "I would, but it is more difficult than I was expecting",
                "This is a very cool course. It's not that hard to like. However, there is not much depth. The student should keep this in mind when considering taking this class.",
                "Honestly, probably not. If you've taken Intro Psych or any psych class before, you'll probably be familiar with a lot of the studies discussed. Lectures are not recorded and the slides that are posted afterward have half the content missing from them, so you're sorta screwed in the event that you're sick and can't make it to class. The lectures themselves are disorganized and sometimes you're left wondering why Scholl was jumping from a certain topic to another. Also, you don't get your final paper grade in time to decide where you should Credit\/D\/F.\r\n\r\nWhat's also interesting is that towards the end of the semester, Scholl spent half a lecture discussing majors--why it's useless to double major and why it's better to focus on something you're interested in. As someone who felt as though this class was a mishmash of topics, I actually found this to be a really good argument for why I shouldn't major in cogsci and why it might be better to study neuro or comp sci or one of the fields that makes it so ~interdisciplinary~.",
                "I would. But keep what professor Scholl tells you on the first day into account: this is a breadth over depth class, there is no textbook (only scientific papers for readings), there are no lecture notes, and don't expect clear feedback unless you seek it out. Given the nature of the topic and the sheer size of the class, I think all of these choices are justified  I don't see any other easy way they could have been done. A lot of griping I've seen about this class is related to these concerns: make sure you know what you are getting yourself into.",
                "Yes! I think it's a wonderful intro to cogsci and Professor Scholl is an incredibly engaging and interesting lecturer.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes! The criticisms about the breadth of the course and the hate on professor Scholl's slides I find confusing. It's THE point of the course to serve as an opportunity to be introduced to many, many ways cognitive science is used in many fields, of which you are then free to choose whichever you enjoy. Also, the exams are very easy to study for, if you take a one-second look at Scholl's presented research on studying - take paper notes, engage with the lecture, spaced repetition for terms if needed and the course is easy from there on. I even missed a lot of lectures, and still just by talking to a friend for a bit about the content that was presented, in conjunction with the readings, I could catch up on the material easily. Also, professor Scholl's teaching style is great, very engaging and the material presented is super fascinating! Definitely do take the course if you have a remote interest in cognitive science, or any of the fields related to it!!!",
                "No unless needed for cog sci major. Way more interesting, engaging courses you could take",
                "Yes, if they are interested in cognitive science or learning about how the human mind works in general",
                "I'd highly recommend this course to any student, in STEM, social sciences, or humanities, though I'd be clear that the scientific writing cannot be neglected.",
                "No, unless they have to take it.",
                "Yes, it's a fun class that's pretty low-commitment and has engaging lectures.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they absolutely need it for their major. I'm not a cognitive science major, but I took this course because I wanted to try something new and I thought it would be interesting. I found that this course required intense focus and attention 100% of the time because despite the exams being based on the lectures, the lectures were never recorded and posted, and the lecture slides that were posted had almost no useful information. The only way to do well in this class is to try to write down every word that Professor Scholl says and predict what he might think is important material for the exam. I don't mind sitting through a huge lecture or taking a survey course, but when the course requires you to try to piece together incoherent notes because the in-person lectures are the only thing you have to go off of and they move too fast, it becomes unenjoyable.",
                "This course is fun but if you can't C\/D\/F it then be wary because the grading is arbitrary and unpredictable.",
                "No, only if they must take it for their major. I would instead recommend taking a course that goes more into depth on a specific topic because this course is a very broad overview",
                "I would recommend this course. Professor Scholl is an interesting professor and makes the class fun to take. The information is so cool and even if you arent interested in psych of cognitive science as a major, this class is still fun to take and you are likely to learn something that can apply outside of this class.",
                "No, I have already recommended to many people that they instead opt to take a different introductory psychology class because I don't think this class was taught well.",
                "Yes, definitely! I am not a Psych\/CogSci\/etc. major, and it was the most interesting class I took this semester. I dont think Professor Scholl is teaching it again, which is unfortunate, because he is really great at teaching, making random ideas interesting, and staying organized. Every lecture felt like a Ted Talk, and I genuinely came away from each one feeling like, Wow, thats so fascinating! Our minds work in such a weird way! Because of the interdisciplinary nature of Cognitive Science, and because this is an intro class, the content sometimes felt like a bunch of random facts about different topics, but it all ties back to the same CogSci themes, and because its so interesting, I didnt mind. Yes, its hard to know how well youre doing in the class until the midterm, but if you actually do the readings, pay full attention during lectures, follow the studying advice he gives you, and dont wait until the last minute to study, youll be fine. Its harder than Intro Psych, but way more interesting in my opinion. Id also recommend staying after class to just listen to him answer peoples questions in a smaller group. Take CogSci!",
                "Totally this has been my favorite class at Yale",
                "Absolutely not",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to any student looking to get an introduction to cognitive science. This course gives a good overview and covers a lot of different material.",
                "Yes. Wonderful instructor, wonderful teaching fellows, wonderful content."
