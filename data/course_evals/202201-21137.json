Being more critical of how refugees and refugee narratives are portrayed in media and other platforms. Writing carefully and Capaciously.",

                "You learn about the multitude if ways to look at Southeast Asian refugees and refugees in general. Prof Tran dives into important methods of Critical Refugee studies and exposes you to the core scholars who influence the work in the field. We not only got to read their works but also hear from and speak to some directly.",

The class dives deep into the experiences of Southeast Asian Refugees, but at the same time covers an incredibly large range of histories, topics, and themes."

                "Amazing class and amazing professor. It felt so comfortable to share personal accounts with other students who identify as refugee children or have family who are refugees. Definitely a rare and beautiful experience to have at Yale",
                "While discussions were a bit quiet at times, they were for the most part engaging and very insightful and class felt like a welcoming space. The course was a bit more difficult at the beginning as we were simultaneously introduced to large amounts of historical contexts + concepts in critical refugee studies that I didn't quite understand---this became far less of a problem as the semester progressed.",
                "This course is extremely engaging. The readings are interesting and class discussion always serves to enhance the readings beyond just the academic sense. The personal involvement that many taking this class have with the histories discussed makes it a very valuable class.",
                "Honestly, I can only think of strengths because this course is designed open-endedly to grapple with the many parts of Critical Refugee Studies and Prof. Tran is welcoming and encouraging of different paths of exploration and dissection. Because of the diverse reading list, you are exposed to the diaspora of multiple countries and groups across Southeast Asia.",
                "The content was a wide range and very interesting. I think the pedagogy in class could have been broken up with more small group work or other activities since the class session is so long.",
                "This class has many strengths: you will learn a lot, you will learn things that you won't learn in other Yale seminars, and the material will be engaging. It's fruitful to people who've taken multiple higher level ER&M seminars, but at the same time, it's accessible to students who may not have taken an ER&M class before. The only weakness I can think of is that the coursework is definitely on the heavier side. Be prepared to work hard and engage deeply with the material."

                "YES!",
                "Yes!!! If given the opportunity, take it! Prof tran is amazing and the class gave me a better sense of myself and my refugee familys identity in the US. Its a good survey of Southeast Asian refugee contemporary history as well",
                "Yes! This class allows for a deeper look at many parts of the refugee experience that are often overlooked/overwritten. I felt more understanding of my own community as well as others, and the class in itself became another community where I learned a lot from everyone and their own stories. Regardless of how much you can relate to Southeast Asian refugees, a lot of the concepts in the class are still applicable to many other subjects.",
                "Yes, I highly recommend this course, especially if you have a personal connection to the material (such as your family being refugees).",
                "YES!! Absolutely take this course, because it will add depth to the way you think of refugees and the diaspora. Professor Tran is a wonderful seminar leader and mentor. In other classes, bringing in speakers can be unproductive or feel unrelated but Professor Tran curates the course in a way that everything ties back together and adds to the knowledge culminated throughout the semester. The readings are engaging and not too long as well.",
                "Yes!",
                "As an ER&M major, this was one of the classes I've been most invested in. It has also been one of the best organized classes I've taken with respect to the course reading and syllabus. I learned a lot in this class, and since it was so interesting to me, the work did not feel like a burden. That said, this class certainly has a heavier workload. I would highly recommend it for people searching a seminar!",
                "Absolutely. This was such an enriching and meaningful class. Although the class was probably split 60/40 between students who have personal ties to the course content and those who don't, it was a fantastic community to be a part of. There is so much untaught history that emerges from this class and it's so exciting to be engaged in new critical refugee studies literature. The class is also a wonderful balance in the types of materials we engage with. There is plenty of focus on non-academic literature materials such as art, documentaries, poetry, or other mediums. Such a fantastic course, and Professor Tran is one of the most friendly and just best teachers on campus."
