I had zero programming experience coming into this Summer and now I can code in Java and write programs that work and can actually do things. I learned how to write methods, classes and objects, learned how to use for loops and while loops, and learned how to store things in variables and arrays. I definitely learned a lot this Summer.",

I learnt how to write useful Java programs: using data types (arrays, strings, numbers, lists, queues, stacks, etc.), control structures (conditionals, looping, exceptional handling, recursion, etc.), program analysis (assertions, etc.), basic algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.), object-oriented programming (classes, methods, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, interface, etc.),  and basic libraries (graphics, digital audio, text processing, etc.).\r\n2. I had chances to collaborate with classmates: a precious opportunity to work with excellent partners, which is an indispensable skill for CS programmers.\r\n3. As an international student, I was fully exposed to Yale Culture as well as got kind help and support from Prof., TAs and classmates, which I appreciate a lot.",

Other than just learning the concept, the activities within the class and the problem set offered me chance to apply the skills I've learnt. Compared to just knowing something about java before this course, I am able to use something after the course, which is much more important.",
                "I choose this course so that I would be able to learn more about what my dad does and what programming is all about. I wanted to see if I could have anything to do with real-life programming, and for that, I required an intense course. Luckily, this program did not disappoint and was exactly what I was looking for. \r\n\r\nI learned all of the basic programming skills and the more complicated ones too, such as creating an entire game. I never thought I would be able to learn how to make a whole game in as short of a time as one week, but I did! (with the help of my classmates and instructors).\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the Zoom meetings very much even though I felt like the course was moving along too quickly for beginners. I did appreciate the challenge!\r\n\r\nI loved learning more about the logistic way of Java. Everything has a reason and, one little mistake means hours of work to solve it. I think that that was my most valuable lesson: \"How to solve problems\"",

                "I had to learn most of the content via pre-recorded lectures instead of actually being taught by the TAs, I would have liked to be taught by the actual professor instead. The sections involved lots of examples and exercises but not a lot of actual teaching. That being said, the pre-recorded lectures were very helpful and I learned a lot.",
                "The course is good.",
                "Strengths: tons of. Answered in Question1.\r\nIt would be fully appreciated if it could be more efficient during Office Hour. It might be better if we try filling questionnaires illustrating our specific questions and get into groups, meet classmates with the same problem and help one another.",
                "Strengths: The psets are thought-provoking and most of the time the results are cool.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Many students suffered in this class because office hours were understaffed. It was a common occurrence for a person to attend office hours (online), wait for the entire three hours, and never be helped. They were also very adamant in the beginning about not sharing code, which hindered a lot of possible progress that could have been made (and would have alleviated the office hours crowd). They made adjustments during the third week, but eventually the problem set walkthrough slides they posted merely reiterated the directions on the pset. The need for help with psets was necessary because there were many skills that were used in the starter code that students were not familiar with, which means students didn't understand what the program was supposed to do already and what parts they were supposed to fill in.\r\n\r\nCommunication was shaky at best and completely useless at worst. Responses to emails were erratic and often many hours later. The average response time to posts on ed discussion (well, those they responded to) was probably about 12 hours. The directions for the final project were non-existent (literally, there were no directions provided on the submission page and the only verbal guidance we received was to \"make a project in a week\"). Grading for psets took forever and absolutely no feedback was provided for docked points.",
                "Paced too fast",
                "The quizzes and psets could be more synchronized with the pace at which the lessons are given.",
                "The strengths of this course were the organization of the sections into level of Java programming experience. I really appreciated that this class was able to accomodate for not only people already quite proficient, but students who have no experience at all. Another strength would be how helpful the TAs were for directing the students during section and office hours. The weaknesses of the course were that the assignments assigned each week were double that of a normal year, which was extremely challenging, especially for students with no coding experience. Another weakness is that the office hours were not efficient due to lack of number of TAs for this course. At many times I would be in office hours for over 3 hours and yet to speak and get help from a TA. This was very frustrating and I hope this can be resolved for next summer.",
                "If I'm really a zero-based programmer, I may need more walkthroughs to finish the assignment because now we only had walkthroughs for the hardest problem sets. I know that we had office hours but most of those time periods are not friendly to international students.",
                "My only problem with the course was OH. \r\nWe all appreciated the existence of these in the course, but the waiting lines were terrible. \r\nIf you had a block you would have to wait for about two hours for someone to help you. Not only was there a short help time but while you waited, there was not much to do since you had a block. \r\nSome people wasted 4 hours in the waiting line and got told to come back the next day.\r\n\r\nIt was very chaotic and this could've been organized better. \r\nThe rest of the course was perfect.",
                "As a introduction course, it's really hard for a beginner, especially in the summer session: we need to learn knowledge and master it in such a short time.",
                "It was pretty difficult to try to turn in two psets a week, on the same due date and at the same large workload for each one, during five weeks in the summer. Perhaps if two psets are needed to be turned in a week, they could be smaller and have staggered due dates so we only have to worry about one pset at a time? Having the two discretionary late days for psets was extremely helpful, but perhaps it would be easier for students to receive their grading if the late day was updated to allow students to send the code on Gradescope instead of through email.",
                "it would be great to have more staff at office hours",
                "The course taught useful information, but was taught at such a fast-paced level that it was hard to keep up.",

It's beautiful to see how simple but complicated it is, and there is no in-between. In my opinion, I found a strong base of ethics and morality behind computer science.\r\n\r\nThis course is not only meant for programming and science students but also for the rest. It's a great way to learn more about problem-solving and also a very interesting and professional way to learn more about programming when in high school.\r\nIt's a lovely preview of what yale offers educationally and it also shows how interesting the courses are.",
