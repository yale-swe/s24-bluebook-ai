                "I liked that it combined multiple mediums of understanding the contexts. We looked at journals, maps, listened to songs, alogn with analyzing the texts",
                "Strengths - Extremely well-structured syllabus. I loved the readings, and Professor Smith is a wonderful lecturer.\r\nWeaknesses - There seemed to be a lack of cohesion between Professor and TF. I was a bit confused about logistics sometimes. I would have loved this class even more as a seminar.",
                "I really loved this course- I thought the lectures were interesting, readings were great, and general theme of the course worked really well. Only thing I didn't love was that our final paper got pushed to the end, as we also had a final exam. Just sticking to the schedule or working really hard to make sure that there aren't two finals in future iterations would be great.",
                "strengths: \r\n- readings were super interesting and thought-provoking\r\n- essay prompts were stimulating and provided good focus but still appropriately open-ended\r\n- lectures were well structured and enjoyable \r\n- I really enjoyed the discussion section component of this course\r\n- great way to practice and improve your close reading\r\n\r\nweaknesses: \r\n- reading workload was somewhat unbalanced such that some classes had tons of reading due while others had far less\r\n- studying for the final exam was a bit of a pain, especially considering that we also had a final paper. However, I hesitate to put this as a weakness as I do feel like studying for the final exam helped me solidify my understanding of Southern literature and culture.",
                "This course was amazing. Lectures were very interesting, and I loved the assigned readings. I would have appreciated knowing about the two projects at the start of the semester, rather than having them announced right before Thanksgiving break.",
                "The only good thing about this class was the selected readings. Lectures were badthe language used seems more fitting to be read than to be listened to; I would have loved if the transcript the professor read off of would have been posted. The slides were horriblethey only consisted of a few sentences from the reading; I would have appreciated some slides presenting and analysis of the passages. Lectures just werent very engaging.",
                "I absolutely loved the class and the material. The one weakness is that there was a lot of material it was a bit overwhelming.",
                "The course materials are stellar, and the lectures were extremely enlightening. I do wish there was more group work or in class participation so that the material was more accessible, but discussion sections mostly make that up.",
                "I really loved all of the readings, and I loved lecture. I do think this course could offer more opportunities for class discussion during lecture, especially as many of us are from the South and have direct experiences with the topics discussed. I also wish there was a bit more support for non English students, as I found the essays difficult as someone with little English background as a STEM major.",
                "The course has a great lecture setup, and Caleb Smith is a fantastic lecturer. Hes incredibly knowledgeable and very engaging!",
                "Strengths: interesting lectures, assignments and exams were engaging (and sometimes fun!), TF was flexible and kind.\r\nWeaknesses: reading load was pretty high.",
                "The readings are incredible, but there are so many that they cant all be focused on. Perhaps dive deeper into a few select shorter pieces along with the books.",
                "I think the amount of reading could have been evened out more from week to week.",

                "Definitely! I had a previous interest in this material and learned a ton, but I'd recommend for anyone with or without that. It was a great way to learn about an important aspect of America's history while reckoning with it not through a textbook but the literature of the time. Professor Smith didn't shy away from issues and in fact made them a central part of the course.",
                "yes, it is a great way to practice and develop your close reading skills and improve your ability to critically read and write. Plus, you get exposed to a lot of really awesome pieces of Southern literature, and Prof. Smith's lectures give you great insights and frameworks to help you interpret them! However, I wouldn't say this is an easy class, and I think you need to work hard (i.e. actually do the readings, think carefully about them, and participate in discussion section) if you expect to do well in this class and reap the rewards of taking it.",
                "No, do not take this class. Lectures arent very insightful as half the time is spent by Professor Smith reading a few sentences from the first few pages of the readings. The other half consists of some form of analysis of the passage that could potentially be interesting if they werent given in hard-to-aurally-digest flowery language. The course felt very lazily put together by the professor and I wish I hadnt taken it since I felt I learned nothing.",
                "Yes. Amazing class to learn about American history and the antebellum south.",
                "There was a lot of reading in this course, but I found myself realizing all of that reading was valuable. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested!",
                "I loved this class. It is super interesting and made me think about the South in a lot of new ways. Being from the South at Yale is isolating in many ways, so this class was a great way to engage in ideas about the South in a meaningful and thoughtful way. However, I am not an English major so I did find this class quite challenging, and I found the readings and essays to be a heavy workload.",
                "I would. I think its an interesting course to take as a senior, since the writing is very basic, but I learned a ton from the lectures and had so much fun.",
                "Yes!! These topics can be difficult to understand and discuss, but this class did a great job navigating those challenges. I enjoyed every lecture and section. Professor Smith was very knowledgeable, too.",
                "Yes. I thought that it was an incredible course that gave rare insight into the south- a topic that isnt frequently discussed at Yale. I will be recommending it to plenty of people.",
                "I gained so much from this course! I speak about it often with friends and family. I would recommend to any student who wants to gain a greater understanding of the American South.",
