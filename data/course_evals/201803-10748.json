    "Understanding of more formal Chinese language, writing and discussion topics.",
    "I built on my existing Chinese and improved my ability to express things formally.",
    "Learning Chinese vocab quickly, how to speak in Chinese about topics beyond just daily life topics (eg the American Dream, Chinese idioms, patriarchy, the one child rule, etc)",
    "I developed expanded knowledge of difficult topics in Chinese, particularly progressing my proficiency in writing and listening.",
    "I improved my Chinese speaking and writing skills. This course helped me increase my vocabulary and grammar knowledge, so I can discuss more complex topics in Chinese.",
    "Chinese Level 5 does a great job of teaching us the advanced topics of Chinese. While these may not be the structures and topics that come up in daily conversation, they are nonetheless very important and they will contribute to the overall improvement of your Chinese language level. We learn about complex topics such as career-family balance, love after loss, forgiveness, etc. It gets really deep and I think you'll be astonished at how much you'll be able to discuss after this course.",
    "I got some more experience speaking Chinese, but got mostly experience with grammar structures and expanded my vocabulary to be more formal."

   "comments": [
    "This is an amazing course, I love Chinese at Yale, and my only negative comment is that Im sad it doesnt meet 5x a week because I think its really hard to learn a language like Chinese only 3x a week and expect to see significant improvement.",
    "This course was a bit messy this semester because they just made the switch from 5 days a week to three days a week. The text needs to be redesigned for the new format. Wang Laoshi was great at teaching, but I often felt bad for her because of all of the logistical issues she and the other teachers faced (technological problems on top of the issues relating to the switch -- the monitor in our classroom was broken like every Monday). She made a valiant effort though, despite all the chaos surrounding her. If possible, it'd be better to have more speaking opportunities, like a longer tutorial session or something -- I don't know that my spoken Chinese really improved this semester (but I came directly from an immersion environment, so my standards for progress were high).",
    "Strengths: My professor was amazing, accommodating, kind, yet effective, the workload was tough but never too much to handle, the weekly TA sessions provide a great way of refining the in class material. \r\n\r\nWeakness: quite fast paced as this was the first year with L5 CHNS meeting three times a week rather than five.",
    "The strength of this class is the small learning environment that allows the teacher and the students to really engage in chinese in a way that develops skill in the language. The weakness is the pace at which the class moves. Although moving very fast was beneficial to the total amount of chinese learned it sometimes left me wishing for a better grasp at certain sections.",
    "This course was great. It was challenging, but not too stressful. I do not think this course needs improvement.",
    "The Chinese department at Yale has always been top notch for the three years I've been involved in it thus far. This course was no exception. It was well organized, efficient, and very fun to be part of. I supposed I might like a little bit more personalized feedback on what mistakes I made while writing or speaking for longer assignments. Otherwise, everything was spot on.",
    "Even with less than 10 people in the class, we didn't get that many chances to actually speak Chinese. We had a WeChat system this semester, but it seemed like several people were too embarrassed to speak. Even if I heard someone speak incorrectly, I didn't correct them because it would be awkward.",
    "Although I understand the purpose of the WeChat assignments, nobody listened to each other's responses."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, so highly recommend. Take Chinese at Yale, you cannot go wrong.",
    "Yes. The Yale Chinese faculty are still great, despite the issues surrounding the 5-day to 3-day switch.",
    "Yes! The teachers are amazing and the course content is engaging. There are also a lot of different mediums the professors use to teach us (eg electronic listening dialogues to essays to fill in the blank grammar exercises) so you are always excited.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class. Very helpful in chinese.",
    "Yes!",
    "Absolutely. If you are serious about learning Chinese, completing L5 is a must for any semblance of real fluency.",
    "Yeah, if you're interested in learning Chinese, there's really no other choice.",
    "Only if you are ready for the high paced structure of this class."
