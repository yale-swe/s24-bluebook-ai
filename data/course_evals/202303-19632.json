                "I developed critical Korean language skills from this course. In particular, I learned a great deal about Hanja and contemporary life in Korea. Through speaking Korean in every class, it helped hone my Korean speaking skills as well -- with both peers and the instructor.",
                "I learned so much hanja. Hanja is such a building block for the Korean language that is often overlooked. However, through the extensive classes on hanja, I was able to bring my understanding of Korean to the next level.",
                "I learned Hanja, which are traditional chinese characters that korean is based off of.",
                "Korean culture and society in a lot of comparison to American culture and society. Hanja and vocabulary related to it."

            "comments": [
                "The course does a great job of expanding your vocabulary. We learned about 10 new advanced words per day of class, but they were grouped with a specific hanja, making it much easier to memorize them in bulk with the chance to practice with group quizzes and with the TA. The class would likely have been better if it were smaller, so try to take the less popular section if you can.",
                "I think the strength of this course was definitely the professor. The professor was always so caring and understanding. It made learning Korean not-stressful and he helped create an environment that was very risk-conducive. The course materials and structure was great as well, with a mix of quizzes, homework, and presentations; it was very learning-based. I don't have any weaknesses to note.",
                "The course was very interactive where we always had time to practice speaking if we chose to take it. Additionally, the class is very family style you create this sense of closeness with your classmates throughout the semester which makes coming to class first thing in the morning something to really look forward to. A weakness is probably the lack of grading. We did not receive grades for anything throughout the semester so often we felt like we were floating in the abyss when trying to figure out technical ways to improve our Korean.",
                "In the course you learn a lot in an engaging and open environment. Strengths include the quality of the environment we were in. There were no weaknesses.",
                "This was the first time this course was offered so it was very experimental but I still enjoyed it. I liked learning new vocabulary and seeing how it related to the Hanja characters we were learning. I wish we had had more chances to talk with each other as classmates because I felt my speaking abilities severely declined during this course (I don't have any chance to speak in Korean outside of class and TA sessions) and I also never got to know the classmates that I wasn't already friends with at the beginning of the course."

                "Without a doubt, I would recommend it. This class is helpful for any higher level language students, or even \"fluent\" speakers as the vocabulary we learned was very advanced and we were immersed in current Korean culture and trends. Any class with Professor Lim is a joy, and this is no exception, it was a always a great start to the day.",
                "I would! It was a fun class, where I got to practice my Korean and learn more under a kind professor and supportive peers.",
                "Yes! Professor Lim is one of the nicest, and most encouraging professors I've had at Yale. KREN 152 is also a very light course, that was really fun and engaging. If you take it , and put the energy into active learning each day, you'll be sure to take a lot from the class.",
                "Yes, the class is amazing.",
                "Absolutely! I love the Korean department here and have never taken a course I didn't love. If you're looking for an L5 Korean this is a great one."
