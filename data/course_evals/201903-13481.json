    "Felt more confident generating plots and strengthening my writing skills. Was also a great exercise in creativity.",
    "My fiction skills improved greatly!!",
    "I learned about writing round characters, balancing scenes and summary in fiction, how to make generous critiques of writing, about my own writing and how to let writing come out of you, develop from characters you have imagined and who exist in your head. A truly thrilling experience in moments.",
    "I'd always loved fiction, both reading and writing it, but this class taught me the various components of the fiction process. I'm definitely taking the next level next semester if I can!! Amity Gaige is wonderfulput everyone at ease, made us laugh, and super passionate about being a novelistand I hope to God that Yale hires her back. This was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "I learned the basics of fiction writing, thinking about narrative, character, different forms and genres of the short story, as well as techniques and methods of revising.",
    "How to become a better fiction writer, specifically the art of short story writing. Thinking about plot, characterisation, mood, diction, style, narration, etc. Learning how to become a better reader and better observe techniques used by writers you love. And in general, becoming more observant in your interactions with people and the world!"

   "comments": [
    "Maybe giving each writing prompt two weeks to be completed and making them 5 pages in length, instead of 2.5-3.",
    "This was one of the best writing classes Ive ever taken! Only wish it was twice a week.",
    "Strengths: workshop structure with some lectures mixed in was helpful for my own writing and for learning from\/with others, reading samples were awesome\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: maybe would have liked to know a little about history of fiction \/ where it has come from \/ is going \/ its role in the world",
    "I really appreciated that the course was taught like a workshop, and there was ample opportunity to give and receive feedback, as well as discuss the assigned readings. I wish there could be more time for revision, but I also wish that there could be a more substantial portfolio amassed at the end of the course, even if that meant doing a bit more work with workshopping.",
    "Professor Gaige is great and there's so much you can learn from her, both as a writer and as a human being. There's weekly readings of short stories that teach you something specific about characterisation, mood, style, etc. along with 2-3 page writing exercises on that specific technique. Towards the end of the semester, you write two complete short stories, one of 10-20 pages and the other 6-10, which are then workshopped in the class. I loved the format of having specific weekly readings that provided templates for the technique we were trying to learn that week, and the readings themselves were like pleasure reading! You will find yourself looking forward to putting your other homework aside and doing the weekly readings for this class. The structure is also a great way to teach yourself the discipline needed to write something every week, and by the time your complete short stories are due, you are amazed at your own ability to write and rewrite a full 10-20 page story in a week's time. You may not love all your weekly exercises, but they are super useful, and it's great to be able to read the other students' amazing work. \r\nThe only thing I craved more of was class discussion. Even though we would spend a little bit of time discussing each other's work and the weekly readings, there was none of the energetic discussion environment that a seminar has and it often felt like everyone was simply stating their own view on things without any discussion between people. However, this might be an unfair criticism given that this is not really a regular seminar."

    "Yes! Its creative writing is a wonderful thing to experiment with, even if you aren't interested in \"taking it seriously\"",
    "Absolutely",
    "Definitely. I learned a ton about how to write persuasive fiction, what makes good writing, and even what it is to be a person. If all characters in fiction should be round, with perhaps a few exceptions, does that mean all the people in our lives our round in some way?",
    "YES. I've heard nothing but great things about all of the Intro to Fiction professors, I adore Professor Gaige, and thanks to her class, I'm considering doing the writing concentration in fiction.",
    "Yes, if the student is interested at all in writing fiction.",
    "Yes! It's super fun if you like writing and reading, and teaches you valuable skills that are broadly applicable even if you aren't an English major or don't plan to be a professional writer. My class had several non-English majors, and just being able to read other people's amazing work and see their different styles is a great experience. But more importantly, this really does significantly improve your writing. It's a great opportunity to get one on one feedback on a weekly basis, do some fun readings, and finish the semester with two complete short stories."
