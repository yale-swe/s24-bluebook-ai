   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot of molecular orbital theory and organic synthesis reactions and developed the important skill of being able to predict organic reactions. I also learned how to read a syllabus.",
    "I learned to teach myself material from the textbook, integrate knowledge from multiple themes. I learned that organic chemistry is very difficult to understand",
    "organic chemistry\r\nsooo much organic chemistry",
    "I learned the basics of organic chemistry, including reaction mechanisms and the rationale behind them.",
    "Especially as I was studying for the 3rd midterm, I found myself in awe of how much we've learned. It was amazing that all of us were sitting there spewing terminology about out to synthesize a compound from another compound. Besides the obvious chemistry knowledge, you also learn how to think like a chemist, which requires a lot of creativity as well.",
    "Tons and tons and tons of organic chemistry shoves into your brain in a short period of time. From molecular orbital theory to 30+ reactions, you will constantly be learning new things.",
    "I learned to think very differently about chemistry. Instead of just memorizing concepts and equations, I started to understand their chemical backgrounds and learned to apply what I had previously learned to new problems.",
    "MO Theory, energy diagrams, Newton projections, arrow-pushing mechanisms, acid-base reactions, chair conformations, stereochemical relationships, organic synthesis",
    "The course doesn't only teach organic chemistry but how to think about organic chemistry. The course emphasizes learning reagents, stereochemistry, and regioselectivity as well as the molecular orbital theory explanations behind these topics.",
    "Gained a basic understanding of the forces which govern molecular interactions, a better understanding of how to apply those forces to achieve desired results on the molecular level, and practice in applying those twin understandings in novel situations under time pressure.",
    "I learned much about organic chemistry, especially in terms of trying to apply concepts to hypothetical mechanisms.",
    "I learned how to challenge myself and work incredibly hard in taking this course. I also learned how to approach a problem from many different ways and to expand my way of thinking.",
    "- collaboration: the TEAL classroom is very conductive to asking clarification questions and working with classmates during class, which easily carries over to study groups outside of the classroom especially given the \"no curve\" grading scheme used\r\n- how to get help effectively: there are regularly scheduled Study Halls with peer tutors (7-9 pm Sun, Tues, Thurs) and discussion sections both train sills in how to ask the most effective questions and make the most out of experienced chemistry students\r\n- lots of chemistry -- especially Molecular Orbital Theories \r\n- little memorization -- mechanisms based more on sensible arrow pushing mechanisms, no hardcore regurgitation of information",
    "First semester topics of organic chemistry. After talking to friends in other schools, I feel like we go more in depth than other schools.",
    "I learned both about the mechanisms and details of process in Organic Chemistry as well as many of its real-world connections and applications. I feel like I now have a solid foundation in the basic concepts of organic chemistry that I can build off of and reliably recall in the future.",
    "I learned a great deal about beginners level organic chemistry, including: molecular orbital theory; the mechanisms and results of reactions involving alkenes, alkynes, alkyl halides, alcohols, ethers, and epoxides; Sn2\/E2\/Sn1\/E1 reactions; oxidations and reductions; (retro)synthetic pathways and planning; and stereochemistry.",
    "By taking this course, I learned about the main principles of organic chemistry and I gained the skills to synthesize reactions, which required a particular sense of creativity I dont usually employ.",
    "Cooperation, independence and perseverance",
    "A wide range of some really intriguing organic chemistry topics! We learned about molecular orbital theory, stereochemistry, a ton of reactions and their mechanisms, and so much more. We also brought it back to both historical and current-day applications of organic chemistry in the real world, such as pharmacology and the Houdry Process. This class is also a great way to build academic skills that will carry you through the rest of college, such as self-directed learning, how to study and read textbooks effectively, etc.",
    "How to critically think about problems",
    "I developed a thorough understanding of the practice of organic synthesis, as well as detailed knowledge of powerful chemical transformations.",
    "The class covered topics in first term organic chemistry and dove particularly in depth on molecular orbitals. To name topics off the top of my head, we covered resonance, acidity and basicity, substitution, elimination, and addition reactions, arrow pushing mechanisms, and retrosyntheses. This class really pushes you to take initiative when it comes to learning the material.",
    "Creativity in science! Also learning chemistry from a completely different perspective.",
    "Solid knowledge of synthetic techniques",
    "I learned fundamental organic chem concepts.",
    "Problem solving skills and a new method of thinking with regards to chemistry. The most important I learned was that memorization is not going to get you very far in o-chem. You need to understand the content and then memorize. I also reinforced the idea that practice makes perfect.",
    "The ability to approach problems creatively and in a deductive manner through synthesis questions. A plethora of organic reactions that have a purpose in industry.",
    "How to do orgo reactions + a LOT about MO theory",
    "I think I gained skills in combining knowledge throughout the semester and connecting all the information back to some of the core principles chemistry is built upon",
    "A lot of organic chemistry knowledge.",
    "This course focused on the fundamentals of chemical reactions and eventually concluded with material about synthesis and making products from many different routes. This allowed students to take what they learned in the first half of the course and apply it to real reactions.",
    "I struggled in this class so it helped me figure out how to best study and cope with failure. In addition, it helped me develop a stronger work ethic.",
    "Besides learning organic chemistry, I got better at applying information that I learned to new problems. I also got better at working with other people in the team problems to figure out more complex problems.",
    "I have learned SO SO much in this course. Not only do I have an extremely solid background in organic chemistry now, but also I have developed some really valuable skills in synthesizing information to solve problems (retrosynthesis) and spacial awareness (stereochemistry). I've also discovered some crucial changes I need to make in the way I study and prepare for courses in college as opposed to high school. This course was very very difficult for me, but I truly feel like I've gotten so much out of it.",
    "I learned how to work efficiently and actively learn material (instead of just memorizing facts). This class required me to apply my knowledge of chemistry and often think outside the box.",
    "Critical thinking, new chemistry skills, creativity in relation to the sciences and specifically in coming up with mechanism, 3D visualization abilities",
    "I learned a lot about how organic reactions work and how to apply them to specific cases, which was more useful than just memorizing reactions. However, I feel like I have a 60% understanding of this.",
    "I was able to stretch my understanding in science, as we were exposed to many different situations in organic chemistry using the Team problems throughout the class. Ive definitely became better in analysis.",
    "problem solving and asking good questions",
    "I learned a great deal of organic chemistry, probably above and beyond what I \"needed\" to learn in a first-semester course on this topic. More significantly, the focus on stereochemistry, mechanisms, and synthesis forced me to think in ways I hadn't before. I specifically improved my spatial visualization and step-by-step problem-solving skills.",
    "This course gives students an in-depth understanding of a wide range of organic chemistry concepts.",
    "CHEM 174 introduced me to the world of theoretical organic chemistry. From this class, I've learned the foundations of organic chemistry such as the mechanisms behinds commonly used reactions as well as designing molecules from starting carbon molecules.",
    "I learned more about the fundamental theories and basis upon which organic chemistry reactions take place, as well as some basic reaction patterns (maybe too little MO than I should have though...)",
    "This course fortified not only my chemistry knowledge but also my abilities to systematically problem-solve and approach the same problem from multiple equally effective angles.",
    "How to think about organic chemistry",
    "I learned how to teach myself content that I did not understand from the lectures.",
    "I gained some very good isights into organic chemistry. Additionally, I developed problem solving skills through the retro synthesis questions.",
    "I learned what organic chemistry was really about because I had different expectations for what the course would be like, but I realized that there is so much more about chemistry than I had realized. Since this class is focused largely on the concepts and reasonings behind the reactions, I learned that probably the most effective to learn was to really have a solid understanding of the basic concepts first in order to better solve and understand the more complex and larger concepts later on. Memorizing for this class will only take you part of the way there.",
    "I developed many skills pertaining to organic chemistry and specifically organic synthesis. This class also helped me develop better study habits and critical thinking skills.",
    "I learned how to manage my time better. The \"flipped classroom\" was a new experience for me. I had to set aside time every day so that I could read the textbook. This course also made me better at working in a team. My classmates were very cooperative.",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of organic chemistry, especially about various mechanisms, resonance structures, retrosynthetic analysis, and the underlying theory, MO theory, that drives the reactions we learned. Outside of chemistry content, I learned to really collaborate with other students and seek help from the many resources we had (study hall, discussion, section, and office hours), and to dive deeper than memorization to really understand the material we learned.",
    "first semester organic chem skills. i learned how to get my stuff together and study for a class like my life depended on it.",
    "As expected, I gained knowledge of the foundations of organic chemistry. \r\nBut, I also developed an excitement for active discovery and collaboration with Tim's encouragement.\r\nAlthough the \"flipped\" classroom was sometimes discouraging on days that I hadn't quite finished the reading\/got behind for whatever reason, I always felt welcome and inspired by my awesome classmates and the helpful TAs. So even if I felt out of place at times, I have learned to focus and give my best effort and to not be afraid to ask questions (even if I think they are stupid) because people want to help more than you might think.",
    "Organic chemistry and especially MO theory. 3D visualization.",
    "First semester orgo basics. Plus some stuff that you don't usually learn: namely MO\/FMO theory, which is probably the most useful thing I got out of this course.",
    "I definitely gained lots of responsibility regarding learning due to the flipped class nature of the course.  It was fairly fast paced, and overall I feel like I learned a fair overview for the foundational concepts and theories behind organic chemistry, and also learned a fair amount of reactions.",
    "I developed several skills in taking this course. This course was challenging in a way that allowed me to develop my critical thinking and problem solving skills. Not only did I learn about organic chemistry, I learned how to solve problems through different methods and look at the questions from a different angle. It was less of a procedural thinking class and relied more on being able to visualize the end result and the process needed to get there. It also improved my thinking of different molecules in the sense that after the course I am more able to visualize 3-dimensional models of molecules and how that would affect structure, configuration and stereo-chemical properties. I developed a basic knowledge on the synthesis of molecules, FMO and MO theory, several reactions such as epoxide formation, Newman projections and the interactions between molecules in a reaction and in the molecules themselves.",
    "orgo",
    "We dove deep into the theoretical foundations of organic chemistry",
    "I gained a fundamental understanding of many chemistry concepts (such as MO theory and learning how to approach synthesis questions) that will be useful throughout my academic career.",
    "There was a lot of creative thinking development in this course.",
    "I really feel like I learned so much in this class. I had no experience with organic chemistry, but I learned about reaction mechanisms, chemical synthesis, stereochemistry, and even some current events in chemistry.",
    "Thorough understanding of the reactivity and mechanisms of organic chemistry.",
    "various organic reactions, how to come up with a pathway to synthesize a certain product when given the starting material",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about the basis of chemistry, including Molecular orbital theory and retrosynthesis. I learned how to problem solve and synthesize information well.",
    "I gained a general understanding of the principles of organic chemistry. The best part of this class was that it was focused on understanding the underlying principles rather than memorizing reactions or properties of certain molecules. That made the end of the class when there were too many reactions to memorize doable. I also learned how to work harder than I ever have before; this class is incredibly overwhelming and seems to take over your life for a few months, but it definitely was rewarding in the end. I also confirmed my desire to research further in biochemistry and medicine.",
    "Very good basis of organic chemistry. Thinking ahead and designing stepwise pathways for synthesis reactions has helped me in other areas of my life where I would never expect it.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of the basics of organic chemistry such as molecular orbitals, common reactions and mechanisms, and retrosynthetic analysis.",
    "I learned how to think on the spot and envision a process rather than just one answer. This class is very collaborative and gave me insight to my own study habits and how I can utilize group work to best help my own learning."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class was taught in the TEAL classroom, which was so helpful especially as a first-year. It never felt like a big lecture even though it had about 100 students, and I got to know my classmates a lot better by working in groups with them. In this way, I got to learn not only from the professor and the Gas but also from my peers, which I think is a great experience. Another strength of this class is that it is not curved, so I never felt like I was in competition with my classmates. Also, the grading of the homework assignments was very beneficial to the collaborative process. One huge plus, then, was the educational philosophy of the professor. I think I learned a lot more because of his style.\r\n\r\nA weakness is that there were not enough TAs or other assistants for the class. Many of the study halls were packed full and it was hard to get questions answered because the TAs were always busy just due to the sheer number of dedicated students coming in after hours.",
    "The flipped classroom is a weakness. Its very difficult to teach yourself organic chemistry from reading the textbook. We go over problems in class but thats not very helpful if i dont understand the theory behind reactions.",
    "The course does provide a lot of opportunities for you to get more personal time learning the material which is unusual for a large lecture course. Between the discussion section, study hall, and office hours, you can always get the information you need. However, the structure of the course being a flipped classroom is not ideal. It forces a lot of concept learning on the student outside of class and if you don't understand it when you get to lecture, you'll be lost the entire class period.",
    "This course is definitely a challenge and it harbors collaboration over competition, but the flipped classroom does not facilitate learning.",
    "The only weakness was that I wish the notes and slides were a little bit more structured --simply more headings on files to help me understand what the concept was about when reviewing them.\r\n\r\nStrengths - Tim as a teacher",
    "Strengths: You learn so much organic chemistry it's actually outstanding. The group tables of 10 students really help with collaborating in class and forming study groups out of class. \r\nWeakness: While study hall can sometimes be useful (and the TAs and peer tutors were so awesome), it was often too hectic and I usually left more stressed\/confused then when I came. The sapling pre-class also didn't help and were nothing like things on the assessments. Topics were briefly mentioned for less than a minute in class and then ended up being a fundamental concept of the unit so it made things pretty confusing. Expect to do 90% of the learning yourself outside of class, like watching Khan Academy videos or Youtube videos. Also, the answer keys to practice tests were never put up to facilitate collaboration (which I get at first), but it would be nice to have the correct answers at least the night before the test.",
    "While I liked the flipped classroom, I think it still would have been helpful for the lectures to be more clearly structured around what we needed to know. All of the practice questions were helpful, but it was hard to discern what was important to know and what was just peripheral. Also, all of the office hours, peer tutoring, and sections were super helpful.",
    "Strengths: collaborative atmosphere, out of class resources, emphasis on understanding over memorization, grading system\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes irrelevant homework that doesn't relate to the tested material",
    "This class flirts with the flipped classroom framework but ultimately rejects it in favor of a more collaborative discussion based approach. This usually works fine, until a concept from the reading previously unmentioned in class crops up, at which point those unable to learn from the textbook find themselves adrift until the lecture inevitably teaches the content. This element could be removed by focusing less on the flipped classroom framework and instead prioritizing learning through teamwork at all times. Additionally, time pressure on exams has no equivalent elsewhere in the class.",
    "I loved the TEAL classroom and the collaborative environment felt in the class.",
    "Overall I enjoyed the class and I think it was very well taught; however, I don't enjoy the flipped classroom, as I believe I benefit most when I learn the lesson and then do homework to solidify what I have learned.",
    "I really liked the interactive style of the course. I also really liked how easy it was to find resources for this class. For example, I went to the peer tutoring study hall which really helped to clarify some of the concepts we learned in class and to do some practice problems. I wish there was more transparency about the grades - like what an A is.",
    "Strength:\r\n- instructor, TAs, peer tutors working closely together to ensure tight-knit support system, fostering collaborative atmosphere\r\n- engaging content, setting up for success in second semester organic chemistry\r\n- similar minded students -- share a lot of classes together, really get to know them not just in first year but moving forward\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n- some competition and toxicity may be felt in the class, especially as finals approached, because everyone who is in first year organic chemistry chose to be there and had at least some confidence (and thus expectation) in their chemistry knowledge\r\n- the course has three midterms and it sometimes could feel like either not a clear distinction can be drawn between the content, or they are superficially drawn, or they are wildly different that they do not even all show up on the final",
    "I did not like the flipped classroom format, and I felt like it decreased my engagement with the course. I also didn't really like that the homework was on sapling, but it was nice to receive the instant feedback while doing the homework.\r\n\r\nTim's a great instructor, and there is a lot of outside help available like the study halls. I always had conflicts during office hours, but I wish I could have to those.\r\n\r\nI also wish we were given more print resources that were relevant. For example, the textbook only lightly brushed on topics like MO theory, but we used it on every exam.",
    "I like that this course really de-emphasized competition in favor of collaboration and teamwork, and that it focused on conceptual understanding rather than memorization. One thing that I found a little challenging or frustrating was the varying levels of partial credit assigned to test questions - the course really emphasized conceptual understanding but I felt like that was not always reflected in the feedback given on wrong questions. It made me wish that we had spent more time reviewing or more emphasis had been given to specific details in class to prepare for the level of recall expected on tests.",
    "First of all, the material is so engaging on its own for anyone even slightly interested in chemistry that I'd have to count that as a strength in itself. Beyond that, the many, many resources at students' disposal - the TFs, the peer tutors, the Sapling questions, the study halls - mean that even if you don't understand a concept at first (and there will likely be at least a few such concepts), you will have ample opportunity to learn it over time. The generous grading scheme also made me less stressed and made for a less competitive environment, as did the classroom structure (divided into tables).\r\n\r\nPersonally, I didn't like that the tests were only 50 minutes; I would've preferred longer tests, so that time is less of a factor and so that if there's one concept you don't understand you won't be penalized so much. Additionally, the lectures in class didn't always match up to the readings, which sometimes left me confused.",
    "I disliked the flipped classroom structure because I perform better in a lecture format. I struggled with the text, so classroom discussions didnt help as much as a lecture would because they went over the material rather than introducing it.",
    "Strength: student involvement and the emphasis on effort over results. Very fun class. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I would have very much preferred a lecture that went over what we read before the class instead of lecturing what we WILL be reading. I felt lost and thrown in the deep end at times.",
    "Strengths -- by far the strongest aspect of the course was the people! Tim, the TAs, and the peer tutors were beyond amazing and always available for support. They truly went above and beyond to offer incredibly valuable study halls, office hours, and more many times a week and made the in-class environment engaging and enjoyable for everybody.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- none that I can think of!",
    "More clarity about the grading scale in the class would be much appreciated. Instruction was incredible.",
    "This could be seen as a strength or weakness, but the class is an active learning environment, which essentially means that your learning is largely self-motivated. Going to class should be supplemental. A huge strength of the class is Tim, the TFs, and the peer tutors. Help is always available. A weakness of the course is that it is only an hour long, three times a week. I think I would prefer it to be twice a week for longer.",
    "Flipped classroom somewhat reduces teacher's involvement, but in turn it increases engagement with classmates!",
    "Would love more practice tests posted before exams",
    "The course is hard. Tim does a good job, but its just one of those courses you have to get through.",
    "Strengths:\r\nAmazing professor and TAs. \r\nVery well organized \r\nRelevant course work \r\nChallenging \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nClassroom (TEAL) \r\nNot able to see grades",
    "A key weakness was that it was at times difficult to review\/catch up on previous material due to the fast pace of the class.",
    "It should not be a flipped classroom style (in my opinion a very bad idea), it was hard to know what was important and what wasn't.",
    "I think it could be intimidating to be in lecture when there are so many students. But I liked how we had table groups that changed so we could get to know our peers more",
    "I felt that the flipped classroom setup hindered my learning. I wish that the professor spent more time teaching the material to us as opposed to having us do problems. I didn't always have time to learn the material on my own before class, so I was often quite lost during class. In addition, I did not find that the textbook was very helpful, as it included a lot of unnecessary information. One of the biggest strengths of the course was that there were so many opportunities to get help.",
    "This was a very fast-paced course that was more focused toward discussion of different solutions. Some strengths of the course were that it allowed students to learn large amounts of information by building off a general understanding of chemistry and the material was always engaging. The \"flipped\" style of teaching was useful in learning how to do problems but it could sometimes lead to gaps in the understanding of lecture material.",
    "I think it made it a little hard in the beginning with the flipped classroom but eventually I figure it out. The available help was a strong strength of the class.",
    "I think the flipped classroom was effective for some of the material, but other times I felt that there was a disconnect between the information presented in lecture, the textbook, and section.",
    "The strengths of this course are the study halls, office hours, and the class in Hillhouse 17. These resources help struggling students better understand the course material. The biggest weakness of this course (and arguably also a strength) is how much material is covered. I found the first exam relatively easy, but I was hit by a truck with the second and third sections of material. I think the only way to improve this is to make it explicitly clear how much time and effort needs to be devoted to keeping up with the class at the beginning of the year.",
    "The flipped classroom style put a lot of responsibility on students to do the work and foundational understanding themselves BEFORE class, which could be good or bad, depending on the student. I think some stress may be relieved if there was a review of basic material at the beginning of each lecture (which was done in the second semester, after this was expressed to the professor through the mid-term evaluation). But overall, I think the class was wonderfully structured to reward those who put in the necessary time and effort.\r\n\r\nThe professor, TAs, and peer tutors were BY FAR the best things about the course. They really wanted us to succeed, and went above and beyond to make us feel supported and encouraged to do our very best.",
    "Very well taught. Engaging. There were a few lectures (I remember the one where SN1\/SN2\/E1\/E2 were introduced to us) were set up so that they were introduced in class before we did the reading on them. I think it would be better if we were assigned the reading\/pre-class for those topics before we show up to class and would make the learning we do in lecture more productive.",
    "The teacher is very engaging and the TA's are very helpful. However, I am not sold on the active learning style as applied here--the table groups were too big and made it difficult to talk and work out problems. Additionally, I always felt frustrated after lecture because I felt like I would leave not understanding anything--It was only after going over it a few more times on my own did stuff finally make sense. Additionally, while I think organic chemistry is going to be a difficult class no matter what just because of the conceptual jumps, I felt like this class could be more neatly organized and have more material\/lecture\/handouts that condensed what exactly we were expected to know at any given point (the added learning goals felt too vague). A strength is the sapling--I actually really liked the homework.",
    "Strengths:\r\n1) Interactive group work\r\n2) The professor is passionate about the subject, which motivates the students to do better.\r\n3) You can always get help inside and outside the class.\r\nWeakness: I dont really like not having the answers for practice exams online. A lot of times, Im not able to attend study hall due to other personal reasons.",
    "the TAs are really good, and I love the pre-class homework",
    "This course made material that has a reputation for being obfuscatory make a lot of sense, and for that I applaud the professor and TAs. However, it often felt disconnected from the real worldneither fundamental and revelatory nor applied and immediatelike we were studying how to fashion random molecules for no real reason in a sandbox of starting materials. Of course there were some powerful references to the pressing problems that organic chemistry could solve, like the question of how to reduce greenhouse gases into alkanes. Overall, though, I think this is an aspect of the class that could be strengthened.",
    "This course was taught in a \"flipped classroom\" style, but I believe this format leaves much to be desired. If I had a less than full understudying of the material for a given day when I came into class, I would not gain much from the lecture.",
    "The course is designed to be in a flipped classroom where students are expected to do the reading beforehand and practice problems are to be done in class. This method is extremely helpful for classes such as organic chemistry where problem solving is essential. However, certain difficult concepts could be discussed a bit more in class.",
    "The Active Learning component of the course was certainly the highlight for me and made it memorable compared with my other classes. Furthermore, there was always help available to students looking to get more out of the course.",
    "It was very work intensive",
    "The course had several weaknesses.  The main weakness was the fact that the lectures were set up as a flipped classroom.  For a subject as challenging as organic chemistry, this was not an effective way to help students understand the content that they were expected to know for the exams.  Additionally, any outside help\/review sessions were poorly organized and mainly catered to students who understood the material on a deeper level, rather than the students that were actually struggling.",
    "Overall, I really enjoyed this course. I think that there could have been greater overlap between lectures, class readings, problem sets, and that the practice tests could have resembled the actual exams more.",
    "I personally did not like that this class was a flipped class because I prefer learning from a professor through lectures rather than learning by myself first from the textbook and then coming together as a class to go over the concepts we read about. Also, there were times when I felt I could not ask many questions during class and there were a few things on the tests that we had never covered in class. However, I did like that they offered many study halls and review sessions to help the students, but I just couldn't make it to them due to schedule conflicts. I think the professor could take the pace a little slower or offer lots of practice problems for students to do at home.",
    "The flipped classroom aspect of the class was great.",
    "The course was intellectually challenging. Instead of having students memorize facts, Dr. Newhouse taught us how to think critically and understand how different processes worked. One weakness was that it was very easy for students to fall behind if they did not do the readings; this is one problem with the \"flipped classroom\" format.",
    "I thought the flipped classroom style was a major strength of the class as it really pushed students to work together and discuss idea with each other, and also made it easier to make friends and form study groups. All the TAs and peer tutors were super helpful and knowledgable, and Tim made a lot of effort in providing support for all students, as well as making sure that there was no sense of competition. The only weakness is that the flipped classroom style requires students to invest a lot of time outside of class to learn the material on their own and the fast-paced nature of the course made it a little challenging to adapt to at first, but these qualities are also what made the course engaging.",
    "the preclass homeworks were kind of annoying because it was 3x a week, but they were helpful for information review and gave extra points. the strengths are definitely the teaching staff. tim, yannan, gavin, will, jocelyn, ngozi, and drew were some of the best people ever.",
    "I think that the course was very well organized for learning. There definitely wasn't any pressure to compete with other students for a curve, and I found this class to be the most collaborative (by far!) of any course I took this semester. The only thing I would have liked more was if answers for practice tests were eventually posted on Canvas. I understand that you want students to try the test on their own and then come to study hall, but there are simply too few TAs to check dozens of tests while answering questions from other students.",
    "Strengths- lots of review sessions, wonderful TAs, varying office hours to accommodate different student schedules, amazing peer tutors, non-competitive class environment\r\nWeaknesses- occasional differences between the online homework and the textbook\/class notes, but they were generally easily resolved and did not cause any issues with grading (just a few alternate conventions). A couple times there were some minor differences among the explanations provided by TAs\/peer tutors for homework\/test questions, but again, they were most likely just different ways of saying the same thing. And sometimes there isn't a clear-cut answer, so I learned to work on applying overarching concepts\/principles to any problem. I am struggling to think of many weaknesses because any struggles that I had were generally due to inconsistent studying on my part and I always had support and extra practice available from many resources if needed.",
    "I don't like the flipped classroom style. But I liked the grading scheme.",
    "Strengths: emphasis on theory over memorization. Weaknesses: sometimes there's a lot of busy work. I don't think most students got a lot out of the overwhelming number of pre-classes\/p-sets. And some test problems did emphasize memorization over theory.",
    "A strength is definitely the amount of resources students have: Office hours, (optional) section, and study halls the night before every class that were led by either TFs or dedicated peer tutors. However, because the classroom was flipped, there would always seem to be people that knew the material much better than others, even though it should all be new to us. This led to (at least, personally) slight intimidation, and discouraged me from asking questions.",
    "Some strengths to this course include the style of teaching and the resources available to the students. The instructor for this course made the material interesting through some demonstrations and historical examples that related the material to real-world applications. In addition, the discussion sections, study halls, and review sessions allowed students to find the help that they needed in order to succeed in the course. The way we were put in groups facilitated the formation of study groups and allowed us to get together with people we knew in order to better study and prepare. However, one of the weaknesses of the course was also the style of the lectures. The ability for people to ask questions when needed was good; however, it was clear that some of the questions clearly extended beyond the material we were learning and distracted from the overall learning experience. I cannot see a way to improve this part of the course because I feel this had to do more with people taking the class, but students may ask the question to the TA's around the room first and then if that answer is not satisfactory\/it is a good question that can apply to the whole class then it can be asked out loud.",
    "strengths: passionate peers and professor\r\n\r\nweakness: FLIPPED CLASSROOM, passionate peers",
    "The course was wonderful, a great introduction to organic chemistry, strengths include a great professor, dedicated TF's, and interesting subject matter, while all of the course weaknesses stem from the difficult nature of the material itself.",
    "Strengths definitely included TA staff and constant engagement. Need more personalized help tho.",
    "Strengths: So much help available! There's study hall with peer tutors and a TA every other day, the TA's during discussion section are a great resource. They were a big help when doing the preclass homework and psets. Also Professor Tim during his office hours, probably what helped me the most throughout the semester. He always took the time to answer my questions, which were always a lot. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There's definitely a feeling of competition in the class but I think this is a result of the kind of students that take it. This wasn't a problem for me personally but a lot of people had class during office hours so they couldn't ever go. Other than that, I think the class is very well organized and we learn things in a very logical sequence.",
    "I think the greatest strength of the class is its emphasis on how basic electronic structure lends itself to reactivity with MO theory, induction, resonance, etc. \r\nIn regards to weaknesses, the structure of the course makes it so most of the material is learned independently by the student from the textbook, and then reviewed in the next class. This makes it so the Sapling homework might have very specific, difficult questions (which is why students will read the textbook pages 6 times over and still get the question wrong after 28 attempts) but the class is drawing arrow pushing and a few notes. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I feel that the exams should not be limited to the fifty minutes of a class slot. Open response type tests have a much greater variation in the time required to answer between students than a multiple choice test. I feel that with a science like chemistry which requires such broad knowledge, a student's actual depth of understanding is demonstrated by their ability to find the right answer eventually than to recall it immediately as if it were studied by rote. I'd suggest scheduling the midterms for a date other than classtime and allowing two hours (reducing the number of midterms if needed).",
    "Strength: High amount of feedback and support from instructor, TFs, tutors, etc; very interactive class format\r\nWeakness: Very fast-paced class to the extent that many things were talked about for very short periods of time in one class, not mentioned again, and asked about on exams. If you don't have a lot of time to spend on this class, the time you do have will end up being largely spent on Sapling problems that often have little relation to the actual class content, so plan accordingly.",
    "strengths: Sapling homework problems solidified grasp of concepts taught in the textbook, professor was very engaging\r\nweaknesses: lecture was sometimes unrelated to previous day's textbook reading and Sapling homework, textbook readings were often quite long and class was a bit fast-paced",
    "I think the topic being taught is inherently difficult for me; however, the course did a great job of giving ample resources to help me understand the material. The course could have done a better job in choosing  a textbook that better explains the various theories (MO theory, steric hindrance, inductive effect), and explains how these theories predict what happens during a reaction. The sapling learning homework should also be tailored to better represent the in-class group problems and test problems.",
    "The course was well structured in its distribution between tests and homework. The psets were helpful and the class notes were helpful for preparing for tests. One thing that can be improved is that the preclass assignments can have more relevance to what is addressed in class lectures.",
    "The course had a ton of resources in practice problems during class, section, office hours, study halls, review sessions, and very readily available and helpful teaching fellows and peer tutors. It was obvious that everyone working to teach the class was incredibly passionate about organic chemistry. I think the organization of the class as a \"flipped classroom\" was a weakness since it was difficult to understand the concepts from a confusing textbook and then be surrounded by students who have varied experiences with organic chemistry solving problems. This added unnecessary pressure on students with less prior knowledge. I think the class would benefit from the same amount of resources and outside practice but a more traditional lecture style during class. It felt kind of like a stressful high school class but with the hardest college material possible. This made coming to class more of an anxiety-producing experience than a time I could focus on learning the material.",
    "The strength is that the instructor is very engaged with his students and clearly takes student input into account; he is very flexible and adjusts dates and policies based on how effective he notices they are.",
    "Strengths: Tim is a very good lecturer\r\nWeaknesses: The students are constantly stressed out about their grades like they're still in high school. Some students seem to act overconfident to compensate for this. This makes it difficult to learn in a flipped classroom where most learning is coming from other students, who might act confident in their knowledge but end up giving inaccurate information.",
    "Strengths: This course effectively and extensively covered many aspects of organic chemistry, especially compared to other college courses at the same level. An attempt was clearly made to facilitate individual student learning. Professor Tim Newhouse is a bright presence in the classroom, and made classes legitimately enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was extremely unclear to me and other students as to how to receive help for specific questions. An expectation to come to almost all office hours and tutorial sessions wasn't made clear to non-STEM-oriented students until midway through the semester. Many test questions felt like \"gotcha\" questions and made each midterm an almost painful experience as I struggled to remember a specific reagent that we had talked about one time or missed a crucial part of an intentionally misleading question on a simple reaction. Often, I felt unable to convey what I had learned within the parameters of the test.",
    "Require discussion section",
    "One strength of the course was the multiple resources offered consistently throughout the semester (TA's, discussion section, office hours, study hall, practice exams)."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to first-years who have the chance to take it. It is not an \"easy\" class; you have to put the work into it. But Professor Newhouse is so enthusiastic that you just kind of get swept up in it having fun. From what I've heard, it also covers more material (i.e. the exams ask about more reactions, etc.) but is easier than the regular (sophomore) organic chemistry. In sum, THIS IS A GREAT COURSE to start off on. And you get to learn fun facts about everyday chemistry and about modern research in addition to the base knowledge of organic chemistry, so it never gets old. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "I would not recommend this class unless a student has prior experience with organic chemistry. The teaching style is not conducive to learning. To be fair, there is a lot of support in the form of study halls with TAs.",
    "It does a good job of teaching the material, just make sure you have enough time to dedicate to the course",
    "Yes, it is a great course and Tim is a fantastic professor.",
    "Yes, I loved this class and it taught me not only organic chemistry, which is cool in itself, but it also taught me how to be a better thinker.",
    "If you can place into freshman orgo, definitely do it because it is a much better alternative to gen chem and gen chem lab. While I personally didn't like how this course was taught, I made some great friends in the class, learned a lot of organic chemistry, and would rather have this then normal organic chemistry in sophomore year where there's even less support. It's nice being in a class with all first-years. Be ready to have to put in so much work outside of class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It sounds better than either of the other freshman chemistry classes and the content is super interesting, framing chemistry in a whole different light and connecting it to real-world applications.",
    "If you can, you should take Orgo as a first-year. Only take this class, however, after shopping both this and the regular sophomore Orgo class. Then, if you decide you like flipped classroom and have the time to dedicate to this class, you should take it.",
    "You will learn so much if you take this course! Organic chemistry can be scary, but I promise you will be proud of the material you learned by the end of the semester. The grading system in the course is pretty forgiving which allows you to be more concerned about learning over grades. And, there are so many resources at your disposal that help enable success.",
    "This class would be an ideal target for auditing. The lecture style and frequent opportunities for collaboration allow for concepts to be learned thoroughly and effectively. However, homework adds little to the lectures beyond information at best incidental to the class content, and tests introduce an element of time pressure so absent elsewhere that no amount of generous grading can properly compensate.",
    "Definitely!! If you placed into freshman orgo, it means you know and love chemistry and you should definitely take this class. Taught extremely well and all concepts were clarified.",
    "DefinitelyI think it was a great intro to organic chemistry.",
    "I definitely would because I think it was really nice to take Organic Chemistry as a freshman because everyone around you is in the same boat and it was just a really nice and collaborative environment. Prof. Tim is a really good lecturer and lectures were never boring in his class.",
    "Very worthwhile experience:\r\n- you meet some of your best friends and study partners for beyond first year\r\n- you feel very loved by the instructor, TAs, and peer tutors (they can even remember your name, and they will stay behind to answer your question, hold extra sessions, etc)\r\n- applicable skills learned and explanations given instead of memorizing things for the sake of or artificially challenging oneself with irrelevant and obscure facts",
    "Yes. Orgo is surprisingly fun, and everyone there wants you to do well so long as you are willing to put in the time.",
    "Yes, I think it was definitely a time commitment as a course but I feel like I learned a lot and that the way the class was set up kept it from being a 'weed-out' class like organic chemistry is often said to be. I also liked that I got to know a lot of other first years through the class.",
    "Definitely! Organic chemistry is a great subject, and I loved how it often feels like a puzzle. This class didn't emphasize memorization, so don't come in worrying about memorizing the most minute details. Also, don't worry about the grade coming in; the professor wants you to succeed.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes if their schedule allows for much attention to this class",
    "Absolutely. 10\/10. Will miss this class so much.",
    "Yes! Professor Newhouse is incredible, and although the grading is a bit ambiguous at times it is not difficult to get an A.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in chemistry and want to devote a large part of your first semester to learning chemistry. I would not recommend taking this course if you are not STEM or not planning on working in chemistry in some capacity in the future. If you are deciding between general chemistry, 1st year orgo, and normal orgo, and have a solid chemistry background, take 1st year orgo!! It's honestly such a great community and has such a great support system in place.",
    "Yes! It is an intellectually challenging and engaging course.",
    "Yes, Tim is a great teacher. You will learn a lot.",
    "Its hard, take it only if you need it.",
    "I would only recommend the course if they were passionate about chemistry. Otherwise, it is a huge course load and you would be learning something you don't care about.",
    "This course is definitely effective in deepening one's understanding of organic chemistry and organic reactions as there is a lot of material covered. Would highly recommend if this is what you are looking for.",
    "Yes if you like chem and\/or premed",
    "Yes, but only if they are interested in this field or if they need it for their prospective major.",
    "Definitely, it was very engaging and I learned a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to a student that feels confident enough to skip the general chemistry sequence.  The material took time and effort to understand, but there were so many resources to help us all do well.",
    "I would only recommend this course to students who truly love chemistry and want to continue, in some form or fashion, with chemistry, biology, pre-med, etc. I think this course is so interesting and can be an excellent class to take, but if you don't have a strong interest in the course material, then there's no point in spending the time and effort to make a good grade in the class.",
    "Yes, if they are looking to become a STEM major or are very interested in chemistry. It's a wonderful introduction to organic chemistry, and really gives you the skills to critically think in a scientific way.",
    "Definitely! Well taught, very interesting material. I'd recommend going to office hours\/peer tutoring hours because sitting with others and talking about orgo will help you understand it so much more. Tim does a great job of challenging us but not to the extent where we feel hopeless and like you'll never be able to get the material down. It was the hardest course I took this semester, but it was also the most rewarding.",
    "I would only recommend if they are very serious about chemistry. I kind of fell out of love with the subject just because I felt incredibly frustrated all the time.",
    "absolutely! It is challenging but there is a lot of support",
    "Definitely! Not only did I learn the material, I (mostly) enjoyed the process.",
    "I would recommend this course, but don't take it if you don't absolutely need it for pre-med or for a specific chem-related major. It's a LOT of work.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to freshmen who are interested in pursuing chemistry as well as those who are premed and have a strong background in general chemistry.",
    "I would take the regular orgo class instead of this one, but nothing against this class. The other one is just easier from what I heard.",
    "Yes, as it got me extremely excited to continue pursuing the chemistry major and could definitely be a class that makes someone fall in love with the subject.",
    "Yes",
    "No.  This was a terrible first semester experience.  I would never recommend it to a student that did not go to a prestigious high school with an elite background, because this course is geared towards people who had those advantages prior to coming to Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to any first year interested in taking organic chemistry, because the course really tries to get you to understand the bigger concepts instead of just memorizing things.",
    "I would recommend this course to a first year who really would like a challenge or can handle this intensive class with a lighter course schedule. It takes a lot of outside class time to prepare and really understand the material, but this is a good step to take for those who want to learn more about chemistry or need to fulfill the pre-med requirement without having to take general chemistry. The course is not impossible, but the student will need to allocate a significant amount of time towards it.",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in chemistry. It was a great course with a great instructor, the class covered abstract chemical concepts then related them to our daily lives.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Not only did this course allow me to get used to the workload at Yale, but it also allowed me to make many new friends.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any student who had a good grasp of chemistry in their AP or IB courses and have even somewhat of an interest in studying chemistry in college. This course was a good introduction to the academic expectation for students here, and it was also a great way to find friends with similar interests. Tim is also an AMAZING professor who really does his best to connect with his students and support his students in any way possible, while the material is very interesting and the sense of achievement at the end of the semester is incomparable.",
    "definitely. the payoff for taking this vs gen chem is so much and it's a great experience for a first year.",
    "Yes, absolutely! The course was fair, well-structured, and engaging. And the professor was knowledgeable, down-to-earth, and passionate about the subject.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student--even if they don't feel that their chemistry background is outstanding! I was very conflicted about even taking the placement exam. But I finally decided to review some concepts from my AP book\/online and fortunately had the opportunity to join the course. However, even if a student didn't score \"highly\" on the placement exam, I believe that anyone interested\/excited should be able to join because we still went over the basic concepts that we needed during the first couple of weeks and Tim, TAs, peer tutors, and classmates are more than willing to review\/collaborate on anything that a student asks. You can do it! I am very happy that I pushed myself out of my comfort zone and met all these awesome people.",
    "Yes! It was hard but I felt the instructors really cared about our success. We had a lot of help and engagement with real life applications in chemistry.",
    "This is probably as good as o-chem can get given its status in the pre-med canon. Maybe one day it won't be a pre-med requirement anymore, and then o-chem can actually be an enjoyable class dedicated to exploring the beautiful patterns and inconsistencies of carbon-based chemistry. That said, Tim makes a great effort to move the class in that direction with his emphasis on MO theory and current\/recent research. If you need it for a requirement, you should probably take it with Tim. If you want to learn o-chem for fun, it might be a good idea to do some self-teaching before taking this course, and then avoiding all study-halls or office hours.",
    "I would recommend this only to students that are serious about learning chem: there is a lot of material to learn in a short time. It helps to have taken orgo before but it definitely isn't a requirement, you just might need to utilize more office hours, haha. It's definitely a better first year chem class to take in regards to the lab (gen chem lab is rough)",
    "I would recommend this course to another student interested in looking more into chemistry that has already taken general chemistry. Although the course is difficult, it is a good learning experience for those that want to put the effort in and helps to develop a wide variety of skills besides simple chemistry. It has improved my ability to problem solve and has heightened my critical thinking. The problems given to us were fair in the sense that they were possible on exams; however, they required us to apply the material we had learned instead of simple memorization which is a better skill to have in the long run. It also presents questions more like puzzles or challenges and rewards us for finding unique ways to solve certain problems such as designing forward routes to synthesis. It is however unlike other chemistry courses in the sense that there is a lot less math so I would recommend it to people who like the side of chemistry that involves less math.",
    "take this if ur confident about ur chemistry ability. everyone in the class will be talented at science\/chemistry so it can be tough at times. sophomore orgo, ive heard, is easier but isnt curved as generously.",
    "Yes, it is a great way to start chemistry at yale.",
    "Yes I definitely would.",
    "Definitely! I think it's very possible to do well in this class, you just have to put time in. There's so much help available, the lectures are always posted, we do practice problems in section etc. I also think that the grading is very fair and generous; the psets and preclass are a big part of the grade and they were mostly completion.",
    "Yes, but only if you have some level of interest in chemistry. Course material is dense and workload is greater compared to other classes. If you enjoy spending long hours reading about chemistry\/solving chemistry problems, I definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student to learn about the fundamentals of organic chemistry in a collaborative environment that fosters learning.",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student if they have background in organic chemistry or if they are willing to put everything they have into this course. It is so easy to get lost in this course and fall behind if you don't dedicate yourself to practicing and learning the material everyday. It is rewarding if you put in the work, but it is extremely difficult to do that if this course isn't your number one priority.",
    "I would recommend only as a way to get 'ahead' with classes for a STEM major. Otherwise, it is not worth being surrounded by stressed-out premed students.",
    "Yes. While the material was challenging, there were many opportunities to get help with challenging topics and to ask questions about the material. The course is well-organized and well-taught.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone who is not on a pre-med track or a prospective STEM major. This felt more like a gauntlet or a cult than a course at times.",
    "I liked the teaching style of flipped classroom",
    "Yes! I loved it! I talked about this class at breakfast everyday."
