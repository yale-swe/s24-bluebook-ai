                "This course was well-designed, and I appreciated the alternating synchronous\/asynchronous days as a way to devote extra time to material as needed and also get a break from Zoom calls. The professor worked very hard to make sure everyone was engaged in the Zoom calls, and I enjoyed the assignments outside the classroom that required me to collaborate with other students. The issues I had with the class were technical - and I appreciated the flexibility the professor offered when my technology did not cooperate.",
                "A strength of this class is that it consistently trained my Hebrew skills so that they are exercised almost every day. I also enjoyed the multimedia learning.",
                "So many strengths! I loved the virtual format, the asynchronous\/synchronous sessions (I actually think that it will be a great format to keep even when classes are in-person again), the final projects, etc. Some of the work sometimes felt unnecessary (ex: some YouTube videos, etc.), but it was overall a great course!"

                "As previously mentioned, the assignments to collaborate with classmates were an excellent way of creating connection between students in different locations. Also mentioned above, the synchronous\/asynchronous format was definitely the best way to cope with Zoom fatigue and still maintain engagement. I also felt the instructor made a concerted effort to encourage participation from students, and I appreciated the many accomodations made for those with different technology access.  Overall, this class was very thoughtfully designed for a virtual setting.",
                "Zoom virtual meetings worked well 99% of the time, and I enjoyed the efforts for communication between the students themselves to help our learning.",
                "Asynchronous sessions were really great: the format was really helpful. I would recommend adding an explanatory sheet for every new concept that clearly delineates what we are learning (ex: Future tense, with a chart of verbs in the future tense)."

                "I would definitely recommend this course! Professor Goren is an amazing instructor who takes the time to meet one on one with her students throughout the semester and really listens to the feedback they provide. I saw adjustments in the course based on what I and my classmates suggested, and I appreciated that she valued our input. Be prepared for a heavy workload, but if you are taking this class virtually just know that it really does work best to follow her suggested plan - schedule your asynchronous work at a specific time and always do your homework from synchronous days seperately from the asynchronous work - it makes everything much more manageable.",
