                "You pretty much have full control over how you want to approach this class. There is no attendance requirement, and there is no in-class exam. So as long as you can churn the psets out you are fine. The weakness is the excessively theoretical focus of this class. While I understand the importance of theory, as somebody who is not really doing research but rather is interested in the practical applications of the optimization techniques, I would much prefer if the current ratio of theory-to-practice ratio of about 6:1 be reversed to 1:6.",
                "I liked the final project format (no final exam) and learned much more during the project than I expected. I wish we spent more time on linear programming and constrained optimization and a bit less time on gradient descent and related topics.",
                "Strengths: very well-structured course taught by a very knowledgeable professor.",
                "Strengths: Material is fun, psets and exams are fair, office hours were great (including Zhuoran's, which is the important one for future years)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures got boring at times, and we did very little programming for a class called \"Optimization and Computation\" - most of it was mathematical theory behind convex sets and convex functions",
                "I think the course moved a little too slow and it didn't seem like you needed the course content to do the problem sets",
                "Nice content",
                "The course is a solid first course in optimization. I took it as review. I am unsure as to how it could be improved for the target audience.",
                "Very good class, very good teaching style and interesting problem sets.",
                "Problem sets were fine. The lectures specifically were a bit messy sometimes, because there were no slides and the prof just wrote everything. Sometimes the writing might be too fast and would jump to the next slide too fast. Other times, the most important thing hierarchically was not emphasized enough because there was so much on the board, so the flow of ideas wasn't always clear. The handwritten proofs were valuable though so we could work through problems together. Overall, the problems could be remedied by giving the presentations a bit more framework and direction, maybe by use of slides. Then, we could go onto the whiteboard for proofs or something like that.",
                "The course has good problem sets that strike a balance between difficulty and doability. There weren't really instances where I felt like I was being given work for the sake of work and each assignment in the class was very conducive to my learning. It was very easy however, for me to get lost and come to lecture without a very good understanding of what exactly was happening.",

                "I would only recommend it if you have a solid background in proof and are interested in doing academic research in optimization and ML in general. The materials are at times so difficult that even though I can finish the pset I still have no idea what's going on. So in the end I don't think I have really learned that much. It's also a time sink, so you should plan your life around it.",
                "Yeah, this is a great class! Zhuoran is a great professor who cares about his students and is very supportive out of class as well. His office hours, along with Jorge's, were incredible and really a life saver on some of the harder pset questions (though they were overall very fair and the exam was take-home and open note). One warning is while this class is called \"Optimization and Computation\", we did very little programming and mostly covered mathematical theory behind convex functions and convex sets. You'll leave with much greater understanding of why optimization works compared to actual hands-on experience, but given that it was a very good class and I would highly recommend to everyone.",
