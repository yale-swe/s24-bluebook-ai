                "This course provides a great introduction to the topic of IR but doesnt dive especially deep into any area (went I wouldve liked to study it even more). That is likely an inherent issue with intro classes and I certainly wouldnt fault the instructor or syllabus.",
                "My only criticism of the class is that the readings were simply too excessive. I ended up having to skip the majority of them, which I very much regret because the ones that I was able to read were incredibly interesting. But the sheet amount of reading expected was much too high for an introductory class. Beyond that, my experience was excellent. I enjoyed the class, the professor and my TF were both great, and overall I think it was well-organized and expertly conducted.",
                "so many assignments that are needlessly long, felt like we had a quiz every other week that took up a lot of time. Professor Scheve also spoke very very quickly during lecture and it was often difficult to keep up",
                "STRENGTHS: Professor Scheve is very knowledgable, TAs are incredibly helpful, subject matter is very thorough, readings are interesting\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: Felt like we focused on war for a long time, workload was a lot toward the end, lectures could be a bit boring with just the powerpoint slides but it was Zoom so that is to be expected",
                "Strengths: The course moves quickly with lots of information and readings, which are usually interesting. Professor Scheve is a great lecturer and is really interested in the material. The content is really interesting, especially on international trade. They ask for a lot of feedback and actually use it, which is cool. I thought the course was going to focus more on the isms, but it didn't, which ended up being great. I am also not a very quantitative person, and the class is definitely more quantitive than I thought it would be, but it ended up being really interesting as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The readings can be quite long and technical, and sometimes it didn't feel like they were aligning with the lectures very well towards the beginning of class, but that improved towards the end. The course does move very fast.",
                "the readings were very long and it wasn't always clear what we were supposed to be getting from them. this could be improved by shortening the lengths of the readings.",
                "Strengths: The class went over a lot of material, if that's what you're looking for\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course is very dense, and the sections often went over new material rather than discussing the lecture explicitly (many section meetings had their own readings)",
                "Nothing to improve, good course",
                "This course was very interesting and well-taught, but I often felt that there were too many readings for us to actually absorb any of the information.",
                "The topics were very interesting and the final paper was very engaging. One weakness is that the pace of lectures often felt too fast.",
                "Strengths include organization, engaging lectures, clear slides, and a manageable workload. There are not a lot of weaknesses. Perhaps practice questions to help review for the exams would be helpful.",
                "I wish we had received more guidance on the structure of the final paper. The expectations were very unclear.",
                "The readings were not as engaging as we didn't speak about them in class and it felt like they were only there for the midterm. Moreover, having a quiz, a midterm and a paper due back to back was overwhelming towards the end. The display and teaching of the material was excellent however and I really enjoyed it!",
                "This course goes into way too much detail about complex topics for an \"intro\" PLSC class. At times, the class felt like an upper-level macro or game theory course, and we covered topics like war using counterintuitive methods that very few of us had even heard of before. Exams are open-book and open-note, but they often tasked us with finding minute details in long, advanced readings that we hadn't covered that much. This made it very stressful and hard to tell exactly how each of us was doing in the class. \r\nI also felt that we didn't get enough guidance on the final paper (or, in general, how to read and write political science research papers).",
                "I did not enjoy this course. The lectures were loaded with words which made it difficult to take notes and feel engaged at the same time. The concepts were also more technical and we did not explore any case studies in depth.",
                "A lot of topics but not a lot of information about them.",
                "I thought that the professor was very engaging and really enjoyed my sections. However, I found the lectures to be very long and filled with too many details, so they were difficult to follow. I also felt that a large amount of reading was assigned, but it was repetitive and often irrelevant, and even doing all of the reading, grading on assessments was so harsh that I did not do well.",
                "The course gives a very good comprehensive overview of the field to IR for students who may not have taken a similar course before, but moves very quickly and may be harder to follow for students not considering a major in a related field (e.g. Political Science, Global Affairs or EP&E).  It may be worthwhile to slow down the material slightly and spend more time on important conceptual topics being introduced (e.g. tragedy of the commons, democratic peace theory) to ensure all students can follow the course and remain engaged in the material.",
                "Very interesting content, not always taught in a way that was accessible to students who were new to the subject.",
                "Strengths: Class is interesting and tests are comprehensive. Sections are intriguing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class materials are somewhat boring.",

                "Less readings and more interactive assignments. I would rather do problem sets than have hundreds of pages assigned that never get discussed.",
                "Strengths - the content was very interesting\r\nWeaknesses - the sections were rigidly structured and didn't allow for natural conversation",
                "I wouldve liked a little bit more freedom with regards to essay topics throughout the year. I found that I was able to express my knowledge of topics discussed in class better while writing essays as opposed to taking exams.",
                "A strong point of this course were the quizzes and the sections because a lot of learning was reiterated and cemented in section and the quizzes were a good indicator of progress. A weakness of the course was that a lot of content was covered in each lecture; it wasn't necessarily an excessively fast class as a whole, but there wasn't always time to finish the lecture every day."

The final paper (rather than just a final exam) was also a good test of knowledge acquired in the class in a less time-constrained manner.

                "Yes, if you are new to the field and want to gain frameworks to study international cooperation in trade, organization, war, etc. It seems like a great springboard to further study IR  though it is perhaps not as engaging as a more specialized/advanced course.",
                "This is a very interesting class, and I would certainly recommend it to a fellow student. The only warning I would give is that the amount of reading expected is quite high. So be prepared to either read a lot or employ discretion as to which readings can afford to be skipped. Beyond that, the class was excellent and I hope that students in the future will enjoy it as much as I have.",

                "Yes! It's a lot of reading, and the lectures have a lot of material, but it's such an interesting and useful class. To be able to think on basic theoretical levels and understand the empirical work behind certain IR claims is really incredibly useful in a practical way. You'll find yourself thinking about countries (in the news, for example) in terms of coordination, thinking about how domestic institutions are affecting the government's response; and trying to identify issues in wars on much more simpler IR terms (indivisibility, regime change, policy) that actually make thinking about conflict easier and better. I really enjoyed the parts of the class that focused on trade, and thinking about that as well with IR language helps a lot. Prof Scheve is a great lecturer and very much wants to help you do well. I certainly did not understand everything or score perfectly on assignments and exams, but I learned a lot that I'll be able to use going forward even as a non GA/poli sci major.",
                "not really, unless they're especially interested in studying very specific models of international relations - I took this class expecting a general overview of theories of international relations, perhaps with a more historical approach, but it's very game-theoretic and model-heavy in a way that made me dislike the course",

                "Yes but be prepared to do a lot of reading. The topics are interesting and the professor is very nice, but only take this if you can handle a lot of readings that dont always feel necessary.",
                "Yes! This is a great class for students interested in international relations or the poli sci. Very interesting.",
                "Definetely would recommend to any students who are considering political science or international relations",
                "Absolutely if you're looking to learn more about a wide array of topics within IR/political economy.",
                "No- take a different course if you're interested in PLSC or looking for a social science credit.",
                "Not really. The lectures did not cover all of the material in depth and the reading load was too much every week, given that we had both lecture readings and section readings to complete per week. I also did not like that the lecture readings were never discussed in section.",
                "If they are interested to learn about international relations.",
                "I would not necessarily recommend this course because I did not feel like I got a full foundation of understanding international relations. There was a lot of reading and assessments, and I did not necessarily find it interesting unfortunately.",
                "Yes, particularly for students interested in majoring in Political Science or Global Affairs, since it provides an in-depth introduction to the field of IR.  However, it might be slightly less engaging for students not already familiar with many basic concepts in the area of political science.",
                "Yes! Do take this course, Ken is really passionate about this stuff and if you're at all interested in learning about international relations, this is a good way to do it. There are a LOT of assigned readings and needing to skim some is inevitable, but if you put in the time to do so it's not too difficult of a class.",
                "Yes! If youre EPE and looking to fulfill a requirement, very interesting! Reading is not entirely necessary so work load is very manageable.",
                "Yes. Professor Scheve was very engaging and the reading material was always interesting.",
                "Yes, it was an incredibly accessible introduction to complex topics such as international relations.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in international issues and politics",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, I would strongly recommend this course to any student that would like an introduction to global politics with regard to trade and war.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, would absolutely recommend this course to anyone looking to better understand the basics of international relations.",
                "If its required for your major. Otherwise, take more interesting stuff.",
                "Yes - this may not have been the most engaging class I took this year, but given that I intend to take more classes in poli sci and global affairs, I think this course provides really helpful vocabulary to understand international conflict and negotiation and stuff that will be back in my academic career, so I feel as though this course has helped me to be ready for those future classes and the work I will eventually be doing.",
                "Yes! teaches you the fundamentals of international relations",
                "Yes. It is a great course that will give you a little insight to the poli sci major.",
                "I would: the course contained interesting information and knowledge that could be very easily applicable to other fields, and it is taught very well. There isn't an excessive amount of reading, and the teaching staff typically highlighted which readings were most important and helpful.",
                "Yes, especially for non-political science majors."
