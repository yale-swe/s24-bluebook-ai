                "The course was extremely hands-on and the experiments each week were interesting. I enjoyed being able to refine certain techniques, such as excising a muscle and nerve out of a frog leg, across multiple weeks. The hand outs and pre-lab sessions were detailed and provided good guidance for each lab. This course could be improved by having more TAs around to help troubleshoot experiments--troubleshooting was a necessity in every week, because puzzling outcome (e.g. no readout on the oscilloscope when measuring action potentials) were frequent."

In lectures, I think that the inclusion of Prof. Wyman through Zoom was convenient but flawed, as there was no way to communicate directly with him, which slowed down those lab session. However, I understood that there was no better practical way to include him."

If you're comfortable spending 4 hours a week doing essentially nothing then go for it, again it's not that stressful it just feels like you're time is being wasted. The experiments would be cool in theory, but only the professor really ever gets them to work. After his demo, he would leave and not come back for 2 hours and then when he's back he helps 1-2 students and then we all leave. Grading is also very unclear, especially this semester since we didn't have quizzes. Better than other labs in terms of difficulty\/time spent out of class, but still annoying.",

The experiments were surprisingly interesting, engaging, and useful, but they came with a high degree of troubleshooting in order to work. This course provides an interesting perspective on neurobiology but will require you to have the time and patience to handle unexpected challenges in lab each week."
