                "I like the set up of this class, but I think that there should be flexibility with assignments. Given the frequency of meetings of this course, I think it should offer opportunities to excuse a few assignments.",
                "It is very structured and it makes it easier to follow. I wish they were even smaller classes",
                "Strength is that it focuses on speaking/reading as opposed to writing, and that the writing is all on the computer which allows for a faster pace of learning which is more applicable to real life.",
                "I think this course could teach to the test a little more, or modify the test to fit more of what we cover in class.  The writing portion of our tests is very, very difficult, and I often felt underprepared for the section no matter how hard I studied.  I also felt that I didnt really know how to study for this portion, given most of what we do in class is speaking, listening, and grammar/sentence construction.",
                "The four synchronous days plus on asynchronous day was a good balance, and I felt like the time during class was a good combination of lecture and conversation. I cant think of any particular weaknesses.",
                "More writing in characters",
                "Strengths: very organized, engaging, fun, prioritizes learning over grading, extremely qualified instructors\r\nWeakness: the textbook is outdated",
                "The powerpoint slides were helpful for learning new grammar and vocabulary, but I wish we did more engaging activities to change up the class structure sometimes. I think my two favorite classes of the semester were (1) when we had a debate and (2) when we did a job recruitment fair but speed-dating style. The asynchronous Fridays were a nice way to end the week and allowed us to talk to people we don't typically converse with in class."

                "Seems to be a lot more work than many of the other L3 languages at Yale, but I think that is typical of the Chinese program for all levels here. The textbook was less comprehensive than the L1 and L2 textbook, but the exams were much simpler. It is not too difficult to get an A if you participate in class and keep up with the work.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student that is looking to keep progressing in learning Chinese. It is definitely a step above L1 and L2 Chinese with longer essays being assigned and more new characters to learn. However, the class is structured in a clear and effective way and I felt that I was learning a lot of useful Chinese."
