                "This course teaches a lot about opera and its development, as well as its relationship with philosophy.",
                "I gained knowledge of and appreciation for several operas, along with the overall musical/philosophical/social scene in 19th century Europe that generated them. In particular, I gained an appreciation for what Professor Tomlinson calls \"problematizing\" media--that is, acknowledging the ethical issues of even engaging with a piece of media (Don Giovanni's misogyny, Wagner's anti-Semitism and mind control, Bizet's racism)--which is a skill that I think is widely applicable.",
                "As someone with little prior musical experience or training, I learned how to talk about music for the first time and to enjoy opera as a form of art.",
                "I learned so much about opera.",
                "I considered a range of philosophical questions (on the influence of music on the human spirit, on feminism, on the role of music) and learned about opera musical structure. I had no personal experience or exposure to opera before this class, and I have discovered it's a very big interest and passion of mine now. I loved analyzing them and digging into the historical contexts they were written in as well.",
                "This course focused on the intersection of Operatic and Philosophical traditions in a number of ways: 1) How opera responds to philosophical questions (such as aesthetics or affect-theory), 2) How opera prompts philosophical questions (such as race- or gender-theoretical readings), and 3) How opera voices philosophical questions (such as the philosophy of history or political-theoretical ideas).",
                "I learned a lot about many different views of music throughout history. We mostly read philosophy that directly had to do with the operas we were studying, and it was fascinating to see how some of the great philosophical minds thought about music.",
                "An interesting blend of basic musicological skills and philosophy. Especially how to take a given philosophical text and see its ideas are reflected in a work of art. And reading philosophical meditations on works of art.",
                "I found that my relationship with opera as a genre and with the specific operas we studied was greatly enhanced through this course. This was also an excellent gateway to a lot of philosophical readings and concepts I had not previously studied."

            "comments": [
                "The history, theory and analysis of opera was extremely interesting, although oftentimes the connection to philosophy was less clear.",
                "Strengths: the operas chosen span a wide range of genres, plot structures, and philosophical issues\r\nWeaknesses: the readings tend to be almost entirely from the same people, all from the past 50 years, with the exception of a smattering of shorter contemporary sources (mainly in the first 2 operas); the balance between \"opera\" and \"philosophy\" varied greatly from class to class, making it difficult to prepare and thus difficult to engage; too much time was given to the first 2 operas, leaving little time for the latter 2--which is a same, as it seemed to be a universal point of agreement in the class that Carmen was our favorite opera; the \"philosophy\" of the latter 2 operas was much less engaging, relying mostly on sources that did not engage in the source material directly",
                "The chief strength is Professor Tomlinson's mastery of the subject matter.",
                "No weakness.",
                "I liked the pacing and structure of the assignments/syllabus. My only suggestion would be to allow a little more time for the essays (10 days instead of 7, maybe?), because arranging meetings with Writing Tutors for them was a little hectic and sometimes not possible within the timespan. The prompts stumped me at times, but ultimately you have a bit of freedom within your responses.",
                "This course excels at its interdisciplinary approach, and is best as a way of using philosophical questions to introduce students to music in a unique way, and using musical works to introduce students to a number of distinct philosophical approaches in a way that is engaging and concrete.\r\n\r\nIn terms of improvement, this was the first semester this course was taught, and so if it is taught again (and I hope it is), I believe that it would benefit from more transparency in its organization and structure, so that at any given moment in the class, there is a clearer idea of not only what operas but which philosophical approaches and ideas lay ahead. A similar thing could be said about the placement of assignments throughout the semester.",
                "This course was very interesting, and the professor kept it engaging the whole time. I had a really fun time in this class, but I noticed that despite being a music class, there were no music majors. This is because this class doesn't count for the major. If somehow that could be changed, I think I know a lot of people who would really love to take this class.",
                "strengths - Professor Tomlinson is a gem of knowledge about both the opera and philosophy. A good lecturer, and very kind. Great & diverse (musically speaking) selection of operas.\r\nweaknesses - I think the different relationships of the philosophical texts to the operas made the organization / larger themes of the course harder to pick out (ie: some philosophers were writing ON opera, some were generally philosophy the professor could connect to the music, etc). I think a more specific philosophical focus would help provide a greater feeling of \"cling\" between the disparate elements of the course.",
                "Strengths: First, Professor Tomlinson is awesome. He's brimming with wit, knowledge, and passion for his subject, and is overall just a fantastic lecturer. If he ever made a podcast, I'd definitely listen to it. (Also, he's very, very nice!) Second, the workload is manageable. You watch operas, have weekly readings, and there's only three short papers spread throughout the semester. Try to take the class with a friend so you'll have someone to watch the operas with, it makes it even more fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: First, sometimes (though not always) the lectures fell into fairly discrete \"music\" and \"philosophy\" boxes, and I definitely preferred lectures that balanced the two rather than sticking to one or the other. Second, it'd would've been nice if Tomlinson had been clearer regarding his expectations for the papers. Be sure to ask what he's looking for! (He's not a harsh grader, he just doesn't give much guidance on the papers unless prompted.)",
                "This class was well suited to students of all levels of prior familiarity with music. There was a great mix of lecture, when necessary to teach key concepts, and discussion, allowing students to engage directly with the course's intellectual material. Frequent opera viewing and listening in class kept the core of the class in focus without feeling like it was just filling time (as often happens with in-class videos)."

                "Absolutely. It is hard not to recommend a course where half your homework is to listen to four of the great achievements of western music, but the gems of this class are much deeper than music listening. You will gain a greater appreciation not just for the titular works but for opera in general as a musical genre, dramatic form, and space for philosophical inquiry.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to explore opera in an interdisciplinary manner.",
                "Honestly, this one is hard to say. I have a slight background in music, and a greater background in philosophy, but even with both of those, it could be really hard to engage with the class at times. The main reason for this is that it is clear that Professor Tomlinson is more interested in the music than the philosophy; on days when we were meant to discuss readings, for example, the first hour of the class would usually be dedicated to talking about the opera, and the last 15 minutes to the readings. As a result, he expected absurdly high engagement with the opera at times--usually, he would require that students watch the opera at least twice, sometimes in two different versions, and during the weeks of discussion would ask us to rewatch certain acts (keep in mind that operas can run for over 3 hours, and the acts for over 1 hour). What made it more frustrating is that he would often assume that, after watching it, we would somehow have the music completely memorized, often playing certain tunes or leitmotivs on the piano (or singing them aloud) and commenting on them as he went along. But the most frustrating part was that several other students had an extremely high degree of knowledge about opera--keep in mind that this is a 100-level course. A lot of the time (multiple times each class, in every single class), at least one of these students would raise their hand and talk about any opera OTHER than the one at hand. (Section asshole + opera = a terrible concoction.) Professor Tomlinson would actually engage with these students, in the middle of class, for quite some time, meaning that he was essentially having private conversations with a portion of the class, making it unclear what was necessary to know and what was not. Recommending this is only \"hard to say\" because some of the content really was interesting. So here's what I suggest: shop it, and see for yourself--if, in the first class, you realize that there are a bunch of music snobs with you, and Professor Tomlinson races through (I should note that he speaks very very quickly) the material, then don't take it; if the class is more balanced, and Professor Tomlinson has learned to balance the content better, then check it out more seriously.",
                "Absolutely - especially if you have no prior experience watching or thinking about opera. This course is an initiation into a beautiful art form that I hadn't thought to explore before.",
                "Yes. Teacher and community are both amazing.",
                "I absolutely loved this class. Professor Tomlinson is incredibly knowledgable and poses very thought-provoking and interesting discussions. My favorite parts of the class, though, was hearing the ideas and comments of the other students in the class. Opera is such an interesting topic, and discussing philosophy alongside it paired nicely. I wish I could take this class again!",
                "As a student with a philosophical interest with little knowledge of music and no experience of opera, this course was incredibly well-taught for students in my position. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants an introduction to Opera and skills in interpreting music, especially from an oblique Humanities-centered angle which is more engaging and interesting than a standard musicological survey course. This course truly has no musical prerequisites, and is excellent for the Humanities student who wants to reap the benefits of a genuinely interdisciplinary approach to studying culture. Most of all, I recommend this course for Professor Tomlinson, who always amazes me in the breadth of his knowledge and his ability to teach a wide variety of subjects in such a way that students from different disciplinary backgrounds can all come to understand and appreciate his way of thinking.",
                "I would. Even just as a fun elective, this class would appeal to anyone who loves music.",
                "Yes! if you have only a passing interest in opera, this class will deepen it. If you love opera it will be great fun and a way to learn about philosophy in a less scary way.",
                "This class was the twice-weekly highlight of my week. I felt consistently challenged to engage more deeply with an art form that I already loved."
