                "Strengths: class diversity and professor knowledge inspired excellent class discussion every week \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lots of reading and those readings were often not discussed in class (but Im still glad I did them!)",
                "Dr. Young is fantastic! I loved that she brought in guest speakers to converse with us, and the discussions and readings were fascinating and related well to current events. The workload is very manageable, and you'll learn a lot about democratic institutions from a comparative standpoint",
                "Its hard to call this a weakness, because the course is so great as-is, but it sometimes feels like there could be room for more involvement with the readings. Usually, class has a great mix of current events and topical discussions. At the same time, office hours are a great place to talk about the readings, so its not really a weakness of the course so much as an endorsement of how full it is with engaging information.",
                "The class always offered high quality discussions, but a few discussions on specific case studies could have enhanced the discussions.",
                "strengths: Dr. Young!!!! An amazing, thorough professor who truly cares about her students, their lives, etc, way beyond teaching. That was refreshing and much needed, especially during the rough online semester. Content and readings were also a strengthreadings were kind of long but very thoughtfully selected for each topic. we also had great guest speakers who were really interesting and wanted to engage with us. We also received copious feedback on essays, which was super helpful and just again, showed how dedicated Dr. Young is to her students. talking about current events that related to democracy at the beginning of each class was something I also enjoyed. Weaknesses: none come to mind",
                "Really strong in its rate of participation and opportunities for students to learn from one another.",
                "It would have been amazing in person to meet Dr. Young and the other students, but other than that the course was amazing."

Class discussion is always engaging and readings\/topics are interesting to anyone with even some interest in democracy\/American\/EU politics and policy.",

                "YES!!! please take the course if you are interested in the content. Dr. Young is one of the best profs i've had, if not the best. she is so passionate and kind and smart and will support you, challenge you, and open your eyes to different topics and perspectives.",
                "Yes! Learned so much from my classmates and professor in comfortable setting.",
                "Yes! Dr. Young is AMAZING and the other students were also very engaging.",
                "If you want to do the readings consistently and be held accountable by class discussion, do not take this course. While students sometimes bring in the readings, the class discussions are mostly focused on overarching questions posed by Prof. Young that are informed by the readings. As someone who much prefers reading-based discussion that will flow into greater themes, I didn't like this aspect of the course and it hindered by learning when students would steer the discussion to the superficial rather than bringing in the complex analyses of the readings (which are very good)."
