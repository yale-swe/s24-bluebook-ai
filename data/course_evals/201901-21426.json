   "comments": [
    "It's a research class, so I learned a lot about the research project I was working on.",
    "Did research. Advisor dependent.",
    "I did a \"study project\" rather than a research project, going through a part of Nielsen and Chuang's textbook on quantum computing. Learned a lot about quantum computing, from foundations up to Shor's algorithm. Had a Mellon forum presentation in addition to the more technical presentation to other PHYS majors; also wrote a term paper synthesizing what I had learned. So in addition to information, had some practice in synthesizing it for different audiences.",
    "This course significantly aided in my research experience. My specific area of research involved materials science and mechanical engineering but I was able to tailor my work toward physics while still feeling that the work would important toward the disciplines. The course improved my presentation skills and scientific writing ability. Working alongside researchers was also an important social skill that I gained.",
    "Taking this course allowed me to develop skills of researching scientific literature, learning independently as well as locating and solving important questions about a subject.",
    "In this course, I learned about group theory and its applications in physics.",
    "Good course for developing research and presentation skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The presentations should be split up over more than 2 days. Splitting the presentations up will encourage more people to come and stay for the length of the presentations.",
    "The organization\/clarity of assignments could have been better (i.e. having canvas assignments posted instead of just emailing in assignments)",
    "Very standard research for credit. Would have been nice if guidelines were more accessible and thorough for things like mid-term report, final report, final presentation.",
    "If you do more of a study project, it might be good to do it with a professor on a topic in their field. My topic was new to both me and my professor, so a lot of it was self-teaching -- more difficult, but maybe more rewarding. Not sure how it would have turned out if my professor's thing was quantum computing.",
    "Strengths: Involvement in research, presentations, writing reports, social learning\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: slight difficulty in choosing mentorship",
    "From an administrative perspective I think that the course was perfectly well structured. It is difficult to make judgments about a course that is so broad. I think that there should potentially be a different course listing for students like me who used the course to do a directed reading of a subject instead of doing research, but that is my only suggestion.",
    "The course is designed for students to get out what they put in--which can be both a strength and a weakness."

   "comments": [
    "If you're taking this, you're doing it for the major. Find your advisor as early as possible. But other than that, it's a pretty easy course to pass as long as you make it to the end of your presentation and turn in a paper on time.",
    "Yes of course (plus it's mandatory for physics majors anyways)",
    "Yes, do as much research as you can as early as you can. No downside. Make sure you have an advisor you like.",
    "In an instant.",
    "471 is required, so there's no point in recommending it to another student, per se. I had a good time with my 471, though my advisor was really demanding and I ended up spending a lot more time on my project than most of my friends in the program.",
    "Yes; would especially recommend a study project over a research project if you know you're not that into research. I hadn't really realized this was allowed, but it was awesome -- taking a 1-on-1, predominantly self-taught class on a new topic was a really cool experience.",
    "Yes. This course will help with developing your research project.",
    "Senior thesis course, so it is required for the major.",
    "Yes definitely, to any student interested in doing physics research!",
    "Very enjoyable course for those looking to do research."
