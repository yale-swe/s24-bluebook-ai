    "I learned all about what the Internet is, where it exists (no, it's not just some unknown dimension), the psychology behind it, data and privacy, and so much more. This class definitely had the most impact on my daily life and I became much more cognizant of my own digital usage.",
    "Knowledge about digital privacy, technology usage, and the internet.",
    "Presentations skills, a bit of coding (react), planning and developing a user-friendly product",
    "In this course, we discussed what the physical internet is, who owns it, how's it profitable, how people consume it and what the ramifications are of that consumption.",
    "This course taught me how to critically evaluate many of the things we take for granted when it comes to tech, and the rising concerns of user privacy in the digital age. I learned about the infrastructure of the internet, how data is collected on users, and how much money is in this industry. We also assessed how tech affects user well-being and different tactics to control the extent to which technology controls us. This class made me hyper-aware of my own technology usage and how it has affected relationships and interactions between people in my daily life.",
    "I learned about digital over-consumption and how people are using technology these days."

   "comments": [
    "strengths: the organization was phenomenal, readings were very engaging, and the seminar-style was mostly student-led with the perfect amount of guidance from Lydia\r\n\r\nweaknesses: only met once a week!",
    "Strengths - Very unique class, products instead of papers make it so that students get very connected to and attached to the material and their arguments, INCREDIBLY well-organized, timely and helpful feedback always provided",
    "I found our class discussions to be really thoughtful. I appreciated the specific questions the prof would ask that guided discussion. Standards for midterm and final projects was really clear, feedback that was given for drafts was also clear and swift.",
    "Strengths of the course include that the readings were engaging, and the reading responses were always fun! I liked the policy that we had to turn off our phones and put them in a basket during class, since it helped people engage in the discussion. The time always passed quickly. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the class  nurturing, stress-free, and insightful. There was enough flexibility so that people could engage with the topics they felt most passionate about. Great feedback was given by the professor on project ideas.\r\n\r\nThe primary weakness of the course was the projects. I strongly would have preferred writing papers to doing those projects, which included writing a paper about the project. In many ways, I felt limited by the form of the project, which had to be digital. I was willing to put a lot of effort into this class, but I felt as though that effort was not represented through the projects. In my opinion, it would have been more worthwhile to write a 10-15 paper in which I could make a more nuanced, supported argument about privacy, health, or power in the age of digital over-consumption instead of being limited by the digital form of my product.",
    "I really liked the seminar format of the course because I feel like I was able to learn a lot from the experiences and perspectives of the other students in the class. I also really enjoyed the course readings and topics because they were a mix of articles, readings, and videos."

    "YES! Absolutely this is hands down one of the best classes I have taken. It's so relevant as well. If you're at all curious about how that little device that's always in your hand actually works and impacts your life, take this class.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes, 100%. The most timely, topical course you can take in our evolving digital age.",
    "Yes, absolutely. You will learn so much about the thing that we use every day (the internet), and begin to understand its effects on a deeper level.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in how we, as humans, consume media and devices. I learned so much about who controls the internet and how apps and platforms are designed to control my behavior. Super applicable to my every day life.",
    "If you are interested in how technology is affecting us and bigger questions about privacy, health, and power in today's age, then I would recommend this course! The reading load is fairly manageable (~2 hrs\/week) with a weekly, open-ended reading response that encourages introspection. If you like open-ended project-based classes, that's also a big part of the class. Discussions were good. If youre loosely interested in the topic but not super serious about it, the conversations can start to feel a bit repetitive.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone and I think that it is such an important topic that not a lot of people are thinking about. It is essential that we have conversations about the negative consequences of technology and think about creative solutions to fix it. I would highly recommend this class to anyone and I think that everyone at Yale should take this course so they are more aware of their technology use. The products take up a lot of time but they end results are fascinating."
