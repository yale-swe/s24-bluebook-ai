I also developed a strong background in the content of this course: understanding the creation of the state and its role in development around the globe.",
                "This class gave a wonderful analysis into the role of the state and how differing factors control its development, both internally and externally. Each week was focused on a different aspect of development, from colonial history to trade. I thought it was beautifully structured way to engage.",
                "Great insight into what development means, what it looks like, its history, and the different policy and institutional mechanisms that can help foster positive development outcomes. Also improved writing and research skills, especially through the final research paper."

                "The course readings were extremely valuable, but at times the workload was too much to manage. As a result, I did not complete some of the readings with enough depth and therefore had little to contribute in class. I think I would have preferred slightly fewer readings that I could have dedicated more time to.",
                "The class was structured very well and the professor was very receptive of our feedback and how we wanted the course to improve. For instance, we asked for video and non-literature heavy works to be incorporated into the weekly reading and this was done!\r\n\r\nIn terms of weakness, the reading load at the beginning of the course was a bit heavy. The final paper, which is 20 pages, is also quite difficult.",
                "The biggest strength of the course was Tumi. She's a fantastic professor who is not only passionate about the subject but wants to inspire passion in her students. The course was structured super well with reasonable expectations, and the discussion-based seminar format allowed for everyone to share their insights and help reach a deeper level of understanding of the material. Office hours were super accessible, and Tumi was willing to help in any way possible. No weaknesses."

                "This is one of the most impactful courses I have taken at Yale. I would absolutely recommend it to any Global Affairs student. I am not particularly economically inclined, but this course merged economics and social issues beautifully, taking a well-rounded approach to development that I appreciated immensely. Although the course material was great in volume, it was also rich in insight. Every minute I dedicated to this class paid off, from time spent completing required readings to participating in class discussions. Highly recommend.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone curious about how to improve development! Human rights is also tied to the class as well as aspects like economics. Its a great well-rounded GLBL class.",
                "Yes. Tumi is so intelligent and does hold you to a high standard but she really pushes you to be a better reader, writer, discusser, and thinker. She offers REALLY good feedback on papers and the proposal and you can tell she puts in the effort to do so. I'd recommend the class if you want to further your academic/literature knowledge of development. In the beginning, the readings felt a bit too esoteric and theoretical. However, Tumi asked us for anonymous feedback at the end of every class and actually incorporated our thoughts the next week (which was impressive, instructors are rarely proactive with feedback). With our feedback, she included more case studies into our readings and was flexible about the syllabus which I appreciated.",
                "This class fills a gap left by the global affairs department in its discussion of development. The class was utterly brilliant in its academic approach of development. Professor Makgetla covers the most important development works and makes an effort to make these works digestible. Professor Makgetla always cares about her students and asks for their feedback after every class session. She is well-versed in the world of academia and knows what feedback is most effective in our work. It is such a shame that she is leaving Yale in the next few years because she is a brilliant professor one of the best I have ever worked with at Yale.",
                "Yes! Taking a class with Tumi is an inspiring experience, and I've never felt so supported and engaged in a learning environment. The course material was interesting, the class community was fun, and the discussions were engaging. Easily one of the best Global electives you can take, and a much more comprehensive and exciting course on global development than any other offering currently."
