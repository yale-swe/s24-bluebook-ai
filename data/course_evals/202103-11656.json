                "strengths - low pressure and refreshing content. I liked the set-up of lecture Tuesday and movie discussion Thursday\r\n\r\nweaknesses - class could be boring sometimes",
                "The strengths of this course were the films. They were great. It's all classic sports movies. Rocky, Eight Men Out, Invictus, Chariots of Fire, etc. So good. Really enjoyable. Especially when all your other work is hard, it's super fun to be able to watch a movie for homework during the week.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were the classes. The discussions tended to be pretty listless. Maybe that's on me and my classmates, but I also think part of it had to do with the structure of the course. I think it would be better to have more specific prompts to consider when watching films or doing readings so that everyone comes to class a little bit more engaged. I also came into this class expecting to do more reading and writing, so I felt a little underwhelmed in that regard.",
                "The readings were very lengthy and very boring. The films were good and the discussions around them and their accuracy and the events were good. I think it could be improved by using the first class of the week to show part of the actual film after setting up the premise with history since more engaging to watch with others vs by oneself for homework. Also, grading was very vague for the course. I never received my grade on my nonmainstream sport worth 5% and have no idea what my participation or weekly discussion write grades are. Other teachers normally midway through the semester would tell us what our participation grades were and how to improve it or give us assignments back. I only know my grade on my midterm paper worth 25% of the grade and waiting back on final paper, but for the other 30% of assignment have no idea and is difficult because if I receive a unfair grade I will have no idea since will just be told final grade at the end and would be nice to have midway feedback.",
                "very passionate and nice professor, not super engaging classes, very little feedback from professor given about assignments",
                "The strengths are the readings and films. They were interesting and I enjoyed them. I will say however it was a lot to ask the students to watch 1-2 whole films in addition to readings and lectures each week. The class itself was extremely disengaging. The professor was unorganized, unenthusiastic, and didn't teach up how to read long articles or write papers (which I was expecting in a first-year seminar). I think the professor could be a lot more prepared for each class, and make the class engaging. I think also the students shouldn't be allowed to be on their laptops because not everyone was doing work on their computer that was related to the class.",

                "I definitely would, especially to a sports-fanatic or athlete, as it was interesting to hear the perspectives of athletes from different sports at Yale. I also loved meeting some fellow student-athletes",
                "It depends. If you want a fun and light workload, yes, this is an amazing class. I would highly recommend being a sports fan, though. However, if you are looking for a rigorous introduction to college reading and writing, I think you would be wise to look elsewhere.",
                "Maybe. It is an alright class but I think for those interested in a freshman seminar there are a lot of options and it is hard for me to say if this is better than others. I've heard of some phenomenal ones and some very bad ones, I'd say this is more a middle one in terms of class enjoyment, probably not a top choice, but a backup one in selection.",
                "really good class for people who want to watch iconic sports movies, does require a lot of time to watch all the movies/do long readings",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student because I was frustrated at times with the lack of organization and help. I met up with my professor twice and he forgot about our appointment and I had to call him on the phone to meet up. I also didn't get much feedback on my work. In general, I didn't learn as much as I would've liked.",
                "If you like a wide variety of sports yes. I only pay attention to 1 or 2 sports and didn't particularly love the units about cricket and some other sports, so in some weeks, I was less engaged than others.",
                "I would recommend this course if the student is interested in sports and/or is looking for a relatively easy course to fulfill a Hu or WR credit. Outside of that, I probably wouldn't since the material can be very disengaging at times."
