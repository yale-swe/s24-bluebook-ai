                "This course helped my French writing a lot. We received really helpful feedback on essays, and a lot of the classes highlighted useful vocabulary and phrases. I also got the chance to read some more recent French novels in a class context, which was a great experience.",
                "Having interacted relatively little with contemporary French novels before this course, FREN 233 helped to build my understanding of modern-day French literature and the themes\/trends that characterize it.",
                "deep analysis of French literary works in the contemporary age",
                "French essay writing skills, how to parse difficult texts, information about French media",
                "I think I really, really deeply improved my close-reading skills--especially in regards to French and French literature. The French language is an incredibly rich language, and the assignments in this class, as well as the books that were chosen (although they were certainly not my favorite) really focus on style and the nuances of the language's complexity. I also feel like out of all the French literature-based courses I've taken, this one focused equally on learning and improving your grasp of the language--we learned new expressions, new terminology, idioms--and this is just a testament to Professor Cadieu's teaching. Before taking this class I was unaware of the rentre littraire and it's significance to French culture, nor was I acquainted with the many mdias littraires in France, and so I'm walking away knowing a little about French contemporary literature but also a little about media and the significance of literature in modern France. I've always wondered why literature is the most oft-taught thing in a French department at a university, but this course is a testament to it: French, France, its literature, they're all intertwined; you can't have one without the other. And while there is an established literary canon, this class allowed me to broaden that horizon and discover some of the more controversial and daring literary works being produced today."

                "This is a great class. The choice of readings was varied and interesting. I will say, though, that we could definitely have spent less time on Ormuz!",
                "I thoroughly enjoyed the reading list for this course and our class discussions; I can't think of any obvious areas for improvement!",
                "Very good seminar, vibrant discussion, interesting selection of books, very clear prompts and essay guidelines, great professor",
                "I really enjoyed this class! We read meaningful texts and raised interesting ideas in discussion, and the class environment was always friendly, so I felt comfortable sharing my thoughts. Don't really have any suggestions on how it can be improved",
                "Strengths: honestly, all strengths. I love the way Professor Cadieu teaches. A seminar is truly a seminar, and with a really good discussion leader. She comes to each and every class with an agenda and runs it very well; everything is extremely organized and efficient. I loved that our readings were guided, and the often had a singular question to answer prior to our class session, really forcing us to distill some particular idea. I also really love that the written assignments are NOT standard essays. They're creative: I wrote a glossary, an \"criture d'invention\" where I rewrote the passage of one other in the style of another, and a \"recension,\" a journalistic book review. We also had a really fun debate about Marie Darrieussecq and plagiarism. The level of French in this class was clearly elevated, but Professor Cadieu doesn't make you feel like you're behind or timid. Also, she gives extensive feedback on every assignment, EVEN if you do well, which I adore -- she really cares about teaching and the material she teaches, and it shows.\r\nWeaknesses: if I had to name any at all, it would be the book selection. Of all the books we read, I found the final book (which we actually chose as a class) was the most interesting, \"Les Envols\" by tienne Kern. I can understand why some of the books were chosen, but I don't think it was necessary to have read \"Ormuz\" over two class sessions; I didn't really learn anything from the novel and while the discussion of the style may have been interesting, it was frankly just really boring."

                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in French literature, as I think we don't talk enough in world literatures in general about recent novels. Many of these books will likely be canonical in a few years, and they are a delight to read.",
                "I would definitely recommend FREN 233 to students who want to learn more about French culture and literature.",
                "highly recommend just to take the course with Professor Cadieu is an immense pleasure",
                "Yes, I have recommended it to a few friends already",
                "Absolutely, but with a reservation regarding French level. You need to be able to have advanced conversations about French literature and literary devices, and these skills need to be equally as strong in regards to written work and thought. This class asks you to think about form and style a lot, especially in each essay assignment, so if you feel like you're lacking in this, but are up to the challenge, then you should be okay! But again, make sure your French is up to par, because you will struggle if not -- Professor Cadieu is here to correct your French and all its mistakes. I did well on my writing assignments, but the bane of my existence is when I just receive a grade and no comments; in this class, Professor Cadieu put comments on each and every single page, highlighting passages and leaving notes about her thoughts. The care she puts into this class make it worth taking altogether. I just hope some of the books on the syllabus change, because even an incredible class discussion can't make up for the bore."
