Milton, love or hate him, is really fascinating and has a lot to say about everything, which is conducive to a seminar -- there's always something to comment on and explore. I think Professor Mohamed did an excellent job guiding the discussion and pointing us to specific passages.",

                "Could have more organic student participation -- the first half often felt like a lecture before the student discussion leaders for the day took over, if they took over at all -- but the professor is extremely knowledgeable"

If you love Paradise Lost and/or Milton, or you are interested in the experience of reading one difficult poem very deeply with the guidance of an experienced professor, then you will enjoy it. If you need a Renaissance credit, this is also a fairly painless way to get it. I appreciated the course overall, but if you don't fit either of those categories, I don't think the course is impactful enough to warrant taking it over another."
