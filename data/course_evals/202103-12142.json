I was able to explore a wide breadth of women throughout history, and simultaneously improve my reading, writing, analysis, and discussion skills.",

                "I think the curriculum is well-balanced so that you get to learn about a lot of interesting figures and deepen your understanding of issues facing female musicians. I can't really think of any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Great professor, Frances Pollock gave a great presentation, really really enjoyed the class and wish I could take it every semester! I hope these themes continue for other music classes in the department, loved the chance to delve into personal interests for the final paper \r\n\r\n\r\nPlaces for improvement: Possibly the class could have been skewed slightly toward the more recent area, or perhaps this could even make two different classes - I felt the place we ended the class could have been a whole semester and was my favorite part of the course! I think intersectionality could have been explored even more and I also think short lectures at the end of each session to prepare for the next class would be useful to give everyone some common background so the next session would be a more lively discussion.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Support, kindness, and availabiluty from Prof Kreuzer throughout the semester\r\n- Very in-depth and structured course material\r\n- Opportunity to write on specialized topics of students' choosing\r\n- Clear feedback throughout the semester\r\n- An opportunity to focus on women in a male-dominated department\r\n- Acknowledgment of and discussion surrounding intersectionality, gender minorities & nonbinary folk, systemic racism\r\n- Guest speakers and multimedia in class that keeps engagement\r\n- Positive and affirming class environment",
                "This course is designed very well. I liked the chronological progression of the course and having a different theme each week. I enjoyed the midterm paper, final presentation and term paper project. I did not particularly enjoy having to prepare a certain reading excerpt to present to the class, but I understand the necessity to divide and conquer a lot of reading. Some weeks I wouldve liked to focus on music analysis more, but overall the balance was pretty good. Having an opportunity to discuss music together (listening to a clip while looking at the score and then making observations) provided a nice counterpoint to discussion of readings that were completed to different extents throughout the class."

                "Absolutely, I think every musician would benefit from taking this course. Prof Kreuzer facilitates nuanced conversations, and I felt that I could bring up complex and perhaps controversial ideas.",
                "Yes definitely!",
                "Yes! Prof Kreuzer is wonderful, and the material is extremely necessary, especially for music majors. As someone who doesn't have much formal experience with western art music, I learned so much, and it was excellent to be able to do so with such an affirming, warm, and engaged group of people!",
                "Yes! Professor Kreuzer knows how to lead a seminar and a lot of the course content is not covered in the music history sequence. The reading is reasonable and the papers are flexible and thereby more enjoyable."
