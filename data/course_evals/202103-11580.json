            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Deb is wonderful and makes her students feel loved, I think. Theatre of desire is a really radical concept for me. As an actor-playwright, this class was really perfect for me.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a bit disorganized, Deb doesn't always come in with a plan I think, but I never minded",
                "The intention of this class, to me, was to give some students tools for performance but more so to inspire and facilitate students in making \"a theater of desire.\" I think that this goal was empowering for me. I don't know if that was the case for everyone in the class because, while the results are pretty flexible, Deb has a pretty fixed method towards making a theater of desire, and this method is full of surprises. We only ever really knew what was supposed to be happening for the next two weeks in the course. I think more clarity at the beginning of what some of the major chunks will look like over the course of the semester could help students decide whether the methods of this course were best suited to their goals as students of performance. Some people want to work more with written texts than occurred in this class. That's all a caveat to saying that I think this class is incredible, and I think it unfolded in the perfect way for me. I loved getting to work with the movements of the body as building blocks of performance. I loved having the options for the readings, although I think as another student pointed out the readings would benefit from more author diversity. I especially think there is an opportunity to look at author's outside the 20th-century, European and American performance cannons. Many of the books we read were already from artists working at the margins of a commercial system, so I think there are books of a kindred spirit to be found be non-white and non-American/European authors. I do think the books I read were helpful though.",
                "I wish the reading syllabus could've been more diverse. Almost every single author was male and white. \r\nI also would've loved to work more on scene study -- sometimes we were given really lengthy memorization assignments only to work on them very briefly for a single class. \r\nI really enjoyed some of the acting exercises we did though (entering the room under X circumstance or carrying out an imaginary phone conversation). I wished we could've focused more on that and less on passing the sound, walking around the room, etc.",
                "For those who want strict structure in a class, this is not for you. But have in mind that in the open-ended questions that prof. Margolin's assignments throw at you, you will find true discipline and intellectual stimulus.",
                "This class was always a relief to come to after a long day of more traditional Yale courses. Deb does a great job of establishing a space where everyone truly feels free to experiment and fail without shame or judgement. The weakness of this course lies in its disorganization. At times it felt that there was no class agenda so the exercises became repetitive. I wish we had spent more time analyzing and receiving critique on our work in class.",
                "This course is very effective for developing one's personal relationship to theater and writing. I think it could be improved by more clearly explaining the difference between the two sections during course selection.",
                "The biggest strength of this course was how close all of the students work with each other. I feel like I learned a lot from my peers in this class. The biggest weakness is that the class lacked organization, as canvas was never used and most information was spread by word of mouth. The class also lacked structure, and it was sometimes confusing why we were doing certain activities.",
                "I think one of the strengths of this course is the freedom for development and self-expression that the class gives the students. Students take the lead on the direction of their assignments, projects, and learning. The class does lack a lot of structure as a weakness. There is not a clear place to look for information or references which can lead to confusion."

                "Yes! Yes! And again, yes! I took this in my sophomore fall, and it feels like one of the most important and well-timed classes I've taken at Yale for my development as a performer and as a person. If you want to work with the building blocks of performance, take this class. If you want to be empowered to make theater in your own way, take this class. If you want to do a lot of constant scene work, you might not love this class but you should take it anyways because I truly believe that at some point in everyone's lives they could use the things we learned in this class. Be prepared for the journey because it will be chaotic and more time consuming than it appears on first glance, but the journey is rewarding.",
                "I would recommend this course especially to non-majors. If you feel like bringing an entirely new perspective to your college career and learning about your own vision/voice,  this is a must take class. The assignments we had challenged me to have intense dialogues with myself. The conversations we shared within our class was more meaningful and vigorous than any humanities seminar I ever had.",
                "Depends on the student and which section. Deb's section really puts on emphasis on creating your own work thus consists of a lot of writing and abstract thought exercises. While I enjoyed this I know that some other students felt that they were not receiving what they needed from the course. If you are looking for more traditional acting training using scene and monologue study from existing works, I would recommend Hal's section. However if you are looking for a more liberatory and unorthodox approach to a class would 100% endorse Deb's section.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other TAPS majors and people interested in an intensive approach to acting.",
                "I am not sure. While I loved the work I got to do with other students in the class, I think a lot of students were often frustrated with the lack of structure and confusion faced throughout the course. I truly cannot say how much I actually learned in class, because often times it felt like we started working on things (monologues, scenes, etc) without ever getting the chance to finish this work and see it to the end. You need to take the class in order to take some upper level TAPS courses, so maybe take it for that reason, but beyond that I don't know.",
                "I would recommend the class to students who are interested in better understanding performing. However the class greatly changes and differs based on who teaches the class so I would recommend that before taking the class that one considers the person teaching and if they believe that teacher will help them best grow."
