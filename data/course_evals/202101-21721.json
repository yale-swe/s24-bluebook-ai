                "The course is very organized and the readings were relatively easy to find.\r\n\r\nHaving access to slideshows viewed in class would be helpful for studying.",
                "Strengths:\r\nthe survey course engaged meaningfully with a variety of ancient Chinese texts, attempting to understand each one in its own context and in the context of others\r\nassignments were clear and very thoughtful about the current covid situation, stressors, etc (REALLY appreciated) \r\nappropriate amount of time dedicated to each thinker given the nature of the scope of the course, encouraging students to engage on a deeper level with the texts and thinkers that interested them most\r\nassumed no previous experience with the same or similar texts...great intro course!!\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nclass sometimes felt less structured, when I think first-time engagement with texts needs more organization to build foundational understanding",
                "I thought the concept of the class was very interesting, but the workload was higher than what I was expecting. I think the virtual nature of the course also made discussion more difficult and less engaging",
                "I found the readings to be quite dry and repetitive, also didn't understand why we were skipping over vital texts like Sun Tzu's Art of War. The workload for this class was too heavy, with four essays, two exams, and discussion posts due every class, it was difficult to keep up. If it were up to me I would add Sun Tzu and trim the excess fat in the syllabus to give us more time to mull over texts like the Laozi or the Zhuangzi.",
                "I thought the discussion posts were a good way to make sure we stayed up to date with the reading.",
                "Strengths: \r\n\r\nProf Hunter is a gem (lots more on that below)\r\nThe associative questions on the exam are low stress and allow you to ramble and really show off your knowledge. I think it's a really good representation of our learning rather than some rote memorization-based question\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n\r\ncan't think of any. I LOVED this class.",
                "I think one really good addition to this course would have been breakout rooms. A lot of times, I think students are uncomfortable speaking up about their ideas in front of the class (Yale students are generally good public speakers, but texts are very hard and dense so chance are we're also really uncertain about our takeaways), and being able to perhaps just express your ideas by a few peers first before actively participating in front of the class would have been helpful for sure!\r\n\r\nAnother improvement I think would be to give introduction about the philosopher in our assigned reading the class before, so that way during class next day we can jump straight into discussions rather than learning about the philosophers after engaging with the text (this was a little awkward for me on a few occasions, as I had to reevaluate the text after reading).",
                "Strengths: I love the way classes were formatted as half-lecture, half-seminar. It facilitated learning by combining a top-down approach from Professor Hunter (who's very knowledgeable about the material) with space where we could present and discuss our ideas with peers. Prof. Hunter also reads the discussion posts we write prior to class closely and uses them to prepare discussion questions, so the discussion never falls flat.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is a LOT of reading involved in this course, and we go through them at a very fast pace. The page count isn't very high, but these texts are dense and complex. Many times, I would read the passage and, despite understanding each and every word and sentence, have no clue what the author was trying to get at. Though the half-lecture went a long way toward helping me digest the text, I still felt that we were only able to delve a tiny bit into what each text had to offer. As a result, I think that the course offers great breadth, but not so much depth in the texts.",
                "This course feels quite in-depth, and the historical background and discussions for each text were thorough and challenging. The short papers throughout the semester and discussion posts amounted to a consistently heavy workload, especially paired with the lengthy readings, but the number of assignments meant that there were plenty of chances to improve your grade, and lots of opportunities to gain points in general. However, I wonder if there is another way to test comprehension on the final exam and midterm format other than the passage IDs. I did all of the readings, posts, engaged in discussion and studied extensively, yet with so many very long (50+ page) readings and many similar themes and word use, it was really difficult to be able to identify the passages based on providing short excerpts (usually around 3 lines). It certainly makes sense to want to add an element of recall, but that format felt like the lottery if the few lines you happened to remember from so many pages of readings appeared on your exam.",
                "I really enjoyed the discussions we had in class, and Im glad to have been able to build a foundation in the early Chinese canon and learn more about the values and philosophies held by the ancient thinkers. I also really appreciated that the professor responded individually to all of our discussion posts.",
                "The texts are brilliant, they are the strong suit of this class. Professor Hunter also picks really fascinating texts that arent usually taught in Chinese philosophy survey courses like this one while giving us the foundational texts of the tradition. The discussion style of the class let the students lead the focus of the class, but sometimes if no one had ideas or the energy to direct conversation, the class felt a little aimless. However it also centered the class around our ideas which was engaging."

                "I would highly recommend this course as a great introductory survey course to ancient Chinese philosophy. It lives up to the name and offers a variety of Chinese thought with large relevance to today's state of philosophy, politics, etc. In many ways, it captures the best of directed studies, so I absolutely loved the course and I feel like I came away with new conceptual frameworks to use in assessing philosophy, politics, ethics, history, and literature.",

                "Probably not ... syllabus is quite bloated and material is not presented in an interesting way.",
                "As someone who had very little exposure to ancient Chinese thinkers I found this course very interesting. I did not feel unprepared, and I was able to learn outside of my usual area of study. There is a fair bit (but not an extreme amount) of reading and reading responses before each class, but the papers are short (only 2 pages). Professor Hunter led high-quality discussions and asked us good questions.",
                "100%, but with a few caveats. One, you will get to learn about a topic from one of the experts in the field, and from one of the most empathetic and humble professors you'll meet at Yale. It'll challenge you intellectually and really make you think about the world in a new light.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the workload is nontrivial. The readings take a significant amount of time. They're only 10-50 pages usually between classes, but they are often very cryptic, so it takes a lot longer to digest and read. It takes a lot of brainpower and critical thinking as well. Furthermore, the reading responses take another few hours to construct something thoughtful, as even though it's one comment and one question, almost all responses are a few paragraphs long, well-thought out and thorough. So keep in mind that this class does take a significant workload, but not an overbearing one like some of the other ones Ive taken at Yale.\r\n\r\nAlso, be wary of the papers. Even though 2 pages doesn't seem like a lot, the amount of thought and care you need to put into your analyses is extremely high. Its by a far the most rigorous and demanding humanities analysis in terms of depth and articulateness of analysis. Prof Hunter has SUPER high standards, although he will also be one of the most generous in offering opportunities to meet with him, do rewrites on papers, etc.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend this class to anyone, but if it's a normal year and you're concerned about the workload and grade, I would suggest Credit/D/Failing, as I think that would be the best way to get the most out of the course without the academic stress. Although Prof Hunter did his best to lower that, especially this year.",
                "Yes! This course is a great comprehensive introductory course, so good for both students that just want to dabble the surface of Ancient Chinese Thought and for students looking to go further down. The one thing I'd say is that this course is definitely not gut, as there's quite a bit of reading and if you put it off until night time you might fall asleep...",
                "Absolutely. It's very accessible; I had little knowledge of any of the texts or Western philosophy prior to this semester, and I was able to keep up and learn a lot. This is a great chance to pick up a little bit about Eastern thought!",
                "Yes - the discussions and assignments were fun, the professor was very engaging, and I was glad to have gained a deeper understanding of the ancient Chinese tradition overall.",

                "The exposure you get to the ancient philosophical tradition in this class is really irreplaceable and under appreciated. The texts we read are engaging, imaginative, and make you think in ways you may not have before."
