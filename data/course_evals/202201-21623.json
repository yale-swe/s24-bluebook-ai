                "Honestly, if you're taking this course, you probably have to. It's one of the foundational building blocks for a lot of upper-level courses in engineering, physics, etc. That said, if you're deciding between this class and 225, and you're an engineering major, definitely take this course. It's much better than struggling through hours of proofs and nice to actually deal with numbers. However, the teaching and organization of this class were quite abysmal. Yariv is a sweet man who really is trying to explain linear algebra to us, but he just cannot. His explanations just didn't make much sense, and although he tried to keep us engaged, we just weren't comprehending enough to ask questions that would have helped us. The teaching staff also didn't give us a list of topics to study or a practice exam for the midterms. We were given a list of questions that \"do not necessarily closely mirror those on the exam.\" Furthermore, in regards to the sample solutions for these problems, it was noted that \"As these are \"sample\" solutions that I produced, it may contain typos, incorrect answers, and some incomplete explanations. (At some parts, I deliberately did so.)\" It was consistently frustrating to try and study for exams while knowing that the problems provided would not completely prepare us for the exam. Additionally, psets and practice problems were often posted late, less than a week before the deadline or exam. It felt like the 3 professors who were co-teaching did not know who was in charge and were just content to leave all planning up until the last minute when students were bugging them too much so they couldn't ignore it anymore. Thus, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this class to anyone, but you probably have to take it, so just mentally prepare yourself for frustration.",
                "I cannot in good conscience recommend this class to anyone else if they're not already familiar with the concepts or can put in the effort to learn everything on their own.",
                "i enjoyed the class. i think that the linear algebra problems were fun and prof. Aizenbud is super nice.",
                "I would recommend it if it's required for your major. In theory I appreciate the skills we learned, but it was a challenge for me."
