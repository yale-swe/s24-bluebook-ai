                "This course is not well taught. There are some great instructors, such as Professor Geiger, but the material is not presented in an intuitive or engaging way. If I had not taken Calculus before I am not confident I would have been able to pass the course. Thankfully, the main problem of the course would be easy to fix, if the course were given using the \"flipped\" classroom model. Under this model, instructors would record lectures online and assign them as homework along with the Problem Sets. Then, class time would be used specifically for addressing student questions about the material and problem sets.",
                "This course could be more engaging in class aside from just lecture notes and doing problems individually.",
                "Strengths: worksheets handed out at the beginning of class\r\nWeakness: pacing can feel fast sometimes",
                "Sections, especially with Eric, were great! I wouldn't say I liked how the grading for Problem Sets wasn't centralized. For some PSets, points were taken off for ridiculous things (e.g., not simplifying answers when we were told that simplification wasn't required). I had to email Eric to make sure those points weren't lost which was definitely a hassle. This course was good overall, though! It wasn't draining like some of the other classes I was taking this semester.",
                "Strength : good class notes weakness: need more in class questions",
                "The classes sometimes were not as efficient as they possibly could have been. Other than that, I thought the course was good.",
                "Strengths, alot of help to resources available to students. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses, could have more review sessions.",
                "I wouldn't say that there was any main weaknesses everything ran pretty smoothly. I would like to say that Professor Eric was very supportive and helpful the whole semester.",
                "I liked the guided notes! They were very helpful for me.",
                "The strength was that the professor was accessible in answering questions or clarifying. I think the pace of the class was manageable as well. However, at many times, the problem sets contained questions that weren't completely covered in class. Additionally, the due dates of certain problem sets were extremely stressful (for example, there was a problem set that was due the night before our second midterm on topics that weren't relevant for that midterm; this problem set in particular was a lengthly and difficult one, and as a result, I did not have much time to study for the midterm, leaving me to perform poorly).",
                "This course works very well when the graduate student teaching the section is engaged. Mr Geiger was very engaged, and I really appreciated that. However I can imagine that, without such a switched on teacher, the class could have been a lot more difficult to get through.",

                "Not really. Unless you are pursuing math or a degree requirement, I would stay away from this class. The material was presented in a confusing way under Geiger, and it was hard to learn in a lecture setting. Problem sets were unnecessarily hard given the subpar lessons in class, and more could've been learned under the various calculus teachers on Youtube.",

                "If you have to take a Calculus class for a major\/degree requirement, I would say Calculus I is not a bad choice at all. If you're looking for a QR credit, you might want to look for other, more \"gutty,\" classes because you do have to put in time and effort into the class if you want to do well. Eric was really awesome though. If you are going to take Calculus I, take it with Eric's section!",
