                "I read many great works of American literature including works by Whitman, Dickinson, Melville, and Toni Morrison among others. I learned how to write essays involving close reading, archival research, and critical analysis of literature.",
                "Close reading, composing an argument, engaging with literary criticism",
                "I have been able to develop my structural analytical skills as well as my poetry knowledge through this course.",
                "I learned about some common themes across American literature through textual deep dives",
                "Critical thinking, styles of American literature, how to discuss themes of belonging and identity",
                "I was able to develop a a stronger ability to close read and connect texts. I also learned a lot about the subtleties of writing and how to communicate an idea without having a rigid structure in my essays.",
                "From all the English courses that I've taken, I never had such a hard time answering this question as I'm struggling to truly define what I learned from this course. Our discussions were definitely insightful but I'm not sure if I've received any new skills from this course. I mainly just I implemented everything I learned from my other classes.",
                "Good understanding of the American canon. Books I would not have read on my own.",
                "I greatly developed my critical writing and reading skills."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course are that the Professor is able to prompt conversations and he engaged in the conversations as well. The weakness' of this course was the difficulty in knowing when an essay prompt would be released because files on canvas does not give notifications.",
                "I think the course had very good readings that were thought-provoking and allowed for great discussions. I also think the essay prompts gave opportunities to delve deeper into certain texts. I think one weakness of the course was that the feedback received was sometimes a little vague, and some of the in class discussions felt more like people stating an idea without really building off of others.",
                "I genuinely loved the people in the class and they made fascinating discussions about all the readings. But I was slightly disappointed in the instructor as Professor Caleb seemed to steer the class in his specific interpretations and there wasn't much space made for other analyses. I also wish our instructor provided more discussion about the intentions behind his reading choices as I struggled to find cohesion and intention behind the specific chronology of readings.",
                "Strengths: The seminar is done well, the choice of books is good, not great.\r\nWeaknesses: We dont go in depth at all into these extremely significant works in the English canon. We could easily have spoken about these books in more efficient ways, but we often gloss over symbolism and connections or just not acknowledge it altogether",
                "I think this course was strong throughout. The readings were interesting and the paper assignments were designed to allow students to develop valuable skills."

                "Necessary for English majors, so it was good enough. For non-English majors looking for a WR or Humanities-type class, Im sure they could find something more interesting, unless they are particularly partial to American Lit.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if you like to read and dissect literature. It is a great way to work on understanding the meaning behinf literary works, and prompts really good conversations beyond the text.",
                "Yes, if you have to take it or not! Specifically professor smith was a fantastic prof",
                "YES! It is great really surprised me how awesome it was.",
                "I was genuinely looking forward to taking this course and am slightly sad to say that the course did not live up to its potential. Although discussions about the American fantasy and consciousness were interesting, I would highly recommend other English majors to find a different instructor to fulfill their ENGL 127 credit. Maybe this course would have been more enlightening with a professor who allows discussions beyond his own interpretations and passages he finds significant.",
                "Honestly, its a very basic foundational course. It is what you expect it to be, so theres nothing out of the ordinary here. If you need it, take it. If youre in STEM or just taking it for fun, take a more engaging, eclectic course.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in American literature and wants to improve their reading and writing skills. I will caution students that the professor and syllabus will have a heavy impact on one's experience of the course, so choosing a section carefully is important."
