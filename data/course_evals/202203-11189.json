                "I think the one weakness of this class is that feedback can be unclear. I have received bad grades on assignments but been completely unsure of why.",
                "Strengths: not a crazy workload like my other Chinese courses up to this point; students very engaged; class time is discussion-based; loved all of the films we got to watch; lots of practice presenting\/ speaking in Chinese\r\nWeaknesses: not much practice handwriting characters",
                "It's a very well-taught course! The format is straightforward, with texts, movies, presentations, and exams. Presentations and such don't require memorizing the script, which is nice as that allows for more time learning\/writing, rather than brute memorization. The movies were entertaining and by the end of the semester, the class felt more like a tight-knit group of friends.",
                "A phenomenal course all around. Lighter on workload than prior years, especially compared to L1\/L2, but really fun.",
                "Strengths: Zhang Laoshi is wonderful and always excited about sharing knowledge of Chinese culture and history. The workload is definitely not too demanding -- it never feels like you're doing busy work, and Zhang Laoshi is always very clear about what material\/vocabulary are the most important to learn. Weaknesses: Sometimes it can feel like the work has been pared back *too* much -- there isn't very much built in in the way of assignments to make sure you stay on track. At the same time, some of the essays\/texts can be extremely long and every other word can seem unfamiliar, just because they're not written for Chinese learners but often excerpted from famous pieces of literature. So it's very easy to end up knowing the \"core\" vocabulary words by the end of each unit, but still not really understanding the text that you read. (Also, it seemed like every other unit was about pregnancy for some reason...)",
                "Strengths: Very diverse material and engaging assignments. \r\nWeaknesses: Pace was too fast - it didn't allow us to study the texts deeply"

                "Yes, for students who are interested in Chinese",
                "If you gotten this far in Chinese, I would definitely reccomend. The course is much easier than CHNS 151 and the preceding classes. Also the texts are a lot more authentic.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students who have completed and the first two L5 tracks in the Chinese series. This course is a great extension of those classes, with the same amount of learning but a lower volume of work required to be completed outside of class. This class creates an environment where you can dictate the amount you learn.",
                "Yes! If you're interested in furthering your Chinese studies, the L5 Chinese courses always don't disappoint. They're fun, low-pressure, everyone is interested in the culture and the language, it's a good time. The workload spread is a little bit uneven here and there, with much lighter\/heavier weeks, but it balances out fine. Prof Zhang is a very capable and engaging instructor as well!",
                "Absolutely, a great way to continue advancing skills in chinese",
                "Yes! It's a very pleasant course.",
                "Yes! It makes learning Chinese enjoyable and fun."
