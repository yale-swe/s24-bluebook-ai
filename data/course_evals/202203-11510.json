I learned that I could experiment with my writing and expand my perspective on how a paper \"should\" be structured. It is difficult to condense everything I learned about my identity and how I can position it in a future context but all of the lessons we learned about futurism in the context of marginalized communities were incredibly profound in shaping my understanding of who I am as a person. I also learned the necessary writing skills and tactics to get my paper started, which oftentimes was the most difficult stage of writing for me. I found the class extremely empowering in teaching me how to trust my abilities both as a writer and as an individual which I am very grateful for.",

It didn't become monotonous because we talked about such diverse topics, and we had fun activities. Perhaps there  could have been more direction on how to write the essays \/ what the expectations were, but I'm glad we spent as much time on the readings as we did.",

I really felt like a strong community was formed among us within only one semester and I will miss this course dearly. It had such a profound impact on how I view the world, our history, and current issues regarding social inequity."

                "I would highly recommend this course to another student at Yale College. Professor de Len is incredibly engaging, and the class promotes some very intense and important conversations about belonging that I feel were foundational to getting through my first semester. Additionally, the material you read in this course is very interesting and modern, making it much easier to ease into academic writing and discussion.",
                "Yes, this course teaches writing while making things fun and relevant to the real world.",
                "Absolutely. Other Futures introduced me to  breadth of subgenres within the idea of futurism, and while it tackled issues about science fiction and the ways media makes us frame and construct ideas of the future, each course reading was incredibly entwined with the present and the past of various marginalized groups. Honestly, one of the best classes I've taken, and I know I will carry on the ideas from those readings as I continue to interact with ideas of the future.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, it was engaging and fun. The course challenged me, but also made me excited to learn. The teacher was also super cool and obviously knowledgable.",
                "I would encourage any first year to take this course, especially if they are feeling nervous about their first semester and are unsure of how they'll perform in their classes. Professor Leon manages to craft an immensely loving and understanding space for his students which allowed our discussions to be extremely engaging but also extremely free. The topics we learn in the class are captivating and I will forever be grateful to walk away with a better understanding of how I can position my identity in the future. The workload is also very manageable and the bonds you can create with your classmates through the discussions that derive from this class should be cherished.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students, as it was very intellectually challenging in the best way and Prof de Leon was such an amazing instructor."
