   "comments": [
    "how to read closely and look for writing strategies, some writing strategies that good writers use and some experience implementing them in my own writing",
    "This class greatly improved my ability as a writer. Mostly, it helped me understand elements of great composition, and gave me a better handle on the macro concepts of good writing (i.e. things beyond the sentence level).\r\n\r\nHowever, the most important thing it taught me and my classmates was the fact that we actually can write. I at least had always been afraid, and thought everything I produced was trash. This class really gave me a confidence that if I apply myself I can also write well.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to learn how to write well without writing. So if that's one of your goals, I highly implore you to take this class.",
    "My writing skills were improved",
    "How to identify and imitate the \"moves\" that great essay writers execute in their work.",
    "Learning to write honestly and from a place of personal experience rather than strictly academic.",
    "The course was extremely helpful in improving my writing skills because we would read and analyze works of literary nonfiction and apply the same techniques in our writing. There were a total of five essay assignments that ranged from personal to more general themes so we were encouraged to explore styles that were out of our comfort zone. I think it is a great way to get a stronger command of your writing skills and am thankful for all the feedback Ive received.",
    "I became a lot better at developing new types of writing skills",
    "In my writing I have struggled with effectively communicating my ideas to my audience. I could write about my own perspective, but became frustrated when engaging with people who didn't already share my view. This class taught me several strategies in writing for manipulating the reader by setting up and or subverting expectations, use of a self ironic narrator, etc, many of which I hadn't consciously been aware of before.",
    "I learned how to write and read a modern essay just like how the course suggests. I learned grammar skilled, I learned how to phrase a sentence to make a point, I learned about writing style, different tricks to bring out meaning in a sentence, and literary devices.",
    "English 120 with Professor Shirkhani introduces you to a lot of great writers. I think one of the things I enjoyed most from this class was reading such great essays. In addition to this, the careful way Professor Shirkhani leads the discussion makes you read these pieces with an entire new level of depth -- she makes you see things you would have never thought of before, and afterwards you find yourself reading much more carefully. English 120 also greatly improves your writing. It gives you a lot of confidence, for you're trying out different genres and slowly finding\/building your own voice. It really asks that you do a lot of thinking, about how you write, but also about what you write about."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the assigned reading should be accompanied by a guiding question or a technique to look for. I also think the class should focus more on implementing the skills we identify - especially in the workshopping classes, this needs to be done much more explicitly",
    "This course is very well organised, and expectations are very clear. The readings are mostly brilliant and even moreso after one breaks them down and begins to understand how the author made it so.\r\n\r\nNo significant weaknesses, although sometimes it would be interesting to discuss parts of the writing beyond technique.",
    "Strengths -- the amount of feedback in this course is so helpful. Turning in a required draft a week ahead of time and receiving your professor's comments really strengthens your writing process. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- the discussion time feels way too short for the amount of essays we read. The seminar feels a little rushed and it was common to not even touch upon one or two essays.",
    "The strength of this course would be the detailed feedback we received from both our professor and our peers on many of the essays we had to write because they really helped clarify the ideas we learned during class and pinpointed the exact problem areas with my writing. I also really enjoyed the wide expanse of authors that we read and the different genres of literary nonfiction that we explored because it helped us delve into the essay as a form of writing and broke down the various components on how to make writing stronger.",
    "I think its probably a fine First Year course in that it shows you examples of writing and makes you practice writing. Additionally, the draft, revision structure is genuinely very helpful in that it allows students to incorporate feedback. For me, the biggest weakness of the course is that some students don't shut up and others never contribute anything. The conversations are mostly dull and unilluminating as a result. I really don't know how to fix this.",
    "The strengths of this class is that you get to read so many different essays from so many different authors and it helps you to figure out your own writing style. I think the only weakness of this course is that there's so much material that sometimes you can not discuss everything, but all the work is useful and interesting.",
    "This course is incredible. It's strengths were definitely the diversity of writing it exposes you to, and also the way Professor Shirkhani managed discussions. She was always very patient and organised, guiding us through the ideas she wanted us to explore, but never explicitly telling us what she wanted us to see, rather, letting us find it on our own.\r\nThe only thing I say can maybe be improved is that this course moves very, very fast."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! If you want to read great pieces by great writers and also work on your own writing.",
    "Absolutely. I took this course by accident, but I think this is one of the best courses for any undergraduate to take. Writing well and being able to frame one's ideas uniquely in a prose format is an incredibly useful skill.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, Professor Shirkhani is a great instructor. She knows the pieces like the back of hand, gives rich feedback (and lots of it) and is the most skilled teacher I have ever seen at directing a classroom discussion toward fruitful conversation (without being too heavy-handed).",
    "it's a great course if you love to read and want to improve your writing skills! Shirkhani is a great professor!",
    "If you enjoy writing seminars than you will really enjoy this class.",
    "Absolutely!! Especially with Professor Shirkhani! She's amazing and so so helpful. She really cares about her students and the feedback they receive.",
    "I most definitely became a better writer and have learned to write descriptively and read text through a lens of learning to improve my writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because it really helps improve your writing while simultaneously introducing you to the genre of literary nonfiction. The discussions we had in class were also quite thought provoking and informative and the professor definitely helped a lot in terms of feedback and explaining the material!",
    "Yes definitely take it",
    "English 120 can go either way depending on what you are looking for. If you want a class that will force you to write so that you can expand your portfolio of this kind of writing, it is pretty good and you will get good feedback. If you want to come away from a class with tangible knowledge gain, this one isn't a big hitter. The material you read is interesting from the perspective of writing techniques, but the content itself is rarely novel or interesting.",
    "Definitely. I believe that anyone who has any interest in essay writing or just creative writing should take this course.",
    "Yes. Absolutely, especially with Professor Shirkhani. You will grow so much as a reader and writer, and read so many cool essays and be introduced to so many incredible authors. The writing assignments really make you think deeply about the topic you're choosing to write about, and also how to best approach it. I found myself figuring out new things about myself and my interests as I wrote these essays."
