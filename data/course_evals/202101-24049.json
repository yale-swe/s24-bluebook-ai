It was great to have chances to talk to other students and the professor on a daily basis. It was a great class to interact with others, especially during remote learning.",

She was super understanding and receptive to feedback, and she always privately direct messaged us when we talked, giving us corrections about conjugations, vocab, grammar, etc. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: In the beginning, the class was a bit intimidating because the class was very speaking-heavy, but I quickly adjusted to it! Everyone makes mistakes and don't be shy about that. That's part of the learning process!",

                "I would for a normal semester in person.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint is about my Spanish placement.\r\n\r\nI am a freshman who was placed into Spanish II at the beginning of the semester. I emailed the department to ask if I could retake the exam to hopefully place into Spanish III. I believed that with my prior Spanish education and test scores, my entrance exam did not properly portray what I knew. The Spanish department declined, which I understood because of policy. However, after semester II, I was emailing my Spanish III professor about my upcoming section time, and based on my writing within the email, she requested that I take the exam again. I did so and was placed into Spanish IV.\r\n\r\nI would have been happy with any decision made about my placement; however, I do not believe that changing my level mid year was ideal for my Spanish education. Instead, if I would have been able to retake the exam initially, then I might have been able to take Spanish III and then IV.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I had a great experience with the class and was able to improve my Spanish.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The workload is very manageable, and all of the work you do feels very valuable. If you take the course seriously, you can emerge feeling fluent enough to speak to others in Spanish. Also, the professor was great and kind at all times. The cultural project presentation was the most fun assignment I have had at Yale. The classes themselves are very unique in that you have a chance to really converse with others in the class. This is something very unique to Spanish in my time at Yale. This class is very enjoyable and fair in grading and workload.",
