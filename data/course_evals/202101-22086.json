                "weakness could be that it is not very engaging but lectures are straight to the point and easy to remember",
                "Strength: The problem sets are not too difficult (although they didn't always line up with the lecture), the professor is nice, and the network projects at the end of the course are interesting and a nice opportunity for collaboration with peers. \r\nWeaknesses: If something was confusing going to TA office hours was not that helpful. You are kind of on your own. The midterm grading was also changed after graded had been posted which was very frustrating too.",
                "fun and well taught",
                "Strengths: Recorded lecture made it easy to not attend class and go at your own pace (which was nice for flexibility), Professor was super nice from the times I interacted with him, math was not too difficult but took some effort, final project was easy, we were allowed to resubmit Psets as many times until they were due which helped me understand how to actually do the problem correctly, good QR credit for people who aren't great at math.\r\nWeaknesses: TA's were nice but usually hard to reach via email (one TA helped me on a problem and gave me the wrong approach and then never answered whenever I said it was wrong and was looking to understand how to successfully accomplish the problem), course was super disconnected (the lecture material never seemed to coincide with assignments, which was the math on the slides and that's it)",
                "It is not very engaging or interactive. It could be more clear and more examples could be used. \r\nHowever, I like the format of doing the homework again if you are incorrect because it allows you to learn the right method without being penalised for previous attempts",
                "Strength-- super low workload \r\nWeakness-- still can't quite tell you what I learned",
                "strengths: low workload, attentive and responsive TA's\r\nweaknesses: little feedback, and sometimes the topics were not explained well",
                "Straightforward",
                "Great 6th/7th/8th course",

                "Good class",

                "This course was amazing in that I felt the instructors were truly empathetic towards the students and designed the course in such a way that I was focused on enjoying the material rather than overly worrying about my grades. The weekly PSET helped me apply the information that I learned and helped me to retain it, and the structure of the midterm and final meant that I really understood the key concepts of this course.",
                "The strength of this course is definitely the amount of support provided by the TAs and our professor.",
                "Strengths: course material is diverse. Material covers extremely important and relevant topics like probability theories and why certain outcomes exist in a rational setting. Instructor clearly knowledgeable. Problem sets were directly related to material. \r\nWeaknesses: Consistent errors or glitches associated with problem sets created through Google form answers. Had difficulty in following some assignments like Gephi.",
                "This course was very chill and easy. All our assignments are reasonable and doable. The final project was actually pretty fun to do.",
                "Strength - ease\r\nWeakness - material not that riveting",
                "I think this course has a lot of potential, as network analysis can be extremely useful and cool. The course was very organized, but it would've helped if assignment expectations (especially the final project) were more clear. Also, I would've liked if the class went more in depth on deeper network analysis, rather than some of the other applications we looked at in the later weeks.",
                "Strength is that homeworks and exams are fairly straight-forward. But there is somewhat of a gap between material taught in class and assignments.",
                "The problem sets were not too hard but its difficult to know if you are doing it right or not",

The lectures also went all over the place and weren't engaging enough to actually have people excited to come listen to them.
