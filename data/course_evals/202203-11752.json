The biggest thing you come away with is comfort debating investment opportunities and identifying bull\/bear cases. Also you learn about this all in in international context, which is really interesting, and you learn so much about emerging markets and how different business models are suited to fit them.",
                "By taking this course, I learned to think analytically about businesses in emerging markets such as India. I learned how to ask the right questions and how to perform due diligence.",
                "Learned how venture capital works, from the founding team of venture startups, raising capital, and deploying capital to startups. The use of case studies with real startups led to really great discussions where everyone learned a ton; I think as someone with basically no VC experience, it was just a great way to talk about tech in a low-stakes environment and learn a lot of new perspectives that I would not have thought about.",

We also had the opportunity to hear from industry professionals: investors and founders alike.",

                "Strengths: discussion based which was really helpful and Professor Ishan is really insightful and a great person to talk to. Weaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: Ishan is the best - so chill, smart, and interesting - he is always excited to be there and leads a great discussion; This class is very low stress and the workload is low - there are a few reading each week and a short response to the readings that facilitate the seminar discussion. This is a free flowing class, so if people are interested in a certain topic, you just need to voice that and the discussion will easily follow; everyone in the class was engaged, and asked really interesting questions and made great comments that added a lot to my experience; quick feedback for the most part and Ishan is very responsive and reasonable (with extensions and all) \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses honestly - such a good class.",
                "This was my favorite course Ive ever taken at Yale- I wouldnt change a thing!",
                "I really looked forward to discussion every week, Ishan creates an engaging, high energy environment that is unique to this material. I wish we had workshopped our final papers, or even presented them briefly, in class so that we could know what others were working on!",
                "I enjoyed how faithful the course was to the seminar classroom structure. While many came from different levels of experience in venture,  Ishan helped facilitate a productive environment that enabled us to thoughtfully engage with one another.",
                "Strengths - it is a course that I feel lucky to have offered at a liberal arts school, it allows students insight into investing\r\nWeaknesses - I think the course could benefit from a greater mix of levels of knowledge in the students (i.e. some who know a lot and have experience, some who do not; learning from more guest speakers might be nice as well!",
                "Strengths: you get to talk with a bunch of really smart people in the class about what you read -- Ishan is very knowledgeable on the venture capital space, he's been running it at Point72 for 6-7 years now. The deals are always super interesting because you go through what the bear\/bull cases for each of these companies are.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: at times, though, I felt like the discussions lagged at 'if we were hypothetically looking at Facebook 15 years ago, would you pass?' I feel like I came into the class wanting to learn more about what venture capitalists see in the founders that present companies to them, but at times, it still feels like the answer is 'you go with your guts and wish that luck is on your side.'",
                "Amazing course! Perhaps would have enjoyed more case studies and more feedback on written reading responses."

                "Definitely take this class! It is absolutely fantastic. You learn how to think about companies and assess investment opportunities. You learn about the venture capital deal process, the entrepreneurship landscape, international markets, and more. There are some great speakers who come to class, and every class is super interesting. You also look at company pitch decks and debate the company \/ if you would invest in it, which is a great experience and you learn so much. The class itself is very low-workload but an incredible experience.",
                "Yes, if a student is interested in learning about venture capital.",
                "Definitely take this class if you are interested in venture capital (either being a VC, GP, or founder). It helps you understand how a VC is thinking, and you are learning from a VC (Ishan is at Point72).",
                "If youre at all interested in venture capital (specifically in emerging markets investing)- take this class. Ishans firsthand knowledge was invaluable to helping me understand the industry better, and we got to read a number of fascinating articles and hear from founders and investors about their own experiences.",
                "Yes! Amazing class!!",

                "if they are interested in learning about investment and what investing in an emerging market entails, yes!",
                "Overall, this is a great seminar. I still walk away fascinated by some of the companies in emerging markets like wow, there are people like this in the world. I really like the book that we followed in the beginning (Out Innovate). I think it really set the tone for the beginning of the class knowing that we were going to learn about startups and venture capitalists that defied the Silicon Valley stereotype. My classmates and I probably agree that the deck discussions (where Ishan shares real-time decks\/deals) are the most engaging and interesting. At times, I felt like the discussions lagged at 'if we were hypothetically looking at Facebook 15 years ago, would you pass?' I feel like I came into the class wanting to learn more about what early stage investors saw in now-unicorn companies, however, from taking the class, it seems like  'you go with your guts and wish that luck is on your side' is still the answer. However, what I have learned is that there are some metrics and guidelines to follow: management, unit economics, moats, etc.",
