                "Good lectures, harry is a good explainer. I think there is a decent amount of material that isn't covered in the lectures though which is a bit annoying since not all the material in the textbook is relevant either.\r\nThe TA's are fantastic, but I just generally dislike classes where there's such a strong culture of going to office hours to get a ton of help and\/or answers for the pset. Don't think there's an easy solution, but just something that bothers me because this feels like an issue at some point in the learning process",
                "Strength: I feel like this kinda stuff is useful so I was glad to learn it\r\nWeakness: I wasn't used to writing up proofs for things(even though the proofs we did were basic) or doing at math from such an abstract standpoint at times so it was hard to keep up a lot of the times",
                "Strengths: kind professor who cares about students' learning. course was structured well-- very clear how each topic built upon the last.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 9am online MW is just not the play.",
                "Great course! The professor clearly knows how to design a good course.",
                "Strengths: offered enough office hours, professor was readily available to help with material\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were confusing and did not go over enough nuance to prepare students for problem sets or exams",

                "Professor Zhou is just amazing. The only thing is that most of the answers to the problem sets can be found online, so I found my friends not actually engaging with the material. \r\n\r\nOffice Hours are vital for this class, everyone should be attending office hours. ALSO, attend class live if possible, it's way better.",

Through this way of learning, it is really easy to come to learn what you truly understand and what you need help with. Plus, with amazing peer tutors, it is very easy to get help beyond the professor's office hours.",
                "Lectures are very well taught and clear, and the TAs and professor are always kind and willing to help. A lot of support is offered during office hours, which I greatly appreciate. I loved learning under Harryhe is an incredibly caring professor.\r\n\r\nI found exams to be very challenging, and I think this stemmed from not having enough practice problems. The practice midterms and finals were quite helpful, but I wish we could have been given more optional practice problems to work on (the practice problems in the textbook were very challenging).",

He is very helpful during office hours as well. For improvement, aside from the psets, there could potentially be additional assignments to practice the material.",
                "course covers interesting material at a very digestible pace.",
                "The only strength was the professor's lenient grading. He introduced multiple different grading options to favor students throughout the semester. The main weakness of this course was that the recorded lectures were extremely difficult to understand due to the professor's heavy accent.",
                "This course is extremely effective in making students, who may not be from a statistics\/math background, move rapidly from a superficial to thorough understanding of probability.  The strengths lie in the excellent organization of the course, in addition to Professor Zhou's wonderful lectures and attitude.  The slides provide a condensed version of the textbook for efficient review of material.  The problem sets address key concepts without necessitating extra experience with mathematical reasoning beyond the prerequisites and what is taught in lecture.  Professor Zhou's lectures are engaging and instrumental to the success of the course.  \r\nA large portion of the grade was left to the two exams, and I may have expected the weekly assignments to comprise a larger portion of the grade. However, I understand that this is how it's done in many S&DS and math courses at Yale, and the exams were definitely reasonable.",

If you're considering taking this course, it's probably because you want to learn probability theory while taking a course that is supposed to be slightly easier than S&DS 241. This course is not much easier than S&DS 241; in fact, all of our practice midterms were those from 241. So if you're taking this course and expecting something easier, you will be thoroughly disappointed. While it certainly is possible to get an A, you will have to work hard and score highly on tests to do so. With all this said, Harry is lenient on grading, as he introduced multiple different grading options throughout the semester to support students. The professor is nice, but unless you listen carefully, it is difficult to understand him at times because of his accent.",

Second, the goal of having this S&DS 240 course, in addition to 241, is definitely achieved - as a senior whose most recent experience in math was in high school, I was able to follow all stages of the course and perform well.",
