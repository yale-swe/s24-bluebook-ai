    "My professor was amazing and she always kept the class engaging. A weakness of this class is that some students were more behind than others, which sometimes slowed the class down.",
    "Weaknesses are that the course often moves too fast, however that is necessary to cover all the material. Strengths are that the course excels at ensuring students are comfortable speaking Spanish in a conversational setting.",
    "The material covered in the course packet was above an L2 level at times.  To add to this, the material on the final exam was not material that was covered well in class.  Be aware of this.  The class moves to fast!",
    "The strengths are the engagement of the course, and the relatively in depth learning of all the grammar. The week after spring break included too much grammar and vocabulary tho, all of which were new concepts.",
    "More time to digest material",
    "weaknesses: complex rubric and fast paste"

    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course! It is engaging and helped improve my Spanish skills.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in learning the language.  If you just want to get your language credit, take another language.  Unless you are rally good at languages, this will drop your GPA.  Other languages are less intense.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are at all interested in the Spanish language. I would also especially recommend Professor Alexandrov."
