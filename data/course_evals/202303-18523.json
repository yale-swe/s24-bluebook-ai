The course covered topics such as immigration, fear, activism, and the ways in which Central Americans have established themselves in the country. This class emphasizes Central American studies as an important field of study. Through readings of works by scholars like Zamora and Tenorio, among others, we delved deeper into the understanding of what it means to be Central American in the U.S. By the end of this course, I felt that I was contributing to a community, as the final project was designed for us to contribute to the community within the field of study."

                "I really liked the intimate setting of our class that made every meeting feel very welcoming and engaging. No class was ever the same.",

                "I fell in love with the content discussed in this course. I believe it is crucial as it provides a profound insight into the Central American experience. The professor's relaxed teaching style creates a comfortable environment, especially when addressing sensitive topics. However, I wish the class could be spread across two days each week to alleviate the stress associated with extensive reading and the draining nature of back-to-back classes. Adjusting the schedule could potentially allow for a more relaxed atmosphere, enabling students to analyze and contemplate the content more effectively."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This is a population that even within the understudied field of latinx studies goes unrecognized and generalized within academia, and as someone living in the US it is your responsibility to learn more about Central American Studies.",
                "Absolutely! Take the course regardless of what your major is. The topics are relevant and interesting.",
                "I wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone interested in Central American studies. It emphasizes the significance of understanding the unique identities within each country. If you're someone who enjoys exploring topics such as war, immigration, identity politics, and power dynamics, this class is tailored for you. It prompted me to consider the importance of other courses that delve into Central American studies as well.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to students interested in Central American studies and/or the topic of immigration. Professor Hidalgo does a wonderful job of organizing the class and is incredibly receptive to student feedback regarding its structure. I found the readings and the activities we engaged in within class to be extremely engaging as well."
