                "Interesting topics, thorough lectures. Although there is quite a bit of reading and idk if all of it is rlly necessary",
                "Strengths: interesting, very chill, low workload \r\nWeaknesses: very broad, sometimes I felt like I wasn't learning that much new specific information interesting, very chill, sometimes the workload was so low (only a midterm and final) that I didn't feel encouraged to learn the material well",
                "Strengths: Lecture quality, reading selection\r\nWeaknesses: Readings piled up towards the end of the year, limited opportunities for student engagement during lecture",
                "Strengths: pretty easy, but interesting content\r\nWeakness: can't really think of anything",
                "This was one of my favorite courses thus far and it is definitely worth taking if you can.",
                "Strengths: Kennedy! Course content is great and Kennedy is an awesome lecturer. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Depending on your discussion section, the discussion can be subpar.",
                "The problem with the course is that Prof Kennedy is super knowledgeable but it doesn't translate to you through his lectures. Almost all of the knowledge you get comes from the readings. The readings are massive (200-350 pages per week) and it's so hard to stay on top of them. I lasted about 2.5 months and then finally got behind and couldn't catch up. The class itself is basically just an incentive to do the readings which is ok I guess, as I would never have read these books without this class. My section was really good, I think better than others, so we had good conversations and reinforced key concepts.",
                "Great course for an overview of European history post 1500.",
                "Overall it was very good and I enjoyed the lectures and sections. Personally I thought there were too many readings so I wasn't able to get to them all.",
                "I thought it was organized well and strong in all aspects. I liked that the final paper requirement was dropped versus previous years, I feel like the exams were enough to get the content readily absorbed.",
                "Great lectures",
                "The lectures by Prof. Kennedy were very interesting. This course is considered a Yale staple, and I think I got all that I expected from it without notable weaknesses.",
                "Paul Kennedy is a fascinating lecturer and the material is super interesting. He frequently incorporates literature, art, and anecdote into lectures to keep them as spry as himself.  Result: Lectures are very enjoyable. I took this course with my suitemates and we hooked it up to our TV and watched together. Genuinely more entertaining than most sitcoms, if you enjoy history. Provides new perspective to European history. There's a lot of reading, but the final/midterm are based on big ideas, so many got by without exhausting the reading list.  I would cut out Howards War in European History. The other books all provide a certain flavor (Kennedy's pieces offer the necessary survey knowledge, and the other readings expand upon it). But that book was rather dull and added little to my understanding.",
                "The course is well structured and provides balance across various time periods.",
                "Not putting all the ROTC on the same section",
                "Strengths: lectures were quite interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: BEWARE, NOT an easy A. Many of the other course reviews come from ROTC students, and they have what is essentially a DIFFERENT VERSION of the course. To explain your course grade is determined entirely by your TA. If you get lucky and get an easy-going TA (very very few of them), you will have a good chance at an A/A-. Most TA's, however, are quite strict when grading the essay exams. The ROTC students have their OWN SECTIONS for ROTC students only, and these TA's are all SUPER EASYGOING. It's because this is a required class for the ROTC kids or something. But for the rest of us, this is NOT an easy A at all. Take the other reviews with a grain of salt.",
                "The lectures were engaging! Kennedy is a great lecturer and this is really a class worth taking if you can fit it in.",
                "I think Professor Kennedy and his treasure-trove of knowledge is one of the biggest strengths of this course. His ability to make connections and explain, with such detail, any event and connect economic and technological changes to these events is deeply interesting. However, I found that the biggest issue with this course is its method of 'teaching' the content to the students. While the learning is done through the readings, the lectures are used to include auxiliary details, and the discussion sections are used to further detail and connect the readings.",
                "Very good course, and I think it is structured and laid out very well. The course wants to cover a lot of different themes and ideas, and I think it manages to successfully interplay all of them very effectively. I think the instructions and guidance was clear and effective.",
                "This course was a fantastic way to learn about the military history of the west. It was well organized to help your learning, and the material was fascinating. \r\n\r\nThe real weakness was the absurd reading load occasionally as high as 150 pages for each lecture.",
                "Very monotonous lectures - Professor Kennedy is incredible and obviously and expert in his field, but very monotone lectures without much variation. Interesting material though.",
                "This course was very interesting but could be more engaging",
                "Professor Kennedy is fantastically charismatic. His lectures were great, albeit not as information dense as they could have been.\r\n\r\nThe readings were phenomenal. The diversity of views (from Boot to Kennedy himself) was super useful. But I think there was too much reading, which made it difficult to focus in on anything. Rarely was I caught up on the material. I think Boot, McNeill, and the Kennedy readings, plus the occasional Canvas supplement (On War was fascinating), were more than enough. Howard was good for the pre-class readings as well. I think if we had stuck to these readings it would have been more manageable.\r\n\r\nThen for the discussion sections, I think this was a fluke, but mine was a bit small. Only 4 people! That made things slow at times.",
                "Strength: covers a sweeping geographic and timescale in history; interesting readings; engaging professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: learning dependent on section; sporadic lecture topics and high reading load can leave student confused; not as much in depth analysis/critical thinking involved as I would have liked.",
                "The lecture material is innately interesting and Professor Kennedy is a fantastic lecturer. I felt like there was a lot of overlap between the readings, which were often onerous, so streamlining the assigned readings would have been helpful. Also, I didn't like that the vast majority of the final grade was based on two exams. Having a paper worth ~20-30% of the final grade could potentially be useful, especially because it would allow for more creative/nuanced analysis of the course material (which is simply impossible in a short exam essay).",
                "Strengths: Prof. Kennedy is awesome.  He is the archetype of a Yale history professor and makes the lectures engaging.  Course structure was well thought out with many people supporting.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes easy to forget readings but easy enough to get by without them."

You will have to decide for yourself it is what you want, but it might be worth a credit/d/fail if you can't put your full effort in.",

Kennedy is a thoughtful lecturer who will tries to expose everyone to the \"bigger picture\" of the things you learn from the readings, which I loved.",

If you want to listen to a charming British man talk about Picasso and B-52s in the same breath, this is your course. If you want to read about how Italian cities are designed to repel invaders, why it didn't matter that Britain lost the American Revolution, spend an hour or so on a colorful battle like Koniggratz or Tsushima,  or learn about the cannons and swords and atom bombs that changed the world -- this is your course!",

It's because this is a required class for the ROTC kids or something. But for the rest of us, this is NOT an easy A at all. Take the other reviews with a grain of salt.",
                "Yes, it is always interesting to listen to Professor Kennedy talk about military history. He has perfected his lectures such that they would always last exactly 50 minutes. This course could make a very interesting podcast as there are many insightful and broad topics that would help anyone understand the complexity of state powers.",
                "Yes! You should really take this class if you have any internet in Military History at all. It is one of the few survey history classes that Yale actually offers.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but would caution them that this course has a relative low level of engagement, at least when taught during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary learning from this course would be done by oneself through the readings, and this learning would be expounded upon mainly through the discussion sections.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would recommend that this student take another European history course before this course to provide better context to the events and factors discussed.",
                "Yes! I think this course is important for any incoming Yale student to take, because it really gets at a lot of different ideas and applications: politics, economics, morality and warfare. I think these ideas are highly motivating and important, and I think it would be a really great idea for any incoming Yale student to do!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. I am a military history fan, so am of course biased, but the material is fascinating, Kennedy is a delight, and the workload is in all honesty not particularly high. There is a lot of reading, so be aware of that, but other than that (and not all of it is strictly needed) the work is very low. Great way to learn a fascinating topic.",
                "If they are interested in European military history",
                "Yes I would it is very interesting and a lighter workload",
                "Yes 100% if Polly is the TA and Prof Kennedy is teaching",
                "Absolutely. It provides a lens of understanding of history that is just totally absent elsewhere. Professor Kennedy is doing fantastic work by keeping this intellectual strand alive at Yale.",
                "Yes",
                "Absolutely! Professor Kennedy is an amazing lecturer and if you are interested in the subject matter, there is a great deal of extra information in the readings. Polly was also an incredible TF, and her discussion sections took the class to another level. Be aware that the vast majority of the final grade comes from a midterm + final exam so there is little room for error correction as the class moves forward.",
                "Yes--just an enjoyable course.  Probably not the most challenging class you'll take in the history department, but satisfying all around.  Prof. Kennedy is great, the TAs are great, the information is entertaining.  Allow yourself to take a class that is actually enjoyable."
