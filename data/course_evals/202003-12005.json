                "Most literally, we covered Du Fu's lifetime in the 700s, reading his earliest poetry through the pieces he produced just before his death. Each week we also read a piece of literary criticism that wasn't always related to Tang Dynasty poetry and often reviewed older classical Chinese poetry and philosophy that influenced Tang culture and Du Fu's references. My familiarity with Du Fu and Chinese poetry increased significantly, but there's something about the course that makes it extremely niche and broadly applicable at the same time. Diving into the life and writings of one individual figure is a cool opportunity, but in reading about Du Fu's problems and path, I also feel like I gained some insight into my contemporary questions\/issues\/conflicts as well. Du Fu didn't provide any magical answers, but the course helped me improve critical thinking skills that could somehow be applied to Du Fu's life in the 700s as well as our own existence in the 2000s.",
                "I learned a lot about the Tang Dynasty and Du Fu--as might be suggested from the course title. I also learned how to analyze poetry from this particular period.\r\n\r\nMore importantly though, this course left me with a lot of ways of looking at the world. Du Fu broke the mold of poetry writing in a lot of ways, and he questions a lot about his own life and culture. The kinds of questions he asks are very fascinating: How should one leave behind a legacy? How does one react when your entire culture is falling apart before your eyes? What's the role of poetry and literature in a collapsing society? What does it mean to care for other people? And they're definitely questions that I've been thinking about.\r\n\r\nThe secondary readings are also fascinating--learning more about how form changes the way you understand something, how integral storytelling is, how someone might react when a culture is falling apart or torn apart, etc. These readings--or at least, most of them--felt a lot more applicable to everyday life than. most other courses I've taken.",
                "I gained the ability to read and analyze Du Fu in depth.",
                "Compared to some other poetry courses, this one taught me to delve deep into one poet's life. Examining the ways that his works change over time against the backdrop of his historical context was very interesting. Another big thing I learned was to relate ideas from secondary sources that don't necessarily directly correlate with the poems that we're reading, since there aren't that many sources that talk directly about Du Fu. Of course, since this is a writing credit, Prof. Bender provides a lot of really helpful worksheets on paragraph organization, thesis formation, close analysis of poetry, etc. as well as very detailed feedback on our 3 essays.",
                "Besides learning about the historical period rebellion within the Tang Dynasty, reading the poetry of the poet Du Fu during that time period and understanding how poetry itself plays into describing not only his personal life but reflects the larger struggles and structural shifts of the empire, you also learn about (Chinese and Western) philosophy and about literary theory and analysis of poetry in general, which are paired with a wide selection of Du Fu's poems that span his entire life. Not only do you start to get a sense of how to read ancient Chinese poetry, but you will tie it together with Western literary analysis\/philosophy and these combined can offer profound and fresh perspectives of looking at your own life."

                "Strengths: Du Fu just has the coolest story\/rise to prominence, and the juxtaposition of our learning about his life over Zoom in 2020 with his actual life in the 700s as a relatively obscure poet whose initial career goals didn't pan out is still crazy for me to wrap my mind around. He's a fascinating figure and poet to explore, and we were lucky to get to read his poems each week; Professor Bender is a Du Fu expert and also very good at elaborating on the significance of Du Fu's writing and the supplementary readings. The course was a seminar, but listening to him eloquently sum up the meaning or main points of a reading or poem after we all took a stab was usually the highlight of each class meeting for me. Weaknesses: I personally thought we had too many supplementary readings that took up reading time and valuable discussion time. I wished we could fully center our weekly assignments around poetry and maybe only include supplementary readings once in a while; struggled with the longer analysis of a poem in papers and wonder if there's any way to teach how to turn these close reading skills into written arguments earlier in the semester.",
                "Professor Bender is a great professor who's clearly thought a lot about these texts. His insight into poetry, writing, and life is really cool, and I enjoyed hearing him speak both during seminar and office hours. I can't think of any weaknesses. The workload was manageable for an upper-level humanities course, and I really enjoyed the course.",
                "This course was extremely engaging and the discussion boards were very insightful.",
                "Strengths: the course is one of the best organized I've taken at Yale so far, so while there are a fair amount of readings, it's very clear how we're supposed to connect them together. Every week, we read primary text (poems), background (other literary works, historical context), a secondary text (sets up an angle to approach the poetry from), and some biographical material. Prof. Bender is also very encouraging and knows how to lead a seminar discussion well when some students know more than others. \r\nWeakness: There's so much good material to cover (and people have lots to say about it!) so sometimes it feels like we don't have enough time to talk about everything. And Prof. Bender never wants to cut anyone off, so at the end we've occasionally squished an entire poem into the last 10 minutes. Overall, this is not a big deal and Prof. Bender is very aware of his limits in time management.",
                "Weekly discussions allowed fellow students to lay out their understanding of the texts, their individual insights, as well as pose any questions about things they didn't understand to the rest of the class, which was very helpful and also gave much needed relief to know that you didn't have to understand everything at first glance (which will happen, because a lot of the supplementary readings are extremely complex while also being extremely compelling). As someone who loves reading about literary theory (discovered, really, from this class!) , I personally really liked the discussion of the secondary readings because of how applicable they were to one's own life and how they connected a figure like Du Fu to the present. If this class could be longer we would really get room for both the readings of Du Fu's poetry and the secondary readings, although it's understandable that extending time could make it fatiguing - but definitely filled with material worth talking about."

Honestly, I would like it during a normal in-person seminar, but even more for virtual sessions. I also liked that Prof. Bender stayed on the zoom session afterward for questions, just like a professor would normally do in the classroom setting.",
                "I thought this class did a great job in the way it was geared toward the pandemic. We were given a break in the class to prevent Zoom fatigue, and for a virtual seminar over Zoom it went as well as it could be. Prof. Bender pays close attention to the class to see who wants to speak, prompts them, and gives chances for people to jump in, as well as giving us ample time to share our thoughts. So I really think it was tailored towards online discussion."

                "Yes. Being able to take a class like this is one of the reasons you came to Yale. \"Nobody knows the use of the useless\" is a line from the Zhuangzi we went over during the semester, and I think it applies to the course in general. Studying Du Fu, a figure from a very different world 1300 years ago, may seem irrelevant, but you'll be surprised at how much you can gain from studying one person's writing and life through a magnifying glass. This was the class I looked forward to attending most each week. The poetry was fun to read, and being transported to the 700s for a couple hours each week was an unexpected treat during our fall COVID semester.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, especially those who are able to read and understand Mandarin Chinese. The class was always super engaging and I had a lot of fun every week discussing the readings, which even though were sometimes dense and difficult always provided a lot of room for discussion and thought.",
                "Yes! If you're at all interested in thinking about what it means to be moral in a collapsing society and\/or what the value of literature is and\/or what it means to live a meaningful life, this is definitely a fun course that tackles all of those questions through a lens that will likely be very different from one you're familiar with. I took this for my HUMS credit with no prior knowledge of China (outside of newspaper articles), and I really enjoyed the course.",
                "I would recommend this course!",
                "Take it! Prof. Bender has some great insights into the poetry, and the class is fun and encouraging, even for people who don't know that much about Classical Chinese poetry. Yes, it's a writing credit, so there are 3 essays, but each essay is pretty open to interpretation and Bender is always happy to talk with students about their ideas. I think it also brings up relevant questions about how we live our lives today, despite being about poetry from hundreds of years ago.",
                "Highly, highly recommend. Not only for people interested in the topic of ancient Chinese poetry\/history and\/or the figure of Du Fu himself, but for anyone who is looking for a class to be, at its core, transformative. This class uses a combination of different disciplines to approach and contextualize Du Fu's poetic journey, but for me, I couldn't help notice the universality of some of the topics\/emotions we talked about and how they presented themselves in my own life. This class will introduce you to a new way of moving through and thinking about life, and connect you to someone who lived in a circumstance\/time period worlds apart from you, through the power of poetry."
