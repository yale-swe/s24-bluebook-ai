                "I gained a lot of reading skills and became better at close textual analysis",
                "Shakespeare is nice because he can explore very deep questions about human nature even in very light theatrical moments\/dialogue. We read 10 plays covering Shakespeare's career from Richard III to The Tempest and gained a solid understanding of these \"Shakespearean questions\" and how Shakespeare illuminates them through his amazing language. As the title of the class suggests, we focused on the political questions (e.g., the nature of power, virtue, duty, honor) in class, but many other questions were discussed as well (e.g., Nature, thoughts, action). The in-class sessions were mostly lecture but I still developed my close reading skills while reading the plays and writing my papers.",

It didn't feel like a seminar, which is what I was hoping for.",
                "Excellent Course, no complaints.",
                "Professor Bromwich has a lot to say about the plays. He is knowledgeable and funny. He does make an effort to include student participation in the lecture but I felt that he fostered a somewhat competitive\/judgemental environment in the seminar where it was difficult to speak up if you didn't have a strong background in Shakespeare\/philosophy\/history.",
                "This class was phenomenal. I recommend it to all. \r\nDiscussion about characters like Falstaff and Barnardine was especially memorable.",
                "I really enjoyed the class discussion",
                "Strengths: Bromwich has been teaching this class for years and is super knowledgeable on the topic. Shakespeare is all about his extraordinary language and his ability to write from the perspective and in the style of such diverse characters. In this class, you gain a lot of exposure to his use of language and should be able to trace the evolution of his writing from the start to end of his career, which was very interesting.\r\n\"Weaknesses\": This is not a class that chiefly does close reading. At the beginning of the semester, he said something along the lines of: there are many valid interpretations of Shakespeare, but there are also wrong interpretations. So don't be too surprised if he straight-up rejects an interpretation you propose in class--as he sometime does (nicely). But I think this frames the discussions on the plays in a more structured way that illuminates the interesting \"Shakespearean questions\" and you get to know Shakespeare as a writer\/thinker\/intellectual rather than as \"Shakespeare,\" the works.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bromwich is very intelligent and holds us to very high standards. I appreciated that he wanted us to be highly specific in our comments in class and would work with us until he understood just what we meant. I also appreciated that he always made himself available for meetings and office hours.\r\n\r\nWeakness: This course was billed as a seminar but was basically taught as a lecture. Our course was moved from a seminar room to a lecture hall. The first hour of class was simply a lecture; the second hour was class participation, but we all directed our comments to Bromwich as opposed to each other. He would respond to our comments individually and then allow the next question, meaning we hopped from topic to topic and did not have a naturally flowing discussion.",
                "This was a really interesting course, and strongly taught by Prof. Bromwich, who is an excellent lecturer and professor. One note is that it, though advertised as a seminar, was more often taught as a lecture followed by discussion."

                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in Shakespeare. Professor Bromwich has great insights into the plays (and he's one of just a few remaining \"public intellectuals\"). This class, though, feels more like a lecture than a seminar. Professor Bromwich stood at the front behind a podium and spoke for great lengths of time, only leaving us a few opportunities to contribute to the discussion. I would have preferred if it were more of a \"seminar\" feel.",
                "Definitely. Prof. Bromwich's knowledge of the texts is exemplary and he brings to life the materials. The facilitation of classroom discussion is extraordinary and he takes the time to include all views.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who loves Shakespeare and knows Professor Bromwich's teaching style.",
                "Yes. David Bromwich is fantastic and his feedback and essay analysis is awesome. \r\nI have not received as detailed feedback on papers from any other instructor. \r\nHis classes are entertaining and wide-ranging. \r\nHe really unlocked some of these plays for me.",
                "Yes. Bromwich is amazing.",
                "Yes it was very interesting",
                "If you want learn more about Shakespeare the writer, then you should take this class. Bromwich does an excellent job serving as you guide through Shakespeare's plays, highlighting the interesting questions\/language. Shakespeare explores so many questions in every play and has such diverse characters. So, you definitely need to come prepared to class (i.e., finished the plays and carefully thought about them on your own before class). Otherwise, you will be lost during class when Bromwich starts lecturing about all these different scenes and insights. That said, the readings aren't too bad (50-70 pages of poetry per week) and for \"major\" plays like Hamlet, King Lear, Macbeth, we spend two weeks per play so the class never felt rushed. The 2 longer papers took some time but they provide an opportunity to you expand on your own thoughts--which you don't really get in class--and Bromwich gives detailed feedback.",
                "I would recommend this class to a student interested in working with Bromwich or who is interested in hyper-specific political analysis of characters. I would not recommend this class to a student who wants a general introduction to Shakespeare or who reads with a specific eye for literary structure, beauty, or emotion. \r\n\r\nI would also only recommend this class to a student who likes learning the humanities through a lecture class format rather than a seminar format.",
                "Yes. Do note that the course has a heavy reading load, and can feel a lecture part of the time."
