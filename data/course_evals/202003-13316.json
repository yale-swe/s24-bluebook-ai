                "The readings for this class provide a fascinating cross-section of Chinese history and culture throughout the millenia, and the in-class discussion of them highlights their place not only within that history and culture but also within the canon of literary scholarship surrounding it. Connections are also drawn between works not just within one class but across the entire course, which creates at least the appearance of a comprehensive examination of the corpus of literature on the topic. Additionally, many of the readings are fantastic works of art in and of themselves, which drives engagement with in-class discussions.",

                "This class was great, no improvements",
                "Strengths: Professor Chang has great energy. She is always excited about the material, and her excitement is contagious. The poems are also beautifully written, and so many lessons can be learned from them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because the course covers hundreds of years of literary works, it is sometimes difficult to understand the chronology of the literary works.",
                "Very strong course. Something to add may have been a more guided approach to what we need to focus on in the readings.",
