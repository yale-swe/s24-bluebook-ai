You learn that the computational bases for things we often take for granted (visual perception, intuitive understanding of physics, tool use) are highly non-trivial, but not intractable from an experimental perspective.",
                "I learnt how to tackle burning questions in psychological research using a computational approach. I learnt about cutting edge computational models used to solve problems in vision science and how they work, and learnt how to discuss limitations of these models and ways they can be improved to better reflect real visual experience.",

It covered the history as well as the state of the art. It also gave students the research independence in the field, by having students compose weekly reading reflections, participate in dynamic discussions, and complete a term project."

                "Professor Ilker was a very patient, passionate and engaging lecturer who was great at sparking interesting discussions about cutting edge research in computational vision science. The weekly readings were well structured to allow us to expand our knowledge and build a foundational understanding of concepts in vision science such as intuitive physics so that we can discuss it in class.",
                "The course was overall very strong. The seminar style as well as the final project greatly facilitated student learning as well as student independence in the field.\r\n\r\nSince the seminar is small, and since both undergraduates and graduate students (some of whom are in the professor's lab) at times it felt that there was a very large imbalance in the ability of students to contribute and be a part of the discussion. Professor Yildirim was aware of this issue and worked to mitigate it, but it nonetheless persisted at times."
