Developing your own goals and ideas, communicating the steps you need to take, and understanding your expectations for the group and the group's expectations of you.",

                "This was an extraordinarily challenging thing to be doing in the pandemic because we spent most of the semester working individually, apart, unclear of what the robot actually was, how it operated, and most importantly what each person in the group was really doing. Prof. Kuc also took a very long time to share materials with us or really communicate with us what the robot was already capable of and how it operated and also what the real end goal was. When those things finally became apparent to us, we only had a month left and it was a scramble to get things done and working. I think being able to access all the code, documentation, photos, etc. right away at the start of the semester would have made all of our lives easier. In a year when we would be meeting in person and able to work side by side much of our issues would be non-issues.",
