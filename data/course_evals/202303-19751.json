                "I learned how to use different power tools (compound miter saw, bandsaw, drill press, router, etc.), and learned a little about different sculpture artists through guest lectures and Sae Jun's recommendations of artists to look up.",
                "Wood tools and thinking of wood as a medium beyond the surface level.",
                "I learned basic wood working using tools at Yales woodshop and also about new ways of thinking about three dimensional art, especially contemporary art.",
                "I developed the entirely new skill of wood sculpture, in and out of the wood shop. This was also my first art course at Yale, so I learned how to talk about my own art and others' art, as well as develop prompted art.",
                "This class was an excellent introduction into woodworking and contemporary sculpture. I learned skills relevant to working in the wood shop such as safety, how to clean up after yourself, and how to work many of the wood shop machinery such as the table saw, band saw, miter saw, drill press, sanders, planer, etc. I now feel comfortable using many of the tools in the wood shop, and I feel that I've learned a strong enough foundation to continue building on my woodworking skills even outside of the class. As a sculpture class, I feel that Sae Jun did a really great job teaching us and encouraging us to think about our work critically. We were encouraged to think about why we make the decisions we do, and how to craft a strong conceptual backing to our work. Sae Jun encouraged us to think critically about wood as a material and to think through our artistic decisions. This was my first sculpture class, and I feel that I have come out of the class feeling more confident about my own art making. Our critiques were excellent in teaching us how to talk about art, how to go about critiquing a piece of art, how to give good feedback, and how to receive feedback as an artist. Critique really taught me to engage with every aspect of a work and to actively think about the way we presented our works, and how our works might be interpreted.",

                "strength: hands-on making art! professor and ta were lovely and helpful!\r\nweakness: from a non-art perspective, the critiques were really long and time-consuming plus can be pretty intimidating",
                "Strengths: this was one of my favorite classes! It's great if you (like me) are scared of power tools, but still want to learn and get your hands dirty. Or if you already love woodworking and want studio time and conceptual inspiration. Sae Jun is great at making you feel prepared and safe, and is so supportive of whatever you want to make!\r\nWeaknesses: a **BIG** weakness was lack of safety training in terms of respiratory health. I had to learn on my own about the dangers of wood dust. Always wear a mask!! Also, don't leave clothes covered in wood dust lying around your dorm, and shower after being in the studio. While we covered physical safety really well, respiratory problems and development of wood allergies are probably the most dangerous part of woodworking, and were not covered in this class. To all future teachers of this class: MAKE THIS MANDATORY AND EMPHASIZED SAFETY TRAINING\r\n\r\nanother weakness was that none of the homework was posted on canvas, which made it difficult for me personally to keep track of. Critique days were long, but manageable. Felt like they were more for the art majors in the class.",
                "No complaints.",
                "The prompts were not very inspiring.",
                "Strengths: learning basic woodworking, being able to work with the instructor 1 on 1 to build you ideas\r\nWeaknesses: takes lots of time, not much guidance after first project",
                "I felt this class was paced very well and I was constantly engaged with a project, whether that was developing a concept or creating the sculpture. I also appreciated that we did not focus entirely on wood working skills or sculpture based conversations. When we discussed \"art\" it was always within whatever context we felt was necessary for a specific work or lesson. Critiques were usually engaging and I appreciated that everyone was encouraged to speak. The artist presentations did not add much to the class as I don't think many people took them seriously/did not benefit from the open ended-ness of the assignment. I also would have appreciated some brief instructor feedback for each sculpture.",
                "Strengths: Sae Jun is clearly extremely knowledgeable about the wood shop and all the tools and machinery available to us. I really felt that I was learning from someone who knew what they were doing in the wood shop, and as such, Sae Jun always gave good advice on how to build what you were conceptualizing and was keen to support you along the way. I appreciated the class's emphasis on safety and I think that that was really helpful and reassuring as a beginner. I found critique very rewarding for the class, and I think this class has had some of the best critiques I've had. Our longer class time meant that we could really spend an extended period of time critiquing people's work. Sae Jun placed a strong emphasize on thinking critically about all of your decisions and having a strong conceptual background to your work and I think this translated to strong work being produced in the class and lead to more fruitful and meaningful discussions. We experimented with different critique formats, for our first critique, the artist was able to speak, we did a blind reading for our second critique, and for our final review we did a blind reading for the first half, and during the second half the artist and the audience could ask questions. I think all of this was a really effective way to play with the critique format and make you think critically about the way your work is being perceived. Our TF, Rachel, from the MFA program was similarly wonderful. Like Sae Jun, they were also deeply knowledgable, incredibly helpful, and gave great feedback. Rachel also did a great job delivering important communication and information to us via email. As part of class, we did small presentations about our own work or on an artist we were interested in, and I thought it was a great way to see my classmate's work and learn about their artistic interests. I also really enjoyed the two artists talks we had and I found it really insightful. Weaknesses: there are no major glaring weaknesses but I do think this class could be a little time intensive depending on the work you're making, but I do think you get out what you put into it, and I do think it is manageable if you plan ahead. I really enjoy the prompts for the three major assignments we have, and I think they are engaging and thoughtful, but I do think it would be helpful if all three assignment sheets were passed out in the beginning of the semester just so we can start conceptualizing earlier. In a similar sense, I would appreciate it if the syllabus is a little more detailed.",
                "Independence was comfortable with aid available, the length of class felt fatiguing at times but perhaps this is unavoidable with crit."

                "I would highly recommend this course so students with and without wood sculpture experience. The class is well structured so new students learn skills quickly without others waiting for them to catch up. It is a huge privilege to have access to the woodshop at any skill level. Critiques were also diverse in structure and provided unique perspectives into the artists' work. When we did not have work days or crits, I really valued the opportunities to hear successful Yale graduates speaking about their own artwork.",
                "Yes, definitely! I think the class is rewarding to all students regardless of background, and would definitely recommend if you are art major or are interested in sculpture.",
                "I encourage students with frames of mind they are passionate about pressing to consider wood sculpture in this exploration."
