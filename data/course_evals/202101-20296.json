                "YES! You've probably heard the hype surrounding Yale and America, and I was skeptical myself of whether it would live up to the expectations. It certainly did. Prof G is a gem-- there is no professor at Yale like him. All he really cares about is his students: that they're learning, that they're having fun. This was abundantly clear. He fought with the administration for months to allow an in-person class (the famous Grove St Cemetary tour), and it was successful. This is a great indicator of what Yale and America is like. Work-wise, it's fine... there is definitely a lot of reading, but you can skim it and be fine. Also, the readings are pretty interesting. There's a super short paper at the beginning of the class, and a long one at the end (15-20 pgs), and some other fun assignments sprinkled in (like writing and performing a song!). Prof G is a lenient grader as long as you are putting in the effort. Also, don't be scared by the number of people trying to take the course, we had 2 sections this year. One of those must-take classes at Yale!",
                "u need to take this class simply to enjoy prof g's company, its more work than you might think - it's super fun but not a gut at all"
