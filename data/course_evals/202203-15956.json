                "How to complete a semester-long humanities research project",
                "Learned how to read literature (like how to think about it in the context of literary arguments) and write specifically about that literature. The course was an overview of 20th century Chinese literature, so we learned about many different authors, those author's historical contexts, and trends/themes of the 20th century 's different literary movements in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.",
                "A more complete understanding of modern Chinese history. This might seem counterintuitive for a literature course (not a history seminar), but I loved how reading literature chronologically each week from different periods, perspectives, and Taiwan/Hong Kong strengthened my grasp of China's last century. I had exposure to modern Chinese history before, but actually reading pieces (in translation) from the early 20th century (Qiu Jin, Liang Qichao, Lu Xun) all the way up to recently published 21st-century works (The Membranes, The Backstreets) helped me see how different historical events/ideas/movements emerged and developed. Gained an appreciation for Chinese literature and the recognition that politics and external circumstances shape literature. Improved literary analysis skills and research skills. Specifically, class taught me a lot about how to take a vague research interest and refine it  continually, with lots of feedback from peers and instructor  into a tight project.",
                "I realized that literature is a very good lens to view history through. Because Professor Borgonjon categorized the readings according to specific periods and/or specific themes, I was able to think about the works not only as works of writing by one person but also works of writing reflecting the sentiments of a specific group of people from specific times.\r\nIf I think about the concrete things I learned from this class, I guess I learned more about Chinese history, Chinese literature, and how to analyze creative writing. But I think that I gained a lot more than this concrete knowledge. I came out liking literature a lot more and understanding a little more why people write. I also became a lot more comfortable speaking out loud in a classroom setting as this class was discussion-based.",
                "As someone who has studied China for many years, this course was somehow my second time reading modern Chinese literature, and my first time in a course entirely dedicated to Chinese literature. I read authors whose names I've known for years but never their full works. And I learned that I'm decent at literary analysis, a form of analysis that has always been challenging for me."

                "Strengths:\r\n- Good class size\r\n- I enjoyed the discussion format, presentations, and final research project\r\n- I loved the selection of texts\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I think it could be useful to break up the seminar into two classes a week so that the first can focus on a presentation + one of the texts or themes and the second can ensure we get to the second text (although this would be difficult for commuting)",
                "This is a very strong course. Meeting twice a week (instead of once) would have made it better.",
                "Strengths: David was a great instructor  knowledgeable, enthusiastic, made the content feel approachable and engaging. There were so many opportunities to get feedback from him and benefit from personalized seminar instruction. By the end of the semester, I felt David really knew my research interests and motivations; solid variety of texts on syllabus, especially liked Membranes, Backstreets, and second half of semester; complete autonomy to pick a research topic and design a final paper/presentation project based on your interests; helpful context and the link between each class was conveyed very clearly to students  I felt very grounded the entire course, which doesnt always happen in seminars with different selected readings each week. Weaknesses: Discussion occasionally felt fragmented when we would try to tackle three different works in a session. Occasionally delayed one piece until the next week, which made the problem worse because people forget the plot by the next week and I thought it would have been best just to move on. I thought discussions definitely improved in the second half of semester when we were more likely to have one short novel to read for the week instead. The format of texts in certain periods are a constraint, but I would recommend more short novels and fewer short stories on the syllabus for a small weekly seminar like this; more of an emphasis on research and idea feedback rather than technical writing feedback (though this class was not advertised as a WR credit, so maybe thats unfair)",
                "I liked how the class had very clear expectations (listed in the syllabus). Also, I really appreciated the syllabus because it was so thorough and clear cut. I also appreciated that the final project was about a topic of our choice. Also, Professor Borgonjon emphasized multiple times that there were no stupid questions in our discussions, which I appreciated because I came in knowing nearly nothing about Chinese literature and therefore had many questions. It was cool that our class consisted of students with different levels of knowledge of Chinese history and Chinese literature, which I thought made for interesting discussions. Professor Borgonjon's engagement with all of us individually was also a huge strength. I think this was possible because of the small size of the class. \r\nAs for weaknesses, I honestly can't think of anything. I think I gained everything I can gain from a literature class.",
                "Strengths: The course material was very interesting. I really loved the play \"Under Shanghai Eaves\" and Ding Ling's \"Miss Sophie's Diary.\" The language in these works was so vivid, I could imagine them clearly. I still remember them and they were readings from the beginning of the semester. I also liked the multimedia references, as we got to watch some films some weeks.\r\nWeaknesses: I believe that some reading for historical context would have been beneficial. Some weeks the assigned readings/viewings were too much- I think the assigned reading + film for the week of October break was longer than the assigned reading for Thanksgiving break. Also, everyone should be more flexible in the post-COVID era, both instructors and students. However, I still feel burned by the reworking of the schedule in the last 4-5 weeks of class, as the changes really affected me and my ability to turn in final paper assignments on time. Lastly, I would have liked to read a full-length novel by a female writer in the last few weeks of class."

                "Yes, it was a great survey of Chinese literature that also went into an introduction of modern Chinese history and personal research interests.",
                "Yes absolutely! This has been my favorite course at Yale. The reading list is great and covers a wide breadth of different styles and topics, which made the discussions very engaging. David was an incredible instructor - he is very kind and listens to student feedback. His instruction is what made the course so enjoyable. As a STEM major, I was initially intimidated by the research paper, but David met monthly with each student to discuss our progress, which made it feel more manageable and helped us to create well-developed arguments. I was really proud of how the research paper went and how much my humanities skills developed through the class. Very highly recommend this course if David is still teaching it!",
                "Highly recommend if you like reading. A lot of the stories are really cool and you have the freedom to write a final paper about whatever interests you the most.",
                "Yes, I would recommend with David teaching. You dont need to have prior exposure to Chinese history, but I think a basic knowledge would help you get more out of the class. I didnt always love the shorter texts in the first half of the course, but enjoyed the literature a lot more in the second half. Plus, I think I got a lot better at thinking about research questions and how to mold them into concrete projects. We spent a lot of time developing an idea for research (pre-proposal, proposal, annotated bibliography), interrogating the root of that interest, and continually tweaking the idea as we narrowed it down. The research process actually felt like a conversation between David and other classmates  Ive had other instructors use that term before, but this class really made it feel like an accurate description.",
                "Yes! I came in knowing nothing about Modern Chinese Literature and left a little more knowledgeable and a lot more curious. It's also a pretty easy-going class with a lot of freedom to talk about whatever comes to mind. Discussion were always fun and I think it is very hard to feel lost in this course as the professor is so reachable and willing to help.",
                "I would recommend the course, especially if someone wants to study China's literary culture after the Opium Wars."
