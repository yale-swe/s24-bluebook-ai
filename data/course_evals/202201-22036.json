                "I gained a deep understanding of the British Empire and its impact on the world we live in today. Professor De and Professor Aziz built our ability to dissect primary sources, to hold historical complexities and contradictions, and to make new historiographical interventions. This is a class that I will keep with me for years to come.",
                "I learned about the global unmaking of the British Empire through the work of international, community-based, and local activism. We worked with a range of sources, from collections of newspapers to speeches to journal articles to books. I learned about how important it is to think about how people understood themselves and their relationship to the state or the empire; so many of the boundaries, constructs, or identities we assume today emerged out of empire, and it's important to understand how many alternative paths the world might have taken.",
                "I learned a tremendous amount about empire and decolonization, specifically in the anglosphere.",
                "This course was a great overview of the British Empire that certainly shouldn't be compared with other \"survey\" courses in terms of method and depth. I learned about the broad history of the British Empire, key milestones in its lifetime, but also changed the way I thought about Empire. We've been very used to thinking about empires in terms of rise and fall, or decolonisation as an event, but I've gained a deeper appreciation for global imperial history as a history of resistance and instability. The historiographical insights from this course are basically unbeatable.",
                "This course provided a broad intellectual history of the British empire and decolonization. It introduced major colonial and anticolonial figures from the 19th century to present-day, covering a wide range of historical developments in both British colonies and the metropole. Students were pushed to think critically with primary and secondary sources and were encouraged to think creatively with archival sources, marrying the use of film and media with scholarly writing.",
                "This was my first advanced history seminar, so I learned a lot about not only the subject material itself but also how to write discussion posts, participate thoughtfully, and write a research paper.",

                "An incredibly well-taught and well-crafted curriculum with rich classroom conversation and intellectually challenging readings.",
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed learning from Professor De and Professor Aziz together. They built a fascinating course and each brought interesting perspectives. The other students in the course, too, were engaged and had great points, so I always looked forward to class. The readings were well chosen, and they were careful to assign only the sections we needed to build the context for our discussion; they didn't assign unnecessary chapters, so you could really just focus on getting as much as you could out of what was assigned. Weaknesses: it would have been great to receive more feedback on our written assignments throughout the semester. I really appreciated the feedback we did receive and the chance to talk through ideas in office hours, and adding more written feedback is my only possible idea for how to improve the class.",
                "The strengths of this course were the professors. Professor Aziz and Professor De were both incredibly knowledgeable and fantastic at guiding the seminar discussion. They both offered a lot of helpful knowledge and wisdom during class, and were great at drawing out key parts of the readings. The readings were also a strength. I learned so much in a semester. The weaknesses were the communication with the class - I would have appreciated if the readings were sent out earlier in the week - and feedback on the assignments we submitted. Other than that, it was a great class! One of the best I've taken at Yale.",
                "The thematic approach to learning about British imperial history was excellent, but there were times where I wish that more contextual information (or maybe a super quick crash course/timeline at the beginning of the course) would have been helpful to situate us in various parts of the history. Some weeks did feel like knowledge was assumed, so it was a bit tough to follow the critical readings without quite knowing what events they were referencing. The student presentations at the start of class did help a lot, but in general they didn't necessarily always follow a fixed approach so the amount of contextual knowledge I received week on week in order to immerse myself in the discussion was variable.",
                "Strengths: syllabus was mostly structured around big ideas in the history of the Empire and it effectively contextualized many of the major liberal and postcolonial movements across various regions. I really enjoyed the multimedia reading / watching materials and the variety of assignments (film review, creative presentation, research paper) \r\nWeaknesses: we didn't receive any feedback on our assignments throughout the entire semester. I didn't find the reading responses to be a particularly educational exercise because they didn't receive feedback / typically weren't incorporated into class discussions.",
                "Professor De and Professor Aziz were the strength of this course. They clearly knew and cared a lot about the subject which they were teaching. They were both wonderful and I learned a lot from them. One weakness of the course is that you dont really get feedback on your work.",
                "Content was superb - readings could sometimes be very dense for one week.",
                "Strength: A varied selection of important, interesting texts, and great discussion leadership.\r\nWeakness: Not enough time spent on British colonies in West Africa or the West Indies."

It's so important to understand how we ended up with the institutions and constructs that govern the world today, and so much of that has to do with the making / unmaking of the British Empire. And Professor De and Professor Aziz are fantastic!",

Most of the readings are thought-provoking and employ a really interesting array of sources and research methods. The variety of assignments is fun, although the workload is heavy.",
