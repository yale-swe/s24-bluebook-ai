I definitely improved on some of the verb tenses that I was iffy on before. The work we did in the second half of the semester on translations was also really interesting, and the practice we did with it was really valuable. I feel a lot more confident with speaking and writing than I did at the beginning of the semester.",

I secondarily learned about Magical Realist literature and the themes with which this genre engages. By focusing mostly on the literature, this course made me feel like I could move beyond Italian as just a language to study, and into a language which I know well but need to refine in order to read more complex texts.",
                "Just a great course!! Improved pronunciation and comprehension in Italian by having a clear lens to analyze literature and film.",
                "Through this course, I learned a lot more about Italian literature and further developed my conversation skills through the use of breakout rooms. The topic of magical realism was really interesting, so it was great to explore that through literature and film viewings. The structure of the class allowed us to analyze text and films in smaller discussions, which was actually useful in becoming more comfortable with conversation. Moreover, I gained skills and experience in translation between Italian and other languages"

                "strengths- Sarah is an INCREDIBLE instructor, workload is higher in the beginning of the semester and lighter towards midterm season which was really well planned, literature and films were really interesting, combination of class discussion and breakout rooms during class time makes it easy to stay focused and engaged, homework was really helpful for practicing Italian, received clear feedback on assignments\r\nweaknesses- sometimes its kind of awkward to be in a breakout room with just one other student so I would have preferred having breakout rooms with larger groups, presentations can be anxiety inducing if social anxiety is something you struggle with but that is just an essential part of language classes",
                "This class was wonderful and set up well for student learning. I really liked the degree of creativity that we had on all of our assignments because it gave students a chance to explore areas of Italian literature and film. Overall, a great class!",
                "The projects for this course were very well designed, with a series of short reflections which exist to stimulate Italian practice and get your thoughts out there, and a final translation project which requires a more rigorous engagement with the language and its grammar. If I were to improve the course, I would want to study fewer texts, as while it was impressive how much breadth we got out of this course, the course worked best when we had a sustained engagement with one text or film, rather than jumping around too much."

                "I actually really liked the online format of this course, compared to some of my other seminars. Sarah made really good use of breakout rooms, which is super important for a discussion seminar.",
                "Sarah definitely made the most effort to make online classes great out of all of my professors this semester. I think breaking up class time with a combination of class discussion, breakout rooms, and individual class reflections was really effective and helped me stay focus during the hour and fifteen minute class. Also, organizing the course so that it has a heavier workload at the start of the semester really helped me get back into Italian after summer break, and it was really helpful to have a lighter workload in this class during a busy midterm season for other classes. I feel that the workload was really manageable, but effective in helping me improve my Italian.",

                "The frequent use of breakout rooms to facilitate interpersonal conversation was very effective in this course. Of all my courses, this one handled the pandemic situation the best, and needed to because of how difficult language instruction could be otherwise.",

                "100% yes. Or any course with Sarah. Even if you aren't trying to get your Italian certificate or major in it, I think it is a really interesting and fun class that is flexible enough so that you can incorporate your own interests for the projects and assignments.",

By the end of it, I felt very comfortable with my ability to translate and analyze complex works. I would recommend this to any student aiming to improve their Italian, but especially to the student who is similarly under-confident about their proficiency in the Italian language and wants to take their Italian a step further.",
