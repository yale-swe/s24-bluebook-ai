This is because there was a ton of reading to do for each class and never enough time for each person to comment on each piece, so what really happened was everyone would only read one assigned essay and prepare a response for it. So, there is never much insightful discussion.",

The discussions with the professor is also very effective for understanding how and why the essays work in a specific way to achieve specific goals.  There is so many long readings assigned for each class and sometimes it is hard to do them all with the same level of engagement. It would increase student engagement through less assigned readings so that students could come up with more detailed ideas and analysis for the readings and discussions would be more fruitful.",
                "I think the workload is fitting for a class like this. I like how most of the class is structured around reading other personal writing and discussing it. I really enjoyed that."

                "Yes, I would 100% recommend this course to any freshman coming in looking to knock out a writing credit. There is not too much reading, I have heard great things about multiple professors, the assigned essays are fun to read because they are very interesting, and the style of writing is your own so you can essentially write however you would like to, which is nice. There is a lot of writing between the rough and final revisions, but it is not bad at all because everything is based off personal experience and evidence and the essays are short.",

                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student especially if they are trying to improve their writing abilities while finding their own voice and style. The intellectual development is also an important component of this course because we are reading and analyzing many hard to read essays from successful essayists. However, it should be noted that there is an essay due almost every week so students thinking of taking this class should be ready to put in the time for that every week.",
