   "comments": [
    "I learned about how education has been a tool of U.S. empire. Education reflects the political agenda of those in power and works to socialize students into serving them.",
    "I learned so much in this course, the biggest takeaway is a critical view at education that helps you understand how education helps to control people and how knowledge is a form of conquest. We don't often consider but the very way we learn is a mechanism of Western hegemony and serves to reinstill certain values and ways of thinking.",
    "This has by far been the most transformative, engaging, and interesting class that I have taken at Yale. Prof. tbz delivers a clear and compelling argument for how imperialism has been used as a tool of capitalism in order to intentionally create an education system that maintains inequality and teaches submission. You learn the histories of the US setting up educational systems in Cuba, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, the south (for Black Americans) meant to assimilate, Americanize, and teach vocational education so that cheap labor could be produced. You learn about these systems still exist today in different forms. This class absolutely changed my view on many of the other topics that I had learned about at Yale. This is by far the best Education Studies course this university has to offer and should be taken by anyone who can get in. Prof TBZ is an incredibly professor, and is the only person who could teach this course in such an incredible fashion.",
    "I gained an understanding of our education system, the intentional nature of certain practices in our education.",
    "Giving history the respect it deserves and not accepting what has been told to you as truth because even that is subjective to who has the louder voice",
    "critical thinking thinking and appreciation for history",
    "i learned a lot about education itself. i think tzb made a really interesting point towards the beginning of the course that you tend to learn about certain subjects or types of pedagogy when you study education, but not education and its creation itself. this was a really fascinating class to learn about how the us education system was formed and wielded throughout history.",
    "Know so much more about US empire, imperialism and the connection to education. Learned how to think about complicity and action. Generally have a better framework to understand education and the world.",
    "I gained a valuable perspective on the use of education in the United States as a means of empire building. I also learned how the strategies towards this goal evolved over time.",
    "I learned about the role of academic disciplines and the education system in furthering empire's agenda such as through biological racism or through neoliberal mechanisms. We focused on Black education, Indigenous education, the education system in Puerto Rico as a U.S. territory as well as the education systems in different former colonies. We examined systems of power and discipline, \"multicultural\" education, studying abroad, and more. \r\n\r\nYale and other educational institutions that we have experience with were central to many of our discussions. We talked about how one might affect change within an institution and the implications of that. We tried to imagine a world beyond our current system and looked to alternative pedagogies that one might implement. \r\n\r\nWe learned a lot from each other in addition to the text. I learned to stop searching for answers all the time and how to become comfortable with not knowing and with being wrong and also the line between doing this to avoid being debilitated in order to actually take action  and passively accepting the state of the world. I learned to complicate the binaries in which we are trained to think and how to maintain hope in the middle of discussions that at times felt painfully depressing. These are just some of the skills and insights I acquired that I can know translate into any future seminar or setting that I might find myself in.",
    "An immense understanding of the structure of schooling throughout American history, the influence those schooling structures had on American colonies abroad,  and the ways in which education is a tool that provides both harm and hope.",
    "I feel like this class taught me how to think more deeply about education and to question the premises of the education system. We gained a strong foundation through learning about histories of imperial and colonial education and then examined aspects of education and empire more specifically, such as discipline, tourism, and the imperial university. More than anything, this class made me question my most fundamental assumptions about what \"good teaching\" looks like.",
    "This was an incredible class with an incredible professor - I learned so much about American imperialism, the racial projects of education, and potential avenues of resistance within the university.",
    "I learned how to detach myself from what I had been previously taught good academic writing is and let myself explore what freer, more authentic forms of writing can look like.",
    "I learned about the ways in which colonialism and imperialism have influenced education and the ways that education has been used to maintain standards set by colonialism. We explored the history of who got what types of education and why from Indian boarding schools to education being withheld from black people in America. We also explored what aspects of recent and modern schooling promote the narrative of white supremacy and colonization and what impact that has on students in those classrooms. There were a lot of different source materials that were great for seeing how these issues were interconnected between groups of people and the dynamics at play within a particular classroom, institution and on a more global scale. Throughout the class we posed the question of how can people resist the methods of colonization in schools and whether or not it was possible to change an existing school or create a school that didn't follow the same role that schooling has traditionally held.",
    "I learned histories of American imperialism in light of education and American education in light of imperialism (which was never taught to me elsewhere), analytical tools to view those histories and current events, how to be an ally, how to pursue justice and righteousness. Because of this class I am beginning to analyze my world in a different light."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course covered a lot of interesting material but it sometimes hard to make sense of everything. The discussion format definitely helped in the understanding, but sometimes certain readings would not be covered extensively due to the nature of the conversation. Overall it was a great course and the weaknesses were unavoidable given this was the first time the course was taught and also given the nature of the topics.",
    "No weaknesses! The strongest part of this course was that it actually built of community. Also it was so supportive of creative finals projects and that was truly liberating and pushed our learning further than a traditional essay would have done.",
    "Strengths: Prof. TBZ is the biggest strength. The readings are great (although there may be too many at times), the discussion was incredible. This is a must take\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think that Prof. tbz may have accepted too many people. Have about 20 people in the course instead of 24 would have made it easier to have discussions and get to know everyone.",
    "There are no weaknesses with this course.",
    "a smaller class size, but professor TZB took as many students so we could all enjoy it, which i admire and would not ask her to change because in the end it contributed to how beautiful a class it was",
    "maybe it was too big for a seminar.",
    "strengths: amazing syllabus, great class dynamic established by tzb, really cool to have a facebook group as a way to share a little less formally how other things we were seeing (tv shows, movies, news articles, etc) were relating to the course, flexible\r\nweaknesses: could've been better ordered\/organized in the beginning but the course was flexible enough that i don't think it became some big problem to switch things around, the pace of class discussions could be slowed down a bit to establish a baseline understanding of the readings more (was done a lot towards the latter half of the course, but not as much in the beginning)",
    "Open discussion, great readings, extremely supportive prof. Could be improved if it was a smaller size, perhaps, but also want as many students as possible to take this class.",
    "At some parts, I found the course to be vague, but overall it was great.",
    "This was a really strong course overall from the seminars to the discussion posts to the readings. In my opinion, one of the only weaknesses is the time restriction that many are under while still wanting to engage with optional readings that often offer the alternative pedagogies we are looking for in class. A potential solution for this is getting rid of background readings by assigning them to different student pairs for each week and having them give a 10 minute presentation or so at the end of the previous week's class to give the background for the upcoming reading to allow the optional texts to be in the syllabus. I think it could also be refreshing to include a couple more documentaries or podcasts scattered throughout like in Week 1 in order to offer an occasional break or something to supplement our very dense readings. \r\n\r\nAnother strength was our final projects allowing us to be creative in how we expressed our knowledge of the material, so I would have loved even more of that even though I also understand that we would have to do some writing as well since we couldn't get rid of papers entirely. I think the Facebook group served a similar purpose to this and was great towards the end of the semester. I wish we could have achieved that earlier but I also think realistically that would be difficult since there would be less material to connect things to. \r\n\r\nThe many opportunities for partner work was another strength of the course and tzb's teaching style. It was really helpful to learn how to co-write a paper and to have another person to bounce ideas off of and hear their approaches since it was otherwise easy to get stuck on certain ideas.",
    "The class was a bit disorganized at times with last-minute syllabus changes, but tzb was very understanding and accommodating and I believe that a second iteration of this course would likely run more smoothly. Also, the seminar was a bit too big, which made meaningful discussion and connections between students difficult.",
    "The reading selection was amazing and the assignments were super flexible.",
    "The strengths of the course was basically EVERYTHING, from the topics we touched on to the readings and the freedom we were given on assignments. The only weakness I can think about is that sometimes certain topics felt a bit rushed, we did learn and unpack a lot in just one semester and balancing how much history we learned with the more theoretical stuff was a bit bleh. I personally loved both parts of it though and am wondering what it would look like to have one course focusing on the history (and present) of education and empire and one focusing on theoretical stuff because everything is just so important to fully understand.",
    "Strengths: This class was really strong in that we were able to deeply engage with the things we were reading on a personal level and not just in an academic way. A lot of the reading included primary sources, research done by indigenous scholars, and the same histories or themes presented from a variety of different perspectives. Students also brought in a lot of their personal experiences which helped bring depth to the class. A lot of the things we talked about were things in history but it was extremely relevant to current day activities.\r\nThere was a lot of flexibility in the structure of written assignments so everyone was able to explore things that they were personally interested in and finding ways to connect it to the themes of the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I really don't have anything bad to say about this course. If anything, I wish there was slightly more overview\/resources for some of the definitions that were heavily used in the readings that aren't necessarily intuitive. A lot of the authors presented concepts that we did start to preview in the beginning of classes in the later half of the semester, but I think it would be helpful to do that throughout or have some of the key terms in the syllabus that we should focus on in readings that we may miss.",
    "Strengths: incredible readings, amazing professor, class that feels like family. The most special and sacred atmosphere of learning.\r\nWeaknesses: none."

   "comments": [
    "1000% recommend this course to anyone interested in flipping what you know about education and, honestly, global social order, on its head. This course taught me critically analyze (in a real way-- not in a buzzword-y way) aspects of interpersonal  interaction, education, travel, and nation-building in such a way that undermined what we all assume as normal. Not too much work, interesting papers with the chance to co-write them. A chance to work with Prof. Zemach-Bersin should never be missed.",
    "Yes! This course makes you think about education in so many new ways and it was extremely interesting.",
    "Yes!! Professor TZB is amazing and the course is dopeeeee",
    "Yes!! take this course!! Professor tzb is incredible and the content is life-changing!",
    "YES! Please take a class with Talya Zemach-Bersin. There are many professors at Yale but very, very few teachers. She's a teacher through and through.",
    "Absolutely. Take this course if you want to understand how American's imperialistic history impacted educational systems--and still does. This is an amazing course that will change how you view things for the rest of your time at college. Take this course, but only if you're willing to put in the time into the readings since that's the only way to get the most out of this course.",
    "I would.",
    "100000000000%",
    "yes, especially for stem students",
    "absolutely! i think anybody interested in working in education after college (especially seniors who get pulled into the strong TFA advertising) should take this course",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Everyone needs the information of this class and you won't find a better prof at Yale.",
    "Yes, Professor TZB is incredible.",
    "Yes! Yes! Yes! This is hands down the best class I have taken at Yale and extremely relevant to all regardless of whether you are interested in a field directly related to education in the future or not. It's critical for reflecting upon past educational experiences and being aware of empire's influence upon them and seeing the ways in which we are tools of empire in the present and to determine to what extent you are okay with reproducing certain technologies in the future and which ones you want to change and how.",
    "Absolutely! If you have the chance to take this course, do it!!! It will completely change your understanding of education and schooling both in American contexts and abroad. Prof ZB was so wonderful that I am now going to seek out all of her classes for the rest of my time at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in education. It will push you to rethink your preconceptions and examine where your assumptions about education originate. I think the readings and discussions are essential for anyone who hopes to impact education (in the classroom, in policy, or elsewhere) in the future. But, even if you aren't interested in education, I think this class would be interesting for most students, since we're all products of some education system. However, I would not recommend this class to students who aren't ready to be flexible or open-minded.",
    "This was one of the best courses I've ever taken in my 4 years at Yale - if you're at all interested in education, student organizing, or critical race theory you absolutely must take this course. I have never felt more recognized and inspired by a professor.",
    "Yes, if they want a course where theyre free to reflect and explore topics that truly interest them (and to explore themselves too), given that they are interested in what education and empire entails, this is the one for them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This is one of the best classes I have taken so far at Yale. It really intentionally works to unpack the systems that we operate in from both an academic level but also a real world perspective too. Yale is part of the systems that we discuss and that allows us to bring in our experiences or current events to our understanding of the concepts we tackle. This course is really great for anyone interested in pursing teaching because it shows ways bring more intentionality into the classroom and highlights the importance of restorative justice practices in schools. \r\nEven if you are vaguely interested in the contents of this course, it is definitely worth taking. It takes such an interesting and well rounded approach to the history of education with perspectives that are usually excluded from this sort of conversation.",
    "One hundred times over, YES! This is one of those rare classes that in your most jaded moments makes you understand \"ah, yes, this is why I\/someone else is paying a ridiculous amount of money for me to be here and learn at Yale.\" This class is hands down my favorite that I've taken at Yale. tzb is a diamond in the rough - I've never had a teacher, in college or K-12, that cared so deeply for both the subject matter and her students. This makes a world of difference - if the purpose of these classes is to help us as students learn and be empowered, tzb orients her pedagogy to do exactly that. She pushes us to do greater while being empathetic enough to be flexible to our situations and desires. She doesn't lower her standards though, and in her love for us continues to push us to be analytical and critical and hopeful. The readings are incredible and I'm planning on reading the ones I skipped or skimmed again (semesters are rough but now that I have more time I'm excited to go back into them). My classmates also made discussion lively - people were genuine and you knew they all cared a lot about the American education system and understanding how it's messed up and how we can make it better in our own little ways. I finished the semester feeling like I had gained a family."
