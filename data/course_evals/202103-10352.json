                "ENGL 128 definitely helped to crystallize my close reading skills and my ability to draw connections between texts that, at first glance, might be completely disconnected.",
                "I learned how to more deeply analyze texts, internally and exegetically. I also gained greater knowledge on the form and history of the \"novel\" and how postcolonial writers either challenged, appropriated, or rejected it.",
                "I learned how to better read and discuss works of literature from outside the Western canon.",
                "Learned about contextual history of texts and an understanding of what 'world literature' is. This was more focused at the beginning of the course and then fell away towards the end. Read and discussed several seminal novels, plays, poems, and memoirs from around the world. Learned how to write essays that expanded or contradicted scholarship on these texts, analysed them, and put them in conversation with artwork.",
                "This course helped me further develop literary interpretation and analysis skills as well as improve my writing. The assigned readings presented a diverse array of forms, topics, authors, and cultures which expanded my thinking about English literature within a global context.",
                "A survey of non-American literature written originally in English, as well as a conceptual framework for analyzing literature on a world scale. Intentional reading under the lens of many big questions- What makes something \"world\" literature? What might a text be trying to say, and how does the text go about saying it? How do transnational interactions and historical context influence our understanding of a novel?",
                "I learned how to do close readings and construct analytical essays."

                "While ENGL 128 had an extensive reading list, I did sometimes feel that we spent a bit too long in class discussions focused on single passages/excerpts, and thus were unable to engage with the works as fully as I might have liked.",
                "The main issue with 128 was the quality of discussion. I think Iheka relies on the students to really lead discussion themselves and bring their own things to the table so when that does not happen the discussion really falls flat.",
                "Professor Iheka always made helpful interventions in discussions, and maintained a consistent engagement with what \"world literature\" means throughout the course.",
                "Strengths:\r\n1. The professor Cajetan Iheka helped guide discussions very well and had brilliant insights to add\r\n2. Wide range of books from a variety of authors; well-chosen and curated syllabus with short stories and essays included to diversify reading\r\n3. Professor evidently cared deeply for the course and sent weekly inbox messages with reminders\r\n4. Clear and helpful guidance provided for all major assignments\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n1. Midterm assignment could have used more guidance for how to interpret a work of art from the YUAG",
                "The texts chosen for the course are very interesting, and input to discussions by the professor were always insightful. Class discussion would sometimes falter. I would have loved more opportunity to revise essays.",
                "Professor Iheka facilitated class discussions that were engaging, productive, and genuinely thought-provoking. These discussions were great for generating questions/ideas for writing assignments throughout the semester. There was also a day where the class toured the university art gallery in preparation for a writing assignment which was a fantastic experience.",
                "The seminar format necessitates a strong and active engagement with the course, which can be a strength or a weakness depending on who you are as a student and what you're looking for in a course. The papers each had a uniquely interesting prompt, it felt like I had the opportunity to try a new approach for each one. At the same time, receiving feedback on my writing with each paper also established a sort of continuity, that I felt like I could clearly find points to improve my work for each assignment.",
                "Overall, there wasnt a sufficient amount of time dedicated to each text. To improve the course, the list of books could be shortened so more time could be dedicated to discussing each one."

                "Yes, it was an awesome opportunity to be exposed to some really great works of literature that I otherwise would've never read. A great way to expand your thinking of literature to new terms!",
