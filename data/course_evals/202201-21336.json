                "The readings were fantastic and insightful and the lectures always went in depth and covered a variety of perspectives on the issues. In terms of improvement, as this is a joint PLSC CS class, I thought more could be done to encourage cross talk and collaboration between the students in each section. Other than that, fantastic course!",
                "The strengths were that they had two faculties from two disciplines, weakness was that the Polisci portion of the class was almost like a book review of our readings at times.",
                "The material of this course is very interesting and Professor Acorn does a really good job presenting in during lecture. The weakness is that it is co-taught with a section in computer science. The more technical lectures were really interesting, but there were some lectures where I wished that the class was separated by section so we could talk more about the political implications rather than the tech.",
                "I think that the grading wasn't ideal since the computer science and humanities sections were graded on the same scale. Apart from that, the many guest speakers made the course very enjoyable and memorable.",
                "The course was very superficial at times. The assignments did not require me to think very hard and did not require mastery of the material."
