    "How to typeset text, how to think critically about text and how its arrangement can convey emotions, express ideas, and tell a story.",
    "We did some typesetting exercises, presented research on different typefaces, kept a type journal, and created a chapbook, a poster, and a film translation. I learned how to typeset a book and honed my problem solving and technical skills.",
    "Wild that some people make it through 4 years of college never taking a class about font, am i right ladies?\r\n\r\nBut actually this class is a good continuation of graphic design and ways to think about visual elements. It was frustrating, at times, to spend so much time thinking about letter spacing and stuff that didn't feel so ~exciting~ but i really appreciated thinking about ways to express and idea using limited tools",
    "Rounded overview of Typography.",
    "I learned how to become a better designer and have gained better insight to spatial arrangements.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: consistent format, plenty of time to receive regular thorough feedback on work. Projects overlap so class is never just one thing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: critique is DULL. Alice is too nice. No one ever says what they really think. People happily chastise themselves in front of the class and love every second of it, only to take time away from meaningful discussion. Enjoyment depends heavily on other students. Also projects don't help you build a real portfolio LOL good luck actually getting a design internship.",
    "Some of the non-graded projects (or at least not-talked-about-in-class projects, like the dots thing) seemed unecessary. Like, we had to draw a lot of dots on a piece of paper. Unclear why.  Also, def kinda stressful not having a single grade. I'm writing this after the semester has ended and I literally have not received any feedback about my performance in the class. Grades are a social construct and I'm sure im not gonna fail but like... would be nice to have some more concrete feedback, especially since i've heard from prior students that alice is not the easiest grader",
    "This is a great course. You should absolutely take it whether or not you are in the major.",
    "If youre not proactive about getting feedback, we often run out of time and the class might not get to you in during crits. I wish there was a more structured way to receive feedback to make sure everyone gets what they need.",
    "Critiques are very thorough and thoughtful"

    "Yes, but don't expect a wild ride. You'll learn a lot and appreciate it in the end, but it may lose your interest in the middle. You'll never look at text the same again, however. Also you'll never look at Helvetica the same.",
    "Yes, this is a great class! Prof. Chung is a really kind and thoughtful instructor, and I learned a lot in the course.",
    "If you like intro graphic design, then yes. If you haven't taken intro graphic design, don't lie and say that you did because one kid did that then never showed up to class and he annoyed everyone and seems like he may have withdrawn on the last day?\r\n\r\nBut if you liked ART 132 and you think you'd like typography, go for it. It's also the only way to get an exclamation point on your transcript, which is cool!",
    "Yes. Alice is fantastic and this course is a great progression in the Graphic Design sequence, whether or not you are in the major.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes!! Amazing classa lot of work but so so worth it. Im not sure if I learned a ton about typography, but I really appreciate how the limitations Alice puts on our project really forces you to think more creatively and critically.",
    "Yes, because design is relevant everywhere"
