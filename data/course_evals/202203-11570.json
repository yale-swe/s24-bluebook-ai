                "The lab seemed a bit disorganized since it hadn't been taught in several years, but a strength of the course was that the instructor and TFs always adapted to any situation that arose and still made sure we were learning.",
                "The strengths is that this is a fun lab because they are all very hands on experiments. The weakness is that there was little to no guidance on how to do the actual labs. I ended up relying on my bench mates because I did not know how to do any of the experiments because the lab handout either wasn't clear, the TA wouldn't answer my questions, or there was no supplemental video to help guide you through the process. It was assumed that I already knew how to do everything, but this is a big oversight since there are no pre-recs for this lab, so you should assume that none of the students have worked in a lab before.",
                "I loved the professor, but the lab reports could get pretty long at times.",
                "overall I thought it was great. the lab reports were sometimes difficult to write but if you got started early enough you'd get a lot of help from prof hartman and the tf (mark, what a g). some of the material was complicated but again, always well explained and there were many resources to help you. the lab never actually lasted for four hours (yay) and the concepts were interesting and very relevant to the genetics lecture. I felt bad when prof hartman fell sick towards the end of the year and our last two labs basically got cancelled. would there be a way to have two professors so that not everything depends on one person? I felt like it was a lot for her to manage and that she could have used some extra help.",
                "Strength: this course is very focused on our learning and understanding of concepts.\r\nWeakness: I wish the course was more organized in terms of knowing when there will be and won't be quizzes."

                "Yes!",
                "Yes, especially if prof hartman is teaching it, she is the best and will answer any emails you send her. It does require some work to write up the lab reports and do the quizzes (I don't know why labs are half a credit instead of 1), but overall a great bio lab where you learn some really foundational techniques in the lab. definitely take it in congruence with the genetics lecture, it will give you a leg up in both classes.",
