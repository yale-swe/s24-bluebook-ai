                "The breakdown of assignments between exams, written p-sets and the presentation at the end of the course was helpful  the variety makes it easier to learn things. But I wish the grading had been slightly more evenly distributed (perhaps one more p-set, to balance out the exams?), and that the lectures had been slightly more interactive, given that it wasn't an especially big class (less than 20 students  a few more \"turn-and-talk\" discussions, or even a doodle poll every once in a while would have been helpful I think).",

                "Yes! It was so interesting learning about how the body functions both in humans and in other organisms. There are so many really cool topics taught in the class that will really make you think about how complex and interesting physiology is. It is also really interesting learning about how physiology is impacted by environment, as there are so many methods of adaptation that I never knew existed. If you are pre med, I would highly recommend this class as it puts into perspective classes like biochem and physics and shows you why they matter in a medical sense.",
                "Definitely would recommend this course! Professor Moyer is a great lecturer, and the course is very well-organized. Clear guidelines are laid out for each assignment, which I found very helpful."
