                "I learned more about Russian intonation, had practice using different conversational phrases, and improved my accent.",
                "This class helps students gain a better understanding of natural Russian speech and sounds. This helps both with speaking (using\/recreating natural speech) and with listening (recognizing natural speech\/sounds). Specific topics include intonation (when one's voice should rise\/fall and its different meanings), soft\/hard consonants, and sound reduction (when to shorten\/exclude sounds in written words). For each topic, we learned the theory and tips behind the topic, then developed it in ourselves by practicing through in-class and at-home speaking exercises.",
                "Pronunciation and oral communication skills - how to more naturally and effectively express myself in Russian.",
                "We worked on pronunciation and proper vowel reduction, especially in more casual speech. We also worked on listening skills and how to understand faster or more unclear speech.  We went through the different intonations in Russian and when to use them. We also did a lot of group work and conversation practice. Overall it was exactly as described in the syllabus.",
                "This class focused on two main concepts: intonation patterns and phonetics of the Russian language. I can now say that I have a rather strong grasp on soft\/hard consonants, my pronunciation of the dreaded  has greatly improved, and I can pose questions and respond to them with a much greater awareness of my speech patterns. I also learned some pretty niche, but also useful vocabulary along the way."

            "comments": [
                "This class was I think uniquely good at covering some areas of Russian that hadn't been taught in my previous classes. I had never worked on my accent before and had never really learned about intonation, so I think it really filled some gaps in my knowledge. However, I wish I had learned some more vocab because I felt like my vocab kind of deteriorated.",
                "Strengths\r\n- The homework assignments really logically follow what was covered in class; this is helpful for internalizing and practicing topics and skills.\r\n- Students receive lots of personalized feedback on pronunciation assignments for a more personalized and effective learning experience.\r\n- In-class discussion practice is varied in terms of form (matching\/sorting exercises, prompted discussion, guess-the-word games like the game Taboo, etc.) and in terms of topic (academia, language learning, westernization of Russian, etc).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- There is little focus\/support on learning new vocabulary (which is understandable because it's not the focus of the class).",
                "The individual feedback was extremely helpful, and I also really enjoyed the presentations at the end of the semester",
                "Strengths: this course was very unique in terms of the usual Russian course offerings and offered a lot of skills that are often overlooked. Overall I think I improved a lot and that everyone enjoyed the course and it was accessible and beneficial regardless of previous language level.  We also didn't just learn new rules or vocabulary, but new ways of practicing so we can continue to improve. The pedagogical methods were very diverse with many different types of exercises and it was very easy to submit oral assignments and receive feedback.\r\nWeakness: The only weakness is that it's Ilia's last semester teaching!",
                "Mostly all strengths here: Ilia brilliantly integrated technology into the classroom and brought in authentic materials to pair with some of the more grounded, textbook-based exercises. The topics that we did cover got their due diligence and the homework assignments were never really all that tedious. The absolute best aspect of the course was the audio transcription exercises: we'd watch YouTube or Instagram clips and try to parse out the words and phrases. I wish that we had done this in all of my introductory language courses, as this was a brilliant way to really work on aural comprehension and also to learn pronunciation patterns. The only thing I wish we had done was go through more of the Russian alphabet and more consonant clusters; there were some things that we never got to. I also wish we had perhaps discussed newscaster intonation or looked at some more authentic audio\/video of different accents."

                "Yes! This class was good for people who have taken a couple of L5 Russian classes\/are medium good conversationalists in Russian. Would not recommend if you are a native Russian speaker.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student who is relatively proficient\/fluent in conversational Russian. The course's focus is not on the content\/grammar of speech, but on the sounds of speech, so students should come in able to hold a conversation relatively well. The course provides an interesting and unique perspective on the language, leveraging linguistics concepts to teach sound formation and reduction. I really loved this course.",
                "Yes, definitely. It is an excellent opportunity to work on Russian pronunciation and conversational speech.",
                "Yes! Whoever teaches it, I think taking a course like this is beneficial and a unique opportunity as not a lot of universities offer courses specifically on oral communication",
                "Yes, but alas it will likely never be taught again in this form. It was very low-stress and the classroom was super friendly and frankly fun. We had a lot of laughs together and also learned a great deal to really focus on our pronunciation skills. If you're going to study phonetics with anyone, it should be Ilia. He's an expert!"
