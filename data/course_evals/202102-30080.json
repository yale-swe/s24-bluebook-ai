                "I learned a lot about the way that Earth's climate works, as well as a brief history of changes in Earth's climate over the course of the planet's history. I gained an appreciation for the complexity of Earth's climate, and it was also a good introduction to some geology.",
                "The course covered a wide range of topics ranging from causes of climate change to various feedback cycles, evidence for climate change, hypothesis and unresolved issues, and more. Overall it was a survey class on the climate and the various cycles that dictate the climate, as the course description states.",
                "I learned about climate change (the scientific aspects)",

                "Knowledge of the history of global climate change from tectonic timescales to the present",
                "I learned a lot of detailed knowledge about the methods of climate science and Earth's past climate, and a bit about our current climatic struggles.",
                "In this course I gained a good amount of knowledge on climate change which I had wanted to learn for time now due to its growing importance. Ive also become more confident in my social skills since the classes felt like an open discussion.",
                "I learned a lot more than I expected about the field of climatology as a whole. As a humanities student, I gained a lot of brand new knowledge about how our climate works, about the multidisciplinary way in which scientists study it, about the history of the Earth's climate system, about the ways through which we can infer information about that history and about the ways in which we can foresee some of the future climatic events we will go through."

            "comments": [
                "I think it was tough because of the online aspect, but the course was taught in a monotonous way. I had to actively force myself to pay attention in most classes, especially towards the end of the session.",
                "The course material is very interesting, but the lectures were a little dry. Professor Bolton is not the most engaging lecturer, and he often had trouble answering students' questions about topics directly described in the readings. Additionally, instead of leaving so much time per class for student questions, the lectures could have been longer and included more material.",
                "Strengths: the topic was incredibly interesting and did further my understanding of the climate system and its interactions. The readings were long, but not particularly hard since the textbook used is very accessible and written well, so it doesn't feel overwhelming. Ulla was a massive strength to the course; she was incredibly knowledgeable, helpful, and attentive to our understanding of the material. Breakout rooms with her were always engaging and interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: I dislike the lectures. Ed is a nice professor, but the constant nagging for questions quickly became tiring. I also hated how the issue of questions was hung over our heads with the participation grade. I think that Ulla did a good job of making the class engage in her breakout rooms; PowerPoint + guiding questions + what are your thoughts + what are your questions? I also found the grading to be very nitpicky and harsh at times. The lecture itself is also long and dense, and usually doesn't veer from the textbook; it would be interesting to hear the material from a different perspective.",
                "Prof. Bolton and Ulla were super helpful and willing to spend time answering questions. They were really great instructors and I enjoyed taking this course with them! I think the textbook was a little confusing to me at times.",
                "Its very lecture heavy but thats because it follows the textbook, so if you follow along every class with the textbook material, it should be easier.",
                "I think the professor could better engage the class by asking questions (rather than asking students to ask questions) and promoting discussion rather than lecturing for the entire class period. Could also help the professor grade students better on participation",
                "Strengths-- the textbook is good and follows the course very very closely, the sets were usually similar to content from the book. The exams were all open book, open note, open internet, so make of that what you will. \r\nWeaknesses-- the psets are not always clear; they usually ask you to summarize content from the book, but Ed is unhappy with you put in too much or too little detail and the line is not clear. The pace is generally fast, even for a summer course. The lectures are very long and quite dreary, especially since Ed complains several times a lecture about lack of participation.",
                "Strengths: interesting content, reasonable workload\r\nWeaknesses: the professor clearly cared about the class, but sometimes he could go off on tangents and ramble a bit when answering questions",
                "The strengths were the instructor and the amount of assignments - not too little but not overwhelming. The weakness was the length of each class which I felt was excessive.",
                "The fact that this course was recorded and we had access to previous lectures and all lecture materials very much facilitated learning, especially (I believe) for those of us not used to studying science. The lectures were focused on the most important aspects of the material, which was also helpful. The instructor and the TA were both knowledgeable and open to questions at all times. Their teaching styles were well-balanced and allowed us to learn effectively.\r\nI wish the course had a more descriptive and detailed syllabus. I came in expecting something very different and more basic than what I ended up learning. While I was glad for all the new information I ended up learning, it was not my initial goal to learn so much about the Earth's climate's history; I was more interested in learning about current climatic trends and how the carbon cycle is affecting and will affect the Earth's climate in the near future. This was only brought up during the last stretch of the course.\r\nThe textbook we used was helpful but, at times, it was a bit unclear or contained excessive information on unimportant subjects. I wish we had been given more direction as far as the reading goes, as I believe there was a bit of precious reading time wasted on parts of the book that were less important (or, at times, irrelevant) to the learning experience."

                "I learned a lot, but it was for distributional requirements. I didn't enjoy reading the book instead of being taught, but that was the way to success.",
                "Definitely! It's a very interesting introduction to climate science. Keep in mind that the first four weeks of the course deal with historical climate change (i.e. beginning of Earth's history to 2.75 million years ago), and we didn't get to human-caused climate change until the last two lectures. If you're looking to learn about climate policy, this isn't the class for you. But you will learn a lot of interesting things about the way that Earth works, and I found it really interesting.",
                "Maybe? I would say if you're very interested in the material or need a class to fill a Science credit that has a nice balance between true \"Science\" and \"Comprehension,\" take this course. The class does use some math, it does make you explain things very scientifically, but the class isn't that hard. Again, the grading can be random and the lectures can get frustrating, so maybe take that into account when choosing courses.",
                "Yes! I think climate change is a really important subject and this was a great way to learn more about it.",
                "Yes, it is great for learning about a very polarizing topic that is present today.",
                "Yes, I took this course to satisfy a Science requirement. I think this is a great course that offers incredible insight on climate change accessible to students from any academic background.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course for a student who is interested in climate change and looking into things a little more deeply. However, it is a lot of material to learn in just 5 weeks, so they should be prepared to do lots of reading and spend some time on the weekly problem sets.",
                "I wouldn't go strongly either way on this. The class is not about modern anthropomorphic climate change except for the last week or so. Get ready for a lot of \"over the last 2.85 million years\" and Pangaea stuff. The sets are fine once you get used to how they get graded, which is not very clear. The exams were all open book, open note, open internet, so make of that what you will.",
                "Yes; it's a great way of learning about the systems that contribute to climate change, especially for those with less experience or knowledge of the topic.",
                "I would. The lectures were a bit long at times and it could be easy for your attention to wander (being online doesn't help), but overall I was happy with the course. The professor clearly cared about the class and was knowledgeable about the subject matter, and the TA was excellent. The material was also really interesting, and I learned a lot. Although do note that this class is more a history of Earth's climate and an exploration of scientific methods for understanding past climates than an explanation of current for future climate crises -- it's more about the past than the present or future. Nevertheless, it gave me a great background knowledge of our past climates and the tools for understanding what will happen next. The workload was reasonable, and the grading was very fair: as long as you put in effort on the assignments and tests, it was not too hard to get a good grade.",
                "If they want to expand their insight in climate change and related topics, then yes.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are very interested in the field of climatology as a whole. I would not recommend it to students who are only really interested in learning about the current state of the climate system and man-made climate change. The course is a deep dive into the Earth's climate history and the ways in which our climate works and has worked as a whole. It is not too difficult, and the professor and TA were very helpful in making sure everyone was learning the material, but the course as a whole can be a LOT if you are not too invested in the material. If I am to be honest, I have to say it was a little boring for me at times, but that is only because I was expecting to spend more time discussing and learning about the current and future state of climate change; still, a solid amount of the information I ended up learning was actually very interesting. If you are interested in climatology as a whole and in learning how our climate works, you should absolutely take this course."
