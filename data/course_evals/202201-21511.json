                "I learned a lot about writing, different genres, what I enjoy, and if a story is moving somewhere.",
                "Practicing writing daily",
                "I learned how to do something every day and how to have self-discipline when it comes to writing. I think I learned a lot about how to write in different voices, write dialogue, and how to trust myself when writing.",
                "learned to write more carefully, specifically, and creatively",
                "I learned the process of daily writing, editing my work, and overcoming insecurities related to getting words on the page.",
                "This was the first creative writing class I have ever taken, and I really did not possess any writing skills outside of essay writing. This course, through the help of my tutor, challenged me to think about what it means to tell my stories honestly and truly make my readers feel something. I loved the short themes and how different all the prompts were. It was truly so much fun to write and see how my ideas came to life.",
                "I learned how to engage with a daily discipline of writing.",
                "I think my writing changed a lot - for me this was a setting in which I could experiment a lot without worrying if what I was writing was too crazy. No topic felt like it was off limits. That allowed me to test boundaries and go past what was good and then rein it in, and as a result I feel like I have a much better sense of where I am as a writer now and where I want to go.",
                "Daily themes is exactly what you signed up for: you're going to write 300 words a day whether you like it or not. So, you'll learn to write quickly. You'll learn to look around for inspiration instead of zombie-ing through your day. You'll learn to be comfortable with failure, and not to stop trying new things because you're afraid to fail.",
                "Through this course, I learned so much about my tendencies and habits as a writer, and how to both embrace them and break out of them. I also learned that I am capable of writing something new every single day, even if it is difficult!",
                "I learned how to write short things better, and how to write better dialogue.",
                "learned a lot about discipline, learned that writers block doesnt really exist, thought a lot about dialogue writing specifically",
                "How to be creative and take risks with my writing!",
                "From this course, I was able to build immunityactually tolerancefor terrible writing and to write without placing so much value judgment on my work. This is a great class to take if you want to develop a habit of writing every day without feeling the pressure of perfecting your pieces for grades.",
                "Writing 300 words of prose daily really helped me to develop and tune my voice as a writer.",
                "This may be a course about creative writing, but it is really an exercise in persistence. I learned how to push through writers block and trust my instincts, which has improved my writing in other classes, too.",
                "My writing improved tremendously by taking this course. The opportunity to work with such a lovely knowledgeable tutor was like nothing I've ever experienced before. This course is so individually catered to what you need, what type of writer you are, and what type of writer you want to be. I worked on my fiction and non fiction writing, stretched my creativity, and learned to push myself in my writing.",
                "I think I just got to focus on my writing as writing for a semester and that was very valuable.",
                "This class will absolutely make you a better writer. There is no comparison to how much you develop when writing everyday and working closely with a tutor. I learned how to effectively write short pieces and turn over a lot of writing quickly. Obviously, if you're looking to get better at longer pieces\/editing\/taking a lot of time with your writing it's not the right class!",
                "I learned about the style I like to write in.",
                "This course helped my writing tremendously. It is an absolutely amazing course. Its a lot of work and can be frustrating at times. But the opportunity to write everyday and make corrections and grow with a tutor one on one is amazing.",
                "Daily writing!",
                "Literally nothing",
                "Constantly writing and receiving weekly feedback was very important in developing a regimen, and also expanding word choice and creative phrasing.",
                "how to be a much more analytical and introspective writer. I have never spent this much time writing in a span of a few months in my entire life. Weekly feedback helped me grow as a reader of my own work and therefore as a writer too. Also the discipline to write so consistently was a huge step in my growth",
                "You get to build up a habit of daily writing. I'm not sure if I'll continue to write consistently now that the class is over, but knowing that I can do that is confidence-boosting. You also get to try out different writing styles and voices in your pieces, which helped me figure out how and what I like to write.",
                "More prolific writer, better technique in general",
                "I developed my creative writing skills.",
                "This is definitely one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale, as I'm sure many will say. The development of routine has been immeasurably helpful in many ways and I am so grateful for that opportunity. I also think my writing itself has improved greatly.",
                "Writing every day is great for you. I learned the limitations of my own writing, identified patterns and crutches, and tried out lots of styles I was unpracticed in.",
                "I developed a practice of writing every day and learned how to look critically at my creative writing on a small scale, where most other classes have helped me with more of a big-picture critique.",
                "This class taught me many stylistic and technical aspects of writing through the lectures. More than that, I felt that I learned a lot about my own writing process. I developed an increased awareness of my own patterns and pitfalls, and developed the skills to produce content regularly and without too many reservations. The course made me build on myself, getting increasingly comfortable writing the themes out of necessity without being too precious or cautious. It also forced me to be vulnerable as I covered a wide variety of topics, using writing as a way of processing my own thoughts and producing creative work.",
                "Writing",
                "Learning what it's like to sit down to write every day. Writing in the 300-word genre.",
                "A lot of personal growth! Writing everyday forces you to think very introspectively and get creative with it! I would say I grew more in a personal way than improvement as a writer, although it was certainly both.",
                "I learned a lot about my own writing by trying different styles and techniques and receiving regular feedback. I learned how to recognize and be more deliberate in what I am trying to say and how to show that to the reader.",
                "I developed a habitual practice in writing daily and improved my confidence in starting pieces. I also discovered a better understanding of my strengths and weaknesses in creative writing.",
                "The practice of writing every day is far and away the most important thing I took from this course.",
                "I learned that learning the skill of writing isn't like most academic learning. It's not about how much content you can learn. It's more like working outif you just sit down and write every day you simply improve automatically.",
                "Daily themes makes you write every weekday so naturally you develop your creative writing skills (fiction and nonfiction). Early in the semester I was nervous about writing each day and had a hard time committing to my ideas. But but he end I was much more adept at that and although it got tiring some weeks, I loved the development of the writing practice and hope to continue writing nearly every day",
                "I learned a lot about my own writing (and in turn, I think at least a little, learned more about myself and my thinking). In requiring consistency, this course really pushed me. It was often very hard (especially paired with writing I had to do with other classes and extracurriculars) and I felt drained by the end of each week. Just formulating something new to write 300 words about each weekday was creatively exhausting, and each theme would tend to take me a little longer to produce as the week went on. But even when it was a slog, I appreciated it, and I am really glad I took it. By the end of the semester, I also asked my tutor to comment more generally on my writing as a whole (weaknesses, habits, etc.), which I thought was very helpful. I looked forward to each week's tutorial, but discussions often focused on really micro, specific themes or parts of themes, so talking about my writing as a whole was a good way to round out the semester.",
                "Not only did I learn how to craft compelling one-pagers, but I also honed the process I used to write. Professor Oppenheimer did a great job at structuring this course, teaching us practical writing tips in lecture (covering the writing process of great writers, showing us research tips, covering how to craft a metaphor), then giving us the opportunity to directly apply this every day. I feel much for comfortable at the keyboard and more confident in my ability to write anything (a fundraising email, a love note to my crush, a party e-vite, whatever).",
                "Being comfortable submitting work that wasn't perfect, iterating on a skill over and over, working a creative muscle.",
                "Creative writing in small pieces of 300 words",
                "Routine and rigor in my writing habits. In depth analysis of my strengths and weaknesses in different styles of writing and how these interact. Discussion of voice, perspective, memory, large scale structure, publishing - the whole works. This was a fantastic class.",
                "This class taught me to write better, remain disciplined, and explore a new type of writing. It also forced me to think creatively and stretch myself beyond my normal writing capabilities.",
                "I learned to maintain a consistent writing habit. The course also really helped me expand into other genres and styles of writing."

                "strengths is the tutorlove Jen!! clear feedback \r\n\r\nweakness  lectures were fun but kind of a waste of time, didn't really learn anything. also by like week 6, writing becomes kinda tedious, wish we would switch up the length\/routine",
                "The themes got progressively less cohesive as the course went on. Also, I think the course could be much, much better if it diversified the lecture content (especially with regards to the cultural references) and the x-themes, which often seemed to look for a very specific type of writing style and tone. \r\n\r\nTutors are by far the highlight of the course.",
                "The strength of this course lies in the writing tutors and the intensive work you get to do with them. The weakness relates to the weekly lectures, which I often found to be boring and not well linked to the weekly writing.",
                "The strengths of this course were certainly my tutor and how fun the class was. I truly looked forward to going to all the lectures, getting to read X-themes from my classmates, and meet with my tutor. I felt like sometimes the lectures in class didn't really hit home, but for the most part, I actually took the lessons into consideration as I moved through my themes for the week.",
                "This course is excellent.",
                "Strengths: you write every day for the duration of the class, which teaches you a lot about yourself. Individual attention from a tutor is a special opportunity and makes the class.\r\nWeaknesses: lecture wasn't all that engaging and felt a little scattered.",
                "Daily Themes is all about the student-tutor relationship, and that's a total roll of the dice. Hopefully you'll build up a good rapport with your tutor. My tutor and I got along well. I didn't think he gave me too much writing advice, to be honest. More what he liked and he didn't. But you get better through continued practice.",
                "I felt like this course had no real weaknesses, except that much or your experience depends on your relationship with your tutor. There are so many strengths: having a one on one relationship with a writing tutor who really gets to know your writing style, the lectures that were great and not stressful (I found I could just sit back and listen), and the fact that you get 5 skips for the semester is super helpful.",
                "I loved this course! It was a really in depth look into the intricacies of my writing and had concrete feedback every week. The weekly tutorials were an amazing class structure.",
                "The course is very well taught. I have no suggestions for improvement.",
                "Strengths  everyday writing. While the lectures were entertaining, thats the core of this course. I also really enjoyed the one on one tutor meetings \r\nWeaknesses wished there had been a wider range of readings in the lectures",
                "I didnt love the way lectures were structured around reading examples of writing. But Prof Oppenheimer is very entertaining and a good lecturer!",
                "Strengths: you always knew what you were going to do (no surprises) and you had the potential to form a close relationship with your tutor. No weaknesses, though I wish I had more interaction with Oppenheimer!",
                "Strength: getting individual attention from the tutors and specific feedback on our work! It's a great source of validation and relief in knowing that you are being seen on the page beyond your participation in a 100-student lecture\r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes the lectures weren't entirely helpful and the X-themes made me slightly self-conscious about my own work (but that might just be something personal)",
                "the individual feedback and consistent writing habits one develops",
                "Much of what a student gets out of Daily Themes rides on their relationship with their tutor. I was lucky to be assigned to a tutor whose feedback I really enjoyed.",
                "I just wish lecture wasnt mandatory :(\r\n\r\nFelt like a captive audience",
                "Strengths: the tutor relationship makes this course so unique and special. I had a lovely relationship with my tutor - who really paid such careful attention to my writing and improvement. The lectures were also always engaging and fun!  \r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "Strength: the concept of daily themes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lack of uniformity across the tutoring styles",
                "The lecture is really fun, not something you need to take notes in. I wish more Yale lectures were like this! I've heard some students complain about their tutors, but I had an amazing tutor (Stephen) and could not have enjoyed our sessions more. The ability to meet with someone one-on-one to talk about your writing is so unique.",
                "The daily writing assignments are amazing! I found the lectures boring and not very helpful. I dont feel like they taught me anything about writing. I also feel like they devolved over the course of the semester, with the lectures at the being more fun and organized.",
                "Strength: you dont really have to go to class or do the readings \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: bad writing prompts, X Themes are the same type of writing every time and are very discouraging for students with different writing styles",
                "The lectures arent essential and unfortunately are at an inconvenient time. You have Monday assignments and arent given out until the end of class, so its difficult to finish the assignment well with other commitments after class (e.g. practice, work, etc).",
                "the tutoring sessions are great. I can't speak for other tutors but my tutor really helped me grow as a thinker, writer, and artist. Weaknesses of the course might be the lack of community felt in a once a week lecture. I feel like it could easily be a  50 min twice a week lecture to process the discussions better, but still a good time.",
                "Strengths: The student and tutor set-up is great for holding yourself accountable, improving your writing, and workshopping ideas. Mark is also an engaging lecturer. The structure of this class is great, and mostly doable!\r\nWeaknesses: Only five skips is tough if you have a busy semester. Guest lecturers are rarely as engaging as Mark and made going to class seem unnecessary. Lectures are mostly valuable for the entertainment factoryou don't learn much.",
                "Loved the tutor approach, it was great to have one person constantly reading all of your writing. Sometimes the lectures were not particularly useful but they were almost always entertaining.",
                "The lectures could be improved sometimes, but I think overall it was very engaging and I loved building a relationship with my tutor.",
                "The class is terrific and the structure is perfect--- weekly lectures, weekly tutor meetings, daily writings. I think the only problem was that Mark himself should have taught every class. There were three or four of the weekly lectures (all clumped at the end of the year) taught or half-taught by tutors, and I think that was a mistake. Mark is fun and charismatic; the tutor lectures were not as interesting. It didn't hamper my enjoyment at all, though, because the writing itself & the tutor meetings compose so much of the class.",
                "Strengths: The themes themselves, the writing, and the tutor system are all great. Friends in the class reported having a bad time with their tutors, but mine was great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't know how much a lot of the lectures offer. The Happenings and class culture stuff are fun, but the actual lessons often felt overly didactic and condescending, without conveying much real writing advice.",
                "Prompt quality varies. Some are great and draw out thoughts and ideas you would never otherwise have, but some are so specific and\/or quirky that the writing just has to be gimmicky.",
                "This class effectively does what it sets out to do: I wrote every weekday of the semester and with that came reflection and skills that are only achievable through discipline and repetition. The lectures were generally interesting and set up the week's topics well. I would say the class could potentially benefit from more standardization between tutors, as I know of vastly different experiences based purely on the random assignment at the beginning of the class.",
                "Strengths: Engaging weekly lectures. Prompts allowed for lots of creativity and experimentation in writing. Well-structuredwe had a concept to focus on each week (e.g. writing about place, or dialogue, or metaphor, or...); we read anonymized examples of exceptional writing from the class each week as a source of motivation and inspiration; and we read an interesting book about artists' work rituals over the course of the semester, which revealed that there's no one way to approach daily artistic endeavors.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Your relationship with your tutor determines so much about your experience in the course. If you aren't a good mentor\/mentee match, which was my experience, then you'll struggle to grow as a writer. Unfortunately, the tutor assignment process is random.",
                "strengths is lectures! mark is one of the best professors around, lectures were so fun and entertaining. weakness depends on your tutor",
                "The set-up of the class, including the daily writing, meeting regularly with a tutor, and receiving constant feedback was very helpful. Sometimes, it was difficult to know how the lecture of a given week lined up with its prompts\/lessons.",
                "I enjoyed the daily prompts and meetings with my tutor. Feedback was typically very helpful in furthering my writing.",
                "The strength of this course is without a doubt the personal friction and growth that comes with making yourself write every day. This is bolstered by the committed set of tutors, with so much dependent on how the tutor relationship develops. The lectures were a helpful but less essential piece of the course. \r\n\r\nOn the whole, I think we overemphasized the schedules and routines of famous writers and underemphasized what actually makes their writing great. The routines are certainly important, and I think merit discussion and class time, but it seemed like most of that could be handled via the tutor\/student relationship. That is a great space for exploring how our writing habits are and aren't working throughout the semester. I also wish assignments were due at 9 or 10am instead of 2am. It was impossible to do a Monday theme in the morning (we got our assignments during class in the afternoon) and, with all the emphasis on routine, I personally wanted to get in the habit of writing every morning.",
                "This class was definitely one of the best I've taken at Yale. Mark is an awesome lecturer. From a more critical perspective, I'd say that the writing tutor meetings sometimes felt unstructured and I definitely didn't feel like they improved my writing at all. Maybe a little more tutor training would ameliorate those issues, not sure. Or a specific prompt for conversation. Also, when Mark ISN'T lecturing, the class takes a pretty hard nosedive. The lectures are already more or less superfluous to the class, so when he gets a guest lecturer who doesn't have his skills then it becomes boring and unhelpful fast.",
                "Strengths: Maybe it depends on your tutor, but I found weekly tutorials so helpful, it's rare to get (almost) immediate and detailed feedback on your writing; fun lecture (random and absurd \"happenings,\" free books Professor Oppenheimer tossed out one day, always some sort of surprise in store); you get to write with some freedom, since only your tutor will see what you write, themes aren't individually graded, and prompts tend to be very open-ended (which has its pros and cons). Weaknesses: It can be draining having to write every weekday, but the expectations are clear and that's what I signed up for. I learned that pushing through that and just writing is part of the point of the class.",
                "The structure of this course is amazing. We learned applicable skills in lectures while honing our line-by-line writing during our tutor sessions. The only way I can think to improve it is by having a bit more structure in our one-on-one sessions with our tutor. I wanted to have tangible feedback to implement after each session, but didn't get that from all sessions. But for the most part, they were incredibly helpful!",
                "Mark is an amazing teacher. But my tutor really really wasn't. That made it so hard because I was putting so much work into the class, but often left wondering if my tutor even read my piece. That is too variable student by student.",
                "One on one tutoring sessions are really helpful",
                "This was one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale so far, and definitely my favorite writing class. Different from other prose writing courses I've taken at Yale, this course required us to write, and a *lot*, and constantly get feedback on it, instead of doing a couple of larger assignments, which means the course gets to cover *so many* different ideas and aspects of prose, while still having the close support of a tutor to draw it all through.\r\n\r\nThe obvious weakness of this course is that it lends itself to a particular style of writing, i.e. 300 word self-contained short stories \/ scenes. Most writing isn't done like this, and we didn't get much of a chance to practice stitching together our scenes into longer works \/ considering questions of larger scale structure, besides the final project. I don't actually think we're supposed to. Aside from tutorials, the longest works of writing students are offered the opportunity to study, really, are short stories, which have their own medium-level structural questions but don't get at the big large scale thematic planning requirements of longer works. I actually think Daily Themes is *more* useful towards that end than other fiction workshops (ignoring, of course, editing; I'm just talking about a first draft). The reason is that Daily Themes just lets you try so many things, lets you dip your foot into so many pools, which allows the student to fine tune questions like 'what kind of voice \/ perspective do I want?' 'what am I good at' 'How can I adapt what I'm good at into the project I'm working on' - the kinds of things intermediate writers really need to progress. The low stakes of the individual themes are fantastic for this - it's a lot more of a hassle to change the voice \/ perspective of a 6k story than a 300 word short description.\r\n\r\nEditing is important, and this course doesn't teach that. This course gives you the endurance to tackle a larger project, and the creativity to begin, but it doesn't actually walk you through it. I don't think it's supposed to; I don't think this course is about editing and I actually didn't like the themes that were about editing \/ stitching things together. The one rewriting theme was good, but I didn't like the themes in the middle of the semester about stitching 2-4 together; I thought that was a bit disorganized. I liked the ending project, though, and I like that it's optional.\r\n\r\nOne thing which I didn't think always flowed super well was the guest lecturers. It was good that everyone had a different approach and lecturing style, but I think the style of the prompts should remain the same - I.e. I think Mark should always write the prompts; he's really good at it. I don't think the guest lecturers should write the prompts.",
                "I loved this class. The tutor system allows for consistent feedback from a mentor you get to know well, Mark gives refreshing lectures that help deepen and expand your writing, and the simple practice of writing everyday really forces you to hone your skills and get out of your comfort zone.",
                "I think this course was very well structured. I really enjoyed the Monday lectures, and the daily prompts and tutor meetings significantly strengthened my writing. There isn't much that I would change about it if given the option."

                "yes, it's a wonderful course. Oppenheimer was a great teacher whose lectures were entertaining and great to listen to. Having my theme to write was like a treat i'd save myself for the end of the day",
                "If you're prepared for the commitment, take it!",
                "Definitely. This is one of my favorite courses- a great stress-reliever that also helped me tangible improve my writing from week-to-week.",
                "You should take Daily Themes! It's definitely a commitment to write every day, but it's nice that you're forced to be creative each day and that there are no other assignments in the class. It's rare at Yale that you get the kind of 1-on-1 attention like you do in Daily Themes.",
                "ya if you want a nice intro writing course",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in working hard on their writing. The daily commitment to a writing practice transformed my ability to pen a story or reflective piece.",
                "Definitely! I know a lot of people in the class have backgrounds with some form of writing or another, but myself, and many others, really had no writing experience. It was so much fun to take, even if you do it Credit\/D\/Fail or something. No matter what your major is, I think that creative writing skills can help you in many ways and in many careers.",
                "Yes. This is a must-take yale class.",
                "Yes I definitely would. Great opportunity to learn a little bit about yourself as a writer - I'm coming out of it liking writing a lot more.",
                "I don't know how much daily themes improved my writing, to be totally frank. But it was a fun, unique challenge. It made me want to write more and try new things. If you consider yourself a writer, maybe check out some of the creative writing offerings. But my friends who are non-writers got so much out of the class. It's a good, fun challenge.",
                "If you are willing to put in the work, TAKE IT!!! Although its definitely difficult to write every day, the task itselfof just producing materialbecomes easier as time goes on. It is a relatively low-stress class in terms of grading, especially because each theme you write is not graded. The lectures and meetings with tutors were always engaging. This has been my favorite course so far at Yale.",
                "Absolutely if you want to get better on your writing!",
                "Absolutely, but you have to enjoy writing or it will be one of the most exhausting classes you will ever take.",
                "yes if you want to develop a highly personalized writing practice in community with others",
                "Yes but maintaining a daily writing schedule is incredibly difficult. Dont do it if you have an otherwise busy semester.",
                "Yes, if you'd like to become a better writer and need external accountability in order to practice!",
                "This is a must-take class at Yale for any aspiring creative.",
                "Sure! If you want to learn how to develop a habit of writing daily despite not having much inspiration, I highly recommend it. But don't take it if you are expecting to receive thorough guidance on how to perfect your craft. This class does not focus on editing or the process of polishing your themes.",
                "take this class. and carve out the time to do it right. you won't regret it.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes! Lots of work but an enriching experience for sure",
                "Absolutely!! This is a bucket list course. It is difficult at times, but worth the effort, and I highly recommend it to all.",
                "Absolutely! Make sure you can commit to writing every day and, if you can, then take this course!! It will help you as a writer and a thinker and frankly, as a human being interacting and reflecting and speaking with other human beings.",
                "If you are serious about writing (in any capacity), take this course!!!\r\n\r\nIf you feel kinda meh about writing, dont take this class. \r\n\r\nIf writing five days a week makes you scared, dont take this class. Nervousness is okay though.",
                "Take this class! It won't be Oppenheimer next year (sad) but the structure of the class is so wonderful and so unique. This is my favorite class that I've taken at Yale and honestly one that I think everyone should take before graduating. Don't be intimidated by daily writing - it's hard at the beginning, but you get used to it and the very open-ended prompts allow you to really write about whatever you want. I'd never done creative writing before but don't let that stop you! It's a really fun, low-stakes introduction to creative pieces.",
                "Yes! But only for the daily practice not for the content.",
                "Absolutely. If anyone wants to become a better writer than take this course. If you want a challenge, take this course. If you want to attend enjoyable lectures every week, than take this course.",
                "Probably not",
                "Yeah its a fun class to take. 300 words each weekday is enough to challenge you, but not enough to stress you. Definitely doable and really fun as a senior class.",
                "Yes. Especially if you don't have a really busy schedule. I don't say this because this course is an overwhelming amount of worksometimes writing every day is difficult and stressful, but no papers, reading, or weekend work is clutchbut because you'll want to be very invested in your writing! You learn a lot about yourself as a writer and come out with some pieces you're proud of.",
                "Yes! Must take",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely yes.",
                "I'd definitely recommend this course. Even if you have a bad time, it'll make you a better writer, and in all likelihood you'll have a good time.",
                "I would not. The tutors were a real mixed bag (as in everyone I talked to felt their tutor was mediocre to bad) and Oppenheimer's lectures were pointless. The tutors should not be paired randomly with students: if I'm a non-fiction writer and want to improve my non-fiction should I be paired with someone who, and I quote, \"only does literature?\"",
                "I would recommend this course to other students as long as they feel that they are capable of making the necessary time commitment. It is an intense and unyielding workload, despite the benefit of not requiring additional midterm and final projects, and it demands a lot of time. That being said, it forces students to write in a way that exists nowhere else at Yale and is exceptional in that regard.",
                "I would not recommend this to the average student. It's just not worth the random tutor assignment risk; if you don't click with them, then the course will begin to feel like a waste of time. However, if you determine that what you need to develop at your current stage as a writer is a wide-open sandbox to experiment in, then this course can give that to you.",
                "Yes! Its a great yale class and you get a ton out of it!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to a student who is dedicated to improving their writing and open to feedback. It gave me so much confidence to work on things in writing that I struggled with and to actually see a difference over time. I feel like I came out of this class having found my voice as a writer.",
                "Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed this classthe weekly lectures were phenomenal, I also loved my weekly meetings with my tutor.",
                "I would definitely recommend it, with the caveat that you go in with a clear understanding of why you're doing it and with a commitment to actually following through. Without that perspective going in, I think the course could breed some resentment (and it does anyway -- writing every day is hard!).",
                "Absolutely. Everyone should take it. Writing is essential to basically any job Yalies go on to do, and the only way to improve is by doing it every day. It's also an easy A (hopefully)if you just get those 300 words down on the page every day, you'll get an A.",
                "Yes!!! But you have to WANT to do all of the writing. You really get out what you put in. Id say the tutor aspect is the best part because you form a relationship with this person who reads five short pieces of yours every week and gives you feedback every single week. Ive never gotten that much feedback and insight into my writing",
                "Yes! But be prepared to buckle down and commit to a little bit of writing every day. The concept alone is worth your enrollment. Longest running class at Yale (I think since 1907) with the exception of a few years around WWII. And with a good tutor and lecturer like Mark Oppenheimer, it was awesome. The entire semester, the class just felt real and human -- no bs, no busy work, just go and write (and show up to a fun lecture once a week that won't take the full 110 minutes). There's a good mix of students too, from English majors who want to be writers to others who enjoy writing but are attracted more by the unique Yale experience and class concept rather than the daily drilling\/focus on the professional craft. If you know you're taking it, I would recommend starting a rough list on your notes app over winter break where you can jot down observations or ideas that strike you as a fun\/interesting\/intriguing topic for a theme. Going into theme-writing with some sort of rough idea is so much easier (and will save you a lot of time) than sitting down in front of a blank screen trying to brainstorm a concept for a theme before beginning to actually write.",
                "Yes! If you want to improve your writing, hone your craft, get more comfortable behind the keyboard, whatever, take this course! I'm a Poli sci \/ Econ person and I found this course incredibly challenging but rewarding. As a graduating senior, I can confidently say this is one of the top three courses I've taken at Yale. For the first time in my life, I feel comfortable calling myself a writer!",
                "You really do work a muscle that you can't in any other class. Its a must take.",
                "Yes. Absolutely. 100%. No notes.\r\n\r\nEspecially if you're an emerging \/ intermediate writer. This course will set you straight.",
                "Yes!",
                "would definitely recommend only if you have the time in your semester it is truly a huge time commitment and it can be difficult to set aside the time to really write creatively if you have a high workload semester already.",
                "Yes! Daily Themes turned out to be my favorite course of the semester. I found myself looking forward to exploring new prompts, attending lectures with friends, and meeting with my tutor each week. This class gave me an outlet to explore topics that were meaningful to me, and I encourage anyone with even a minor interest in creative writing to take this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to any other student with an interest in writing."
