I was introduced to authors from Medieval-era writing about Christian and Muslim influences in Western Europe, as well as ways travel across the Silk Road allowed for greater cultural exchange between Western Europe and the \"east\". I gained a deeper understanding of some scholarship around Medieval-era texts."

                "The course would benefit from more structure in the lectures.  Lecture slides had no writing on them and lacked a bit of structure which would have been helpful.  The course does cover some interesting material.",

                "Lecture was kind of boring at times -- just reading straight off of notes",
                "strengths: really interesting collection of texts that spanned many key topics in the medieval era including interfaith romance, travel, crusaders, violence and conflict between Christian and Muslims, etc \r\nweaknesses: only two papers in the course and they were graded quite harshly",
                "Discussion questions at the end of lecture often felt too broad and did not engage with students' interests. There were moments when it felt like the professors expected the students to have a greater historical understanding of the contexts for the various geographies and time periods of the Middle Ages, which I did not come into the class with, especially on the historical contexts for places outside of Western Europe. The assignments near the end of the semester that felt more like busywork than work that was helpful for us in thinking about our final papers, and it felt like those assignments sometimes got into the way of us working on our final papers. Maybe this could be improved by making assignments more intentional and reducing the number of assignments in the class near the end of the semester or during weeks when we had to work on our papers. The expectations of the course overall was ambiguous throughout the semester, and this definitely created some confusion around expectations for the midterm and final papers for the course. I wish the professors gave clearer guidance on ways to write a good paper."

I think when it came to the midterm paper, the professors were expecting a level of expertise that is not compatible with the introductory level the course is supposed to be.  Its important to meet students where they are and not where you would prefer them to be just to make your job easier or less tedious.",

                "I would recommend English majors who want to take this class to fulfill their Medieval credit to consider pursuing that in other ways. While I did learn a bit about Medieval-era literature from this course, I also felt confused at times about course expectations and what was expected of me. Lecture also felt lacklustered at times, and perhaps the course could benefit from making lectures more concise (and maybe even only holding 1 lecture a week instead of 2). The slides for lecture were also not as helpful for later reviewing as I had hoped, since just having images on slides made it more challenging to verify notes I had taken from lecture and cite them in essays.",
