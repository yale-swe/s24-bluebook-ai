   "comments": [
    "I would have gone over the homework more often- given the class a solid review period where we went over every topic",
    "The course could be improved if we had a teacher with more experience for every section.",
    "The strengths were the problem sets. The weaknesses I think were the tests. I felt surprised every time I took one.",
    "The weakness of the class was that the teacher was inexperienced. The strengths were that there were a lot of ways to get help",
    "Weekly workshops and having a TA in class to help out was really helpful",
    "Class time could be used better. Often times didnt learn much in class",
    "Strengths: offers a very comprehensive course to students\r\nWeakness: I find it to be a bit slow in regards to calculus application and problem type (I'm assuming Math 111 will address this)",
    "More homework questions that are tailored to the question style of the final and also be ready to apply multiple types of topics you learned into one question so have an extremely firm grasp on it",
    "The course moves very fast and the number of systems through which students must jump through to turn in homework, take tests, complete group work, etc is very disorienting. Support for students is definitely superior to Math 112 (i dropped out of that after the first midterm) but I still felt \"behind\" my peers due to my poor math teaching in earlier high school years.",
    "i found it hard to engage in class, it cold be improved by being more interactive.",
    "My professor was not experienced in teaching the course and I fell as if though I suffered because of it. Multiple other students in my class had taken calculus in the past and thus had knowledge of the material already. I, not having seen this information was a deer in headlights for a little bit and feel as if though if I had a professor that had any teaching experience I may have done better. The ULA's, especially Joanna, were what helped me the most and allowed me to understand and clarify topics from class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "No, I would recommend taking math 112.",
    "I would because math 110 allows someone to understand calculus better.",
    "Yes because it is required for a lot of majors",
    "Yes it is a good foundation of math to learn",
    "Yes I enjoy math classes and didnt think it was too complicated",
    "Yes, I would. Professor Hall truly wants everyone to succeed and I believe this course has been designed to ensure that students from all backgrounds are offered a comprehensive and manageable course that will aid them. I do think that students should shop Math 112 even if placed into Math 110\/111(I regrettably did not shop the other course and do think the pace and content of 112 would have better for me).",
    "I would but the understanding of some of these topics just goes into depth too much",
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in taking any other courses involving calculus but who have not had an extensive teaching in that mathematical area. It's manageable only if students engage during office hours, but a challenging course nonetheless.",
    "If you have not taken calculus before or are not comfortable with the material then I highly recommend the class. Instead of taking 112 and stressing about the information in a short span of time, 110 helped to spread out the information and go at a slower pace. I highly recommend you do everything possible to be in class with John Hall as your professor."
