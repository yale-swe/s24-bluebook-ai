I also really liked how the course focused on one particular topic which we went deeply into, rather than a more typical \"intro to English\" class. Also, it was really nice how there was usually low stress \"rough drafts\" due before the actual deadline for papers, it greatly removed stress!\r\nWeaknesses: can't think of one off the top of my head.",

All my grades on my work felt fair and I received a lot of focused feedback that helped me improve my writing. The only weaknesses were that discussions would sometimes go quiet or have long pauses, but just because no one had anything to say and we would move on to a new topic."
