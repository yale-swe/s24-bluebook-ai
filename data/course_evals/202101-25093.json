            "comments": [
                "Strengths: There are a lot of interesting things that the rest of the ME curriculum doesn't cover. Many kinds of mechanisms, nuts and bolts and tolerances and all manner of things like that. They're all interesting and have a lot of use for the mechanical engineer.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Most of the weaknesses, I believe, are from it being in a virtual setting. I think more could be covered, or more completely, if the examples were relegated to the homeworks. Most of the class time was eaten up with example problems which are useful, but not necessarily anything new. Furthermore, the project could have been more well defined. For instance, having a set rubric for what's expected, a timeline and more checking in. Also, maybe having some example projects or things that could be done instead of leaving it totally open-ended. Perhaps also the project could be done in teams and have a wider scope, or be asked to take it more to completion (i.e. machining things, making a useful product) and more time could be devoted to this.",
                "Overall, I thought the course was both engaging and informative. Also, it was one of the first examples of clearly seeing how information learned in class could be applied directly to the real world of the engineering industry. Also, Dr. Adrezin has a great understanding of students and was very accommodating, especially during a covid semester.\r\n\r\nThe biggest critique of the course was the handling of the final project. I felt like more guidance through the project would have been helpful, especially in the brainstorming period. Also, a small working budget for the course (and more accessibility to resources like laser cutters/a machine shop) would lead to better results. Nonetheless, I take that with a grain of salt since this was the first semester doing the course.",
                "This course has a ton of potential. This being its first year being offered, it can definitely improve, but the type of content is exactly what I was hoping to move towards as I became an upperclassman in MechE. Firstly, I think the in-class solidworks tutorials should be more sparse. Considering MENG 325, which includes a design project that requires the use of CAD, is a prerequisite for the course, the tutorials that assumed we were clean slates seemed a bit unnecessary. With that extra time, either more mechanisms could be taught the same startegies could be taught more in-depth. The mastery-based learning is definitely a good way to go, but it might be better if advanced topics that were related were alluded to more often so that students knew where to start looking if they wanted to expand on what they learned/mastered. Lastly, the final build project should definitely stay, but I think there should be at least a bit more structure, maybe in the form of checkins and guidance. That way, students might be motivated to start earlier and be able to design products of the same caliber as in MENG 325.",
                "Strengths - super interesting content. I really like the hands-on aspect of the class and feel like this is one of the few Yale MechE classes I have taken that I am genuinely interested in and can see applying to my later career. Also, the exams are super easy.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Like any Doc A course, to an extent you get out of this class what you put into it. Assignments are maybe a little too open-ended. For example, you have to design a four-bar mechanism on Solidworks for one of the first assignments, and it can be as simple as four links or you can design an advanced machine with it. I feel like something between the two should be submitted, but there isn't much guidance on how to make the step between a simple thing you learn in class and more advanced/realistic applications. I think having some sort of guidance on what machines the mechanisms we learn about are used in could be helpful in taking that extra step to get more out of the class.",
                "weakness: more information about the final project earlier and maybe have students start the project earlier",
                "Strengths were very interesting work, amazing Professor.",
                "Course had interesting applied aspects and felt like an opportunity to put together things we had learned in Machine Elements, Dynamics, etc. Some of the material felt a little abstract but Doc A reiterated the methods used in industry as well. The project was the most rewarding and engaging aspect of the course, and I think the class should be geared more toward it. Having some structure to guide students or timed deliverables could help because we all submitted a proposal and then kind of forgot about the project until reading week.",
                "The primary strength of this course was the teaching by Doc A, who is an excellent professor. He makes all of the concepts easy to understand while giving us assignments that enforce the material. The course is excellent, and one way I can think of improving it is including more check-ins for the final project between the proposal and final product.",
                "Weakness: I think there should be more hands-on, structured guidance for the final project (not as much as ME 325, though). Strength: it really felt like what I was learning mattered and would be useful in the future."

Doc A loves to emphasize building a portfolio, so use this project to make something you can show off. It's also a good course for actually applying things you learned in MENG 325 and 383 especially, since those classes often feel a little too theory heavy.",
