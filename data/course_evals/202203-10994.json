                "I learnt about broad ideas in Architecture - lots of different concepts covered in a very vague, concept based. But overall really enjoyable - become more familiar with famous architects and buildings.",
                "I learned how to visually analyze, critically think about how space and architecture defines movement.",
                "In this class I learned the principles of design as they pertain to architectural drawing and modeling. Not only did I develop my skills as an artist, but I learned specifics, such as drawing plans, sections, and elevation sketches. More broadly, I think this class taught me how to look at the world from an architectural perspective and gave me insight into the minds of architects that construct the world around us.",
                "I feel like I can I draw much better now!",

                "Introduction to basic concepts in architecture and development of drawing skills.",
                "I learned how to see differently.",
                "By taking this course I was able to develop abstract thinking skills and think outside the box. I think one of the most important features of this course was being able to see and observe other student's works, and in doing so I was able to see the way others approached various designs, giving me insights on processes that I would have never thought of.",
                "ARCH 150 was a good introduction to concepts of space, light and changing time, materials, general architectural motifs, and structural systems. It doesn't dive very deep into any of these categories and you don't leave with a complete sense of what architecture \"is\", particularly in the practicing sense, but lectures are really interesting and teach you new things about how architects approach the design process.",
                "Critical observing, perspective, spatial thinking",
                "I learned how to draw in perspective, sections, plans, and elevations. I also learned about general principles of architectural design.",

                "I gained skills in drawing buildings as part of my lecture notes and weekly sketchbook assignments. We gained skills in using different materials, such as making paper models and drawing with different mediums (I personally chose charcoal sometimes). I learned the differences between sections, plans, and elevation drawings. The course definitely pushed me to see buildings more deconstructed, from the form to its surroundings to its material."

                "Starts from the basics and assumes no prior architectural knowledge.",
                "Strengths: fun assignments and TAs were great\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes lectures are kinda boring and don't seem very relevant to architecture at all.",
                "Super chill course, lectures are amazing and keeping a sketchbook is actually a super fun way to take notes\/see your progress in the course. Weakness - not a lot of grades\/feedback, so it's hard to tell how you're doing. Also homework and lectures aren't related at all.",
                "strengths: commitment of teaching staff to the material\r\nweaknesses: gap between assignments and lecture, lectures being a bit esoteric\/too abstract",
                "This was one of the highlights of my semester - I loved my architecture section! I also really enjoyed the drawing assignments. I think the weakness is the guest lecturers they felt a little out of context and I preferred the main professors.",
                "Alex was fantastic. One of the best professors ever.",
                "I loved this course. Not many improvements to be made. Maybe a little bit more emphasis on teaching how to properly do section\/ plan drawings.",
                "The strengths of this course were definitely rooted in my section. My TAs were great teachers that explained in great detail how I was to go about the drawings and taught me specific techniques that facilitated architectural drawing. The weaknesses of this course were rooted in lecture. While Alec is a brilliant man, I sometimes felt like the lectures were unorganized and difficult to follow, resulting in some reluctance to go to class at 9:30am.",
                "Good lectures and assignments, fun critique at the end of the semester",
                "The emphasis on hands-on projects (drawing, model-making) is a strength, but I would incorporate the readings more.",
                "I wish the readings were discussed more, either in section or during the actual lecture. For strengths, Alecs lectures were extremely clear and engaging. I left every lecture knowing something new.",
                "strengths- creative, good lectures\r\nweaknesses- grading policies seemed exceptionally subjective and random",
                "Exceptionally engaging course. I love drawing, so it was a great complement to the rest of my work.",
                "I think we should've been allowed to use technology in the lecture.",
                "Some strengths of this course are exposing students to various architectural designs by different artists and time periods. \r\nOne thing I hope this course emphasized more, however, would be to teach more technical skills instead of putting the most emphasis on the abstract.",
                "Strengths: The TF system. I have never had TFs as engaged and above-and-beyond helpful as they were in this course, and everything is facilitated to teach you how to have collaborative conversations about design and the architectural processes with people actually experiencing grad school programs. When we were working on our lampshades, office hours were incredibly helpful and available and TFs spoke candidly with students as a sounding board for ideas. Lectures were really interesting for the most part, and assignments taught about fundamental architectural skills (from plan and section to visually representing changes in time) while being pretty manageable and fun. The final review was amazing and ended up teaching a lot about how you can approach a relatively complex assignment in many different ways.\r\nWeaknesses: While some guest lectures were great, there were others that didn't particularly land. It might have been helpful to have more in-class time to talk about techniques to draw and think about project concepts. Readings were de-emphasized for the most part and it would have been helpful to know which of the many available texts were most applicable to weekly content.",
                "Lectures were too broad. I didnt feel like I was learning anything except drawing skills. A more substantive curriculum, diving deeper into certain topics instead of giving a surface level overview of everything, wouldve been more engaging.",
                "Strength of this course are the TAs and section meetings. They were very helpful and important. The assignment are a strength because they offered opportunity to improve your own drawing skill and use what you have heard about in lecture.",
                "I found the lectures to be really engaging. I also really appreciated the assignments for this course because it emphasized drawing and hands on crafting which was a great switch up from other courses. Plus it helped working in a visual form when studying through a visual lens. One weakness is that we didn't have much time for technical drawing instruction, which I would have appreciated since almost all of our assignments were drawing based. Finally, while the readings were interesting, they were never discussed and often disconnected from the lecture and weekly assignment.",
                "Both the strength and weakness of this course is that it is very free-flowing. I feel that it aimed to inspire an admiration for architecture rather than actually teach you concrete things. It definitely inspired an admiration for architecture in me, but at times, it also felt a bit too artsy-fartsy. Sometimes, the lectures were too abstract, which I think could be a good and bad thing depending on how you look at it. Also, the readings were the same way. A lot of them were hard to understand for me, but all of them definitely inspired a sort of admiration for the space and materials around me.",
                "if I'm going in search of weaknesses--a few of the guest lectures could have been better. otherwise, all strengths.",
                "I wouldn't change anything. This was my favorite course I have taken at Yale and Professor Purves has been my favorite lecturer I have ever listened to. My TF's were amazing.",
                "The strength of the class is its long history--Professor Purves has taught this class for many years, and amazing guest lecturers come and share their different perspectives and stories of architectural spaces.",
                "Strength: lecture material is not tested so we can really just enjoy the material for our own knowledge, good feedback every week on sketches \r\nWeaknesses: lectures not a clear structure (just go through slides in arbitrary order), did not learn how to actually draw better (just thrown into drawing assignments even with no experience drawing)",
                "Strengths: Many opportunities to draw, weekly section, and fun assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Hard to improve after midterm and final evaluations\/ no way to revise.",
                "Strengths: Discussion section allowed for deeper delve with course content, class wide participation was conducive, creativity was encouraged \r\nWeaknesses: Homework feedback was not always provided, encouragement and access to materials for projects were not readily available, background knowledge and access to materials were disparate and little to no effort was made to bridge these discrepancies",
                "Strengths are that the course encourages and succeeds with teaching students to really look around them and notice aspects of architecture and how they relate to systems in society. The lectures are interesting and students are re-taught note taking in a way that is majority drawing rather than writing verbatim from the lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses are that the lectures don't necessarily follow a thematic course very strictly, so it can be difficult to get the big-picture.",
                "Strength: give a comprehensive and interesting exposure to architecture\r\nweakness: redundancy in lecture contents, especially during the last few weeks of the semester",
                "I wish the sections included discussions of readings.  Or, I wish there were an option to choose a section that was more conceptually oriented rather than only critiquing drawings.",
                "Strengths: definitely a unique course in that it forces you to pay attention to things you may overlook usually. it's also a course that's applicable everyday even to the non-architecture major. the weekly assignments often required at least some drawing element and i found the artistic component of the course to be especially fun\r\nWeaknesses: can be a bit tedious, especially if you're unfamiliar with the different sketch types or if you're not used to making models"

                "Yes if you like drawing and need a humanities\/arts credit. It was fun just to have a little assignment to draw each week. But if you really wanna learn a LOT about buildings and architectural design maybe not. It's more of a creative art class loosely tied to structure but fun nonetheless.",
                "Yes absolutely especially if you are interested in architecture",
                "yes",
                "yes! especially if you like drawing. also, the lectures are great",
                "depends on your interest. i still believe those who have drawing skills or took this class concurrently with (materials of arch, structures, etc.) or something that was more skills-based could benefit more from the. class",
                "Yes I think this is a must take in my eyes - I think you do in reality learn or improve your spatial thinking to some extent. I think seeing the world and drawing the world are invaluable and so yes!",
                "Yes. Definitely, each class was so much fun and each assignment I looked forward to doing.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student that is interested in a class that promotes creativity and thinking outside the box. There are a lot of assignments that allow you to exercise your creative brain, and as an Economics student, that is a wonderful break from the norm. While I am not going to major in architecture, I enjoyed this class a lot and feel like I've walked away with a different mindset about our built environment.",
                "Yes - this is a great class whether youre an architecture major or just want to learn a new subject. Youll start seeing buildings in a different way!",
                "If someone wanted to learn to draw better, I would recommend the course. The lectures were also really interesting.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. Obviously, it's a requirement for the Arch major but the material is really engaging and the work forces you to use a completely different part of your brain than most Yale classes do. You will see so many more things as you look around campus and as you learn to think through drawing more. Great class that blends history and practice in a compelling way.",
                "Yes, I would recommend the course. I started the course with a bit of a cynical view of modern art\/architecture, this changed my outlook. It gave me a greater understanding of the thought processes of these projects.",
                "yes",
                "Absolutely! The TAs and course instructors make this course a wonderful experience!",
                "Yes, if they wanted to learn about architecture.",
                "I highly recommend other students to take this class as it provides a space that fosters active academic engagement both with TAs and other students.",
                "Absolutely! The TF system is fantastic, weekly assignments are manageable but helpful and engaging, and lectures are for the most part really interesting. While this course doesn't cover everything you will learn a lot about how to think as an architect and how to have collaborative conversations in a creative space. This is well-designed for both majors and non-majors, though it was a little unclear where readings fit into the pedagogy and sometimes guest lectures were less than ideal.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend. The course overall was a great experience. The atmosphere is welcoming and positive and even if you are not an architecture major that is no issue at all. We received very helpful feedback and so its easy to improve throughout the semester. The lectures were very interesting and thoughtful and the sketch book assignments were fun.",
                "I would totally recommend this class to another studentwhether or not they intend on pursuing architecture. I think if they are obviously it is a great intro class. If they are not it is great because the workload exercises a different part of your brain that most other Yale classes lackhands on assignments that force you to think visually and express thoughts through a different medium.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. Although it is a bit of an abstract course and I'm not sure if I came out of it learning about anything concrete, it definitely changes the way you look at structures around you. It inspired a curiosity within me that I didn't know I had.",
                "This is the best lecture course Ive ever taken, and I say that as someone who is not an architecture major and has taken many of the best humanities lectures at Yale. (One of my friends, who is an architecture major, and so had taken the class two years ago, sat in on almost all the lectures this semesterthey are that good.) You will look at the world around you differently (and better, more fully) while (and hopefully after) taking this course. As long as Professor Purves is teaching it, every Yale student who does not take this course does themselves a disservice.",
                "Yes. Regardless of if they are interested in Architecture as a major I think this class opens your eyes to what you walk through in the world.",
                "It's an introductory course, so the class gives you insight into architectural spaces (lecture slides full of buildings\/city plans\/maps) and trains students for basic drawing (weekly drawing assignment and feedback). The class gives less technical experience than what nonmajors would expect. For instance, we created an architectural model only once in the semester.",
