Every week I felt like I left with so many new questions and ideas. \r\n\r\nWeakness - I would have liked more structure (ie intermediate assignments) to force myself not to procrastinate the final paper until reading week. Own goal.",
                "Strengths: randomized call on system kept everyone engaged and forced people to do the readings\r\nWeaknesses: Instructor should ban the use of laptops so as to prevent people (myself included) from disengaging with discussion during the class. I also think having 4 response papers instead of 5 might've been better, though I don't feel super strongly about this.",
                "The strengths are in the organization of the readings and discussions. If you do the readings every week (as you are highly incentivized to do), you learn a ton of new content. As an undergrad, I also thought that getting to discuss with grad students and in a very small seminar allowed for a much higher level of discussion than in many other seminars. I really couldn't say enough good things about this course. As for the weaknesses, it was a lot of reading. That's not a weakness, but just worth considering."

                "I really couldn't recommend highly enough. It is both a large and difficult workload every week if you do the readings, and if you take this course, you better do the readings. You just learn so much content, have such great discussions, Prof. Kalla is amazing, and the final paper gives a chance to think in a big way about a political science question."
