                "Learned a lot about Tolstoy's War and Peace.",
                "I learnt a lot more about how to think. I have never taken a literature class and this provided me with a great foundation to take more. You learn how to critically analyse what an authors intentions were, their context etc.",
                "I learned how to pace myself for the tome that is War and Peace. I learned a little bit of Russian history, and found some valuable moments in the dense text.",
                "I learned a lot about the Russian literary classic War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy, the perceptions of the book and its impact on Russian culture, and how the book is still applicable today. I deepened my skills in literary analysis and writing about literature.",
                "I developed a better understanding of Russian history and culture during the Napoleonic Wars, and about War and Peace's themes and legacy.",
                "Read War and Peace and had a fabulous section!",

                "Read war and peace and learned the historical context for the book",
                "My TF gave incredibly specific and useful feedback about writing compelling essays. I have already fulfilled all of my writing requirements, and continue to as a humanities major, but I still learned a lot thanks to the essay requirements.",
                "I read war and peace. This was an achievement and the course design was such that one had to read the novel to be successful.",
                "I've learned a lot about Russian History and about Tolstoy's philosophical and historical thinking.",
                "I learned so much about Russian history in this course! I also learned how to write about and engage with long texts and find themes within them.",
                "I learned about the Napoleonic wars and the book War and Peace.",
                "Learnt a lot about Russian culture and literature",
                "I learned so much about the context and content of Tolstoy's epic War and Peace and the ways it has meaning across various fields.",
                "Beyond just being able to say I read the entirety of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace--which is rewarding enough on its own--the course expanded my knowledge of of Russian history, deepened my understanding of the construction of historical fiction, and improved my writing abilities. We analyzed the unique structure of the book and discussed its characters. We dissected Tolstoy's philosophical perspectives on history, death, war, love, and endings.",
                "I thought that this class was FABULOUS. I learned so much not only about Tolstoy / War and Peace but about Russian history/the Napoleonic wars, how to write well, and how to engage critically with scholarly material. This is without a doubt one of the best classes i have taken at Yale. GO TO LECTURE THOUGH, it is so silly to take the class and miss it.",

                "Through a close reading of War and Peace, I gained a lifelong appreciation for the novel itself, Tolstoy as a writer and thinker, and, more broadly, Russian literature. I learned how to trace dozens of thematic and character arcs through a 1,200+ page text, as well as discuss and write about them intelligently and coherently.",
                "I read and analyzed War & Peace and relevant secondary texts. The themes of the work (and the class) include death, marriage, family, nationalism, imperialism, and the forces of history."

                "Weaknesses - lectures\r\nStrength - passionate TF",
                "The course was fun. I didn't go to that many lectures, simply because it was possible to get a good grade without going to lecture. As someone who kinda needs to be compelled to go to class, I wish attending lecture had been more integral to the grading of the course. Although I didn't attend lecture much, those I did attend were pretty good!",
                "This is a lecture course, and I do think discussing the novel would be better suited to a seminar, but I still think I got a lot out of it. I enjoyed discussing the novel in section and lecture was usually pretty interesting. I think Professor Bojanowska is an incredible scholar and gives great analysis of the novel but if there was somehow a way to get students also thinking about the novel analytically as well instead of just providing the answers that might improve the course. I really liked in lecture when Professor Bojanowska would ask students their opinions and we would have a mini discussion---I think more of that would improve the course.",
                "Strengths: The  lectures were mostly interesting (although the early timing of them was rough), the book was fantastic, and discussion section was an absolute blast.\r\nWeaknesses: The reading adds up really fast and once you get behind it's quite hard to catch up. The reading quizzes felt pointless and were a pain, often including randomly specific questions. it got to the point where there was no reason to do the supplemental readings since they weren't quizzed, they were hardly important in lecture, and they were tacked onto like 2.5 hrs of W&P reading.",
                "First of all its a great course. I think one way it could be improved is with less secondary readings but more impactful ones. I would prefer to read one 10 page reading on something specific than like 4 small snippets.",
                "Strengths: An interesting read.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures summarized the plot of the novel and assigned secondary readings without diving any deeper than surface level. Section was also a slog, as were the reading quizzes (which forced one not to read at their own pace, or to not enjoy moments of the book) and feedback on essays was atrociously obtuse, and showed a serious lack of reading comprehension or interest on the part of the TF.",
                "Strengths: Professor B is very kind and a great, funny lecturer. This class got me back into enjoying reading recreationally. The organization of this course focusing on only one book made for deep, nuanced discussion. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The secondary sources were sometimes forgotten about, so there wasn't much incentive to read them until the final essay when you are required to use secondary sources in the paper.",
                "The course was easy to keep up with and engaging. I understand many students want to take this course, but I do believe a seminar format would better suit the discussion of the novel.",
                "The lectures were not the most engaging.",
                "Loved the structure of class.",
                "Strength: lectures and pace of the class were really good. Allowed for easy digestion of a challenging book\r\n\r\nWeakness: no lectures posted online. If you miss class you miss the material",
                "The course material is fantastic. I loved the book itself and all additional secondary texts. I dont think a lecture is the right format for this course, but I understand a seminar is difficult to accommodate given the amount of interest in the class.",
                "Strengths- sections were amazing.  Novel was amazing. I was not a big fan of the lectures.",
                "The lectures were interesting; however, it didn't feel like the lectures were very connected with the assignments of this course.",
                "This course had interesting lectures and discussion sections that helped me understand the novel. I think the amount of reading per week was too high and that there should be less secondary readings to make it all more manageable.",
                "Great book wish the course had more historical context",
                "This class was awesome. The book we read was great, and I thought the lectures greatly augmented my ability to enjoy the reading process. I wish there were perhaps fewer additional readings since they got to be a bit much sometimes, but I still really liked the class.",
                "strength: lectures are super well taught and sections as well \r\nweakness: lectures are 925am",
                "I think the course was balanced very well. The reading was very steady across the semester and I found the book consistently interesting. I think we were given good time and feedback for each of the papers and I think those fit very well with the points of the novel that we had reached. I think one challenge for me is how to write effective essays when we are only part way through the book which I think can complicate and force us to make theses more qualified and less strong. While it is not clear how this effects grading, I think it could be helpful to maybe adopt a policy like for a certain essay you presume the book cut off at the point that has been reached to make the writing a bit more smooth.",
                "The course had a good structure and a reasonable workload. The contents of the book were complemented well with supplementary readings and portions of the lectures, enhancing our understanding of the plot and characters' motivations. Expectations for the papers were high but not impossible to meet. I feel that the course discussion board should have been started earlier in the course, and perhaps posting at least every other week should be mandatory, to facilitate greater participation.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bojanowska, WAR AND PEACE, lecture, secondary sources, everything.\r\nObviously it is a long book but its very manageable. \r\nSome did not like the professors lecture style (she essentially reads a script) but i think it just makes for a very thorough, interesting lecture! \r\nGrading was a bit harsh, but I think thats because the teaching staff is really pushing you to engage critically with the course and the book itself.  They make themselves readily available for feedback and help, and they really want you to improve and work hard.",
                "The grading scheme of this class seemed a little poorly thought out. For the Non-WR sections, too much emphasis was placed on quizzes where minor mistakes had large impacts on the overall grade.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bojanowksa is so smart and funny and great in class. I woke up excited at 9:25 to hear her insights on our readings. My TA was also fantastic so that further improved my experience in the class. Weaknesses: none!!!",
                "Strength: great lectures, interesting interplay between literature and history",
                "This was one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yaleit was incredibly engaging and well-organized. I deeply enjoyed reading the novel and all of the supplementary readings. I always looked forward to lecture and section.",
                "The lectures need to have less plot summary and more analysis. Also, cut out the high school writing instruction from the middle of the lectures. The secondary sources were generally quite good. I also enjoyed the epistolary assignment -- it was a welcome opportunity to practice creative writing."

                "Not really. The only valuable takeaway is being able to say you read War and Peace at a cocktail party.",
                "Maybe. If you can compel yourself to read the book in your own time, maybe just do that. I feel like much of what I learned in the course came from the book itself (which perhaps is the intention of the course!)",
                "This is a great class for anyone who wants to read War and Peace or learn to think critically about literature. The pacing of the reading assignments and the lectures were very helpful to structure and contextualize the novel.",
                "Definitely! But I recommend a strong interest in Tolstoy or Russia or War and Peace beforehand. It's a long semester to spend on a book you don't end up liking.",
                "Yes! It's a great book and a fun context to read it! The papers are fun to write as well.",
                "Yes. War & Peace is a book that I would probably not be able to read alone. Going through it as a class gives you plenty of background so you actually understand what is happening. Its a decent amount of work if you actually do it. 100 pages of reading is approx 5hrs for me (small font and big pages). Plus a few hours of secondary readings. So about 7hrs not including class and section. Doesnt sound too bad, but it can be tough to stay consistent with it during midterms etc. and if you get behind it can not be as good.",
                "I would not recommend this class to another student; if they would like to read War and Peace, I think it is a worthwhile read, but for me the class did not facilitate much additional discovery. There was no curve by section, so any TF had free reign over grading scales (most were reasonable). The reading quizzes felt like high school. And the sections tried to teach \"how to write a thesis,\" or \"counterargument\" (they did poorly, anyways), which everyone already knew how to write, and which felt extremely redundant, just like the lectures.",
                "If you enjoy literature, absolutely. Important to note is you do not need a background in Russian literature or history to take this course! A simple history background is more than enough to enjoy this novel. Prof B will teach you a lot about Russian culture and history just through the interactions of the novel. This course was a highlight of my semester and truly felt like a journey from start to finish, like a big book club about just one book.",
                "I would, but caution that to get the most out of the course a decent amount dedicated reading and writing time should be planned for. Additionally, since the course focuses primarily on one book, be prepared for the possibility your opinion of War and Peace may curdle substantially before the end of the book (though I highly doubt it).",
                "If you want to read War and Peace and have a good TA, yes.",
                "100% one of the best classes I have ever taken.",
                "Absolutely would recommend. This is one of the greatest books I've ever read and I would never be able to complete it or take away as much about the material without this class. Every person should read this book in their life. The discussion and analysis made the reading much better than I would if I were alone",
                "I would recommend this course to students majoring in humanities-related subjects. Theres about ~90 pages of reading per class (including secondary texts), with two classes a week. I imagine it might be easy to fall behind if you arent very passionate about the subject matter.",
                "This was a good course, but unless you need the writing credit I'd recommend taking the non-WR discussion section. It's exactly the same course, just with less work & less stress.",
                "I would recommend this course if a person is interested in improving their literary analysis and getting an in-depth look at a classic.",
                "100%. Great class with a great instructor.",
                "yes, war and peace is a great book to study. Learnt a lot about life, history and the world as well.",
                "If you want the chance to read one of the great works of fiction with engaging and interesting commentary I would heartily recommend this course. The characters and drama of the book are so life-like and the messages so poignant that I looked forward to reading more each week. There was a genuine excitement that I think many students would experience through the course.",
                "Yes! It is a great course that dives deeply into the historical, political, national, and social contexts of War and Peace as a novel. If you are to take the course know that readings are intensive. You should expect around 120 pages of reading from War and Peace every week (without considering supplementary readings), and the novel is heavy and dense. The non WR section does not have that much writing involved and the only big assignments are two papers. Overall, the course is very interesting and reading War and Peace for sure feels like a big accomplishment. The class moves fast through the readings, so if you  think you will not be able to keep up with them, maybe this class is not the best fit.",
                "I absolutely loved this course. It felt like a more intellectually challenging book club. I will admit that the book does get to be a little tiring at certain points, but the camaraderie built in lecture and in discussion section gave me the motivation to continue with eagerness. War and Peace is a classic book for a reason, and I am convinced that this course--with its detailed lectures for context and contemplation, thoughtful discussion, and intriguing papers--is the best way to experience it.",
                "Very much so, take this class. There is a kind of freedom in being able to really sink your teeth into a single, albeit long, book.",
                "I would 10000000% recommend this course. War and Peace is a fabulous book, and to have read it with so much added context and insight was a gift. I also had a fabulous TA which made section a joy to attend.",
                "Yes, do it! Realistically, when else are you going to read this book? You won't. So read it now; it's fantastic. If you have never had any inclination to read Tolstoy, or have read his other works and hated them, don't take this course \"just to see.\" If you don't enjoy the readings, it will be very difficult to stay on schedule.",
                "Only if you want a good excuse to read the novel and talk about it that you wouldn't otherwise have. Beyond that, the lectures aren't all that engaging, and what you get out of the course is really determined by how good your TA is",
                "This was the best class I've taken at Yale so far...I would recommend this class to any student. Not only is the book amazing (so doing the reading for the class is enjoyable) but Professor Bojanowska's lectures are insightful and help contextualize the entire book. If you think you might want to take the class - JUST DO IT",
                "Yes! Even just for the sake of saying \"I finished war and peace\"",
                "I would recommend this course to another student in a heartbeat. Reading just one book allows you to go deeply into the text wile maintaining a reasonable workload.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I know War and Peace is a novel that I will keep coming back to throughout the rest of my life, and I am so grateful that I had the opportunity to read, unpack, and discuss it for the first time in such an engaging intellectual environment.",
                "If you love Tolstoy or really want to read War & Peace, then go for it. It's worth studying this masterwork in a formal academic setting, and Professor Bojanowska does just enough to make it worth your time. However, I didn't love this course. I agree with Henry James that War & Peace is a \"loose, baggy, monster\" -- worth reading, but too long and unfocused. If you're only going to take one class on Russian lit at Yale, read some Dostoevsky or Anna Karenina or something. The class also didn't add a ton of value, so mostly this was just a way for me to force myself to read War & Peace, which ultimately I'm glad I did."
