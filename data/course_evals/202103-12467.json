Understanding the general mass transfer equations using continuity equation, NS equation, Fick's law, and then later in the course how we applied some of this to ground water flow and contaminants. Good problem solving class and many other classes I've taken really clicked for me when taking this course.",

Towards the end of the course, we learned about the application of transport processes in water treatment systems.",

                "The course emphasizes important concepts. The problem sets help to apply these concepts and the exams test for understanding. The course format is effective. The lectures are good because they start with background and then delve into specifics. The course could be improved with the inclusion of more female engineers in the problem sets."
