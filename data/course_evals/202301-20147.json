                "The course tries its best to present itself as relevant to global affairs majors. While for my particular profession it is not, which made it difficult to remain engaged with the material, I understand that this is not the case for everybody and hence am not writing it off immediately. The course (and by that I principally mean the professor) does its absolute best to set students up for the real world with the assumption that they will confront similar instances of statistical output in the future. In short, it should not be a required class, but for those willing to take it, it is amazing.",
                "It is very well taught!",
                "The class is organized very well and material is very accessible. More office hours from TAs would be appreciated",
                "Strengths: Very well organized, the professor and TFs coordinate each week, and the problem sets and exams are predictable - no surprises there.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We use Stata, not R; R is much more popular nowadays and more powerful than Stata.\r\n\r\nTip: If you are enrolled in any Econ class, reach out to the DUS of Econ and you can get Stata for free. The TFs can help with this.",
                "Biggest weakness is JT is very disorganized. He is very helpful in office hours, but lecture is consistently treated like office hours (everyone asks a ton of questions) and we then don't cover most of the material and most of the class zones out. It is a good class, but we move really slow.",
                "strengths - great professor and TAs. Highly qualified to be teaching and leading students. weaknesses - not enough office hours, very slow pacing in class",
                "JT is the big strength. The material is also quite interesting. No weaknesses in my mind.",
                "I really appreciate how flexible JT was with the due dates of problem sets if we were behind in class or if you communicated that you would have a lot of work. I always felt like the class was fair, which I think is really important for a student.",
                "JT really wants everyone to understand all of the content. This means that I left the course with a strong understanding of all the topics we covered. It also meant that we moved pretty slowly; one P-set was cancelled and we didnt even finish the last lecture. I think we could have sped up the pace of the class a little.",
                "I think the course could be a bit faster paced and more difficult. I also think we could be expected to learn more Stata syntax since this is probably what we will be using in our work.",
                "strengths: Super engaging class, fun atmosphere, great TA's\r\nWeaknesses: Possible include more detailed slides/expectations of the exams, very hard homework",
                "Strengths: the tools we learn are actually useful, and you leave the class with a strong understanding of when each tool should be used and what it can tell you. Weaknesses: the TFs take painfully long to grade assignments, so it's difficult to get feedback, and there are limited preparation resources for the exams. Slides are also very unhelpful to review afterwards - there are lots of questions without answers on the slides, which is frustrating given how much the class emphasizes precision in wording.",
                "Strengths: JT is a very personable professor and wants you to do well. He explains concepts well and goes at an understandable pace\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes just became a semantics class where you had to get the wording exactly right to get full points",
                "Strengths:\r\n- very well structured and organised",
                "The course covers a lot of material over a short period of time. However, with this said, I think the class time at one hour and 15 minutes was a bit long for a math lecture. Additionally, while the professor is hard to get a hold of, the TAs are very prompt in responding and helpful with questions students have. The psets are also very long, but I liked how we had a week to do them.",
                "JT is a great instructor. He teaches you exactly what he wants to evaluate you on and will not move on until he feels confident that the class understands.  I feel like the class prepared me well for all of the examinations. I think the course could benefit by having student teaching fellows.",
                "Justin Thomas' teaching is excellent.",
                "Strengths: engaging, fast-paced, JT is a fantastic instructor, the TFs are great. Weaknesses: cold calling is terrifying (engaging, but scary), material can be boring",
                "This course is well-organized and structured for student learning. For each lecture there were segments saved for questions which made for a great learning environment. Participation was encouraged. Discussion sections helped with practicing and understanding the material taught during lecture.",
                "The main piece of feedback I have is PowerPoint slide improvement. The most difficult concept of the entire semester (triple interactions) had truly terrible slides. Section slides did help fill in the gaps, but it would've been nice if this was improved.",
                "There could be more practice problems offered, and clear revision of the distinctions between the most important methods could be explained a bit better. However, overall the course was taught really well, and Prof. Thomas ensured that students were caught up with the material to the best of any professors ability.",
                "JT is a great instructor. The course was super slow though.",
                "Strengths: JT's personality- made me smile and laugh which is a rare thing, especially in a stats class; JT's deep care for us as students was self-evident and admirable; detailed and helpful feedback from TF's on exams and psets. Weaknesses: lectures were confusingly organized and we spent too much time on concepts that required little explanation; too much information was only said verbally and in a bit of a roundabout way; relatedly, the slides didn't have key information on them (sometimes only conceptual questions, without the conceptual answer, which was frustrating); STATA output from class (with much-needed syntax information) was not provided to students; took a while to get psets back; exams were quite difficult and required very specific wording (not outlined in lecture but sometimes in section) to receive full credit; too much time spent on student questions during lecture which did not contribute to the understanding of the class as a whole",
                "Understanding the material can be exciting and engaging. However I found JTs lectures to be unnecessary complicated and useless, and I instead rather relied on sections.",
                "The course offers a lot of useful skills and the lectures are incredibly engaging. The class did feel like it got bogged down at points and perhaps could have touched an additional topic or two covering a completely different are of statistics.",
                "strength - JT is a great guy, funny, and a good teacher\r\nweakness- material itself is at times boring",
                "This course is very engaging and the problem sets really help for the exams, so there are no surprises.",
                "Strengths of this course was the organization and the discussion sections. Jane, my TA was amazing at synthesizing and confirming any doubts of the material of the week.",
                "Often very disorganized but overall interesting and well taught.",
                "This course moves at a pretty slow pace which is helpful for getting a full grasp of each concept, yet sometimes I wish less time would be spent answering individual questions in class and more office hours or section time available.",
                "Strengths: Engaging professor and TFs, PSETs correlate well with exams\r\nWeaknesses: Heavy workload, some structural disorganization",
                "Strengths: The professor!!! The lectures are extremely engaging and JT makes an effort to get everyone interested in the topic, even in a large lecture course. The discussion sections help to reinforce the materials and there are many office hours available. However, I found that the discussion section quality varied greatly based on the slides- it may help to create a unified set of slides that reinforce the key concepts. The feedback on the psets is very helpful, though I wish that we had received the feedback more in advance of exams. \r\nWeaknesses: The problem sets are quite lengthy, and sometimes redundant towards the end- I think that they could be paired down and then there could be optional questions to reinforce learning. These optional questions could help us review for exams.",
                "This course was pretty boring and hard to fully engage with. There was a lot of in class or in section practice with coding and interpreting regressions which was helpful. Problem sets were hard and would have appreciated more time going over them or taking about concepts.",
                "Strengths: interactive lecture, problem sets really help towards the exams, lots of office hours and really helpful TAs, lecture goes through challenging topics more slowly \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: JT can go over the same new topic in many different ways during lecture which can be helpful for some but if you understand it the first time it can be repetitive or can cause confusion",
                "JT is a great instructor who has clear teaching although he can go a little slow. I appreciate that he takes the time to really answer each person's questions. I think if you start the Psets on time and go into AQA 2 with a buddy who understood AQA 1's format, even if you didn't take AQA 1 (like me) you can still do okay in the course.",
                "Strength: potential applications to real life data analysis and research. Weaknesses: slides were not helpful, material moves very slowly, problem sets graded very slowly.",
                "one thing I think is great is the before class stories, but still I believe not opening up the lecture for online viewing can impact me or other students like me, if I cannot absorb everything in one go, it is impossible to check again until a few days before class.",
                "Strengths: JT is absolutely great, teaches interpretations of statistical outputs in a very easy and digestible way, psets are not hard and exams are a lot like the psets \r\nWeaknesses: maybe could work to make students more proficient in stata so that they can do commands without having to search up basic things",
                "Slides are very difficult to review from- i do wish key information or answers to rhetorical questions were provided in the slides.",
                "I loved this class! JT always engaged the class during lectures and had large Q&A portions as we worked through problems together, which made the material much more approachable. The discussion sections were also very helpful in solidifying my understanding of the subject.",
                "Strengths: This class prepares you to read research papers and conduct your own research. You learn when different types of tests are appropriate, allowing you to evaluate the researchers methodology, and you learn how to interpret the output from the researchers statistical analysis.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the underlying math of each analytical tool is brushed away. I felt like I knew how to use the different tools, and I knew how to interpret what they produced, but I didnt know what they were actually doing.",
                "This course covers a wide range of topics but focuses in on them in depth. It is extremely well-taught and engaging and JT distills the complex things we learn into easily-digestible material. I personally can't identify any weaknesses in this course.",
                "Professor Thomas is very clear at explaining, he has a proven method to consolidate knowledge through lecture, section, problem sets, and office hours. \r\nI really like that he emphasizes the use of plain English as it allows us to demonstrate how much we understand. However, I am sometimes lost in class with the amount of interventions from students. From certain participations I sometimes miss to understand what parts from my peers' responses are correct and which ones are not. Therefore, although I appreciate participation, I wish that summaries/ wrap ups were made more often to make sure that the whole class is on the same page.",
                "Strengths - clear explanation of concepts, lots of help through TAs\r\nWeaknesses - NA",
                "JT is really thorough in his teaching of the course and provides lots of opportunities for students to clarify concepts being taught in the class. The class is a great one for students looking to gain a firm grasp of stats fundamentals. You won't find a more engaging teacher than JT. That being said, because he tries to ensure that all questions get answered in class, we weren't able to finish some of the topics on the syllabus and it's a pity that there isn't another JT-taught follow-up class to go through what was left out."

                "Yes, I think everyone should take this class! JT is a great professor and you learn so much.",
                "This class is required for everyone who is taking it so I dont know that I need to recommend it. But I enjoyed it!",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is looking for an easy stats class. I think it might be possible to get a broader knowledge more efficiently through another course. However, I do think JT ensures that we truly understand the concepts he teaches.",
                "If they're not majoring in global affairs then theres no point to recommend this course to another student",
                "It's a fine requirement for the Global Affairs major, and you will learn a lot, but you should be prepared to be frustrated along the way. Lectures sometimes moved extremely slowly (they would get bogged down by unnecessarily long or repetitive answers to questions), such that we ended up not even getting to a bunch of the material we were supposed to cover. Problem sets can feel very repetitive, and it took an extremely long time to get feedback and grades back after submitting them. Perhaps most frustratingly, this class has a ridiculously large emphasis on correct and precise phrasing, which is reasonable, except that JT is not at all consistent with his wording in class - and then to make matters worse, the slides rarely actually have the correct phrasings (they just have questions asking for interpretations), so I was frequently unsure if my answers would receive full credit or not.",
                "Yes. Despite its issues its still a good quantitative class, and youll definitely remember the things you learn because theyre hammered in quite a lot",
                "requirement, else no",
                "Yes. If you are a global affairs major, this class teaches crucial skills.",
                "Yes, see above re applied multivariate course.",
                "Yes! Really great if you want to understand why concepts happen. JT does a great job of connecting all ideas back to the beginning of the course. It moves fast, though, so go to all lectures if you want the full benefit.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It teaches the fundamentals needed to interpret data accurately and reinforces learning through constant practice during PSET's and during lecture participation.",
                "I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to strengthen their understanding of statistical analysis. It is challenging at times, but I do think it provided a strong foundation in statistics that I'll be able to improve upon in the future.",
                "Yes, it is a wonderful way to gain basic and nuanced insights into the statistical tools required in the policymaking world. It develops your understanding of the quantative approaches to much of the material we have in the Global major.",
                "Certainly. JT is a fantastic professor and does a brillant job of teaching students and ensuring that everyone clearly and deeply understands every concept. The content of the class is very important for all people across all fields and is especially important for Global Students.",
                "I mean you have to take it. But JT is great, and they do a great job teacher.",
                "It's a requirement for GLBL, but beyond that...I mean JT is a source of joy and fun, groan-inducing dad jokes so I would definitely recommend it for that. I also thinks it's really valuable to know stats. And Jane was a great TA. I would say I would recommend the course, so long as the lecture is better-organized (as outlined above) and explanations in lecture are more clear.",
                "You will have to take this course if you are a Global Affairs major. AQA II is not the most intellectually-stimulating course, but it is necessary for you to understand data and extract actionable information from it. If you do take this course, be sure to get close to JT as he will go above and beyond to ensure that you come out of the class with an appreciation for data and will do his best to make learning about the subject as enjoyable as possible.",
                "No, I strongly believe that AQA II shouldnt be a required course for global affairs students. Global affairs encompasses so many different fields and job possibilities - to require AQA II is completely a waste of time for most students. While I concede that AQA I provides information and skills that everyone should know, the technicalities of AQA II is beyond the scopes that many GLBL students will ever have to utilize post undergraduate.",
                "I think for students who are preparing for a career in public or international policy, this class gives you exactly what you need in terms of quantitative skills. Thus for students looking to enter those career spaces, I would recommend this course. However, for students that want to delve deep into theory and statistical academia, I think this class would fall short for them.",
                "i would take it only if you're a global affairs student",
                "Yes, it gives much fuller picture of statistical analysis beyond 121.",
                "Yes, I would. Both JT and the TAs are very helpful and the class is taught very well. JT makes the material/class interesting even when its really dry stat material.",
                "Im really glad I was required to take this course. I think a lot of the regression content we learn will be applicable in a lot of future career paths.",
                "Yes.",
                "required for global affairs majors",
                "Yes, if you need the credit. The professor is genuinely great, and he is really committed to getting students through the slog of material.",
                "Yes, its the most engaging stats class Ive ever taken!",
                "It's required for GLBL so yes not otherwise.",
                "Highly recommend. Although it is for the global major, I really feel JT teaches the material very well and helped me better understand stats than the stats 100 series courses.",
                "It's a GLBL requirement, but I genuinely fell in love with statistics and the importance of being precise with the way you describe statistics. It's a useful skill for any future data analysis, and it's good to understand the different distributions and how things work.",
                "It's not that bad of a requirement, but it's worse than AQA I for sure. JT covers like half as much material, so each lecture is dragged out and it's hard to stay engaged. It's basically the same thing over and over again (interpreting coefficients in Stata output). JT's slides are also really awful this semester. But it's still more useful than the average Yale class, so it's not too awful of a requirement!",
                "I mean, this is a mandatory class, but JT makes everything an instant recommend.",
                "Absolutely",
                "Everyone has to take this for GLBL major so take it - JT makes a subject that can be boring the most interesting and understandable it can be",
                "Yes!! Now that Ive taken this class with JT, I am very confident in my ability to synthesize and quantitatively analyze any dataset using the tools he gave us. This has truly been the best stats/data analytics class Ive taken at Yale.",
                "If youre not a Global Major, no.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. The professor is super engaging and I feel like I learned a lot (in both quantity and quality). I also learned an important resume skill of data analysis, and am excited to see how I can use Stata more in the future. A lot of what we learned also felt very applicable to other courses I have taken, where being able to read regressions is very helpful.",
                "Highly recommend! Extremely enabling environment to learn an otherwise tricky quantitative course.",
                "Definitely!"
