                "I think it's a great course. Prof. Padro is incredible, and the material is consistently engaging. The one potential weakness is that the workload wasn't at all balanced. On the weeks you had your presentation or reading response, it was a ton of work, but most of the rest of the class was not much work at all. So that's something to keep in mind, but not necessarily a net negative. Also, the class tended to be very quiet, so often it was more of a lecture than a seminar, but that might just have been our particular group of people.",

                "Engaging professor",

                "Strengths: design of reading assignments allowed for closer attention to readings in some weeks and less in others, cool content, wonderful teaching and intuitive explanations \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of",
                "Strengths: readings, professor; weaknesses: random group of students in the class. I think it was meant to be more seminar style but it ended up just being presentations and Q&A/lecture. Professor Padro is really good at explaining things!"

So I can't say that the course would be better if it was more general, but it definitely felt very niche sometimes. I think that's the point though  we spent the class dissecting economic papers, one at a time, so that we could truly understand how these studies worked and how they came to their conclusions. In essence, it's a class that teaches you how economic research happens. So I would recommend this to another student if this is what they're looking for. \r\nAlso, the workload is really doable and professor Padro is hilarious and so engaging.",
                "Yes! The content is interesting, of course, but the best part is that it's sneakily a really good way to learn about econometrics and economics in an applied setting which makes everything much easier to understand.",
                "Yes, you should defintley take it.",
                "Yes if you really enjoy econometrics and looking at modern conflicts through a econometric lens.",
                "Yes! Especially for EPE students",
                "I really dont recommend this course. Student presentations make up the first 3/4 of every class, which are just summaries of the readings. Padro then takes questions for the latter 1/4, and he does not leave room for any discussion. That said, it is never clear what that discussion should involveif someone mentions a problem with a paper, Padro immediately jumps in with his opinion about the validity of the objection, rather than allowing genuine discussion/debate among students. \r\n\r\nPadro is also a punitive grader that does not offer specific steps for improvement; I feel like my grade was determined as soon as I stepped in the room. He refuses to help students understand the readings (many of which are written poorly/unclearly) before class, and he also does not ever explain what he considers to be an excellent paper. I never felt like any of my hard work translated into my grades. I regret spending so much time on all of his assignments.",
                "Yes. This course is taught by the most engaging undergraduate economics professor at Yale. Professor Padro is truly a gem in the field of economics professor and taking a class with him is a terrific experience.",
                "Yes! If you are at all interested in applied economics, this is a very fun course with a very reasonable workload where you will also learn a lot about empirical research designs",
                "Yes... with caution? Our group discussion was quite bland but it wasn't Professor's fault. I think we tried but we aren't too good at econometrics and I think that was frustrating to our Prof. ?",
                "Yes, if you're interested in the topic. Even if you're not, you'll learn along the way about economic experiment development and correlates of the economics of conflict.",
                "Solid senior seminar for economics, the professor is clearly super knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, and has a great sense of humor which made class enjoyable. \r\nI would, however, advise against taking this class if you (like me) are not particularly interested in econometrics. The material can be quite challenging, and between the 9:25am class time and long presentations it can become hard to stay focused.",
