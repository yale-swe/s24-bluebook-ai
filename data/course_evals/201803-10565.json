    "We created a poster series, zine, and animated gif for this course, so we practiced a fairly wide range of skills, from typography to bookmaking to informational hierarchy. In particular, I learned how to navigate the balance between being too minimalistic (in other words : boring) and too complex (in other words: overwhelming).",
    "How to create a cohesive system of work that has independent pieces but still shares a visual\/thematic language.",
    "In this class, students were asked to explore a theme (most turned out to be politically oriented) through 3 related projects (poster series, pamphlet, and video loop). Advanced skills for graphic design were focused on through weekly critique."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: Liked how we got to focus on a single theme throughout the whole semester and create work that responded to this theme. \r\nWeakness: I wish the course was organized so that we could contribute and receive more peer feedback. I felt that most of the four hours consisted of Julian solely giving crits. While I respect Julian's eye, this made the feedback we received a bit one-sided\/one-dimensional. It also seems really exhausting for Julian himself. Would've loved to have received feedback from the many talented designers in the room.",
    "This class was well-structured and well-taught for the most part. The biggest place to improve would be the speed of critiques, which tended to be on the longer side, forcing non-critique content (ex. example works) to be looked over at home or class to be extended."

   "comments": [
    "It is a good graphic design course that consolidates everything you learned in previous design courses. However, compared to previous design courses, it feels a bit like anticlimax. You design a series of posters, a short book and a short animation loop -- something that you have done many times before. It is more about refining your skills rather than learning something new. Julian is a great instructor who pushes his students beyond their comfort zones, so in one way or another you will become a better, more sophisticated designer after taking his course.",
    "Yes, take it! It will push you to think at a larger scale in regards to design.",
    "This is a great course in the progression of graphic design classes. I would recommend this class to students who have taken some of the lower-level graphic design courses and are interested in taking more."
