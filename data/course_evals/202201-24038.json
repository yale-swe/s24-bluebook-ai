                "History of Soviet and Russian policies surrounding race and ethnicity, overall questions about race and racialization, comparison with race in the US, how to read anthropological work.",
                "Before this course, I had only ever taken one anthropology course, and it was very narrowly focused, so a lot of the methodological concepts that we touched on in Professor Woodard's class, including linguistic anthropology, were completely new to me. I came into the course having spent several years learning about Russia and other countries in the post-Soviet space, both in the classroom and on study abroad. What I appreciated most about it was how I left the course with the language to describe things I had observed on my trips abroad that struck me as racially motivated but lacked the framework to contextualize or make sense of at the time. Overall, this course was an excellent corrective to a broader reluctance in our field to talk about race in reference to the Soviet Union and how non-Russians are perceived and treated in Russia today. The conceptual and methodological frameworks that this course provided became all the more necessary following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine because of how the ideas and portrayals that we discussed in this course have been, and still are, deployed to justify war against Ukraine.",
                "In many ways, this course was a methodological revelation for me. I am familiar with Russia and the post-Soviet space, but I was unaware of the racial and racist issues in the region. For me, the gradual analysis of the evolution of attitudes toward \"the other\" in the region has been especially enlightening."

                "I think that this course would be better if it had a tighter focus or more discrete themes.",
                "The discussions for the course were very engaging.  The format of doing reading responses in order to prepare for a final paper was very helpful and I felt like my final project was a culmination of the work I had done in the course.",
                "Aside from the material, one of the things that made this course so effective was Professor Woodard fostering a collaborative learning environment by asking us to create a community agreement at the start of the semester and then, as the instructor, keeping this agreement in mind as a discussion facilitator. I think this practice helped encourage people to be intentional about how their contributions to class discussions would help the group think through difficult material.",
                "The course's methodological structure and selection of literature are commendable, especially considering that it was based on the most common and recent works on the subject. As a historian, I had the pleasure of spending an entire seminar working with primary sources, which also gave me access to the Yale Library. \r\nThis course was interdisciplinary and fundamentally exceeded my expectations, making it difficult for me to identify its flaws."

The topics discussed in this course are necessary, I think, for a more nuanced understanding of how race operates in Russia and can manifest differently across the world depending on the cultural and historical context. This course is really timely, and Professor Woodard did an excellent job of making the course accessible to students with varying levels of regional and anthropological knowledge.",
