                "Lectures were solid, office hours hosted by ULAs were very helpful, psets were sometimes quite confusing but overall were manageable.",

                "The instructor did not hold regular office hours and did not record lectures. Studying felt 100% reliant on notes since the department did not approve of ULA lead office hours or review sessions during the exam week. \r\nCourse material was pretty decent though. Wish we got to RSA encryption.",
                "The class was always very consistent: the psets were all similar, the class itself was taught on a blackboard, and the exams were digestible given the practice ones. Still, I found it very hard to focus during lectures because of the way it was taught, and there was no way to go back and re-watch any recordings of the lecture or see the same examples on the board.",
                "There are plenty of office hours sessions to help facilitate student learning. However, I wish that the lectures could have been recorded.",
                "Prof was great at explaining the concepts but I hoped there were more examples of how they are applied.",
                "None",
                "Lectures were very clear and psets are short yet very helpful. I wish we had covered more material, but overall very good course",
                "The major strength of this course is that it had very clear expectations and no surprises. The material taught in class was the only material you have to know and there is a weekly problem set that really captured all of the relevant topics. The only improvement I would make is that the tests were quite easy making the curve very difficult if you make any stupid mistakes. I would rather have very difficult tests where scoring in the 70s is an A rather than easy tests where making one mistake drops you to an A-.",
                "A little bit more content on how what we are learning is implemented in the real world would be cool.",
                "None of the classes were recorded, so this made it really difficult to catch up if you missed a day since the class material tended to transition very quickly. That being said, the class material itself was quite interesting, as it provides a good purview of multiple mathematical topics.",
                "I think the Professor is going too fast on the material, but overall the Professor teaches the material good",
                "The strengths of the course include the organization of the course, the number of resources provided for the course, the vast amount of office hours available, and the problem sets that require a lot of thought but help you to understand the concepts more deeply. The weaknesses of the course are that quite often, the problem sets covered topics that weren't covered in great detail in class, which made them pretty challenging and required help from the TAs more often than not, and that the resources available for the final exam review weren't as comprehensive as for the midterm, which made preparing more difficult.",
                "More office hour times especially during reading week would be helpful. The final was unexpectedly hard and not comparable to the midterm or problem sets assigned.",
                "The course material was taught with many examples, which was perfect for me. Learning through examples is a great way to really understand the concepts and puts you in a much better position to tackle the problem sets and exams.",
                "this covers a lot of content without much depth in any of it",
                "Well organized since there's not too much content. More of the course could be digitized considering the nature of the content",

                "Strengths: fun psets, good OHs \r\nWeaknesses: lecture was unengaging",
                "Strengths:\r\nProf Bridy is a clear lecturer\r\nThe topics covered until the midterm were taught really well\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI feel like some of the material covered in the 75 min lectures could have been covered in 30 minutes\r\nNo good sample finals were made available -- everyone I know thought that preparing for the final was really difficult and challenging. There was not enough prep material, the textbook wasn't helpful, and I think the concepts taught in class didn't feel sufficient enough to enable us to answer a lot of the questions on the final. It is unfortunate because I am sure had we received more preparation time and material, or if the final was made into a 24 hour / take home final as done in the previous years, our understanding of the concepts would have been clearer and the performance better.",
                "I think this course was excellent. Pacing and lectures were great, homeworks and exams were fair. Nothing to improve.",
                "The content was presented in a very straightforward way and was well-presented. However, it could have been more engaging.",
                "It is a lecture, so therefore has the immediate weakness of a huge class size; that said, there are a lot of available office hours and ULAs.",
                "Professor Bridy is absolutely amazing with the clarity in which he teaches. All the problem sets are to the point and easily digestable. I had no problems with this course whatsoever.",
                "strengths: clear lectures and assignments",
                "The course moved at a good pace and was well-taught. We didn't end up getting to some material, but I thought we moved at a good pace that allowed me to balance my work in other classes.",
                "Strengths - PSETs are good, appropriate level of challenge and relevant to the materials taught in the course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the course doesn't really teach you *how* do to anything - much of lecture is spent walking through examples in a somewhat disorganized way, and the onus of extracting exactly what problem solving methods are being taught and when to use them falls entirely upon the student.\r\nAlso, the level of mathematical rigor required to do a \"proof\" was left very unclear, nor was it ever explained exactly what a \"proof\" is - two details that I felt were quite important for a proof-based class.\r\n\r\nI think the two best ways this course needs to be improved are a) dedicate some time to teaching exactly what it means to \"prove\" something and decide on a consistent format for proofs, and b) instead of going through three very similar examples for a specific theorem, teach the theorem directly and then follow with one example.",
                "Perhaps this was the intent of the course, but by covering so many topics, it ended up covering no topic in any real depth. Another issue is that the study of mathematical logic took up a disproportionate amount of time in my opinion, leaving little time for topics like combinatorics and number theory."

The second half of the class was a whole other ball game though.
