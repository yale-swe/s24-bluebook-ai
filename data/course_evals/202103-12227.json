Also, the week-and-a-half-ly programming assignments definitely improved by programming (especially plotting) skills.",

                "Strengths: each of the topics taught are presented without shirking away from the complicated math behind it, which helped cement the concepts further. The course is also well-structured, and covers a lot of ground each week without simply providing surface-level introductions to each concept. Weaknesses: the biggest downside of this course for me was definitely Prof Korenaga's refusal to share lecture notes, which made it much harder to review and follow along with the concepts discussed in class. Even though we weren't directly tested on these concepts since there was no midterm or final exam, it still would have been nice to have a set of notes to follow along with.",
                "The content is great! Sometimes the context of how the theoretical concepts tie in to the examples (and the theoretical foundation of the applications) is not so well fleshed out, but this is also not the focus of the course. Providing more background for the examples would help with continuity, but maybe isn't necessary",
                "The format of 3 days per week is a little annoying, so going down to two days might be better for most students. I also think the classroom felt a little unwelcoming at times, so maybe spending some time to introduce ourselves at the beginning of the year and forming study groups might help with that."

                "If you're interested in some cool techniques that are rather broadly applicable to systems that elude a simple theoretical explanation, take this course. Although Prof Korenaga does keep you on your toes with challenging homework assignments, they truly help you understand the concepts taught, and you will come out of the course with a set of tools that you won't forget for a while to come.",
