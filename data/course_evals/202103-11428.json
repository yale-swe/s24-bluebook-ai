                "Learn about mortgages, the causes of the financial crisis, the history of eminent domain, how to value real estate and assess whether a property would be a good acquisition or not, the history of racial segregation in real estate.",
                "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The first half of the course explores: origins of the concept of property, financial literacy about mortgages, the housing crisis of 2008, housing discrimination, and eminent domain. The second half of the course explores: real estate finance, basic Excel modeling, and real estate investment analysis.",
                "Learned about property rights, the 2008 financial crisis, real estate investing",
                "I learned about the history of real estate, the discourse about the American Dream and how to evaluate/model a real estate investment.",
                "I learned a great deal about real estate, property rights, and investing. It was also very insightful to play around with basic financial models. I also learned that there's a lot about real estate that I don't know about and can definitely see the teaching in this class leading me to a lifetime of learning.",

                "No weaknesses. Great course and very well thought out. You learn so much valuable information about real estate, mortgages, the 2008 crisis. The information is just so foundational that Im grateful I actually got a more formal education in it",
                "Really great class. Only weakness is that sometimes the discussions weren't particularly engaging or felt dominated by certain individuals, but I really really enjoyed the seminar. Professor Powers is this class's biggest strength!",
                "Strengths: fun assignments, great guest lectures from the ex-President of Fannie Mae and the attorneys in the Kelo v. New London Supreme Court Case, motivating class discussions, interesting readings\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "There was a good range of topics, but I feel the financial investing portion could have used more introduction before writing our first essay on it",
                "I enjoyed the seminar style of this course and how open the professor was to questions and discussions after class. A very welcoming environment for all people with different levels/experience with real estate. I thought the reading responses were helpful to guide learning and absorb the material because they were reflection pieces. I thought the cases and final essay were good opportunities to reflect. However, I thought the case assignments were a bit difficult because we weren't taught how to extensively model. I struggled with those essays a bit, however, the professor did not require the case evaluations to provide models, though I would've liked more organized lessons going through the technicals in greater detail.",
                "Professor Powers is the greatest strength of this course. He is fantastic at creating a seminar environment and organizing the discussion in the class. Having taken many seminars in the past, I definitely felt that I took a lot out of this class because the discussions and teaching was effective and fruitful.",
                "I think that Professor Powers was the main strength in this course. He was very engaged and it was very clear that he was really invested in all of us. He would always offer to chat more with us after class and dive into whatever aspects of the material we are interested in. He also engaged a lot with our reading responses. The only weakness of the course is that I thought that the assignments were often unclear. There wasnt a good set of directions and I often didnt know what was expected.",
                "In terms of strengths, I think Professor Powers is the best professor to teach a course like this. He offers a lot of personal insights and is a very good lecturer and very understanding of his students. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses in my opinion.",
                "The course was truly incredible, though conversation could perhaps be more fruitful if more structured. Perhaps guiding questions for each class could be helpful."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to any Yale student",
                "YES. If you get in, definitely take it. The Professor is very engaging and you learn so much valuable information. The class is very laid back and pretty low stress. Theres no tests, just a handful of case studies/essays. The case studies were kinda fun to do too! One was collaborative which I loved. Since its a small seminar, you get to know some people in the class well. The Professor invites you to eat at Yorkside / Claires after class each time which is such a neat opportunity to get to know him and your classmates better. Overall 10/10",
                "Yes! I am glad that I took the course and it was relatively little work, also. Professor Powers is fantastic and really cares about his students -- he took us to Yorkside, Claire's, etc after class and we could talk about anything with him (related to real estate + finance or not), which was really nice. Sometimes the material wasn't incredibly engaging but I think it covered really important topics that everyone should know and gave really great information about the financial crisis. Also had absolutely amazing guest speakers. It's a great introduction to the finance side of real estate if you want that, but you also don't have to be super experienced with / interested in finance to enjoy the class.",
                "Yes!!! If you're at all interested in real estate, take this class. If your only interest in real estate is looking at Zillow listings, still take this class. Professor Powers is awesome -- so many great anecdotes and so much industry experience and so personable. The assignments--all manageable--are short bi-weekly reading responses, a 1000 word paper on the mortgage crisis, two 1000 word business-school style case-based essays determining whether or not a particular person should invest in a property, and a 2000-3000 word final paper on a subject of your choice. The course is accessible to people with all levels of finance backgrounds (read: you don't have to know a thing about Excel in order to do well). You will walk away with a foundational framework and acumen for evaluating real estate properties and great context about about the real estate markets' past, present, and future. Yale's college seminars are hidden gems -- make sure you don't miss out on Role of Real Estate in Society & Economy.",
                "Yes, if youre interested in real estate or law!",
                "Yes, definitely take it if you have the opportunity to. A great course with a very experienced, and welcoming professor. I really enjoyed the discussions about real estate as well as the Professor's experience in the field. It made me think about my future in real estate as well as redefining what I truly want outside of what I am told is the American Dream. It's a lowkey seminar that wasn't too stressful as long as you did the readings and kept up with the essays. We had cool visitors speak to the class too for different units which I found very interesting.",
                "Absolutely recommend. If you're interested in this topic, look no further. The opportunity to learn from and converse with Professor Powers is reason alone to take the class.",
                "Yes I would!! I learned so much about the 2008 crisis and as someone with no knowledge about real estate, I learned a bit about real estate investment and how feasible it is. The best part about this course was Professor powers though! He is an amazing and engaging professor.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course. It was one of the most applicable courses Ive taken at Yale because it offered actual insights for my life after college (owning a house, how to go about getting a good mortgage etc)",
                "Yes",
                "Absolutely, the knowledge and skills developed in this course are essential to any potential home owner."
