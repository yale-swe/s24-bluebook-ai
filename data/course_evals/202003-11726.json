                "The TF sessions and live virtual sessions were very helpful because we could ask questions about whatever material we did not understand in recorded lectures. The strengths of this course are that both Prof. Aizenbud and the TF (Abhinav) were so knowledgeable and extremely patient and understanding of us being enrolled off-campus.",
                "The video lectures were a little slow - I feel like more live material and less recorded would have helped the course.",
                "Strengths- the professor and TA were always available for office hours\r\nWeaknesses- the asynchronous lectures could have been more engaging. I would have also liked to have learn more about the applications of the linear algebra.",
                "The class was as good as it could be with the circumstances, posting practice exams for midterms and finals would have been helpful.",
                "Pre-recorded lectures were good but it was hard to ask questions if there was any confusion. It would have been better to have a Piazza page or some method students could easily ask questions. There weren't many practice problems for exams and this would have helped to learn. Additionally, no answer keys for the HWs were released either, making it hard to study well.",
                "There are no positives to this course. The lectures are not engaging at all and appear to be completely unrehearsed, the order in which concepts are introduced is nonsensical, the homework assignments are tangentially related to the exams at best, we are hardly given any practice\/review material for the exams, they test some material that is way beyond the scope of anything we've learned, and I could go on with even more places for improvement. My most straightforward suggestion would be to structure this course more similarly to MATH 120, which had ample review material, clear lectures and homework assignments, and fair assessments.",
                "Strengths- well organized, profs are clear about expectations, and the pre-recorded lectures were well done. \r\nCons- profs are not accommodating, 2 midterms and a final seems a bit over the top, and the fact that the profs had a pset due on the first sunday of thanksgiving break AND the sunday before we returned from break was honestly absurd considering we had not had a break for 12 weeks.",
                "The recorded lectures were sometimes rather long which made it difficult to engage with them.",
                "I think this course could have been improved by adding more applications. Least-squares fitting and difference equations were the only topics I remember applying, and that wasn't until the second half of the semester. This is a shame, because a lot of the things we did earlier in the semester--solving linear systems, for example--have lots of real-world uses. The course would have felt more immediately useful if more of the problem set questions had been phrased as word problems, even if the underlying math was the exact same.\r\n\r\nOne strength is that the problem sets and exams felt very reasonable in terms of difficulty, and it was very clear what to study for exams.",
                "This course did provide a good introduction to linear algebra. I would say that the teaching was poor. The video lectures were difficult to understand, not because the math was difficult, just from generally poor communication. No connections were really drawn between topics, and terms would be thrown around without having been defined. The live lectures were sort of helpful but very sporadic because they tried to cover several days of material in minutes. Honestly, the most helpful and interesting day of the entire semester was one of the last videos where there was an actual application of linear algebra (I don't really think this course should be called linear algebra with applications, but only have one application).",
                "more engaging course",
                "strengths: material is organized well. I liked the recorded videos and the fact that there were several each week but they were short. Homework was always achievable. First midterm and final were pretty kind toward anyone who studied a fair amount. \r\nweaknesses: I thought Prof Lindenbaum's videos got kinda confusing, especially towards the end. Fortunately I had some linear background coming in, but if I hadn't, I would have felt like the course was not contextualized well. It seems like we're just getting a lot of facts thrown at us without really learning the fundamentals behind it. But maybe I should've taken 225.",
                "I believe that more in-class exercises would have been more helpful to teaching the class.",
                "I think I would've preferred to have the lectures live in order to ask questions as we went rather than meet only for 30 minutes. I feel like I understand things better when I ask questions while I'm barely learning the material, not reviewing it. I also wish we'd received clear feedback on our psets and midterms.",
                "This course had several sources for help, and despite the unique circumstances, was very flexible. That being said, the course fell flat in being an almost completely recorded class. My engagement with this class was at an all-time low, and this class felt like an afterthought when compared to my other live classes. The lectures felt somewhat rushed, and I think more care could have been taken to ensure that lecture material and corresponding assignments were more staggered. I ended up watching the videos as I did the assignments, and did not feel as though I was forming a solid understanding of the concepts. \r\n\r\nIn regards to the assignments, the length was often much longer than other STEM\/Math classes of this difficulty. The difficulty of the homework questions often did not match what was discussed in the lecture videos, and more often than not, I would have to reference some obscure source to even begin to grasp the problem. \r\n\r\nRegarding the exams, I feel as though the two midterms were not representative of the material that we went over in class. When talking to other students in the course, I found that the majority of the people that I talked to did not do well on either midterm. Regardless, they were weighted at 40% of our final grade and were not curved at all. The amount and complexity of the material on the exams did not at all match the homework assignments, and I felt largely unprepared for them. I was satisfied with the format that the exams took, being open for 24 hours (31 hours for the final exam), and felt that this was a good change to accommodate differing circumstances. \r\n\r\nCommunication overall was sporadic at best. One of the resources that I took most advantage of this semester was solution documents, to have examples of a problem that I could reference. The teaching fellow for this course led a discussion section that seemed largely unhelpful in this regard. His 'solutions' were often nothing more than scribbles. The one session that I did attend, however, was not much more helpful, as everyone sat in silence attempting the problems on their own. The solution files for the midterms, taken in October and November, were released 24 hours before the final, making them less useful as a resource for that exam. The level of communication is best summarized by the final exam date being 'changed' and the new date only being referenced in a standard, forgettable canvas announcement. It was not at all highlighted or specified, and I was only informed through a peer.\r\n\r\nOverall, I am very dissatisfied with this course. I was told by a peer that this class acts as a 'weed-out' course for the math major. If this is the case, then it is doing a wonderful job in that regard. This class failed to dynamically adapt to its students as the semester progressed, and I always felt as if I had to put double the effort to stay up to date on material that was better explained by a free to watch course series on youtube.",
                "This class definitely could have been improved. For one, there was never enough time for the exams it seemed. Myself and many students felt the same, especially when we also had to upload everything onto gradescope (which often was extremely slow to upload the results). I also found having two different lecturers giving the lectures made Tsing notes seem inconsistent from week to week, due to their different styles",
                "Communication was poor and students didn't know when exams were taking place",
                "The strength of this course was the pace at which material was coveredit moved quickly but reasonably so that the majority of the material was covered thoroughly. The weakness was the structure of the lecturesconcepts were difficult to understand at first and often given little to no explanation before moving onto proofs, and often no examples were done in lecture so it was difficult to begin problem sets without any foundation of examples. Also, we were only given feedback on points missed on problem sets with no answer key to check our procedures for questions we got correctly.",
                "Strengths: TA was extremely helpful in reinforcing concepts, answering questions and providing practice material\r\nWeaknesses: recorded video format didn't always make concepts super clear",
                "Strengths: problem sets were not too long, TA was extremely helpful\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the explanations given by the professors were somewhat unclear, and it was necessary to go to discussion to understand what was happening",
                "Strengths: It is structured very logically in that later chapters build nicely on the fundamentals from previous chapters. Weaknesses: Later chapters are not as thoroughly explained before expected mastery.",

                "The lectures NEED to be edited or rehearsed more. Nothing against the professors personally, but I felt they were pretty unprofessional in how they went about lecturing and it rarely felt like there was a greater point or direction to the videos. Also, they need to hire more peer tutors\/TA's, as one guy literally carrying the entire class on his back is completely unfair to both him and all of the students.",
                "I thought the combination of pre-recorded lectures and live sessions was really helpful. However, I wish the professors could be more accommodating, especially considering the fact that we are living through such an incredibly stressful time. We could not turn in psets late for credit, and the justification for this was that the lowest pset grade would be dropped. This seems really counterintuitive to learning as there is no incentive to make up late\/missing work. It also seems kind of absurd to only allow students leniency on one week. I really wish the profs could have been more understanding and accommodating, and I think the cutthroat nature of the math department in general is why so many people steer clear of it.",
                "I thought that the recorded lectures worked well. I liked that each week had 5-6 shorter videos instead of 1-2 longer videos. This made the work feel more manageable, and it was easier to go back and find specific topics in the videos.\r\nI felt that we could have made better use of the synchronous time during class. Especially towards the beginning of the semester, the live sessions were often reviews of the material, which felt repetitive. The professor usually didn't stop for questions, so it wasn't much different than watching a prerecorded lecture, but with content we'd already covered. The live sessions where we did example problems were more useful than the times when we did recap.",
                "I think that the recorded lecture\/live lecture format was honestly very difficult for students. With my experience of math classes near the size of our sections (~30 people), there can be a dialogue between the professor and students. 100% recorded lectures fully stop this dialogue, that in my opinion, actually facilitates learning and understanding. The 30 minute live lectures were rushed and difficult to follow. They often jumped between topics, and we'd usually run out of time to cover everything. I don't think I can ever take another virtual math class unless it's much better than this. It was extremely difficult to learn in this format, and I often had to rely on the internet to actually understand what was happening. Very few examples were shown, which I think is critical to understanding- and almost no examples similar to pset or test questions were ever shown.",
                "I liked the system of recorded lectures and then a short in-person meeting. I think Prof. Aizenbud (my prof) was always very welcoming about questions so even though we didn't have a lot of time with him, I thought the level of engagement was totally fine for me.",
                "I think one of the shortcomings was the half-hour length of the class. A longer length (1:15) would have helped for furthering students understandings of concepts.",
                "I really liked that the instructors agreed to have midterms open for 24 hours. I think that having live lectures (and recording them, of course) would allow for better engagement and understanding.",
                "Recorded lectures were widely accessible, but without any supplemental material, became more difficult to understand. The ability to take the exam at any point within a day was well-implemented. I think that this course would have benefitted more from additional sessions with the professor.",
                "I found having the lectures prerecorded saved people a lot of time. We could go back to them whenever we wanted, fast forward, etc",
                "In general, I found the prerecorded lectures to be helpful, as I was able to take notes at my own pace, and even rewind to better understand a concept. However, I felt that the live sessions added very little to the learning experience, as most of what was noted came directly from the prerecorded lectures without elaboration or example.",
                "Making the exams open note and allowing students to pick an hour long block in a 24 hours period worked really well",
                "I liked the idea of doing recorded lectures and then shorter in-person live classes, but I feel like there could have been more focus on solving example problems during the live classes rather than restating what was in the videos.",
                "I believe that the short live virtual lectures were inefficient as they were only 30 minutes long each and did not cover much material. In addition, I believe that the organization of the class could be better. Homework solutions were never posted and homework grades did not come out until after the exams were taken. In addition, many of the practice exams did not give out solutions until the very last minute, which was very stressful.",
                "The use of pre-recorded lectures helped guide the week's discussion and helped to clear up confusions throughout the week."

                "I would recommend this course for students who just want to learn computation-based linear algebra, rather than proofs and theoretical linear algebra.",
                "I would recommend this course - although it didn't translate as well virtually, the material was solid and is applicable for all STEM majors.",
                "Yes, it was a straight forward explanation of linear algebra with some applications.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who needs to take it. It was fairly straightforward and it's easy to find hep when you need it.",
                "Yes, if you have to take it for AMTH\/MATH\/S&DS major. (Because you have to.) If you don't have to take this class for your major, I don't know how much you'll gain\/learn\/carry on after this class. There are fundamental ideas in this course that are important like eigenvalues\/eigenvectors and SVD but only in higher-level class I believe you'll actually use these concepts in applicable settings.",
                "Absolutely not. Even if this is a required course for you, please do yourself a favor and wait to take in when we return to in-person learning. This is by far the worst course I have taken at Yale and I highly doubt it will improve significantly with this set of instructors.",
                "No, unless it's required for a major.",
                "Depends. I don't particularily like linear algebra, but the instructor was good. I would recommend not taking it virtual though.",
                "I didn't find the course very engaging, but I did learn linear algebra, which was why I took the course.\r\nI chose Math 222 over Math 225 because I was hoping that we would cover more applications or learn computational tricks that aren't mentioned in 225. However, we mentioned very few applications, and I doubt we covered much that isn't in 225.",
                "Yep, a necessary prerequisite for many S&DS and CS classes",
                "I would not recommend taking this course unless you have to. In my opinion, it was poorly taught and you don't learn any \"applications\" like the course title would suggest. Concepts weren't really explained well and lots of vocab was thrown around without ever having been defined. The virtual format was quite honestly terrible.",
                "maybe, if you want to learn some linear algebra",
                "I'm not the best person to ask because I have some background in linear, but overall yeah I thought the course was fine. Low-stress. The teaching is sometimes opaque\/not contextualized enough, but the material is pretty straightforward. The exams don't do you dirty, unlike some other math classes.",
                "I would tell students that the class was okay.",
                "Do not take this course if it is not a necessary prerequisite for another class. It is largely dependent on self-teaching, at least in a virtual setting. There is virtually no feedback or direct communication, and it is intensive for a class that should not require this level of work.",
                "I would only recommend this course to someone who need to learn linear algebra as a prerequisite for some other class",
                "No the instruction was not helpful.",
                "If you need to take linear algebra (or a general upper-level math course) for your major, I would recommend this courseit moves fast at first, and exams were quite difficult, but overall there are many interesting and useful concepts presented that are important for many STEM fields. However, definitely get together a study\/pset group and go to discussion section, because this course is tough without the support!",
                "Yes, it is a straightforward class that teaches you what you need to know about the basics of linear algebra.",
                "Yes. Linear algebra is very interesting and useful in various disciplines.",
                "absolutely not, class was very poorly taught. i had to self learn everything from other resources",
                "I would recommend this course. The material will be very helpful in other courses. I believe all Yale students should take this course."
