In sum, this class gave me the ability to critically think about what a wide variety of decorative arts embody and tell us about the world and people which made them, used them, and now have them.",

The scope of the course is huge and ambitious, but Prof. Cooke never tries to encompass everything everywhere. He instead presents some of the dominant forms of art and their circulation around the world at different points in history. I especially enjoyed the later lectures, which were about broader themes like memory, appropriation, collection, and many other interesting ideas. I've started noticing the materials and details of objects and furniture around me and have surprised myself when I automatically perform a mini analysis of how the object might have been made and what historical and cultural trends might have influenced how it was made and what it looks like."

                "The lectures can sometimes be a little on the longer side it would be great if there were more detailed slides that we can take notes off of, instead of having to constantly pause and rewind the lectures to re-watch and re-listen to take down notes.",
                "Strengths: the lectures were so interesting, and Professor Cooke's live sections were really nice to join and engage with the material more\r\nWeaknesses: I did not like how we were never given good examples of labels to look at.",
                "Strengths: Covered a wide variety of types of decorative arts from around the world, giving an understanding of how interconnected different goods are and how globally influenced many goods were. Knowledge of materials helped ground future discussion as allowed for us to think about an important aspect of decorative arts, the body and its use, which isn't as focused on in certain other art forms. Related the material to the world today and fostered a sense of awareness of one's material world, allowing a greater appreciation of the material and design choices surrounding us. Sections allowed for careful analysis of specific items which helped actually apply some of the skills from lecture and readings.\r\nWeaknesses: I think label-writing assignment were good ways to practice concise and careful writing following the themes of the course, but I think it would have been helpful to have an assignment where we did a more formal analysis to get practice thinking in a more structured and comprehensive way than the short labels allowed for us.",
                "I thought the virtual format was really hard  Professor Cooke and my teaching fellow Manon were great, but it was hard to stay engaged",
                "strengths: interesting and engaging material. Really enjoyable and useful assignments. \r\nweaknesses: I personally did not like the recorded lecture format. I felt like it was often difficult to pay attention\/keep up.",
                "The sections were the best part of the course. There were too many videos each week to watch, so it was easy to fall behind. For each lecture (twice a week) there was also a material\/construction video to watch. It was hard to know what was necessary and what wasn't despite everything being valuable to learn!",
                "I think that the discussion sections ran too short and we didn't have enough time to discuss everything we had to say.",
                "There were a lot of lectures and content to get through and with a lot of it being on zoom, it was very easy to do the bare minimum required instead of going really in depth with everything and getting to enjoy the course. The sections were small and helped to get the bigger ideas of what we were expected to know.",
                "The first half of the course focuses on mediums and methods while the second half focuses more on abstract themes like \"surface\" and \"memory.\" The first series of lectures is remarkable and extremely well laid out while the second half lectures are almost incomprehensible in places. If I could make some changes to the course, I would eliminate the second half of lectures entirely or at least substantially reorganize them to have a clearer roadmap. Also, eliminating at least some of the readings, especially in the second half of the course, would be a great way to reduce frustration with the course. Please also remove at least one of the label assignments. They were not especially useful and consumed a shocking amount of time for only being 150 words long.",
                "Strengths: extremely engaging material. Sections and open forums always helped to answer my questions and keep me completely interested. Both Professor Cooke and Ms. Miraval facilitated my concerns about being a remote student\/ a student with accommodations. The material was made very accessible in the lectures and readings, which were easy to understand and covered very thoroughly. Completely changed my perspective of art history and enriched my understanding of the subject\/ world\/other cultures. \r\nWeaknesses: I think the only weakness was the volume of readings we were expected to complete for each unit. This was just a little difficult with 3 hours of lectures, a section video, and the two classes every week. I think the load was extra intense simply because of the virtual nature of the class, as Id imagine that usually the lectures would be done in class, so the readings would be the only homework. Even so, it was hard to balance it all and required careful management."

                "Open-forums were nice, they allowed questions to be raised and answered by the professor which otherwise might not have been thought about. With recorded lectures though, sometimes the amount of time required just for the lectures\/open-forums\/sections\/section-videos added up really quickly, especially in the first half of the semester, so maybe doing the open-forums every-other-week would be better (but I am not sure)?\r\nEverything else was good, though the section videos (which were of objects from the YAUG being handled) often had a little bit too much redundant information, so maybe the objects discussed could be integrated into the recorded lectures instead of being an entirely different video.",

                "The recorded lecture portion was extremely helpful, but the additional section videos and readings were a bit much to handle.",
                "I liked the asynchronous lectures because they could be done on my own time and thus were very accommodating of my situation as a remote student. I think the weekly sections were IMMENSELY helpful in clearing up any questions and also going deeper into the wide range of material presented in the videos. I loved the section videos especially because they gave us the closest taste of the museum, which is obviously very important in a class like this about material knowledge and objects. The open forums were great for questions and clarifications, although I never understood whether or not they were mandatory (I attended all of them anyways). As for section, it felt like any normal class; Ms. Miraval really facilitated our virtual learning well. The presentations were excellent and important study tools, and break out rooms in section allowed for deeper discussion and learning."

I think I got the foundational tools to think about a wide-variety of decorative arts from around the world while also thinking about how those objects reflect on our world today. Prof. Cooke does an excellent job making the items come alive through interconnections and histories.",

Having knowledge of the processes behind the creation of items we use every day made me appreciate my surroundings more. Be aware that the second half lectures are disjointed and don't make that much sense upon first viewing, so pay close attention in section.",
                "Yes! I would recommend it to any student because it is such a unique perspective of art history that is SO important and crucial to the subject. The material is also extremely relevant to our lives as consumers, making students more aware of their purchases\/their origins and how they interact with materials and objects. It has taught me so much about sustainability and respect for other people and cultures. Even for non-art history majors, this class would be an amazing way to have a look into major networks and other countries\/cultures. It has given me so much respect for makers and local traditions\/knowledge and has made me a more curious learner. It gives you insight into parts of the world that are often overlooked or not prioritized in art history (which often favors the painting over the object) and thus makes you aware of these incredible people and communities that uphold markets and art history.",
