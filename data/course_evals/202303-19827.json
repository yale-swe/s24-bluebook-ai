The material and course structure also exposed us to Spanish culture across all Spanish-speaking countries, the language's nuances, and its origins. There was also a reading on the theme of the Cuban war which was great for those who would love to learn history from a more personalised and more light-hearted perspective."

                "strengths: the VHL helped me to understand the concepts prior to class and give context to the lessons we learned in class, i liked speaking w/ spanish speakers from across the globe through the lingua-meeting sessions\r\nweaknesses: there were assignments to complete every day which make the workload a bit higher than i expected",
                "Strengths: Taught spanish very quickly\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very hard for new students, being taught in entirely Spanish is extremely difficult for new speakers",
                "I thought the course was well structured, both in terms of when assessments were but also as far as how class time was used. Most days, Professor Reymundi would lecture for the first maybe 20 minutes and then the rest of the class was driven by conversation with peers and responding to questions. I found the chances to collaborate and speak really engaging. The syllabus was clear and well organized. I appreciated that the remote learning day was on Wednesday to break up the week, and I found Linguameeting enjoyable. The VHL homework videos and activities often felt tedious and some of the Canvas response assignments felt useless. I appreciate that the course attempts to expose us to Spanish culture but I think it could be done more engagingly, maybe with a field trip?",
                "The course had several strengths including the size of the class, the daily assignments for consistent learning, the online interactive textbook, the clear exam structures and going further by not just learning the language but the culture as well. The one weakness I found that many students struggled with was the intense immersion whereby the professor spoke in Spanish for the entire class from day one. This was a good habit but it was often difficult to understand fully what the professor was saying, especially regarding exams or assignments or instructions.",
                "I enjoyed this class' emphasis on discussions and partner work. These conversations made it easier to put what we'd learned into practice. This class is completely taught in Spanish which was a major challenge because most of us have had little to no exposure to the language and then boom, all of the instructions for the class are being given to us in a completely new language. I think that this resulted in some confusion at times and loss of information. Although I think the complete immersion in the language also posed some benefits. I think my listening and interpretation skills got better because of it."
