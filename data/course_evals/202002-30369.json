    "I learned a lot about analyzing cathedrals, the common stories they portrayed, and the context in which they were developed. The course was extremely interesting and Professor Bloch was very knowledgeable.",
    "The focus (readings in particular) were on the age and less on the Cathedrals. Lectures were the reverse. All-in-all, it gave me a heightened appreciation for gothic architecture, the 12-13th century, and French history that I didnt have before."
