    "I learned a lot in this course about ancient Egyptian burials, coffins, sarcophagi, mummification practices, rituals, amulets, and much more. I also was able to learn via a hands-on approach--as our class was able to mummify fish and practice experimental archaeology."

    "There are no weaknesses. All were strengths. Salima Ikram is absolutely amazing, and I want her to teach on campus.",
    "Very hands on and fun",
    "The course felt somewhat disorganised at times as the overall plan for what we were doing in the course changed significantly after the syllabus was written. However, the coursework itself was interesting and the numerous field trips and projects were engaging.",
    "I would not change this course in any way. The strengths were that the seminar was taught in a very conversational manner--which meant I learned a lot without ever noticing how much I was truly learning. Dr. Ikram always wrote key terms up on the board, which greatly helped us to succeed on our quizzes. Additionally, the hands-on learning approach of being able to actually practice mummification was very exciting, and taught us a lot."

    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in Ancient Egypt, or really to anyone interested in taking a fun class where you will learn a lot. The class was so different from any other class I've taken at Yale, and I learned so much working in the lab with the fish mummification."
