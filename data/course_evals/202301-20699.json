I think  its main strength is that it moves quickly and introduces a very large amount of vocabulary (I think it is a large amount, it feels large in the moment). This is also it weakness towards the end in order to finish the units we moved very quickly and so it was hard to learn at such a pace emphasis on vocabulary is also tricky.  I did wish we had practiced speaking in class a bit more.",

The core strengths are the following:\r\n\r\n- Active learning environment \r\n- Engaged and available professor\r\n- Accommodates multiple learning styles \r\n- Multiple opportunities provided to excel outside of the classroom \r\n- Respect between professor and student",
                "strengths: balanced distribution of assignments for grammar, reading, listening, and speaking\r\nweaknesses: unclear communication of expectations for larger assignments like the final project",
                "I think this course could practice speaking a little bit more but I think it is otherwise a great course",
                "Strengths:\r\nOnline homework\r\n1-on-1 office hours or access to professor/TA\r\nClarifications presented at beginning of classes\r\nCultural immersion via only Arabic language drills or lots of music \r\nVarious tools and methods for learning (Lingco, Kahoot, textbook, etc)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe course moves particularly fast for those who have had zero previous engagement with the language or culture."

As well as, if students would be willing to focus and facilitate their growth since they will have phenomenal instruction from a wise professor."
