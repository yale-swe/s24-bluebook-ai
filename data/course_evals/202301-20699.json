I additionally learned how to properly conjugate in the past and present tense as well as recognize different case endings. I struggled with speaking and pronouncing the language during my first semester of the language, but was greatly impacted and aided by the TA and professor Aziz in correcting my speech abilities."

                "I think that the lessons on grammar could be better organized such as having a deck of slides prepared before class and better communication on when assignments are due, but overall I enjoyed the class and the collaborative environment.",

                "In general I thought it was a very good course in that it was enjoyable and effective for teaching Arabic. I think  its main strength is that it moves quickly and introduces a very large amount of vocabulary (I think it is a large amount, it feels large in the moment). This is also it weakness towards the end in order to finish the units we moved very quickly and so it was hard to learn at such a pace emphasis on vocabulary is also tricky.  I did wish we had practiced speaking in class a bit more.",

                "It moves slightly too fast",

The core strengths are the following:\r\n\r\n- Active learning environment \r\n- Engaged and available professor\r\n- Accommodates multiple learning styles \r\n- Multiple opportunities provided to excel outside of the classroom \r\n- Respect between professor and student",
                "strengths: balanced distribution of assignments for grammar, reading, listening, and speaking\r\nweaknesses: unclear communication of expectations for larger assignments like the final project",
                "I think this course could practice speaking a little bit more but I think it is otherwise a great course",
                "Strengths:\r\nOnline homework\r\n1-on-1 office hours or access to professor\/TA\r\nClarifications presented at beginning of classes\r\nCultural immersion via only Arabic language drills or lots of music \r\nVarious tools and methods for learning (Lingco, Kahoot, textbook, etc)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe course moves particularly fast for those who have had zero previous engagement with the language or culture."

Though Arabic is definitely difficult compared to other languages, there is no reason why a student would be ill-advised to take this course. I loved everything about it and I am sure someone else would as well.",

I would do so if said students were willing to step into a challenging zone and out of their comfort zone in terms of academic rigger. As well as, if students would be willing to focus and facilitate their growth since they will have phenomenal instruction from a wise professor."
