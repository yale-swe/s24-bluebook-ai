   "comments": [
    "Development of my calculus knowledge",
    "I developed skills on integration",
    "Better study habits",
    "The course taught me calculus and how to work through problems in a logical manner.",
    "This course taught me many new concepts in mathematics as well as new techniques for learning those concepts quickly.",
    "important elements of calculus",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of calculus that will most definitely provide a good basis for future math courses.",
    "I learned the importance of previewing the material before class through the Explorations.",
    "This class helped me understand why any of the content we learned matters! It wasn't just about crunching numbers, but also how we might be able to use it in the real world.",
    "Integral techniques, sequences and series, (tests for convergence and divergence), Taylor polynomials, polar coordinates, parametric equations, a little bit of differential equations, volumes of rotation.",
    "I learned a lot about integration and series, as well as polar coordinates and parametric equations.",
    "I've learned a lot about how to approach mathematical problem solving. While I did learn actual techniques like integration, series, and sequences, the most valuable knowledge came from the actual problem solving. The exams were of a format I'd never seen before, so I had to learn by doing. I also got to see lots of proofs and learn solidly the mechanisms behind WHY math works.",
    "I learned calculus 2 topics in depth and to analyze and understand math problems quickly and logically.",
    "I had already taken a similar course in high school so this course was a good chance to more thoroughly learn the material.",
    "This was basically the second half of AP Calc BC, which I didn't learn\/understand very well in high school, but this class definitely helped me finally understand series. We also learned some different techniques of integration that I never learned in high school.",
    "The course was centered around the applications of integrals and integral-related concepts, including evaluating integrals and using integrals to evaluate areas and volumes underneath curves. The course also included sequences and series, Taylor and Maclaurin polynomials, parametric curves, and polar curves. When learning all of these concepts, the course not only helped me to solve these problems directly, but also think about them conceptually; how they can be applied and manipulated.",
    "As a first year student I felt this course was great for my first semester. It leads on from calc 1 in a way that is difficult but rewarding. Delevoped my skills in integration and increased my understanding of series",
    "I learned how to analyze information critically and develop a true understanding of the material covered in class. I developed an understanding of sequences and series, integration, polar coordinates and differential equations.",
    "Calculus II concepts such as integration, math involving sequences and series, and polar and parametric transformations were learned.",
    "Time management and structuring my education to be more independent",
    "I learned a lot about how to do calculus in a remember-able way."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Maybe the online explorations could be converted into short quizzes to see how well we understand the material after class, rather than introducing it to us before. I think that would be more helpful.",
    "I think it needs more peer tutors. Having TFs would probably be useful as well.",
    "The problem sets are really thorough and really cover everything and help with understanding the material taught in class. The weakness was that the course isn't always made interesting - it can get super boring and repetitive, especially for someone who isn't interested in math.",
    "This course jumps around a bit in the textbook, which is fine most of the time but can get a little confusing on certain topics. At times it stresses seemingly minute parts of the theory we are learning a little too much. However, it gives you a New understanding for topics you may have learned in the past.",
    "Overall the course was fairly strong. Homework was indicative of what would be on the test and class time was spent understanding the material in order to do well on the test, not just regurgitating formulas. To keep the course strong in the future I would continue to work on understanding the material first and fore most.?",
    "The course was taught pretty well and the material was not too difficult to grasp. Problem sets are always doable and tests are fair. However, lecture sometimes got a little boring.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is that most of the formulas we use were derived in class. As a result, studying for an exam, for example, didn't entail memorizing a bunch of formulas, but rather understanding how they were derived. Another strength was that we did explorations before each class, which meant that we knew what to expect for each class.",
    "It was very systematic, I felt like by the end I can explain most of the concepts pretty well.",
    "The teachers made concepts easy to understand. There could be more emphasis on the ideas we need to know for the finals and how to use them.",
    "I always felt like the practice exams were a lot easier than the actual exam.",
    "I think that class time was well spent going over concepts via problem solving. However, I wish the problem solving we did in class was more like the complex problems that came up on tests instead of simple conceptual problems. The problems sets also weren't very similar to exams. I really liked the explorations and how they walked us through slowly understanding how mathematic concepts came to be. The class does go a little quickly since there's a lot of content. Brett is also very good at explaining concepts in multiple ways until he finds one that works for each individual student.",
    "The class was very well taught and there were many additional resources. However, I felt the content may have been easier to grasp if the course were not as fast paced.",
    "Strengths: I liked the progression in the material and I thought the homework assignments were reasonable and useful for practicing what we'd learned in class. Weaknesses: Meeting only twice a week for a math class is not enough in my opinion but that's a personal preference. I originally was taking one of the sections that met three times a week but I switched during shopping period to get a better professor; the professors are not equal in teaching ability. I also think the tests are graded too harshly.",
    "I thought the explorations were very helpful in helping you learn the material. They basically taught you the lecture beforehand so that when you went to class you already understood everything pretty well. The problem was, if you forgot to do the exploration before class, then the lecture could be kind of confusing.",
    "Strengths - very well organized\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - they try to trick you on the tests in ways I don't think are fair. Also on tests, I think that instead of having to memorize all these formulas (things like arc length of a parametric curve), the tests should be more about proving that you know how to use the formulas",
    "Overall, the course had many more strengths than weaknesses. The courseand the teacher taught the material in a simple, straightforward, easy-to-learn way, and the course throughout the semester was structured well. But when it came to exams, the class did not explore the conceptual applications that we were being tested on. The questions in the class PowerPoints and the problem sets were direct problems, but the exams included little of those questions and more conceptual applications.",
    "The head of the course Brett Smith was an incredible teacher and organised the course well.\r\n\r\nI found the exploration tedious and unhelpful",
    "The flipped classroom approach encouraged me to focus on and study the material before coming to class. It helped me to engage and have context before arriving. The pacing of the class was fair and I felt like I had ample time to explore the material. The p-sets were sometimes a little difficult so I often found myself going to peer tutors weekly.",
    "My professor and his office hours were strengths of the course.",
    "Some topics of the course were a bit boring due tot he fact that sequences and series are mainly memorization as opposed to learning. The large class size was also a negative. The course was well structured and all the topics we learned had a logical order.",
    "I really liked the format of the class, and from what I hear from people who have taken the class previously, it is a huge improvement. I like the direct teaching style (as opposed to flipped-classroom) and I loved the \"explorations\" which were due before each class. I felt like they were a great way to introduce the material in a way that made the student an active participant, as opposed to watching a video or even sitting in class. I honestly don't know if there's a better way to present what I would have thought to be lackluster material. Now, I did have trouble staying focused and awake in class, but I thing that was just the time of day (2:15pm)."

    "I would recommend this if you have to fulfill a calculus requirement.",
    "Yes - math 115 is great for learning calculus, and the instruction (at least in my case) was excellent",
    "Yes, It is useful.",
    "Take it if it's a prereq-- otherwise, get your QR credit elsewhere.",
    "Probably not.  I found the pace of the class was too fast",
    "This class is pretty doable and definitely easier than some of the other basic math classes so if you need a math requirement, this is a good option.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if they are very passionate about learning more math. I dont think it is a course for those that do not take math seriously or dont want to further their studies in calculus.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student but under the condition they took the same teacher as me. I have heard less positive comments about other 115 teachers but I think professor Smith did an excellent job at really getting us to understand and learn the material first.",
    "I would. The material is interesting enough and Professor Smith is a good professor. The homework and tests are never impossible to do, although there is the occasional curveball question on the homework. The class can get a little boring, but overall the course was good.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this. Good intro class to Math in college.",
    "Yes! This class is really fun and engaging. It is the right intro math course.",
    "Yes, calculus is actually really fun when you can finally understand and use the concepts.",
    "Yes. It is a course in which you learn a lot of useful tools that are used in many fields of study.",
    "Take this course if you need to have a QR credit, but be ready for it to be much more difficult than the Calc AB\/BC you may have encountered before.",
    "Yes. Math 115 was taught well and strengthened my logical reasoning skills.",
    "I would if the student needed to take a math course and had prior experience with the calculus material taught. I would not recommend it if they hadn't or if they were not very comfortable with their previous math courses.",
    "Yesa good course for those looking to learn Calc 2 (aka BC)",
    "If you took AP Calc BC but didn't understand the BC topics very well, definitely take this class. I think this is a good math class to take for your first semester before taking MATH 120.",
    "Yes - it's very well organized and you learn a lot",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The course can be challenging, and it requires patience and tenacity to be able to understand and apply the concepts being taught, at the rate they are being taught, but it is a crucial stepping stone into any other STEM discipline, and its applications can even be helpful in the humanities.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if you are interested in challenging yourself. It will require focus and lots of time to do well in this course, however. If you are interested in thinking about math in a deep way, this is the course to take.",
    "Yes, I would tell them to be very responsible and focused or else they will fall behind.",
    "I would recommend this course, and especially with Brett Smith as a professor. The course presents the material in a way that is easy to internalize and remember, and that also lends an appreciation of the material."
