                "I learned so much: about Hegel, about reading and writing with obscure texts, about different Western philosophical schools, etc.",
                "I learned a great deal about Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit as well as the way his work has been influential in post-Hegelian philosophy on a number of issues, from gender to race to nationalism.",
                "This is by far the greatest philosophy class I have taken, because the students are great, the content is phenomenal (no pun intended). I wish Professor Franks can be more active in the discussion and contribute his insight, but I also think he is holding himself back because he don't want to sway our interpretations.",
                "This course helped me develop skills in philosophical analysis and close reading. It also gave me invaluable skills for working through and understanding difficult texts.",
                "I learned how to approach near-inscrutable philosophical texts through both an extended and extraordinarily-close reading, and through the engagement with works of secondary literature as philosophical texts unto themselves. I was also pushed very hard to improve my philosophical writing, and got plenty of thorough feedback for my methods of analysis.",
                "A thorough understanding of one of Hegel's most foundational works.",
                "I developed the philosophical vocabulary and reflective practice necessary to interpret Hegel. I also learned how to connect his thought to a variety of subsequent philosophical movements and positions.",
                "I learned to analyze extremely difficult texts (the hardest I had ever read) and synthesize insights from different pieces of secondary literature. I also refined my abilities to clearly and concisely reconstruct arguments. This class had a huge impact on my own epistemology, ethics, and political philosophy. Hegel's phenomenology brings an extremely nuanced and rich perspective to the table when it comes to questions of objective vs. relative truth, individualism vs. collectivism, etc. I also gained a greater appreciation of the social utility of religion. Overall, I came away from this class with so many new ideas that I look forward to exploring in the future."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths -- we covered a remarkable amount of ground, and it was amazing how we spent a ton of time on the work itself, but also so much time on secondary literature. It really gave us a sense of the great work at hand, but also how it's been interpreted\/used\/taken in the centuries since.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- the beginning of the course should be rethought. There was little to no introduction to Hegel or to the Phenomenology, making it slightly jarring diving right into such an infamously hard work. Furthermore, I wish we had more formal\/comprehensive lessons on the parts of the Phenomenology we missed. I understand it would've been too much to get through every paragraph of the text, but I feel like we barely got any information on the parts we didn't get to, making it difficult to have a smooth, complete understanding of the text as a whole.",
                "The course is designed to be intensive. This is a double-edged sword. If you do all the work, you get a lot out of it. Professor Havranek is also extremely generous with office hours and willing to respond to every question. But if you slip behind, the class quickly becomes slightly more incomprehensible (which can be fatal since Hegel is already so incomprehensible).",
                "One of the biggest strengths of this course was the classroom discussions. Hearing others' views on the usually difficult material was always helpful and insightful. I also liked how Hugo tried to make sure that everyone got a chance to speak. It was also very helpful to ask Professor Franks and Hugo questions on the material, both in class and in office hours. \r\nRegarding weaknesses, most of what I'm going to say should not be understood as weaknesses per se but rather things that I wish were different. The first of these is the perusall deadline. I felt like the (at first 6 but then) 8pm deadline the day before class could sometimes be difficult to meet. Some of us have student jobs and other assignments, so consistently meeting that deadline could be a challenge (and we often would not get instructor responses until close to before class time). It usually felt like a race to finish the reading and get comments in, and I sometimes I found myself rushing and asking questions that were not at the quality I would like because of time constraints. \r\nI also thought that the three presentations may have been one too many. Doing three a semester is rough, and some of us never got feedback on our reports, so we were in the dark regarding how we did and ways we could improve. I also thought that the presentation expectations could have been clearer (e.g., what should we prioritize, clarity on one of the key issues, or breadth?; is a handout appropriate?, etc). Additionally, maybe having one or two max presenters a day with one less presentations would help open more class time for actual discussion. \r\nAnother concern I have regards the final paper in this class. I felt like there was little opportunity to try to write on Hegel and receive feedback in preparation for the final. The seminar reports of course helped, but some of us never heard back in time for the final paper, and these assignments also did not give us the space for any detailed analysis of the Phenomenology. The final seminar report did help with this, but, again, I would have liked to start practicing writing on Hegel a lot earlier, rather than the last week of the class. Perhaps substituting one of the presentations with a ~5-6 page paper would be helpful for the undergraduates. I feel like I personally would have benefitted from this a lot, and the experience would also have helped lesson my stress as I wrote the final.",
                "This course benefitted a lot from its rigorous structure, although this structure also made the course high-workload and incredibly intellectually challenging. The weekly Perusall assignments and monthly seminar reports forced a thorough examination of the text, so that there was no gliding by without understanding, but they, combined with the high reading load of the course, led to this being one of the most difficult (while fulfilling) seminars I have taken at Yale.",
                "Great seminar structure, though I think more in class work on writing could be helpful",
                "This course was very well organized and the small amounts of reading made for much richer and more careful discussion than many of my other classes, where the readings often strayed above 100 pages per week.",
                "My only complaint is that I wish we had more time to discuss the reading. Hugo and Professor Franks did an incredible job and divided up the lecturing workload well. They would do well to have plenty of time beforehand to discuss exactly where their interpretations of the text diverge from one another to ensure the class gets as broad of a range of approaches as possible."

                "If they had express interest in Hegel or continental philosophy, yes! The amount of engagement in the class was amazing, and played a large role in making it so worthwhile: if people were disinterested in Hegel, it would not work. He is a hard person to read a lot of the time, so a lot of the interest and passion really has to come from outside the classroom, I think. For people who want to dive into it, it's such a great way to grapple with the text itself and understand why it's been so important in intellectual history.",
                "If you are interested in learning about Hegel and his influence, this course is perfect. Hugo Havranek is a real gem of an instructor. He is so kind and helpful in his feedback.",
                "Yes. The content of the course is really engaging.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Although Hegel is notoriously difficult, it is really rewarding to work through his project with your peers and (try to) understand some of his key ideas. One of my favorite courses during my time at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course only to the student who wants to undergo rigorous philosophical crucible. This course will make you a much better philosopher, and will give you the confidence to feel as though there is not a single philosophical work in the tradition which you could not conquer with enough time and the right resources. That confidence is invaluable, but it comes at the cost of a course which felt more like 1.5-2 credits than 1. It is worth it, but only if this kind of crucible is what you want, and if you can plan your schedule accordingly.",
                "An awesome philosophy credit.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in the history of western philosophy or politics.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student with a solid background in philosophy that loves diving deep in the weeds, so to speak. I would tell anyone with a more casual interest to avoid the headache of reading Hegel, only because even Professor Franks and Hugo cannot make Hegel easy to understand. Someone with a serious interest in political theory, history, or philosophy (perhaps with an eye for grad school down the road) would benefit greatly from this class, though."
