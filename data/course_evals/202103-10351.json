In addition to broadening my understanding of the personal lives of various authors, I learned more about how these personal experiences/ narratives play into their writing. After taking this course, I learned the way various texts within American Literature inform one another when read in conversation with one another.",

                "Strengths -- interesting reading list, and I thought one of the essays we did about evaluating certain words was interesting.\r\nWeaknesses -- It felt like one of those courses where the professor has a very specific idea of what they want you to take away from each book, and doesn't leave a huge amount of room for interpretation. So class discussion was often quite narrow, and also the feedback I got on essays was not super helpful  usually just \"you interpreted it as this, but I would've interpreted it as this.\"",
                "The strength of this course is the unique thread that the professor connects through texts that initially would seem very different. Also, for an American literature classic, the reading list is extremely unique.",
                "I think the discussions could be a bit more student focused. I think going forward the professor should open the discussion up to student interpretations.",
                "Strengths: low workload and high reward. We had two essays that were fun to write and made you think differently about the texts we read. I appreciated that the two essays could be on anything that we had read so far in the class. Also, Prof. Williams gives excellent feedback and then allows you to revise your essays, which I was so thankful for. Weakness: sometimes I wish we had more discussion of texts in class. Also, it would have helped if we were always given a set number of pages to read if a book per class. It often felt like the class was in very different places for certain texts.",
                "Really awesome syllabus and reading selections. We definitely did not read the typical ENGL127 readings, but I thoroughly enjoyed everything we did read and felt that it widened my exposure as a reader.",
                "Although this course was very well organized and I do not have many ways in which it can be improved, I think one possible area for improvement would be taking out a couple of texts towards the end of the semester. Although each text was very valuable in its own way, I felt like we were slightly pressed for time at the end of the semester especially with some guest lecturers. This meant we were not able to fully finish our conversations about some texts/ left some conversations slightly unfinished.",
                "strengths - by FAR, the professor. Professor Williams is kind, incredibly understanding, and truly passionate about the works discussed in class. \r\n\r\nweaknesses - the breadth of genres broached makes it difficult to truly spend as much time as necessary on each work. the syllabus passes from book to book too quickly.",
                "This is an absolutely wonderful class! Its material itself is very engaging, and the way Professor Williams conducts them makes them even more so.",
                "I thought the professor did a great job of leading classroom discussions. There was a good balance between him guiding the class into discussing certain themes in the readings while also leaving space for personal interpretation and discussion between students. We also referred back to readings we had discussed when approaching new content. I think one weakness was that we didn't always get to thoroughly discuss the reading we did, as the class moved a bit fast."

                "I think I would, but with another prof. This class has potential for sure, but I just did not think Prof Williams did a good job stimulating class discussion that ranged any broader than his own POV. I'm honestly a bit disappointed that this was my introduction to Yale english.",
                "Take this class with this professor!!!!! He is extremely understanding of student needs. He made our final paper optional realizing how stressed out everyone was. I wasnt able to finish a lot of the reading, but never felt like he was resentful or trying to expose the people who didnt. I also got to participate still because he often times will just delve into interesting topics through mythology, religion, or philosophy. This is the PERFECT class for anyone, Humanities or not. This is a rare literature class where the writing is light, the reading is not very intense, the conversations are cool, and the professor isnt a hard as.",
                "I would! I thought the syllabus was really interesting and unexpected -- while it is an American Literature class, there's a lot of sci fi throughout the syllabus. It was a unique way to experience American Literature.",
                "YESSSS Williams is a wonderful professor.",
                "Yes! Professor Williams is incredibly passionate and always finds a way to make class interesting.",
                "Yes, especially with Professor Williams! He was kind, understanding, but also a really great discussion leader and was very passionate about the topic and course material.",
                "Especially for students that have never taken a proper American Literature course, I highly recommend this course. It was a great introduction into some of the major American Literature authors and some of their less well-known but equally as engaging texts. The free-flowing discussion style of this class allowed me to comfortably share my opinions and effectively learn from the opinions of those around me.",
                "I would recommend this course, and more specifically, this section. Professor Williams truly makes the course- additionally, take this course if you love to read! A wide variety of genres and formats is covered, and it helped rekindle my love for reading.",
                "Definitely! Its such a great class! Its such a comprehensive class that encompasses many different types of works while still being able to focus on each respective one.",
                "Yes, I would. The professor was clear, the classroom dynamic was engaging, and I enjoyed the readings."
