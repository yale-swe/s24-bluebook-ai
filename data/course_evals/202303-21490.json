Moreover, the concept of health and the politics involved were further deepen by the idea that even the way health is practiced and treated can be influenced by countering ideals.",
                "Ive developed the ability to analyze texts differently and understand concepts that I previously did not see. I feel more comfortable determining important questions about readings and piecing together the larger picture.",
                "Not only did I learn about different types of traditional medicine, but I also learned a lot about how biomedicine and the medicalization of practices have forcibly displaced and appropriated traditional medicine. I would have never imagined there would be so much depth about traditional medicine concerning the popularization of psychedelics, the New Age and holistic movements, smallpox epidemic, midwivery, yoga, and so much more. Profe really managed to tie so many important, overlooked histories together in this classroom.",
                "I learned how to critically assess healthcare policies and histories of biomedicine methodology. I learned about critical historical events that lead to current healthcare politics surrounding traditional medicine.",
                "In this course, I delved into the diverse landscape of traditional medicine practices and beliefs across Central, South, and North America. The content spanned from the traditions of indigenous groups to individual practices, accompanied by discussions on the ethical considerations surrounding these approaches. The course facilitated a comparative analysis with the biomedical system, exploring potential avenues for improvement. I acquired skills in articulating and debating these complex topics, evaluating traditional medicine practices against ethical standards, comprehending their historical context, and, most importantly, researching their contemporary societal significance. And this was all thanks to the amazing Proffesor that I had."

                "I certainly enjoyed this course. Class discussions were very insightful.",
                "I thought this course strongly engaged students in class discussions, using new vocabulary term, multimedia and student-led class discussions. I loved how the instructor left project topics open so that students were able to engage their personal connections and family traditions with the topics and politics we learned about. I really enjoyed the alternative vocabulary definition assignments because they taught me how to think critically about well-used terms with historically incorrect connotations. I appreciated that every assigned reading connected directly to our class discussion for that day. Each assignments felt necessary -- it never felt like busy work. I liked how the professor led class discussions with questions so that students could engaged heavily and lead conversations towards their interests.",
                "This course boasted several strengths that greatly enriched my learning experience. The professor's detailed feedback was invaluable, providing insightful guidance. Engaging in profound conversations with fellow students enhanced my understanding of the material. Moreover, the knowledge gained empowered me to produce meaningful work for my community. Remarkably, I find it challenging to identify any weaknesses in this course, as its positive aspects significantly outweighed any potential drawbacks."

                "Yes!",
                "YES!!! 100% yes!! I love Profe Lopez Carrillo! She is so passionate, approachable and flexible to every topic and new idea each student presents in class. I love how she adapted the class discussions, readings and projects to include each students' interests. I felt very heard and engaged during class. I learned so so much about Indigenous politics and traditional medicine history!! I would highly recommend for someone with family connections to this history as well as anyone interested in non-biomedicine medical history!!",

This course is not only valuable for personal knowledge but also crucial for future leaders. Given Professor's teaching approach and expertise, I firmly believe that under her guidance, Yale students will contribute to guiding our society in a positive direction.",
