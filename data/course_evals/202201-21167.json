Professor Fotos does a great job of making sure you become accustomed with all facets of Yale such as the library resources, the film archive, the Beinecke, Dwight Hall, etc. The field trips to these various places made the class very enjoyable. Also, a great writing credit -- we learned about the extensive writing resources Yale has to help you with writing, and the writing assignments were well structured to explore different areas of academic writing.",

Another strenght: the variety of case studies\r\n\r\nCould be improved by taking a more international context as well (right now very US oriented).",

                "This course is structured around skill building instead of just completing assignments, which provided useful skills for future academic endeavors.",
                "Strength: new case study every class was a good structure, lots of relevant field trips/speakers, short word limit on assignments helped my writing be more concise\r\n\r\nWeakness: class not always structured, rubric/instructions for writing assignments not entirely clear",
                "A strength of this course is the diversity of the reading material, both in terms of geographical areas covered and types of sources studied. We read everything from scientific studies to journalism articles. I also really enjoyed all of the guest speakersthey all provided complementary but different perspectives on issues of environmental justice. The main weakness of the course was a lack of clarity regarding expectations for the writing assignments, and few writing workshop opportunities considering that this was a WR credit.",
