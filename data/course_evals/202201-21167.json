Professor Fotos does a great job of making sure you become accustomed with all facets of Yale such as the library resources, the film archive, the Beinecke, Dwight Hall, etc. The field trips to these various places made the class very enjoyable. Also, a great writing credit -- we learned about the extensive writing resources Yale has to help you with writing, and the writing assignments were well structured to explore different areas of academic writing.",
                "This course provided good writing and research skills that can be used in future courses.",
                "I learned about the definition of Justice, different types of justice, case studies globally about environmental injustice, and how to write more concisely.",

                "This course helped me as a writer to really think about the power of even one sentence and to carefully evaluate the value of each word in my work. Another strenght: the variety of case studies\r\n\r\nCould be improved by taking a more international context as well (right now very US oriented).",

                "Very Disorganized; Hard to plan via the syllabus as the professor would change assignments and projects on the fly",
                "This course is structured around skill building instead of just completing assignments, which provided useful skills for future academic endeavors.",
                "Strength: new case study every class was a good structure, lots of relevant field trips\/speakers, short word limit on assignments helped my writing be more concise\r\n\r\nWeakness: class not always structured, rubric\/instructions for writing assignments not entirely clear",
                "A strength of this course is the diversity of the reading material, both in terms of geographical areas covered and types of sources studied. We read everything from scientific studies to journalism articles. I also really enjoyed all of the guest speakersthey all provided complementary but different perspectives on issues of environmental justice. The main weakness of the course was a lack of clarity regarding expectations for the writing assignments, and few writing workshop opportunities considering that this was a WR credit.",

                "I would recommend it after it has been offered a few more times. Since this was the first time the course was offered, the syllabus kept changing and it felt like we rushed some of the writing assignments. There was also a lack of clarity regarding the weight of each assignment.",
                "Not really because I didnt learn very much and wasnt very engaged the entire time. The Professor is very kind, but I dont think I gained a lot from this class."
