Overall a great course to just learn about the world, injustice, character dynamics, and of course analyzing literature.",

                "Professor Hickey is by far the biggest strength. Truly an amazing professor! I loved how she would present the historical\/sociocultural background of a work of literature and then we could all discuss it as a class. She's excellent at facilitating conversation and encouraging students to speak up. Also, this class had a real sense of community because of Prof. Hickey, which I was super thankful for during this virtual semester.",
                "Amazing course with an amazing syllabus!",
                "Strengths: ALANNA HICKEY! The kindest, sweetest, most passionate and most intelligent individuals I have ever met! I wish this semester could have been in person so that we could have met her. The environment she created, even though it was all virtual, felt so close knit and supportive. I really felt that by the end of the class I could call many of my peers friends. honestly writing this is making me tear up a little bit because I'm sad I won't be able to take this course next semester.\r\nWeaknesses: I actually can't think of any. this class was BY FAR my favorite that I have taken at Yale.",
                "The strength of this course was the amazing engagement that all of the students had with the course. Even though it was on zoom, I had a great time connecting and discussing topics with Professor Hickey and my classmates.",
                "The course was so engaging, the course material was wonderful (I loved the readings), and the structure of the class was great. It was the perfect balance between positing my own thoughts and growing and learning from others'. I didn't really feel like the course could be improved. It was such a great class, and Professor Hickey was hands down one of the best professors I've ever had at Yale. She handled going virtual so well.",
                "Strengths: PROF. HICKEY!!!!! She brings amazing texts and flare to every class session. There was a diverse mix of authors and I loved the majority of the syllabus (even Melville, whose Bartleby had me preferring not to engage with capitalism :). But the real strength of this class is Hickey, who is very kind, warmhearted and engages with her students extremely well.",
                "Prof. Hickey led really engaging discussions and was always open to our ideas about the literature; while she provided necessary contextual information about the works and authors at the beginning of class, she opened up the discussions from there. She approaches teaching with a lot of compassion.\r\n\r\nThe reading load was a little uneven at first, but Prof. Hickey responded quickly and evened out the schedule, so it wasn't really an issue.",
                "Strengths -- professor Hickey did a wonderful job and was incredibly accommodating to students given the unprecedented nature of the online format of the class. The readings were also very engaging and carefully chosen to craft an exceptional curriculum that examined both iconic American works like Walt Whitman's Song of Myself and Herman Melville's Bartleby while also incorporating the diverse voices of more modern authors such as Zitkala-Sa and Ocean Vuong. Feedback received on assignments\/papers was also always clear, thought-provoking, and helpful in revising different drafts of a work."

                "Prof. Hickey offered alternative assignments to two of our essays that were extremely engaging and intellectually challenging without draining us any more than the online semester already had.",
                "succeeded: I love that for many assignments, we were given an \"alternative\" assignment that was more oriented towards the unusual circumstances of the semester. That was amazing and I really enjoyed it, and it felt very considerate. \r\n\r\nimprovements: none",
                "The practices which succeeded were Professor Hickey's creative ways of making assignments that did not involve staring at our screens. For example, for my midterm I exchanged letters with my classmates about Song of Solomon. It took a lot of thought and time, but it was so refreshing and opened my eyes to new ways of analyzing literature.",
                "I'm definitely not a big fan of virtual learning at all, but Professor Hickey did a great job of just easing the stress and confines of those circumstances. The course was facilitated and led by students and there wasn't any pressure to speak on every single topic we talked about.",
                "The daily check-ins at the beginning of the class were a highlight of the course for me. It was nice to know that we had a professor who cared about our wellbeing as students apart from our academic achievements and who would support us through the many challenges we all encountered during this difficult semester."
