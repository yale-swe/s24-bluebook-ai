Furthermore, I learned much about Asian American history in the US and the predominant influence of ideology and other systems of power on all aspects of civil society. I gained much experience reading and discussing both scientific papers and historical publications."

                "Strengths: The assignments leading up to the final paper guided me through the process. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish the humanities and STEM side of this course was more connected but I understand that this is a difficult blend to achieve.",
                "I think the strength of this course came through the historical readings and discussions which really helped put the major events of Asian-American history in the context of STEM. The final project was also a major strength since it allowed students to explore a specific figure and really encouraged us to think about history on our own and allowed for a lot of freedom. I think a weakness in this course was the STEM portion. The readings were papers that were often far too difficult so we rarely ever discussed them in class. Sometimes guest lecturers were able to come and explain the concepts in simpler terms but usually it was very difficult to stay engaged with the STEM aspect. The STEM assignments also had some issues with some questions being quite difficult without background information and others being far too easy but in both cases points were taken off for missing minor details or not saying exactly what the instructors wanted.",
                "A strength is its interdisciplinary approach and ability to bring science and humanities together however a weakness is the overall syllabus construction which at times did not feel cohesive or connected.",
                "The guest lectures were amazing and I felt like I received a range of background knowledge on Asian American history and some breakthrough STEM works. However, the organization of the class made it feel like we never learned much new historical content after the first few weeks, and the STEM sections of the course felt more shallow than I expected; I suppose thats the nature of a survey-style course that is also a seminar. I also expected some arguments from hshm-type courses to come up, but they didnt. Nonetheless, this semester was the first time that this course was taught and I believe it could evolve to feel more cohesive.",
                "This was a good interdisciplinary course that connected STEM with Asian American history. We covered a wide range of historical time periods while also touching on various STEM topics from physics to computer science. The course was very organized and I like how it was a mix of STEM and history and not just one over the other. One thing that could be improved was that the course could have been organized in chronological order based on the time period rather than the modules. We were jumping from different time periods, so it was hard to keep track of when things actually happened. At times, I felt lost on what events were going on in that time period.",
                "Strengths: both instructors very available for out-of-class discussion, reading material interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes discussion in class was quiet, perhaps partially due to the relatively large size of the class",
                "Strengths were that the class followed a pretty logical order with the timeline beginning in the later 1800s with the first mass immigrations of Chinese people to the United States, to the Cold War, and to present. But, it did feel like the course was all over the place with the different modules and I wish we spent more time delving into certain topics such as the CS and physics unit and actually learned about to do the science and math in class.",
                "The topic of the course is one that isn't typically addressed, and I think the course did a good job at highlighting the lack of knowledge about the historical context behind Asian American scientific achievements. However, I felt that the course often felt overwhelmingly like a history course instead of the blended science-humanities course it set out to be. The scientific elements of the course felt out of place, with difficult scientific journal readings scattered throughout the syllabus. It felt as though we were supposed to learn the science on our own and then discuss it in class while we received some historical context. I also think the modules weren't completely connected, and it felt like they jumped around instead of being one consistent narrative.",
                "Prof. Lui and Prof. Maruyama did a great job of facilitating conversation and creating a great community. I wish this course had more depth and less breadth, but the content was always interesting and the guest speakers were great!",
                "This course felt disjointed at times with various scientific aspects arbitrarily thrown in with various Asian scientists. The two parts did not feel very integrated and felt kinda awkwardly juxtaposed at times. Many of the modules were also poorly structured with little introduction provided behind many of the scientific concepts. Inside the modules, many readings and problem sets seemed disconnected and I oftentimes found myself asking why they were assigned. The modules were also too short with not enough discussion and exploration inside each of them."

                "I would if they are learning more about Asian Americans in history. For STEM students, there are readings from scientific journals but they are not discussed as extensively as the readings from historical journals. It was still an insightful class to be in.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in science in the context of history. This is a very good example of a course that combines different subjects which is very on-brand for Yale. I think from the perspective of a STEM student who needs a humanities credit and actually wants to engage with humanities instead of taking some mindless gut this is a very good choice since it takes topics that interest STEM students and puts it in historical context.",
                "I would because I think it is an exciting way to engage with science for a nonscience oriented student.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student! Whether you are into humanities or STEM, this is a good course that connects the two together. It was a very good course that I hope will be offered again in the future.",
                "Yes, I think taking a class with profs Lui and Maruyama is something to try and do during your time at yale",
                "Yes, Prof. Maruyama and Prof. Lui did a great job in leasing the course. Truly an interdisciplinary class, which is allows for both STEM and humanities majors to lean on their strengths.",
                "Yeah it's a good course that combines two departments that aren't usually taught in conjunction. Also there are very few Asian American classes, so I appreciate this one was offered.",
                "Yes, but I think the curriculum needs some changes before I strongly recommend it. Professor Kim did a great job at integrating science and the humanities, and neither element felt unrelated or forced. Professor Kim taught both the science and the history in class and the readings were also relevant. However, for some of the other units, the conversation seemed dominated by the humanities and historical context, and the science was only present in a difficult journal article.",
                "Yes! Take this course for the professors and the community",
                "Probably? I think this course definitely has a lot of potential for the future as I believe the subject matter is very interesting. However, its inaugural iteration definitely had some rough bumps that need to be smoothened out."
