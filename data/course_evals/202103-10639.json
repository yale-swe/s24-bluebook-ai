I also learned some different epistemological and ontological issues that transcend mathematics and related to a lot of broader philosophical debates.",
                "This course gives a thorough overview of philosophies of mathematics from Kant to today, including some historical context.

The class only requires a final paper, but I found that to be enough of an opportunity to broaden the way I think about creating new knowledge in philosophy. Prof. Shin was an awesome resource in arriving and polishing a topic. It was a satisfying, but very tough final for me (though, maybe not for everyone)!!",

                "The readings are relatively short and interesting and the discussions in seminar are very engaging. However, as most classes were led by student presentations, it would have been great to learn more from Professor Shin speaking and teaching rather than the students for at least a portion of every class",
                "Interesting material. Although, large emphasis on group presentations",
                "No need for improvement-excellent course.",
                "it was a lot of fun",
                "The strength of the course is the professor; Professor Shin is extremely kind, accommodating, and capable. Additionally, the seminar style of the class enables comraderie and friendship. This course has no weaknesses (that I am aware of).",
                "A strength of this course is definitely Professor Shin who makes the material much more digestible and always placed the material in context and gave us necessary background information to really engage with it. Also, the format for assignments made it so I always came to class with a basic understanding of the material and ready to engage with it deeper, which I really appreciated.",
                "Strengths were the organization of the readings and Professor Shins framing of all the ideas and her excellent feedback. Weakness might be that the discussions could have been a little more exciting.",
                "Strengths: Professor Shin is great, workload is very manageable, content is very interesting and relevant for those studying a wide range of subjects\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is definitely the STEM major in me talking but I felt uncomfortable about my grade the whole semester since we never had anything graded except the final paper. (We did get constant feedback on our reading responses though, which was awesome and made me feel well-prepared for the final paper.)",
                "Although the two page responses do take time, I found that they really helped me understand the material of the class. There is strong engagement with the text before class but I do wish that not all the classes were lead by presentation and that there was more room for discussion.",
                "The course is brilliantly structured to get across the various schools of thought covered.",
                "The discussion could be made better if Prof. Shin directed it more. It is mostly student-led, which is great in that everyone can clarify doubts, but I wanted to hear more of what the professor had to say.",
                "strengths: deep knowledge of the topic, high level of engagement due to weekly reading responses, amazing discussions",
                "Each class, a group of students presented the material that we had read for that day. I don't think it was bad to have a student group presenting, but I would have liked to listen to Professor Shin talk more about the material and lead discussions, as her deeper understanding would have let us have interesting and meaningful conversations more readily. I think maybe if students were presenting for maybe half an hour or so instead of the full class length, and maybe on some specific aspect of the reading, that might be more conducive to good conversations. \r\n\r\nA strength is that we had to do reading responses for every class. This really really forced me to understand the material, which I appreciated a lot because sometimes the material was quite dense. Especially as I have not done a lot of philosophy reading before, I found the reading responses -- and all of Professor Shin's feedback -- to be very helpful. Professor Shin's feedback in general was carefully and kindly given and always really apt. Going to her office hours was a wonderful way to get to know the material better!",

You probably want some background in math and specifically a class that's proof based to really be able to appreciate everything but definitely not necessary.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in the subject matter! Its exactly what it says on the tin, so take it if you are interested in reading and critiquing a variety of views of philosophy of mathematics. Also, Professor Shin truly makes the course, so take it for her if nothing else, and attend office hours for max enjoyment!",
                "Absolutely! This is a great class. If anything honestly just take it for Professor Shin (or anything she teaches, for that matter) because she is really an amazing professor: knowledgeable, funny, kind, supportive, you name it. Her response times on reading responses were something else - as a STEM major, I'm used to waiting days for a professor to get back to me, but she thanked me for my response, with comments on it, sometimes after only 20 minutes (!) . The content is great too and very applicable for many different fields of study. We had math majors, philosophy majors, and so many others looking for some cool knowledge (or in my case, cool knowledge AND a precious Hu credit). The workload is really chill (1-2 page reading response every week + one group presentation and one final paper) and she makes sure your stress in the class is at a minimum. Totally 11/10, so yeah please take this class!",
                "Yes! I think it should be required of math majors. Although it was more formal philosophy than I expected (not os speculative or personal), I thought it was very important.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course if you like math or want to study the philosophy behind it for any reason.",
                "I would! Be aware, however, that while the topics are accessible without previous knowledge, 90% of the people in the class are juniors/seniors in Phil, Math, Phil/Math, or Phil/CS. It is somewhat daunting if you are an outsider, but you can definitely get good things from your peers. Also, the final is a big-time commitment, so be aware of it and start thinking of your topic early.",
                "I would only recommend if youre interested in philosophy. I was more interested in math than philosophy.",
                "yes!!! especially if they are a STEM major who loves mathematics but has never thought about what numbers are, why mathematics is beautiful, etc.",
                "If you're interested in philosophy, I would say this class is for you. Don't think that this course is really at all about math. I'm a STEM major and found most of the philosophies that we discussed somewhat esoteric and irrelevant to actual math. That said, it was still interesting, and Professor Shin is really kind!",
                "If you are into math yes, if not no.  Helpful to have some background in first order logic and number theory",
                "Yes! Even if you're not a philosophy major or a math major! There is a bit of a learning curve if you don't have some of the knowledge on terminology, but you will learn and Prof Shin is very willing to help you."
