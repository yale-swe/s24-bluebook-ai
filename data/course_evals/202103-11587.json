I became more adept at understanding what were places of improvement in my learning."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Lee-Smith is absolutely the best. This class has every potential to be a very stressful language class with all grammar and vocab thrown to a beginner, yet Professor Lee-Smith made everything so accessible, engaging and just so fun to learn. When I talked to my other friends about the grammar structure we are learning in class, they said they were only learning similar things in L3, but we never felt such structure was challenging at all. We would just practice some grammatical structures or vocab one day and somehow we ended up with the ability to write an entire story. Professor Lee-Smith's teaching methodology is truly legendary, and I remember her saying not just once that she wants to assess us based on what we can do, not what we can't. That was just such a comforting and uplifting thing to hear. Even as a beginner, I never felt judged or embarrassed when I make a mistake, perhaps that's why my level of comfort with Korean has improved a lot just over the course of 4 months.\r\nI really can't think of any weakness ... If I have to pick one, perhaps for someone very used to the \"punitive\" type of language learning, sometimes you don't really feel you are learning a lot because Professor Lee-Smith very seldom gave negative comments, especially in speaking. But then again, no one has perfect pronunciations from the start and being overly conscious of how you pronounce a certain consonant might not help in improving your general fluency in the language. So I wouldn't really consider this a weakness - unless you are really obsessed with getting everything absolutely right from the beginning.",
                "dailly class was too muchhhhh and tooo farrrrr to walkkkkk",
                "It is the best course I have taken at Yale. I learned so much and it was all thanks to the professor. SHE IS THE BEST !!",
                "teacher was really engaging and class was always participating",
                "The strength of the course was that it was highly engaging and very fun while still covering a lot of material and challenging us. I think maybe the class could be improved by including more speaking practice with no script.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lee made this class a comfortable and welcoming environment to learn Korean. She was an engaging professor and gave individualized attention to each student to make sure we were all learning. The classroom was truly a judgment-free zone, which made all of us feel like we were part of a family. The assignments were a great way to practice Korean while expressing our creativity, and the exams were extremely fair and a good way to test our knowledge. Feedback was clear and constructive. This was one of my favorite classes at Yale, and I will miss learning from Professor Lee!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none!!",
                "The course was designed very well. I was able to comfortably speak phrases within the first several weeks. I found myself eager and secure enough to experiment with the rules and guidelines we had learned resulting in both success and unintentional mishaps at times."

Professor Lee is one of the best, most genuine professors at Yale, and it would be a loss if you go graduate Yale without the opportunity to take a class with her.",
                "For those interesting in learning a new language and who want to learn Korean, I definitely recommend this course. Learning is truly the priority in this class but is done so in the company of your peers and the patience of the instructor. Perhaps one of the most rewarding language classes ever taken at Yale.",
                "Yes this course was an amazing experience. I felt fully supported in my learning this semester.",
                "Yes! If you want to learn Korean, the Yale Korean department is an amazing resource. The teachers are all fantastic.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course!! The way Korean is taught is that the professor prioritizes effort over results, and this creates a great environment that really helps self-motivated students learn at their best without stressing about the grades too much. The course also covers a lot of Korean even at the L1, in my opinion. I learned a lot of different grammatical structure like present, past, and future tenses along with conditional, imperative, progressive, subjunctive, and others."
