                "Although have a basic understanding of Korean, this class helped me hone in on specific grammar skills. In addition, I learned a lot about different cultural elements of Korean culture. In addition, I was able to advance my speaking skills, learning the different tones used in professional settings, casual setting, and grammar used in essays.",
                "I learned a boatload of formal grammar and vocabulary. I also got a little speaking practice.",

                "The strengths of the course are that I was in a conversational setting with other Korean heritage students, and speaking in only Korean helped my pronunciation tremendously. I wished that there were more assignments dedicated to listening, because most of our assignments were dedicated to writing and speaking.",
                "The course itself was a bit disorganized. Slides were not easily accessible and Choi ssn can be a bit unclear as to what she expects from the class in certain periods of time.",
                "I think the strengths are the classmates you can learn with, the fact that you practice everything, and the TA speaking sessions.",
                "strength: intensive, learned a lot\r\nweakness: because it was so intensive, spent so much time studying just korean",
                "Strengths include actually seeing improvements and results with my level of korean. Weaknesses include organization of the class, so knowing which test is when and what exactly to study for."

                "Yes. If you are a heritage speaker who does not know how to write, you will LEARN HOW TO WRITE IN THIS CLASS!!!",

                "Yes, if you are a heritage speaker, and you want to learn more about Korea and become more proficient in Korean, I would definitely recommend this course! It helped me improve my Korean a lot.",
                "Yes! Language courses are great here, especially courses that are meant to be spoken and intensive on a daily basis. I think learning Korean helped my skills advance significantly, and by the end of the semester, I could clearly tell how much I had improved.",
                "Yes definitely. I was very nervous about having Choi ssn as our professor given her ranking on coursetable. The first two weeks of class were definitely a challenge because everyone in the class was extremely confused as to her expectations and what she wanted on homeworks. However, once you get used to the disorganized nature of the class, the course becomes extremely manageable. Homeworks are completion grades and any quizzes and tests are graded EXTREMELY leniently. Even better, all homeworks, quizzes, and tests are graded the day of and handed back to you the next day. It certainly helped that our entire class formed a really tight bond which made class a lot enjoyable. The class itself had a very wide range of speaking ability, with some that struggled to form sentences to those that probably had L5 speaking levels. Regardless, everyone in the class struggled to write and this class really helped me gain confidence in my writing and getting good practice with it. Having never taken formal Korean before in a classroom setting, I'm very happy with how it went and would definitely recommend this class to any heritage speaker that has little to no writing ability.",
                "Yes! Especially if they want to be in a small classroom environment and learn a lot of korean.",
                "yes, although it was a lot of work, my Korean improved that much",
                "If you would like to improve your existing korean yes!"
