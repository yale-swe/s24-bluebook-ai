                "I gained an understanding of the effects new technologies have had on American cities, with an emphasis on transportation.",
                "I learned how to think critically about the city and what technologies, practices, and developments have led to the urban environment as we know it today. The class required a lot of careful reading and retention of information as well as applying that same critical eye to our own term-long research project.",
                "I learned how various technological innovations, such as streetcars, electric infrastructure, and automobiles, have shaped urban growth in the U.S. Looking at historical examples not only gave me really interesting insights into the past but also taught me how to think more critically about the impact of technology on our lives more broadly, and how we can confront it.",

            "comments": [
                "This course had a lot of reading and writing (~20-30 pages) for a non-writing course. We also had pop quizzes on the weekly readings, which were usually 150-200 pages. The discussions in class were very insightful and engaging, but the pop quizzes were kind of unnecessary and juvenile, and they didn't encourage us to do the readings any more in depth than we would otherwise.",
                "The instructors were very knowledgeable and great people, but I don't think this course adequately applied their life experiences. It was basically doing readings and then getting into class and summarizing them each week. The instructors were such amazing people and I wish we could have learned more from them rather than from readings.",
                "Consistently strong discussion, especially after mid-semester feedback. Readings were interesting and I'm glad I read them even if we didn't get to everything in class. I liked watching Jonny and Nate disagree. I don't know how feasible this is, but I feel like gender and racial diversity in authors could be improved.",
                "The course's strength is the well-thought-out syllabus and the wonderful class discussions that came as a result of everyone being actually engaged with the readings. The best days were when people brought in their own life experiences and were able to directly apply it to the research on the page. \r\nI think one of the weaknesses (earlier on, not as much as the semester went on) was the heavy emphasis on regurgitating the information in the text to make sure we knew dates, facts, timelines, etc. The urban environment interests me in a more social, political, economic sense than solely technologically, so I liked when we moved beyond the discussion of the reading and into the real world more than when it felt like we were going over minor details.",
                "The strengths are the professors, who know a great amount on the subject matter (and have super cool professional and real-world experiences in the field of policy/urbanism), and the syllabus, which includes a lot of really fascinating and impactful readings. I learned so much about the relationship between technology and urbanism, and there really aren't any other classes quite like it. I think this class definitely fills an important need at Yale by teaching students a history and way of thinking that I have not been able to find elsewhere. Overall, I really loved it  it was probably my favorite class at Yale!\r\n\r\nOne thing to think about for future reference: I have mixed feelings about the pop quizzes for the readings. The class was competitive to get into, so everyone who was there was already passionate about the subject matter and wanted to put in the effort to do well. In that sense, the pop quizzes felt a bit too \"high school.\" I understand that they want us to do the readings, but I think most of us would've done them diligently even if there were no quizzes.",
                "I thought the readings were great and the course subject has potential. I enjoyed the later portion of the course that covered more recent urban innovations. The course discussions could be improved. We often dwelled on the comprehension questions for too long and Professor Loewentheil often spoke far more often and over Professor Dach. The reading quiz questions were unreasonably specific, which took a lot of the enjoyment out of the readings for me. The course could be improved by spending a little less time on the transportation potions of this course, which felt repetitive by the end, and making the quizzes some other form of assessment."

                "I would recommend the course to those who are interested in historical urban technologies and transportation. However, this is a pretty niche subject area, so if your interests don't align with this, you may not find it interesting.",
                "Yes. Everyone at Yale has experienced a city and this class does a great deal to explain why things look the way they do.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in urban studies (taught by two people who actually PRACTICE this in the real world) then take this class. Every single reading was fascinating and sometimes we had brilliant class discussions. It is a lot of work -- pop quizzes, lots of reading, and your semester ends with a 25-30 page paper but the two teachers were super helpful throughout the semester and really willing to work with you.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this to another student, under the following condition: you are passionate about the course material and are willing to put in the work. It's one of those classes that is really rewarding, but also challenging. I'm so grateful that I had the opportunity to take this class. I thought that Nate and Jonny were wonderful, and I really hope they can continue to teach at Yale. It's clear that they have a lot to offer.",
                "No I would not. The discussions were dry and the quizzes were frustrating."
