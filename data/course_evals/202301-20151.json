But I also learned many life lessons from Professor Rank's lifetime in service, like how to work with a boss, how to be a good colleague, and how to be a good leader.",
                "This course really teaches you how to write a memo. Prof. Rank will give incredibly detailed (and mildly esoteric) feedback on all of your work and spends 15-20 minutes of each class period laying out his writing advice. My work became much more specific, deliberate, and concise throughout the semester and I appreciate that. \r\n\r\nYou also gain a pretty thorough understanding of the tensions that have driven conflict on the Korean Peninsula from WWII to now. There will likely be a DPRK crisis in your semester! You will learn about that.",
                "Learned about the history of the Korean peninsula crisis and the major players. We spent a lot of the time developing memo-writing skills designed to prepare you to actually work in the policy process."

                "Absolutely! If you want a classroom experience that facilitates real-world diplomacy and policy-making, this is the class for you. Rank's top priority is making sure you leave with a new set of hard skills. I'm so thankful that I used my last GLBL credit on this!",
                "Yes, 100%. This course was like a crash-course in not just diplomacy, but also basic professional competency. I learned so much from Professor Rank's insights on professional life, conflict resolution, and his modeling for us, by his example, what excellent leadership looks like.",
                "I would but I don't think it will be offered again for a while so I won't wax poetic as to why.",
                "Yes, it's a very good class. You will get more feedback on your writing than in probably any other class and learn real practical skills. The simulations are a lot of fun, and Professor Rank tends to cultivate a great class culture."
