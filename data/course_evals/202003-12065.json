                "The course's instructors and TF provide very thorough feedback on the major assignments. The course also dedicated an entire week of readings and discussions to materials related to the history of racial oppression, which is something I really appreciated, especially in light of how academic research can shed light on social issues. The course could be improved by breaking the 3 hours once a week schedule into 2 meet ups, since the long discussions tend to lose momentum at the end.",
                "I was really appreciative of the fact that the readings each week came from various civilizations and were organized around themes under urbanism, rather than focusing on individual societies each week, meaning that we were able to conduct comparative studies of urban societal features such as consumption patterns and urban structure. The assignments were also well-designed and mindful of the fact that students have focused on different areas in the world, as they had a great degree of flexibility in terms of content and how they should be completed.\r\nMy only criticism is that sometimes if I ask a question about an area outside of the instructors' expertise, their answers leave me with something to be desired and I often have to seek help from other professors outside the class."

                "Absolutely. The class was extremely interesting and I likely would have taken it even if it did not count towards my major. I found the course to be well-organized and up-to-date, as many of the readings came from very recent publications. Both professors are extremely experienced and passionate about the subject and do a really good job explaining and clarifying the material. If you take this class, you will likely be among passionate peers, many of whom are likely graduate students, and can encounter new techniques for conducting archaeological analysis."
