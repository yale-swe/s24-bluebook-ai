Weaknesses: sometimes the VHL activities were difficult \/ confusing and only had 1-2 attempts. Also, sometimes I found the workload to be slightly unmanageable",
                "Strengths are the varying activities in and out of the classroom to keep engagement high and work on all areas of the language from listening, speaking, writing, and reading.",
                "Strengths: Giacomos teaching style. Asynchronous Fridays. Textbook\/ Syllabus. Cultural immersion activities like the language exchange and film watching. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Rather unforgiving attendance policy that does not seem fair nor safe in the age of COVID-19. Made me feel like I had to come to class even when I was ill and could put others at risk. Also was not very inclusive of other struggles like personal issues.",
                "There could be more talking and speaking involved in the course in person.",
                "the small class sizes helped me learn the language better with more attention from the professor",
                "The course is well facilitated to encourage a high level of engagement and constant learning.",
                "I wish we didn't redo all the grammar from L1 and L2. I think that it's unnecessary. I would've liked to just watch movies, do audio exercises, listen to songs, read stories, etc to improve our understanding and literacy of the language.",
                "Giacomo is fantastic, and I really like that the course is more of a review than learning new grammar. It puts focus on comfort in becoming conversational.",
                "This course is a great review of the skills we learned in L1 and L2. However, at times it was repetitive, especially in the beginning when we went all the way back to the basics I was already very confident in.",
                "You really can't go wrong with any of the professors in the Italian department and Giacomo is no exception. He's very passionate about language learning and Italian and gives you the flexibility to talk about and learn more about whatever aspect of Italian culture you're curious about.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can think about was the disconnect between what we talked about in class and the content in the textbook. I wish we discussed the subject areas in the textbook a bit more."
