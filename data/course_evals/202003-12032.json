                "Arabic 110 with Professor Elbousty was nothing short of amazing. He is a caring and compassionate professor who is dedicated to ensuring that each student in his class learn and understand the material. While taking this course during my first semester at Yale, I learned about the Islamic culture, the Arabic alphabet, a ton of useful vocabulary that I continue to use in my everyday life.",

                "I not only learned part of a new language, but beneficial ways of studying something completely foreign. The course taught me how to deal with a complex subject matter over a relatively short period of time---breaking down the alphabet, pronunciation etc.",

            "comments": [
                "A major strength of this course is that Professor Elbousty has patience when interacting with his students. He understands that the Arabic language is diffcult to learn and takes his time when reviewing new information. This course moves at a decent pace to where I managed to keep up with the workload each week.  Additionally, I found the discussion section with the T.A to be extremely helpful. The only weakness of this course is that it was taught remotely, which prevents students from receiving the full experience of interacting and engaing with a new foreign language.",
                "Strengths: It was very engaging in the first half of the semester when we had practices in talking in the language. \r\nPlaces to improve: Halfway through the semester, when the classes just became lectures, I felt less engaged with the class. I feel like the lectures could have been posted ahead of time and in class, we actually did engaging activities.",
                "The course did a great job introducing us to the language and exposing us to culture. I felt like the different sorts of activities certainly helped gain different language skills, but having more time to practice speaking with other students would be very helpful.",
                "The class is very interactive and Professor Elbousty is very passionate about teaching. At times, however, the course moves too fast so I needed to spend a significant amount of time outside class to catch up.",
                "Strengths: amazing T.A. \r\nWeaknesses: the professor",
                "Given that this course is an intro language, I feel that instruction as frequent as possible is best for improvement and confidence in learning the new language. While I know the department decided it was best to lecture 2-3 times a week, I believe that at least 4 times a week with live instruction from the professor would result in the most growth and confidence from the students.",
                "This course had many strengths including the copious amounts of support offered to us when we were struggling with new concepts. This is very important for learning a new language such as Arabic, since it is important to ensure that we understand the basic concepts of grammar in Arabic. The TF for the class, Bayan, helped us a lot in our weekly sections in which she went over difficult topics for that week for example forming plurals in Arabic. Additionally, the instructor Professor Elbousty and Bayan were very supportive and passionate teachers. They were very patient and always took their time to explain something that was difficult when we had questions. The class was also paced very well for learning Arabic, in order to give us enough time to understand concepts but also to keep our level of engagement high. The online videos were also very helpful, and helped to supplement our learning of concepts in class. One weakness of the course was that sometimes it was confusing which website we submit our homework to, but this was more of a technical issue.",
                "The highlight of this course was Professor Elbousty. His dedication and flexibility proved invaluable. It was clear that he wanted us to not just learn Arabic, but be surrounded by it with songs, shows, group projects, etc. The only issue I had was through submission dates\/places, but that may be a canvas issue rather than something with the course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Elboustys love for Arabic showed through every minute of this class. I appreciated how the material was given at a pace that took into account everyones situations and personal questions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very few! I wish we did speaking more towards the end of the year and received practice that was similar to the test!"

My professor was a fantastic teacher and I just would like more time with the professor as I progress in Arabic, considering that under normal circumstances the course meets 5 times a week.",
                "Learning a language over Zoom is extremely difficult but this class managed to make it very engaging and successful. The breakout rooms were really great for practicing conversational skills in Arabic and for meeting other classmates. The virtual seminar format was also very effective especially when Professor Elbousty shared his screen so that we can see his PowerPoint or a video talking about an Arabic grammar rule. The weekly TF sections were also very effective, in which Bayan shared her screen and wrote on her iPad like a whiteboard. This was highly effective in simulating a classroom experience and keeping everyone engaged.",
                "Flexibility was key. Being able to meet with our TA once a week with specific questions, expanded deadlines, group projects within our meeting time and optional Saturday review sessions were all invaluable. Given the circumstances, the course was organized and adapted very well.",

Arabic is a beautiful language filled with history and nuances, and this course makes you excited to learn about it because of the highly passionate teachers and course material.",
                "Certainly. It is a heck of a challenge to learn Arabic without any background, but it is a very understanding environment. If one puts in the daily work, they would be surprised with how much they progress.",
                "Dr. Jonas is an incredible teacher. He is pleasant, understanding, and full of knowledge. He truly cares about his students wants them to succeed. I loved his class. Generally, it's a joy to be in class, and it isn't boring at all. He wants you to leave his class better than you came in. He indeed will have you prepared to the next level. I would definitely recommend Dr. Jonas! I've learned a lot, not only basic stuff but also how to think critically and intellectually.",
