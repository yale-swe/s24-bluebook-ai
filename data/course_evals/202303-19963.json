                "Professor Morse was one of the best teachers I have ever had. She truly cares about her students and actively encourages their engagement in a way that makes everyone want to share their opinion. She created a safe and comfortable environment in which we could express our views. The readings she selected were always interesting, and each writing assignment was unique yet built on the previous one. It was great to have so much artistic freedom when it came to selecting our essay topics. I feel a connection to the other students in the class that I have not felt in my other classes. I think we will all take away with us wonderful memories from our time with each other and Professor Morse",
                "Overall the course was engaging, challenging, and overall great.",
                "There were a lot of completion grades which made the class less stressful. We also got to turn in drafts for our essays and received instructor feedback. No weaknesses.",
                "The biggest strength of the course would have to be the professor. She creates a space where even if you are scared to share your thoughts with the class in the beginning of the semester, by the end you feel more comfortable. She has many appointment opportunities, and just shows shes really here for her students.",
                "This course is amazing!",
                "I loved the twice a week seminar format and how close I was with a lot of my classmates, in discussions that originally started on one topic and delved into so much more.",
                "Strengths: Prof Morse was an amazing professor and helped create a really relaxed and positive atmosphere in the class, leading to some great discussions. We were also given a lot of freedom in our papers, especially for the 3rd and 4th ones. Weaknesses: Some of the assigned readings weren't very interesting and didn't feel super on topic to what we were doing in class."

                "Absolutely. Its a fun class, with discussions about an interesting topic and a teacher who loves to teach.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it teaches you how to write at a collegiate level.",
                "Definitely! The classes reading were interesting and the scaffolding for larger assignments was very helpful. Professor Morse is wonderful and extremely kind.",
