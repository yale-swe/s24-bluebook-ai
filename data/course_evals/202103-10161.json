I do think that the first 8 weeks helped me gain a significant foundation of statistics, but I really enjoyed the latter bit in which I was able to apply my knowledge to things I was interested in. The material we discussed was interesting and applicable, and the assignments were engaging and I often found them interesting and fun!",
