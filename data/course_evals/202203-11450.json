My handwriting improved, and with practice it got easier to construct sentences using connecting words. I also learned quite a bit about Arabic culture and music!",
                "I learned basic proficiency in MSA Arabic.",
                "I learned an unprecedented amount of information about the grammar structure, conjugations, and vocabulary of the Arabic Modern Standard Dialect and Shaami. I was at first surprised with how much information was being thrown at me, but I was very pleased upon reaching the final exam and being able to write a full 12 sentence paragraph in Arabic Calligraphy. I feel that I learned as much in one semester of Arabic that I did in 2.5 years of Chinese in high school.",
                "I learned how to read arabic letters in addition to forming a very basic foundation of the way this language works.",
                "As this is an introductory language course we skills were all in the facility of using Arabic. We studied the MSA as well as Shammi, speaking, writing and grammar structures.",
                "You learn the alphabet and how to sight read at the beginning with limited vocabulary and then in the second half of the semester we transitioned to more vocabulary and grammar. I can confidently read words even if I cant always comprehend it.",
                "This course teaches you to read, write and speak Standard Modern Arabic. It is very useful to get an overall idea of the language."

                "I feel that the quantity of Lingco particularly in the beginning of the term was unsustainable and did not foster very healthy learning. Once we got to Al Kitaab, the workload felt a lot more sustainable to me.",
                "I wish there had been more emphasis on spontaneous speaking. We followed the textbook's conversation prompts, but each of those required us to simply translate sentences from English into Arabic, and were not conducive to fluid conversation. However, I also understand that as L1 students our vocabulary for conversations was rather limited. I would have liked to have done some more creative projects throughout the year (eg. make a short video talking about our family and where everyone is from) and present it to the class.",
                "Strengths: \r\n1-on-1 learning\r\nClose\/Hard working TA\r\nMultiple learning sources\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nAvailable office hour times",
                "About five hours of homework needed to be completed each night from Monday-Thursday in order to stay fully on track of the material(which is a little much). I think instead of going over the previous night's homework in class, we should learn more material in class that prepares us for that night's homework.",
                "The strength of the course I think lies in that it is very fast paced which enables all that we learn to build on itself very quickly I myself am very surprised and still in a bit of disbelief as just how much Arabic we were able to learn in such a short time. Also there is not a lot of pressure in the course so the students are able to develop enthusiasm and confidence in the new language. As for weaknesses sometimes there was a disconnect between the asynchronous assignments and the classwork so that the assignments involved structures and vocabulary that we had yet to learn. But maybe this was intentional to make us students work ahead a bit I am not sure.",
                "Strengths: Learning all the alphabet and how to write at the beginning was very helpful. Class was also very engaging, Dr. Aziz is a good teacher. I really enjoyed learning the vocabulary in this class and being able to really see a rapid progression in my comprehension. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are a lotttt of Lingco assignments. Doing them at the beginning was pretty necessary in order to understand what was going on in class. That led to about 2-4 hours of my day being dedicated to Arabic alone. During the second half I let myself fall a little behind and was fine though.",
                "Strength: Intense course work, with additional source material such as lingco website is very useful."

It works through the basics of reading, writing, grammar, and vocabulary in a very methodical manner so that all of the skills build neatly atop one another. I always look forward to when the professor plays music at the end of lessons because it gives a cultural context to the language and culture we are learning about.",
                "Yes",
                "I certainly would recommend this course to another student if they wish to grow as both a student of global cultures as well as push the limits of their learning capabilities.",
                "If the student is very interested in learning Arabic, then definitely! If only sort of interested, it's an extremely large time commitment that often can leave you feeling overloaded with work.",
                "Yes, it is a language course and an introductory one so I think I would recommend it to anyone wishing to start a new language and begin a lifelong love of Arabic. But of course learning a new language is maybe not for everyone but if someone is enthusiastic and wants to learn Arabic than I think this course will exceed any expectations they may have.",
                "I would recommend this class if you are serious about taking it all the way to L5, because its a great class, its just very time consuming.",
                "Yes, this course is very good for those students who wish to learn Arabic."
