    "I had never taken German before but absolutely loved this course. It was set up in a way that even with no prior knowledge I learned the basics of German.",
    "Fundamentals of the German language and grammar.",
    "I learned more about German vocabulary, grammar, and culture. The course was very challenging, but overall it was worth it because of the improvement I made.",
    "I learned how to read, write, and say sentences in German and I learned about German culture.",
    "I learned German, and how to memorize things more effectively.",
    "I gained a comprehensive knowledge base of the German language and feel very confident with the material we covered throughout the course."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - In class time is very productive and well spent. I enjoyed the activities and felt doing the HW the night before prepared you for class. Exercises were thoughtful and helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I wish we spent more time on grammar. I felt like I was learning each concept individually so it was hard to combine them on the tests. I also thought some of the emphasis on the tests was not covered well in class.",
    "Strengths: Very rigorous, one is very motivated to keep up with the course material and not fall behind. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The online homework was very tedious and not very productive in my opinion.",
    "The class is very focused on vocabulary, but more focus on sentence structure and grammar would have been really helpful. There was one point in the class during a particularly hard unit where we spent the week of a test watching a movie rather than going over material. Things like that could definitely be changed. Overall though its well organized. If youre taking it to learn intro German, youll learn intro German.",
    "Maybe a little more time for Grammar in the end, and less Connect? Towards the end, it was more repetitive than it needed to be.",
    "I feel that the format of the online homework could be improved because I dont feel that it helped my knowledge of the German language very much."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Take good notes, buy the textbook, and do the work and you will love it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. You go very quickly through the material, so I would strongly advise you to study every day and be on top of your work.",
    "If you want to learn German or have some background in German, definitely. If youre just looking for a language to fulfill the requirement, maybe not. Its a tough language and niche enough where a lot of students in the class already have a background in it. The professor also matters a lot. Christina was wonderful and if you get the chance, definitely take it with her.",
    "I would, I love German! Love my teacher too!",
    "Yes I would recommend it because I enjoyed watching my knowledge grow, however I feel that there are much easier language options here at Yale that deter people away from wanted to take German because they fear of receiving a low grade."
