Fine if the labs are well-designed and explained, but they were mediocre and at times very tedious.",

                "Great coverage and foundation on basics of observational astronomy. Lectures are engaging and hands-on. Labs allowed students to carry out their own observations. Could provide students with more materials\/documentations\/decks to refer to when doing lab reports.",
                "This course is very hands-on. Going through the labs definitely helped with my learning.",
                "The course has a very open format, due to telescope time being limited based on whether. Thus the timing of actual lab work was convenient for scheduling. The classes were engaging and the lab work itself was interesting and a unique online experience compared to the lecture nature of my other classes. It was incredibly rewarding to operate a telescope from my hope many miles away and then study that data.",
                "Strengths: You learn various imaging techniques. It's also a pretty easy lab substitute for Astro majors. \r\nWeaknesses:  I found most of the additional help from the instructor to be unnecessarily convoluted. It also took them several months to grade the majority of our labs, making it difficult to gauge where we were at in the course.",
                "Observation sessions should be run by teacher, or else TAs should be briefed much more thoroughly, because they were often very rough. Labs could involve far less busy work",
                "The content was very interesting but it was quite a lot of work for only a half-credit class. I believe this  could be improved by having fewer labs, especially because being clouded out was an issue with several.",
                "The course was self-directed in many aspects, with supplementary weekly discussions that really helped with the time zone differences and kept me engaged while still remaining flexible.",
                "It is too much of a time commitment for only half a credit",
                "The ability to carry out actual observing was very helpful and a lot of fun. The labs were also very interesting as they covered a range of topics in astronomy and included various data analysis techniques. The live lectures\/demonstrations of lab material were very helpful in understanding the context of the lab and in making its instructions clear."

The optional in-person observing sessions would have been very useful for using the telescopes directly, but unfortunately weather did not cooperate."
