                "This course does a great job of improving your writing and presentation skills on top of everything you learn in class.",

The workload is also very manageable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: in a remote setting, it is very easy to doze off during presentations. A more interactive component beyond passive lectures would have engaged us more, I believe.",
                "The nice thing about this class is that it is taught by the students taking the class as they present weekly lectures on a topic related to the fundamentals of Neuroimaging. Which works very well if all the students are passionate about the topic they are presenting on and if they are well prepared. Thw course could be improved by the instructors having  a checklist of items that need to be covered for each lecture to ensure that the rest of the students can learn all the necessary course material in a more consistent manner.",
                "The course relies on the students to teach themselves for about 80% of the lectures.",
                "while I liked that students gave the presentations, there were certain students with much stronger presenting skills than others...and so there were a few weeks in which staying engaged was very challenging because students were not particularly strong or engaging presenters\/teachers",
                "This was a great introduction to neuroimaging and the concepts behind it. Lectures were presented by students and everyone was very well prepared as we had to meet with the professors in advance and were able to ask questions and get feedback on presentation material. The textbook was provided online and it was very straightforward and helpful.",
                "Strengths = team presentations, learning from classmates was very engaging and exciting \r\nWeakness = extreme vagueness in assignments",
                "Content can get repetitive over the semester, and the level of teaching quality (inevitably) varies across students.",
                "Fantastic course! I really enjoyed that all of the students were able to learn from one another through student presentations each week",
                "Strengths of the course include the willingness of the professors to meet with students, provide help with the presentation and papers and discuss materials. Having the opportunity to present and learn from peers is also very beneficial. However, a weakness of the course is also that, aside from the first few weeks, every class is completely a student presentation.",

                "BENG 485 presents a good, low-stress way to knock out a writing credit if you haven't already. The class can be boring at times, especially if it is still presented in a remote setting. Also, maybe some degree of interest in neuroimaging would be helpful. But people from various majors take the class, and they all bring in different perspectives on how to apply and approach neuroimaging techniques. So personally, I would recommend the class.",
                "Absolutely, this is a fantastic class regardless of your major. If you have any interest in understanding how fMRI works or how researchers scan the brain, this class is amazing. Many different aspects of imaging are covered and the two major writing assignments are open to any topic as long as its related to the fundamentals covered in class, which makes the class engaging regardless of personal interests.",
                "yes! fascinating content",
                "I think especially if you are doing research with neuroimaging, this is a great way to understand the concepts behind it and also understand the shortcomings of it as well. It is important to know what you are actually seeing in the results from different scans.",
                "If neuroscience major, really useful information necessary for later courses",
                "If you need a WR and are a neuro major, then this is a gentle surface-level introduction to (non-human) neuroimaging methods. If you're premed or are familiar with the content, maybe consider other courses.",
                "Yes! Fantastic course and a great writing credit especially for students more interested in scientific writing as opposed to analytical essays",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. The content is very interesting and in depth into multiple imaging techniques. The opportunity to present a topic to the class in a small group is also very fun."
