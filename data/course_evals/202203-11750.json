                "Learned about how Aristotle's principles regarding ancient theater apply to modern media. Was able to develop a beat sheet and original story idea from what we learned in class.",
                "I learned about Aristotle's understanding of compelling storytelling and how elements of this philosophy are present in modern day media, primarily Hollywood films. I feel better prepared to craft an interesting story now that I know what plot points I should hit if I'm following the standard template.",
                "I got a lot of useful terminology and conceptual tools to diagram the components and functions of storytelling devices, as well as a general understanding of what separates a successful story from an unsuccessful one and why.",
                "Class was helpful in developing u detests ding of storytelling technique and patters, along with conversation of form and structuring essays.",
                "I learned how a story is crafted, through the strong similarities between Aristotle poetics and the modern day 3 Act structure. Youre not going to be learning in this class too much, but you will be learning how to write. In some ways, thats much more profound.",
                "Learned about classical storytelling models including Aristotle's/3-act structure, the hero's journey, and character archetypes. It was very interesting to explore and classify the (usually instinctive) patterns when we tell stories.",
                "I have an understanding of what it takes to tell a good story. We went in depth into Poetics and The Hero's Journey. I learned a lot about the structure of stories especially in movies -- three act structure. I have come out of the class inspired to tell my own stories using the structures we learned in class.",
                "I learned a lot about the structure of storytelling (especially pertaining to film) that has left me with a lot to think about as I continue to watch films and consume media."

                "Strengths of this class were an amazing professor, great discussion, and interesting/easy content. Overall, it is a chill and fun class. Only cons were that some of the classes felt like we were doing the same thing when going over content and there wasn't much intellectual challenge outside of the major assignments (although many would actually consider a pro of the class).",
                "A strength of this course is that we covered interesting material and students aren't bogged down with assignments, so the focus is on in-class discussions. A weakness is that class content at times feels a bit repetitive.",
                "I found this course to overall be very strong, and achieve exactly what it set out to. The only lacuna I felt was that we spent essentially the whole duration of the course discussing either Hollywood films or folklore from other cultures. I would have appreciated a bit of a wider focus, as well as some conversation about what sorts of stories various mediums better or worse support- that sort of understanding across mediums would have made this course even more valuable for people like me, storytellers who don't plan on being filmmakers.",
                "The course allows for engaged class discussion on topics of storytelling structure, overall no suggestions.",
                "Strengths: dives very deeply into certain narrative models (Aristotle, 3-act structure, hero's journey, character archetypes); fun and engaging; allows for a lot of creative expression; good workload; exposes you to new movies, stories, etc... my favorite course this semester\r\nWeaknesses: would be interesting to explore more modern or unconventional narrative models",
                "I really enjoyed the structure of the course. Each lecture was extremely engaging, and the slide presentations helped ground me in the material. Professor Price is amazing and structures each class like its own story.Overall I wish we could have written a screenplay, but I really enjoyed the original narrative work we had to do.",
                "This course was super interesting, fun, and Prof. Price did an amazing job. You really get to choose what you want to focus on (as the crux of the class is that all stories share the same essential qualities) so you can pick out the exact stories that fascinate you, and then dive into them."

                "This is a great introductory course if you are interested in screenwriting and film in general. Professor Price is amazing at guiding instruction, and the content is very interesting and fun. Even if you aren't interested in film, this class is perfect for being introduced into college-style discussion as a freshman.",
                "Definitely. If you're interested in filmmaking and storytelling (comedy, writing, theater, etc.) you'll love the content and class atmosphere. The course moves slowly and doesn't have that many assignments (a few weekly assignments, and three fun graded ones). That, in addition to the fact that Professor Price is a great, kind teacher, makes it a fantastic gut and first-year seminar.",
                "This course was very useful to me. I think any student with a future in narrative creation would benefit deeply from this course, but if that isn't something someone were considering, I would advise them knock out a writing credit or something instead.",
                "I would recommend this class as a fun, engaging discussion of story and film",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, especially if they are interested in learning how to write. If you put the time and work into the class, you can get a lot out of it.",
                "Yes, if you're into screenwriting definitely but also for novel writers, play-writers, and people who enjoy reading fiction.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I always looked forward to it, and it was a low stress and extremely rewarding class. It will really make you think about stories and movies differently.",
                "I absolutely would recommend this class to anybody interested in film, storytelling, or just looking for a Fun in-class experience with very little busy work."
