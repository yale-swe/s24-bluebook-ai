The assignments are very manageable and give you the opportunity to bring your own perspective to the topics of the class. Hard to name something to improve!",
                "Strengths: Professor Savci is an amazing professor who makes everyone feel welcome to contribute to our discussions. This was my first WGSS course and I did not feel intimidated at all be because of Professor Savci's ability to break down what we were learning into ideas we could all understand. \r\nWeaknesses: None.",

While these discussions could get lost in the cloud of theory, the course material grounds the class in everyday life, which enlivens the discussion even more. Overall, a wonderful and intellectually stimulating class on a complex topic.",
