                "I really enjoyed the lectures. The first couple lectures of senior essay writing tips and how to write the lit review, deal with sources, etc was very helpful.",
                "I thought it was great! Its more so individual work but I appreciated the dinners & support from Rebecca and Ken.",
                "Strengths: Prof Toseland is very helpful with coordinating, and of course my own thesis advisor was extremely open and helpful with feedback, guidance, and mentorship.",
                "well organized; and not too much work if you are self motivated",
                "Strengths: Rebecca Toseland provides wonderful support for this course. The TA this year Ken Jung also gave excellent advice and made himself available to questions. I enjoyed both their willingness to give their time and energy to senior essay writers as well as their efforts to creating a community among senior thesis writers. \r\nWeaknesses: writing a senior thesis is primarily a self-directed activity, so it's really hard to formalize a course environment around something that is mostly independent work.",
                "I liked how flexible the course was. There were a lot of resources available, but there often wasn't a strict schedule, and it was possible to take advantage of these resources on your own time (e.g. having recordings of the classes and optional group meetings).",
                "Strengths: I think the thesis does a lot to help you learn what research is very quickly. The lectures are really helpful and Rebecca and the TA are very available to help you with anything. Also, librarians are extremely helpful and there are plenty of seniors writing an Economics essay to commiserate with. Weaknesses: I think the main improvement could be finding ways to support students in finding relevant research topics. I know part of the point is to find an independent topic, but that makes it very difficult for certain students without connections to the department to get started and make the most of the semester. Maybe some professors could put together proposals or share topics they think could be fruitful as a starting point, or librarians could give an overview of key data sources to look at, or something else that makes it easier to get started. For myself and many students I spoke with, this was a very challenging part of the process and made it really difficult to get going.",
                "This course offers great support for writing the senior essay. The lectures were helpful and interesting. Peer groups and office hours also offered great opportunities to get feedback and advice on the essay.",
                "The asynchronous nature can be challenging. However, the class material was helpful, succinct, and necessary.",
                "Overall I had a very good experience, although I would think much of it is dependent on whether you find something of interest to research and whether you work well with your advisor. However, I appreciated in general that there was a lot of support from the department in terms of providing resources to help when stuck."

                "Definitely! If you want to do something significant and meaningful to cap off your time studying economics, writing a thesis is certainly an excellent idea. However, it does also depend on your advisor, so make sure to try and work with someone who is knowledgeable and critical, but in a constructive way.",
                "yes, i cherished the opportunity to work on an independent, driven project",

                "Yes, especially if the student is interested in research. This course gives students the opportunity to conduct independent research while still receiving guidance and feedback from both faculty and other students who may be experiencing similar struggles.",
                "Yes! Reflect on if this is something you want to spend your senior year doing, as it does take a lot of mental energy and can be very draining relative to a normal (or even high) course load. That being said, it is a very fulfilling way to cap off your Yale experience.",
                "Yes, writing the senior essay in economics is a great experience. This course offers great support in doing so.",
