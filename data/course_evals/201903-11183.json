   "comments": [
    "After just three months of learning ASL, I already feel comfortable enough to express my own ideas fairly well. Of course there is still much to learn, but this class helped me get to a good beginner level better faster than any other language class I have ever taken. This is the most incredible experience I have ever had with a language class. As someone who is interested in linguistics, I loved that Mikey detailed many semantic and syntactic concepts that other languages do not. It is satisfying to learn and understand the underlying mechanism of the language, rather than just drilling over and over. Aside from the obvious advantage of getting to learn a great language, I also learned a lot about Deaf Culture and my perspective on human communication expanded greatly. I am becoming more involved in the ASL at Yale group here, which has provided me with a community of people I never would have met otherwise. Also Mikey is just awesome. I feel so blessed to have been able to take this class.",
    "I learned the basics of ASL.",
    "This course provided me with a foundation in ASL. I learned more about deaf culture, ASL grammar, and other aspects that involving language learning. Prior to taking the course, I wondered how I would learn language without using my voice and Mikey amazed me with his dedication to us learning ASL.",
    "If I were to compare how much I learned this semester to my Spanish language courses, I would certainly say that I learned a whole lot more in this course. Not only did I learn a huge list of signs, I also feel that I gained the confidence to be able to converse with others in the language which is something that I value greatly.",
    "I gained a basic knowledge of ASL, as well as some information about deaf culture.",
    "I learned how to speak and interpret basic sign language, and also learned about deaf culture.",
    "Basic ASL signs and appropriate signing technique.",
    "I gained new language skills and great knowledge about communication of deaf people.",
    "Learned a new language!",
    "This course teaches all the necessary signs for a beginner level signer to know in order to hold basic conversations and tell stories in ASL. With that comes an introduction to Deaf culture."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: \r\n- The curriculum is very well-designed and thought-out. I never felt lost, but always felt challenged enough to stay engaged.\r\n- There is a good mix of comprehension and expression, and you must participate as a student (which really helps facilitate learning!)\r\n- Mikey is an amazing professor.\r\n- There is a lot of vocabulary of course, but the class also covers semantic and syntactic concepts in a way that will really appeal to somebody who is interested in languages.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There really isn't anything I can think of as a \"weakness.\" It might be cool though if L1 required one short presentation in front of the class (maybe just a minute or two), but I'm sure we will do that in later levels.",
    "The strengths of this course are its efficiency and high level of engagement. We learned so much in a short amount of time and class was always so engaging, with active participation from everyone.",
    "Strength - Mikey's engagement, the construct feedback, the preparedness of the material, Mikey's punctuality, the coursework, and Mikey always had a smile on his face and was ready to teach.\r\n\r\nWeakness - No office hours were provided for students, the price of the required material, and not enough review sessions",
    "I think a strength of this course would be the enthusiasm and knowledge of the professor who always made it a great class to come to. I also think that it was great that we consistently broke into smaller groups before sharing out in class as this strengthened the bonds between classmates and gave us more confidence in our skills. I think one small improvement could be the incorporation of more TrueWay ASL videos closer to the beginning of the semester. I felt like starting right around the time of our third quiz, these super fast signers and variations in ASL were thrown at us and I think it would be more helpful to have some sort of build up to this so it didn't feel like it was coming all at once.",
    "The structure of the class is amazing. Every day is super engaging and you learn so much pretty quickly. Honestly no weaknesses.",
    "The instructor is definitely the strength of this course. He brought energy and excitement to class every day that made the class fun to attend. You can tell that he really cares about ASL, deaf culture, and teaching new people sign language.",
    "A strength is that it requires the participation of all students. A weakness is that some frequently used terminology like negation is not learned until the latter half of the class which makes expressing oneself in actual conversation difficult.",
    "I found the engaging quality of every class to be excellent in addition to the humor the instructor shed on the class. It could be improved by providing better skills to study and practice with. The online sites, whilst useful, are not the best tools.",
    "Love love love this class, no weaknesses!",
    "This class is incredibly engaging, as your attention must be completely committed to watching the professor and the screen\/powerpoint upon which the material is being presented. A challenge of the course is that ASL is difficult to practice on ones own, so I found it hard to remember or keep track of what I did or did not know; all the powerpoint from class are posted on Canvas, so for someone taking this class, I'd recommend reviewing those powerpoints after each class to really review what is covered in class (since so much is covered each day!).",
    "The class was extremely engaging. Even though we learned what seemed like thousands of vocabulary words, I feel so much more confident in my sign language skills and it's only L1. Professor Barrett made every single class engaging, adding various activities and games. The powerpoints sometimes even included pictures of his Bitmoji doing different ridiculous tasks that made everyone laugh while simultaneously learning how to sign whatever it was doing. I absolutely adored this class, it was definitely my favorite of the semester."

    "I would recommend this class to everybody, regardless of whether have a natural capacity for learning languages. ASL is so unique and amazingly expressive. Mikey is just a gem in every sense of the word, and I feel so lucky to have taken this class. It has honestly had a positive impact on my academic and personal life. Take this class!!!",
    "Yes, it is so much fun and you learn a lot.",
    "Yes, more students at Yale need to take ASL course. Mikey is a very passionate instructor and this helps with learning!",
    "Definitely! If you're looking for a unique language credit then this is definitely the class for you!! I learned so much this semester and it was also such a fun class to be in.",
    "100%. It is a very different experience to learning a spoken language, but I guarantee you won't regret it.",
    "Absolutely! ASL is like no language Ive ever learned, and Mikey is like no Professor Ive ever had. This course was a unique Yale experience, and Im so grateful that I got the chance to take it.",
    "Definitely if they are actually interested in learning. Its a hard language to learn and you probably wont be able to if youre just trying to do the bare minimum to pass the class",
    "Yes! This class takes a challenging new way of communication and makes it fun and interesting.",
    "Yes. favorite class i've ever taken!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to learn about Deaf culture and learn ASL in an immersive way; getting to know and learn from a professor who is also Deaf makes the experience very personal. That being said, if you cannot commit to the challenges of the language and course, and to staying present and engaged and energetic with the language\/expression\/etc, then you might find this course difficult.",
    "YES YES YES!! I LOVE THIS CLASS!! Professor Barrett is SO obviously excited about teaching that it makes learning 10 times more fun! He ALWAYS has a smile on his face and would skip around class in excitement for teaching. His moments of excitement after we all would clearly understand a complicated concept were the most encouraging moments during the class and put a smile on all of our faces. I already loved the language before beginning the class but now I somehow love it even more. Take this class!",
    "Yes, it provides a great introduction to ASL and is an engaging and fun class."
