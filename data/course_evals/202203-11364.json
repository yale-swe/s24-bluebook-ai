It's definitely tough to have students get a sense of over thousands of years of complex history, culture, philosophy, and literature in one semester, but I feel like this course does well from the ancient Shang Dynasty up to the Eight Nation Alliance.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: I feel like sometimes we didn't really have to go to lecture because it felt like we were being talked at. There were also a lot of readings. Weaknesses: The exams threw me off. I didn't expect them to have such thorough exams because there's so much information being tested that studying is hard. In addition, we also had essays to write as well. The workload is definitely higher than you'd initially expect.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bender is really great! His lectures are super well-organized, and he's great at answering any questions we have. In general, great class. Weaknesses: Might want to reconsider the third essay. First off, the Story of the Stone is super duper long, so we only read a tiny portion of it (which itself is long). On top of that, the articles we could choose from for the third essay about Story of the Stone were extremely difficult to understand. Also, the readings on Lu Xun were only assigned on the last week of class, and the essay wasn't even due a week later, so it was harder to start early. All of this is compounded by the fact that it is the end of the semester, so it is in general chaotic. A better third essay might be to look at readings from earlier so we aren't scrambling towards the end, or to make the essay look back and reflect on the general themes of the class.",
                "Strengths: Luke Bender is a great lecturer and the content is so interesting\r\nWeaknesses: way too many assignments",
                "I think this course was incredibly well-designed and taught, from Professor Bender to the TF sessions. The only downside was that at times, it was difficult to get a strong discussion going in section, but that seems to be a function of a lecture, often.",
                "Best Chinese literature and history class here at Yale, hands-down. You'll regret it if you don't take it.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bender is a great lecturer. He is clear, organized, and sometimes humorous. He is also happy to meet with students during office hours. The readings are great, although sometimes they are a bit long. The sections are helpful. I can't think of any significant weaknesses.",
                "The strengths of this course were Professor Bender! He is an amazing lecturer and makes any topic exciting. The weaknesses of this course was the overwhelming amount of material we were asked to prepare for the midterm but most notably the final.",
                "Readings and lectures were super engaging, Canvas page was really well-organized. The only weakness might be that the non-WR discussion sections were not super engaging.",
                "The strengths are definitely Professor Bender's passion for teaching Chinese literature and the detailed slides.Also, the essays were spaced in a way that helped facilitate our understanding of the content while allowing us enough time to deeply analyze and draw insightful ideas from what we were learning to write. I also loved the option of the creative project - I had a lot of fun with it! I also liked that there was a lecture and a section where we could more closely engage with the TF.",
                "I really enjoyed the lectures, and sections were very helpful. The Chinese section was tailored so that the material was relevant and engaging, while also very manageable.",
                "I enjoyed reading the variety of text that was assigned for class and the discussion sections often involving lots of engaging and interesting conversations. The weakness of the class is that is not much guidance on the writing prompts and a clear rubric or guideline we should follow for the essays.",

                "I'd recommend if you want a crash course on Chinese history and culture that you may not have been exposed to before. Our course covered things like different forms of Chinese opera and play, Song porcelain, famous landscape paintings, modern Chinese philosophers, ancient Chinese philosophers and scholars, and even some music. It was pretty enjoyable if you have a genuine interest in such things. If you don't want that much work though, I'd say this course's engagement is higher than the average Chinese class because of the readings of ancient texts.",
                "Yes! You learn so much about Chinese philosophy and history and everything. Also, you will finally get to know Confucius better.",

I think the material was fascinating, taught incredibly well (Professor Bender's lectures were always well done), and the material is incredibly important to understanding China and East Asia. Also for any student who primarily has focused on the Western tradition in any way, this course is great for expanding horizons.",

If you have any interest in Chinese literature whatsoever take this class, Professor Bender is an amazing lecturer and you'll get to learn so much about both the history and the literature of China. We also go on a field trip to the Art Gallery which is a highlight of the semester.",

                "I would highly recommend this class if youre really interested in Chinese history, early philosophy, and reading Chinese text. We learn a lot about the origins of a lot of cultural themes, icons, and values that originated from the dynastic times which are still very prevalent today.",
                "yes! very interesting course with an excellent professor",
                "Yes, great way to get a broad understanding of Chinese history.",
