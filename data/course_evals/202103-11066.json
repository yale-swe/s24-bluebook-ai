As someone, who is more interested in theory, I enjoyed the parts of the course that are taught from a theoretical perspective the most. I feel like cutting short some of the more observational aspects in favor of more detail on theory (e.g., gravitational instabilities, galaxy evolution modeling, AGNs, ...) would have improved the course for me personally ---  especially since I felt that there was some overlap between this course and the graduate course on ISM."

                "I think I would recommend this course to other students. It's well taught and well structured, which means that the course is enjoyable even without an own strong interest in the field. I think many topics in galaxies are also useful in a general Astrophysics context, so you can get something out of the course even if your field of research is something else.\r\nThe caveat is the fairly high workload which is in part due to the very frequent problem sets, and in part due to the in-class mid-term and final exams. I think the exams do require a fair amount of studying if the goal is to do really well, as questions can be very specific. So I would recommend this course to fellow students under the condition that they don't have more than one other high-workload course."
