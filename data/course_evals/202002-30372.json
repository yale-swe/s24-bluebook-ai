    "I learned about italian culture and I quickly learned how to speak and write Italian at a relatively high level for such a short session",
    "This class is a fantastic intro to Italian without dogging students with tedious work. I learned the basics: the present, basic past tenses, and plenty of important vocab. This intensive summer course is a great start for Italian learners, especially romance language speakers.",
    "I learned the basics of Italian vocabulary and grammar.",
    "A base understanding of basic Italian communication and culture.",
    "Italian",
    "I learned a strong base in grammar and vocabulary for Italian.",

   "comments": [
    "Since it's online, it's definitely not the same experience we would have in a classroom, but the professors have done a fantastic job adapting under the circumstances and making it as rewarding as possible. I've still learned a lot and class is still engaging and fun to be part of.",
    "Strenghts: All students are very involved, teachers are very helpful and accessible, the course is very structured and easy to follow along. \r\nWeakness: The presentations are sometimes difficult to do straight after an exam, especially with a later time zone",
    "This class is super engaging. Deborah and Anna do a great job of keeping it interesting and making Italian one of my favorite classes of all time, not just with the material but with it all. We got to hear Italian music, watch videos of a humorous cheesy Italian soap opera, and have great conversations.",
    "This course was taught online and it was great! The assignments and class activities helped me understand the material. The course goes very fast through the material and you're expected to learn and practice a lot on your own, but that was very manageable when studying from home.",
    "The homework's are not very helpful for the purpose of furthering your learning and building confidence.",
    "I think learning to speak a new language suffers during an online format, but the professors were really proactive about working with the mode of instruction and I think they did a really good job of making sure that an online format did not hurt speaking. I think the reading\/writing\/grammar section of the course was a lot of work but really reaped rewards.",
    "strength: consistent assignments, grades, run very smoothly"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. One just needs to be ready to invest about 4-5 hours each day (including two hours class) in order to keep with the fast pace and do well in this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The professors have been so welcoming and helpful; they've created a collaborative class environment even when we're all scattered around the world. I do feel like I've learned a lot in just a few short weeks, even taking the class over Zoom. I've not only learned some of the language, I've also learned about Italian culture and society. I was worried about taking a class over Zoom, especially a language class, but it has been such a pleasant and wonderful experience that I would absolutely recommend it, even online.",
    "Yes. The class is very enjoyable and everyone is included in the discussions and work.",
    "Absolutely. Anna and Deborah are gems. Both are fantastic professors. Take it with them if you can.",
    "I recommend this course as a great introduction to Italian, especially if it's taught online. It's intense, but you can be flexible with when and how you learn the material. You really do learn the language, but it's also one of the best ways to get the language requirement out of the way.",
    "Definitely, was a great opportunity to obtain language credits and the professors are great!",
    "Yes, but I would recommend waiting to take this class in person.",
    "yes, very fun"
