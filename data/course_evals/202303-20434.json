                "Learned about anti-racist pedagogy: we talked a lot about the underlying assumptions of modern day education, and deconstructed dominant/oppositional practices. We talked about topics such as accompaniment, culturally responsive teaching, and anti-racist pedagogies in different communities. We also worked with a teacher partner on a project, which allowed us to put our learning into practice, and had a lot of teachers come in to talk about their experiences.",

Our conversations were not just limited to identifying the problem in schools but also to reimagining our systems for the healing and growth of our students. This class is also one that is very important to take, as it centralizes the constructions of race, class, gender, ability, etc. in our education systemswhich is important not only in reflecting on early education and high school but also in our college careers and potential teaching careers. This class is even important for people not going into teaching, as it thinks critically on the violent systems that we live in and how to rebuild them. I also deeply appreciated the ability to work alongside a New Haven org, and critically think about my positionality as both Yale students and as a person from a community like New Haven.",

                "This course is an absolute gem. The professor and TF are incredible, the work is worth doing, and the partnerships are deeply impactful. The readings were always relevant and thought-provoking; the journal entries made for a great way to process them on our own; and the class is structured in a way that really builds community, within the class and out in New Haven.",
                "strength was that I learned a lot",
                "Strengths: interesting content readings/listenings are really good, not too much out of class work, welcoming and inviting classroom space. Teacher partnership is really great.\r\nWeaknesses: there is an assumption about political leanings and opinions upon entering the class. It's not really a place to go to learn about anti-racism, rather a place to participate in anti-racist education. There is also very little feedback provided to the students throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: 1) Our TF Micah and Professor HoSang were an incredible teaching team, and I learned so much from them about education as well as activism and community organizing. 2) I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to partner with a New Haven teacher to co-create anti-racist curricular materials for her classroom. It was so wonderful to work with my partner teacher and teach in her classroom this semester. 3) I learned so much and was inspired by the guest speakers who came to our class and shared their experiences in education as teachers, former students of HoSang, etc. 4) The readings and class introduced me to so many new topics and taught me how to better practice care in all aspects of my life. I am not only more knowledgeable as a student but also a more thoughtful, caring person thanks to this class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Although I loved being a student of Professor HoSang, I felt like there were times where he wasnt understanding of students and our capacities and what we were dealing with outside of class.",
                "Strengths: the teacher partner project was a highlight, we did a project where we helped a teacher with implementing an anti-racist curriculum, and that helped us with imagining what a different type of curriculum could be. The guest speakers were also quite helpful and brought a lot of different perspectives to the class. I think a lot of the classes were quite thoughtful and had a lot of interesting ideas, and I do think generally there was a lot of space for us to air our thoughts. Weaknesses: I wish there'd been more deadlines/guidance/expectations for the project - for the first couple of months me and my class partner didn't really know what we were doing, and after we settled on making some items it was a bit of a guessing game for what the final product should look like. (There were examples given, but with these it was a kinda figure-it-out-based-on-vibes kinda deal, which I think could've been elaborated on more.) - And of course the final project will vary and it's nice that it was freeform, but I think having more deliverables or more checking in on status would have helped us with figuring out what we were doing. (I still learned a lot from the project though!).",
                "Strengths: the partnership with a NHPS teacher, the workload in service of our NHPS teacher, classmate partnership, readings, and in class guest lecturers. The weaknesses were really only that I think this class often times felt a little too big, I think 20 is too many to create an intimate class settingat least there should be enough seats at the table.",
                "This class felt so meaningful and connected to real life, particularly this semester. The thing I had a hard time with is because this class takes on so much, at times it feels like three separate things (project, guest speaker series, and usual seminar) competing for one time slot. I don't think everything got as much attention as it deserved, and I would've appreciated a little more guidance on the project, but I also wouldn't have wanted to sacrifice any of the content or guest speakers... so I understand that Professor HoSang and Micah are in a tough spot.",
                "The work felt very intentional. It's rare to find a class at Yale where the work students are expected to complete doesn't necessarily (or directly) benefit us, a grade, or a major requirement. While I do believe I took a lot away from my time in this course, the impact I was able to create and hopefully sustain with other students was a true highlight.",
                "i wish we had more to time to talk with our peers about our teacher partner projects; i also really loved how dr.erica watson showed us what anti-racist curriculum can look like instead of just talking about bit"

                "Sure! I'm glad I took the class. I learned a great deal about what anti-racism is and how to use it in educational contexts. It was really fun getting to work with the teacher partner. I would just advise to be comfortable in your relationship with anti-racism before taking the class. It's not really a space to share much of any opposition to the tenets of anti-racism. Such positions would likely be ridiculed and shot down by the other students in the classroom.",

                "I think this is a pretty thoughtful course with a lot of different ideas. I think that there is a lot of centering of action, e.g. around the teacher partner project, which I think is nice. I do think this class has a lot of overlap with some other courses (e.g. EDST 205/285, and some other courses I can't think of right now), which I think is fine, you just might find a lot of repeating discussions if you're deep down the edst rabbit hole. I still learned a lot though, and I think that it was a class which motivated me to constantly be thinking and reflecting on myself and calling me to action, which I think are both important, and which traces a different path and focus than other edst classes. Overall, I think this class was quite thoughtful and would recommend if you're remotely interested in education/going into education in some capacity in the future!",

Very warm to everyone and very understanding that we were all coming in with different levels of knowledge on the class. Definitely organized the class to be very discussion-based so that we were all learning from each other rather than promoting teacher-student hierarchies. Deeply appreciated his form of teaching!",
