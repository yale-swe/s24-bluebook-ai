    "I now have much-needed foundational knowledge that will help me understand works in analytic philosophy responding to Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein. I also better understand the founding purpose of analytic philosophy and how the field has evolved over time. This course also made me think a lot about the benefits and limits of the analytic tradition in philosophy.",
    "Read and discussed Wittgenstein's Tractatus and works from Russell and Frege.",
    "We learned about the ideas of Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, and other major figures in the history of Analytic philosophy.  We also engaged with contemporary perspectives on these thinkers.  The material is sufficiently difficult that much of class is spent trying to reconstruct and understand the arguments from the readings.",
    "Plain and simple: what the roots of the analytic tradition in Western Philosophy are. And how Wittgenstein just tore the whole edifice down. The course (at least as taught by P. Franks) might be better titled, \"Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,\" though, because it became clear pretty early on that our engagement with Frege and Russell was just really setting us up to read Wittgenstein and understand what he was doing. Cool material, though -- honestly, probably should be mandatory for anyone who wants to engage with philosophy of language, logic, mind, or most branches of metaphysics.",
    "The name of the class says it all",
    "I learned how to analyze complex philosophical works, such as those of Frege, Bradley, Russell, and Wittgenstein, to a thorough extent, particularly with a mind towards the intellectual history driving the creation of analytic philosophy. We also spent a lot of time discussing different interpretations of certain texts like the Tractatus, which took the analysis to that deeper level of not just learning the interpretations, but learning how to decide between them and interpret on one's own."

   "comments": [
    "The readings were wonderful, as were the class discussions.  The secondary reading was particularly well-chosen, and though there was a lot of reading, all of it felt useful and justified. \r\nI would have been interested in reading other students' weekly questions. Perhaps in the future students could post them on Canvas (under Discussion) rather than just emailing them to Professor Franks.",
    "I like the weekly email with a question (or some kind of weekly reading assignment) and found it to be engaging. I enjoyed the readings. Class discussions could have been more productive in terms of organizing information for optimal comprehension.",
    "The material is very interesting!  Engaging with the mainstays of the Analytic tradition will change the way you think about language and the world.  Workload is manageable.  Class discussions were helpful but occasionally got bogged down or went off on tangents.",
    "This class is quite the intellectual challenge, but a worthwhile one. A major strength was how Prof. Franks tied in the background of Kantianism, German Idealism, and Absolute Idealism. This was very illuminating. His detailed outlines were extremely helpful. Some of the other undergraduates and I were somewhat lost on some of the distinctions that especially Frege made, so it would have been helpful to have had those more systematically explained at greater length prior to the discussions about them. Other than that, this was a very solid course.",
    "Strengths: Important material, really lovely professor who is also brilliant.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the whole \"seminar\" thing didn't really happen. See my \"recommended?\" for more on that.",
    "There was a lot of material to cover in what seemed like a short amount of time -- some people (including me) felt lost at times.",
    "This course provided a great exposition of some difficult texts and led me to write some thorough analyses of them. The discussions worked best when the professor would lecture about the texts, as their complexity meant that broader discussions would often get off track into debates of tangential nature that were less rewarding."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely, if you're interested in analytic philosophy. Otherwise, it could be a tough introduction to the field, with most of the course focusing on Frege's work. \r\nBut if you are interested in analytic philosophy, it's a must-take course, since it gives you a really solid grounding in the history and original purpose of the discipline. Many of the questions asked by Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein still motivate inquiry today.",
    "If you're very interested in the subject matter this could be a good course, but it's a bit heavy in readings and I personally get more out of the seminars that involve deeply reading a small amount of material and understanding it well.",
    "Definitely take this course if you want to be challenged to think in new ways.  It's worth spending time to let the material really sink in.  Most of the course stays in the less technical areas of Analytic philosophy, but you'll get more out of the class if you feel comfortable with formal logic and quantitative reasoning.",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend this course. Professor Franks is always fantastic, but I personally found the course material intellectually frustrating (but this says more about my relationship with Wittgenstein than it does about the course). A foundational understanding of Frege, Russell and Wittgenstein (which the course covers) is definitely a good thing to cover as a philosophy major, but I'm not sure I'd take this class unless you're really interested in spending a lot of time with Wittgenstein (and then I'm not sure if this is a better course to take than the seminar just on Wittgenstein).",
    "Depends. Professor Franks is incredibly smart, clear, and kind. (I still think Kant's Critique of Pure Reason with him was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale.) And the material is interesting, and probably crucial for anyone looking to study analytic philosophy. Franks also has an eccentric, but to be honest probably correct, reading of the Tractatus, and I thought exposure to that was great. That being said, Professor Franks can't really run a seminar. GREAT guy--does not really lead discussion very well. The way the class would typically go: we'd come in, he'd have a handout of varying length depending on the week with an outline of all of the important concepts from the reading, he'd go through it, answering questions as he went (which he did very well). Then he'd get to the end, turn to us, and say something along the lines of, \"okay, so what do you want to discuss?\" And that could get pretty painful. I obviously preferred the days when the handout was longer. In short, I think there could have been much more intentionality around pedagogy. DEFINITELY take Kant with him, though -- it's a lecture, so we didn't have that problem, and he's such an amazing man.",
    "If you have some burning questions about the origins of logical notation and\/or it's relation to the ethical and metaphysical, this class is for you.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in the history of philosophy and learning how to question what are taken to be fundamental historical presuppositions in the \"mythology\" of a movement. This course was less rewarding on the philosophy itself, as the topics were rather erudite for me (ontology of numbers, possibility of relations, philosophy of denotation), but the course was at its best when it was forcing me to ask the question of why these seemingly minor questions held such great historical importance."
