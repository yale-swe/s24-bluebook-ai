                "The assignments for this course do a fairly good job of teaching the important material. The lectures provided background, but the majority of skills that I will be taking from the course came from the PSETs.",
                "This course is pretty good. The content is important and the execution is decent. The lectures are fine but sometimes the lecture related to a certain topic required for the homework fell too late relative to the due date of the homework, which was frustrating. The homework assignments were an appropriate length and difficulty, but on some of them I wish the tasks had been less along the lines of \"experiment with this thing and see what happens\" repeated several times. I don't think the final project was very meaningful, and would have rather just had an additional homework assignment.",
                "strengths: Professor Sherman!!! loved how much he cared about his students \r\nweaknesses: lectures could be a little dry and psets were extremely challenging",
                "Lectures were organized and clear, some of the problem sets were vary challenging",
                "Strengths: Very well taught, engaging projects, great professor. \r\nWeaknesses: Assignments are often ahead of content on lecture.",
                "Strengths: clear lectures\r\nWeaknesses: content gets a bit dry over time, probably would be better if it introduces more diversity of applications",
                "Dr Sherman is really nice. The topic / scientific focus might sound kind of narrow but I learned lots of broadly applicable things.",
                "There was a lot of flexibility in the course, given that there were only 4 problems sets and a final project. Professor Sherman was great and also cared about his students' learning. Problem sets were more so investigations/reports of trying to solve a problem rather than submitting specific solutions to a problem, which was different. A weakness is that there could have been a bit more guidance on writing these reports at the beginning of the class, but there was guidance towards the end (and graders were very flexible, since the reports are open-ended, so this wasn't a big issue!). Also, Professor Sherman included specific details about OpenMP and MPI etc. and walked through explicitly how to use their API functions which we needed for the problem set, and this was extremely useful, and also not something you see often in CS classes.",
                "Strengths:\r\n\r\n- The recorded lecture format really worked wonders for this class in letting me speed up through certain sections and replay other sections. I hope this is kept for the future.\r\n- The Ed discussion panel is so helpful, and Professor Sherman is genuinely nice.\r\n- The psets and final projects take a lot of time, but I liked that they weren't finals, as that took a ton fo stress off of us students.\r\n- Professor is really accommodating and gives us everything we need to succeed, like Makefiles for psets \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\n- The lectures are rather dry, but they are focused and to the point. \r\n- Many of the psets were due before we even covered the same content in lecture, requiring students to read ahead to get psets in on time\r\n- I wish there were more office hours times, since it would often take anywhere between 1-4 days to get a response for Ed during crunch time before psets.",
                "The assignments are well designed and enable you to gain practice writing parallel programs using different technologies. Lectures were occasionally a bit dry, but informative. I would have liked to spend a bit less time during lectures on the various functions of OpenMP/MPI, and more time on some canonical/famous parallel algorithms."

                "only take this class if youre willing to put in the work on the psets! they take a really long time",
                "Yes, good CS elective",
                "Yes! Prof Sherman is an absolute gem",
                "Absolutely take this class. A real must take within the CS department. The assignments are well organized and you will learn a ton.",
                "Sure because parallel programming is useful in industry. However, this is just an introduction and youll need to put in more work to learn the material on your own",
                "Yes, Dr Sherman is great, and the topic is cool. I didn't really have a direct scientific computing interest (if you do it will be even more interesting), but I liked learning how to make (some) slow programs fast(er) and reason in a parallel mindset. I also thought programming GPUs was really cool because I've never done that before, and it was shockingly easily. The assignments aren't too much work, just make sure to leave enough time for the reports. I would recommend finishing and having all your results with at least a full day to write the report.",
                "Yes I would recommend it. It's not the most fun, but it's cool to solve simple problems first in serial and then parallelize the code and see a speed-up. That's basically all we did for all 4 problem sets, solving different problems using different parallel techniques and analyzing performance boosts. It was very good experience, and there's a lot of flexibility in the course (there were no exams, lectures were recorded), but beware the content is pretty dry.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. If you're interested at all in parallel programming or just need a good CS elective, this class is great. While the psets get incrementally harder, and some psets are straight painful and involve a lot of debugging (like Assignment 3), you learn the content really well as a result (like in 323). Overall, though this class was less tough than 323, and imo, taught better as well. Your entire grade comes from psets and the final project (which you can choose your own topic for!), which means it's a lot less stressful in terms of avoiding exam taking. At the same time, though, the psets do take anywhere between 10-20 hours, but they're spaced out much more compared to 323 so the workload isn't as insane. Although, a large portion of that time is in the form of data collection rather than straight data collection. Finally, Professor Sherman is a genuinely nice professor who cares about his student's learning.",
                "Take it if you are looking for a very practical course with lots of C programming. Whether you will use any of the stuff you learn depends on what subfield of CS you enter in the future, but you generally learn a lot about harnessing multiple processors to speed up what could otherwise be intractable problems."
