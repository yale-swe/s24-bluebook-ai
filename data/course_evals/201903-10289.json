    "Newfound appreciate for African American literature and autobiography.",
    "I rekindled my love for reading! These texts are so rich and beautiful and difficult--it was absolutely a privilege to sit down with a great book every week. Then, no matter whether I was truly struggling to understand what the author was saying or whether I felt good about my interpretation, I knew I would get something deeper out of it in class. I learned to speak up even when I wasn't sure--sometimes forcibly--and I learned to listen to my peers. Dean Mahurin led a killer discussion (more on that below), and from it I learned how hard one needs to work to truly engage with this tradition.",
    "I learned so much in this course. I learned a lot about autobiography and life writing in general and developed better participation and critical thinking skills.",
    "I keep getting reminded in Dean Mahurin's class just how much I love books. Also if you're tired of reading hundred-year old books by old, problematic white men then you're in for a treat in this class.",
    "Do yourself a favor and take this class, at least just for the books you read. Such a great selection, so historically important, will change how you think about life writing.",
    "Reading and evaluating autobiographical works by African American authors.",
    "I learned how to take my emotions and feelings about the books and turn them into a short essay as well as a long essay. I learned how to discuss difficult materials and look for the literary elements of real life stories. I really valued the diversity of voices in my class and the attention to detail."

   "comments": [
    "It's a really well-organized course. About 1 book a week, student presentations, two papers. No complaints.",
    "I can't think of any weaknesses. Dean Mahurin is fantastic, the syllabus is fantastic, even the assignments made me feel proud of the work I was doing. This course is hard, but it really rewards you for putting in the time.",
    "I think that this course does a great job in giving students a breath of types of autobiographies to read and examine. I also think that the class was very well organized in terms of the different themes\/section of the class. The only thing that I would want would be to be able to spend more time on some of the books since there is so much to unpack on each text. That being said, I don't think that I would want the class to drop books from the syllabus because each brought such a unique perspective and it was great to read so many different books.",
    "The fact that there's a final and a final paper is a mess. An entire mess. \r\n\r\nBut the class is amazing, you gain so much confidence and the syllabus is always fire.",
    "There are too many strengths of this class that I elaborate in other parts, but the one thing I wasn't a fan of were the first few books that we read (such as Douglas and DuBois). I understand that they are important to lay the chronological foundation of the other texts that we discuss and how black narratives are formulated, but I think we need to further interrogate these discussions through the context of the class or if not, remove them from the syllabus altogether and replace them with something else. I also think it may be helpful to use authors like Danticat or other authors with immigrant experience to discuss how differently blackness is figured in different places, especially somewhere like most of Latin America \/ Haiti.",
    "strengths: great syllabus, professor leads the class well, lots of opportunities to show your engagement\r\nweaknesses: i feel like the success of the course is very dependent on the makeup of the room but i'm lucky to have had a great class",
    "The syllabus for this class is amazing, and the discussions are always really thoughtful and interesting. The course does require that you read a book a week so its important that youre actually prepared for class.",
    "Strengths are the richness of the texts--- they are all great books. Another strength is also the consistency of the reading load according to the syllabus because it makes it easier to plan ahead for the readings. \r\nA weakness of the course is the difficulty of some books-- whether emotional or literary-- and how the one book a week does not account for this. Professor Mahurin made the point to tell us to start earlier on some books, but it can be difficult to gauge which books will be difficult for who."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. This is a great course, taught by a very personable and caring professor.",
    "Absolutely, but only if you're ready to commit to it. You will not get through this course if you try to scrape by--skim the readings, be timid in class, resist engaging with how these texts apply to your life and your world--because there is no faking it. This course is the real deal, and it is so worth it.",
    "100% yes. The books on the syllabus are all amazing and I probably would not have read the majority of them ever if it had not been for this class. At the same time, the general level of engagement of the class led to really amazing class discussions and everyone was excited to come to class each day. Professor Mahurin did a wonderful job of making us think deeply about the texts and leading great discussions.",
    "Absolutely. The class is rigorous and refreshing because of it. Honestly it's fulfilling.",
    "Do not take this class lightly. You read an entire book each week. The essays are graded extremely harshly. I would recommend taking the class Credit-D so you can experience it though. The literature was amazing and Dean Mahurin is so well-read in black life writing that each class is full of amazing discussion. I am so happy I took this class.",
    "It's such an incredible class. I personally wasn't as big a fan of the first few texts on the syllabus, but the last like seven or eight books you read are so incredible and if for no other reason than Dean, I would take the class. You'll grow so much as a student and person.",
    "Take this class! There are few people more enjoyable to talk about books with than Dean Mahurin. And read every single book! Every page!!",
    "absolutely! but only to a student that has the time in a semester to fully dedicate themselves to the class because you really need to read every book and participate in some way during seminars",
    "Yes- anyone interested in literature or memoir should really take this class. If youre willing to do the reading its truly worth it.",
    "YES! Dean Mahurin is a GREAT professor and all the books are amazing. You have really honest and in depth conversations in class."
