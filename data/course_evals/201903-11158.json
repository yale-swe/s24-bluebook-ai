    "I learned Italian.",
    "I was able to learn how to study for myself and how to ask for help. It was hard learning a new language, but I learned that everyone struggles and I am not the first nor the last one to struggle. Practice makes perfect and help is not a bad thing.",
    "This course was so fun and taught me the basics of both the italian language and italian culture.",
    "An understanding of the basics of Italian vocabulary, grammar and culture, taught at rigorous but not overwhelming pace. It was very fulfiling to start with little to no understanding of the language and see practical skills develop significantly over as little as three months.",
    "A basic understanding of the Italian language.",
    "I gained a solid understanding of the basics of the Italian language."

   "comments": [
    "I learned a basis for Italian.",
    "Strengths: Enjoyable and not too difficult of a language. You learn a lot over the course of the semester.\r\nWeaknesses: Moves very quickly. Easy to fall behind. Heavy workload.",
    "I disliked the workbooks that did not really add anything to my understanding. I wish sometimes the exercises were a bit more useful rather than just straight exercises that did not make sense. I did like the textbook and the tutoring program that really helped with my comprehension. The mandatory tables were okay, but it did not reinforce as much Italian as one would expect.",
    "I think one of the strengths of this course was the amount of assignments and how we had both the temas and the assessments. I think that the online exercises didn't really add anything to the course and were unnecessary.",
    "The atmosphere of the class was largely kept fun and not too stressful, which was important for a class where daily attendance was necessary. It could possibly be improved by more resources for studying for tests being made available.",
    "Professor Crognale was extremely effective in conveying concepts to the class and always simplified rules to make them easy to tackle."

   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn Italian, this class teaches Italian. So.",
    "If you are looking for a language credit that is not too difficult but still worthwhile, Italian is the way to go.",
    "It would not be my first choice. This class was hard for me and some of the quizzes where I was getting basic things wrong and right away learning new things was very hard for me. It was hard to learn something new everyday and not really review what was happening before.",
    "Definitely! Loved this course and thought is was so fun and informative.",
    "Definitely. Megan was a fantastic professor, and kept a class that could very possibly begin to feel like a chore (as it meets every day, and most people are taking it to fulfil distributional requirements) fun and engaging.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was both challenging and fun, and was a very good start for someone who has never taken a foreign language class before.",
    "Yes I definitely would reccomend."
