                "Strenghts: the lectures are extremely helpful, the professors genuinely care and will go out of their way to help their students. The texbook is great \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had more discussions instead of language drills, but the profs were responsive to what the students wanted.",
                "The course has a pretty well-defined structure that would be difficult to change, and you do learn a lot. However, I found the textbook to be quite poor; often the pages are unmarked, the distinction between simplified and traditional characters is misleading, and apparently, the information on a lot of topics would be quite incorrect  at least this is what my tutorial instructor said. I also think a lot of the time the audio recordings of the lessons didn't line up with the actual text for each lesson. I think it would be better to have one fewer lesson in this course and be able to spend more time using and learning the grammar, sentence patterns, and how to actually use some of the vocabularies in conversation  there was little to no time for this.\r\n\r\nI think there could be a lot more opportunities for constructive feedback. None of my paper feedback gave any actual formative ways to improve on my grade.",
                "One strength of this course was the immense amount of vocabulary, structures, and information about Chinese society that we learned in one semester. All of the stories in the textbook were very interesting and engaging, which made learning the vocabulary easier. Our homework assignments also facilitated a lot of review which made studying for large exams and writing essays more manageable. One weakness of this course was that sometimes deadlines online were different than what was discussed in class and it was hard to tell exactly when things were due. Another weakness is that while characters weren't assigned for homework, we were expected to know them for the exams. Constant character practice was hard to manage with the homework we already had, which meant that most of the character memorizing had to be done very close to the exams.",
                "The course material and the instructors are excellent. However, the pace of the class is a little fast. I would have appreciated more time to feel confident in what I learned before moving onto the next lesson which builds upon the last one. The course seemed to be designed to meet 5 times a week instead of 3. We never had enough time to go over everything we were supposed to and many students (myself included) often felt behind.",
                "Strengths: You learn everything you need to\r\nWeaknesses: Repetitive and some grammar structures could have been explained better",
