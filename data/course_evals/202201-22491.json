We covered Griffiths' chapter 1 to 11 (basically one per week) so it is a broad range of topics, up till and including radiation. I gained greater confidence working on electrodynamics, and had an introduction to advanced problem solving techniques (Legendre polynomials and gauge transformation).",

                "This course provides an excellent foundation for upper level electricity and magnetism. A must-take for all physics majors, would highly recommend especially if you took 201 or 261. It builds very well upon an introductory understanding of electric fields and potential, magnetic fields\/forces and induction, and then provides a comprehensive understanding of the magnetic vector potential, the potential formulation, multipole expansion, EM waves, and gives a fun introduction to far field radiation.",
                "We covered every chapter of Griffiths introduction to electrodynamics.",
                "I learned a crazy lot about the mathematical formalism underlying E&M. I totally appreciate the depth and breadth of concepts covered in the course: from polarization to the Drude model, from EM momentum to dipole radiationthese were all realms of E&M I had never encountered before. I also highly improved my ability to sit through problems that covered concepts I thought I grasped well, until I hit a stonewall so frustrating. If you resolve yourself to not look at the problem solutions (its our academic and moral obligation), then your best medium of learning is the homework and Griffiths problems.",

I learned how to use Maxwell's equations to derive the existence of electromagnetic waves and find radiation pressure. I learned how to apply Faraday's and Lenz' laws to calculate electromotive force induced by a field changing in time. I learned how to construct and work with the magnetic vector potential. This course also talked about the propagation of waves and behavior of fields in linearly polarized media."

            "comments": [
                "This class would be improved if we had a chance to work on problem sets being covered in lecture while we are having lecture. This class was an endless cycle of being constantly one week ahead in lecture the material in the psets, so when I did the psets the lecture was not helpful.",
                "Strengths: Excellent textbook, clear and well-prepared-for lectures, plenty of office hours, challenging but not tedious problem sets, fair exams.\r\nWeakness 1: There were zerp demos during lecture. A physics class, especially one covering electrodynamics, should always have demos, which help with the problem-solving intuition immensely. This isn't unique to this class, however, but Yale Physics as a whole - the departmental attitude seems to be that demos are reserved for Physics Lab, and lecture should purely be about derivations. I disagree with this apparent mentality.\r\nWeakness 2: Griffiths himself writes in his textbook that a one-semester course has its hands full with the first seven chapters of the textbook; we try to cover all of it, and made it through chapter 10 and into 11. This meant a more rushed treatment of chapters 4 and 6, and not enough time to get used to the sudden ramp-up in algebra starting with chapter 9.",
                "Everything about the class was great. \r\n\r\nThe only small thing for me personally was that I couldn't attend class, so I ended up watching the lectures online. I'm not sure if the camera is human-operated or not, but it is not very good at tracking the board, constantly zooming and panning all over the place.",
                "A strength was the fact that we followed Griffiths and that the psets were of a reasonable length and level of difficulty. Exams were fair. I would just ask for lectures that are not exactly what Griffiths says in order to be able to stay tuned. I would have also liked to know the final curve for the class before grades were released.",
                "Clear, structured lectures and regular pset schedule. The instructor questions for the psets were also very intriguing and fun. \r\nWeakness (?) - this is a fast-paced class! We cover in one semester what is normally done in two in other schools (basically the whole of Griffiths minus relativity) Maybe a revision \/ review session might have helped.",
                "I don't really find E&M that interesting, especially since the lectures just followed Griffiths. I did appreciate how Prof. da Silva Neto would reference interesting applications of the concepts we covered in class.",
                "More office hours would be much more helpful",
                "The course is very strong, textbook is good, and Prof Higino da Silva Neto is extremely helpful. Sometimes the content is quite dry and it is hard to pay attention but I don't think this is a result of any shortcomings of the course itself.",
                "Strengths: Prof da Silva Neto's teaching has been impeccable, and he is great at explaining concepts from the book. The problem sets are well-curated, and focus on highlighting concepts from class. Although the exams were challenging (although not overly), the curve was very generous. Weaknesses: nothing to complain about; it would be nice to see more problems done in class rather than derivations that can be reviewed in the textbook, just so that our problem-solving ability has a chance to grow.",
                "This course was very strong overall. The lectures were clear and concise, covering a lot of material in a relatively short time. The PSETs were fair, if difficult, and always expanded on material we had gone over in lecture. The biggest weakness of the course was a relatively low amount of office hours. I think one or two more sessions per week would have been nice to have.",
                "I don't have many suggestions for this course, I thought it was very well organized. The textbook (Griffiths EM) is excellent and the psets are manageable but challenging.",
                "This class is a very broad overview of the subject, but sometimes lacked specificity. Topics like those covered at the end of the semester, like electromagnetic waves and radiation, could benefit from more instruction.",
                "I think this was a good course and I learned a lot of intermediate E&M. The course pretty much exactly followed the Griffiths textbook (which is not necessarily a bad thing - it is a great textbook). Problem sets were a fair length\/time commitment and exams were somewhat difficult but curved. No real complaints about this course.",
                "Great lectures, content is interesting, but there is a lot of it so it can be hard to keep up.",
                "Strengths: the content was broad and deep, the mathematical and physical maturity we acquired was fantastic, the professor was well prepared and organized, Griffiths problems are great, the textbook is fantastic. Weakness: lectures are almost exactly identical to the book so about a third of class did not come to class (not unjustifiably), the problems are often directly taken from Griffiths so almost everyone consults online solutions which is not only unfair to the class and professor but detrimental to student learning, class is curved too too generously such that an A does not become that precious (is this a weakness?)",
                "This was a strong course. It was a lecture-style course, with textbook readings, lectures, problem sets, and exams. The textbook, Griffiths Introduction to Electricity and Magnetism, was very easy to read and informative. The problem sets in this class were fairly easy and required a low time-commitment, but did not compromise on the material they covered. There is no obvious way to improve this course, I really enjoyed it.",
                "This course is a lot of information packed into a semester and I feel like it does a good job accomplishing this. That being said, the lectures aren't the most engaging and I wish there were possibly more in class demonstrations, questions posed during lecture, and\/or published lectures notes to raise engagement with material during and post-lecture."

It's a challenging course, but the textbook is excellent, so you could pair it with another challenging course. Taking two or more challenging courses on top of this one in a given semester is something I would advise against.",
                "This is really the only course to learn E&M, and it covers things quite well with a great textbook (Griffiths). It is a little fast-paced so it might help to do some reading outside of class (especially examples).",

                "Personally, I'm not that into E&M, but if you enjoy physics, it's a beautiful, concise theory and the textbook is quite good.",

                "If you've taken PHYS 261 you'll be familiar with approximately half of the course material, but the other half is very interesting.",
                "Yes, absolutely!! If you are a physics major, intensive or regular track, please do yourself a favor and take this course. If you are not a physics major but you have taken some intro university physics and have a strong math background, I think this course still could be rewarding.",
                "Yes. It is a good introduction to the principles of electricity and magnetism.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more E&M. They go over topics that were not looked at in intro-level physics that are interesting and cool to learn about.",
                "Yes, best physics course I have taken at Yale!",
                "10\/10. I loved it. If you want to be mature in your physics training, definitely take this class! Youll be more than well prepared for grad school!",
                "yes! EM is a very interesting and foundational subject",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The time commitment for the assignments was low and the material was highly applicable to areas of physics and engineering. There were plenty of opportunities to attend office hours. The professor was accessible. I would caution that the exams were challenging, which for me were a strength of the instruction, but might be alarming to someone who has not taken a lot of physics exams.",
                "This course is required for the intensive Physics major and so I would definitely recommend for them, but this course is very rigorous\/intense and so I'm not sure if I would recommend to anyone else. You go through pretty much all of Griffith's 4e textbook Introduction to Electromagnetism which is a lot of material for one semester. Only take this course if you can commit to staying up to date on the readings and really staying up to date on the class material. Once you fall behind, it can be very overwhelming."
