A lot of assignments focused on giving and receiving feedback, which was useful for reflection and improvement. Thus, I learned a lot about the writing process from taking this course. One thing that could be improved might be the expanded availability of office hours not only during the more intense parts of the semester (i.e. around paper deadlines) but within the entire semester so that the student-instructor bond could be strengthened."

The free-topic final essay made the class much more interesting than other ENGL 114 or seminar classes (where you're usually stuck with one topic for an entire semester)!",

This course has informed a lot of my knowledge that will manifest in future writing-intense courses, and I have a great impression of Yale's writing course offerings after taking this course. \r\nI also made friends in this course, since there is a lot of productive collaboration, which is always great!"
