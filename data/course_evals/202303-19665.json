                "Solid knowledge of basic characters and better spoken fluency",
                "I furthered my own skills in the facets of language ranging from speaking to writing in Modern Mandarin. I also learned a lot of new vocabulary and honed my fluency.",
                "I improved my reading and writing skills in Chinese, improved my reading skills of traditional hanzi, and learned a lot more vocabulary and some grammar.",
                "As a result of going over the same texts many multiple a week, I primarily learned many new characters, sentence structures, and customs practiced in China. Skill-wise, my reading speed improved significantly (both in simplified and traditional characters) and I responded to questions with more grammatically complex sentences. Thanks to a combination of the culturally relevant texts we read and Su Laoshi's engaging stories, I gained a greater appreciation of Chinese culture, and I'm motivated to take Chinese beyond the minimum language requirements for a variety of personal and career reasons.",

            "comments": [
                "Lots of quizzes and a decent bit of homework really helped to learn a lot of the characters.",
                "The strength of this course is that the professor was very engaging and course was small enough that I understood everything without an issue. The weakness of this course was that sometimes the workload may be tedious.",
                "Strengths: Su Laoshi is engaging, kind, and a fascinating person (he's written multiple books and knows so much about Chinese literature and philosophy!).  The frequent quizzes meant I got a lot of practice reading and writing characters. Weaknesses: not a major weakness, but class structure was pretty much the same every day (quiz, if we had one, followed by Q and A grammar practice).",
                "The class was very engaging through Su  asking us questions in order to practice grammar points. I also enjoyed the numerous assignments such as the essays. I felt that more group assignments should been included, however.",
                "Strengths: I really like that there is a heritage class, and the instruction being entirely in Chinese is really helpful for listening comprehension. Frequent quizzes also made sure we kept up with vocabulary, and there was a lot of writing practice.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I did not like the textbook of this course. It's an old textbook, so some topics were outdated. Additionally, its explanation of grammar points were very poor and didn't really contribute well to my understanding. Textbook aside, I wish there was more speaking and conversation practice during class, like talking in small groups.",
                "Strengths: We spend a good amount of time of each text, meaning that by the end of the week, we know all the characters, phrases, sentence starters, and grammatical structures in and out. The class is also pretty light on homework, with around 30 minutes of out-of-class work a day..\r\n\r\nWeakness: The course is, for the most part, pretty monotonous. Each day, we'd start with a quiz if there was one, read the text aloud a couple of times, and our instructor would just call on students to use sentence structures. I didn't feel particularly engaged, since we didn't do anything novel or exciting most days.\r\n\r\nI would've like more frequent small group activities during class, e.g. debating an issue mentioned in the text or giving impromptu speeches, instead of sitting around in silence for most of the class and waiting for my name to be called.",
                "I think Su laoshi has a lot to offer. He talks a lot about his own stories and idioms he wants to share, which can make class really interesting. However, learning the fundamentals sometimes falls to the wayside because of this, especially when his stories are sometimes far too advanced for L3 students. At the end of the day, if students really want to learn Chinese as best as possible, they have to be willing to do more than the course and professor expects of them."

                "Yes, it was pretty good at helping me improve my Chinese, especially as I forgot a lot of it from childhood, and I can actually read and write a decent amount again.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who place into CHNS 132 or need to satisfy the language requirement because the content is not overly challenging and still a great course to improve Chinese.",
                "Yes! Especially if you are a heritage speaker who comes in with limited knowledge of characters---don't be intimidated! The class will seem like a lot too learn at first but becomes easier once you find a study routine that works for you.",
                "Yes, this class will prepare you for higher level Chinese classes. It also provides a solid foundation for any heritage student starting Chinese.",
                "Yes. It really does help improve your Chinese. Just being in the Chinese-speaking environment of the classroom helps a lot with naturally improving your listening and reading skills.",
                "I would take this course more for the strengths of the individual instructor than the course itself. For most people, you're taking this course to knock out your language requirement or to reach specialized, higher-level courses (e.g. Current Affairs or Films and Stories). If you don't fall in one of the above categories, I don't see any practical reason to take this course for personal enjoyment.",
                "the heritage chinese track is pretty unique. i think L3 is definitely a gut for most, so if that's what you're looking for definitely take it. If you're really interested in language and happen to only be L3 heritage, I would perhaps consider self studying to take L5 in the spring. But you'll definitely still gain a lot from taking the course!"
