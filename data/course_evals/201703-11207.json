   "comments": [
    "I obviously learned a lot doing an independent research project from planning the project to figuring out the methods etc. to really appreciating all that goes into scientific literature and learning how scientific research operates. I recommend it, it can be frustrating but is a great opportunity and a real learning experience.",
    "I have learned how to code, more about atmospheric boundary layer meteorology, and how to work in a research setting with colleagues.",
    "I enjoyed working on my senior thesis very much this semester; it was definitely my favorite \"class\". Working on it has been a very valuable experience in thinking for myself, problem solving, and thinking creatively. I'm also learning great skills such as literature review, coding, and writing and presenting that are preparing me well for graduate school. It's been great to be able to work on a project so in-depth like I never have before, and I look forward to continuing my work next semester!"

   "comments": [
    "I think the structure of the course is perfect in terms of the departmental requirements, but will depend on your project.",
    "I'm really enjoying my senior thesis so far. Professor Lee is the best--he always answers my confused questions and keeps up with my jumble of ideas during our weekly meetings. His patience and guidance have made me feel comfortable and excited about my topic. I also have loved going to lab meeting each week and learning about what all the other students in the lab are working on. The topics are all so interesting, and I feel I've gained a lot of insight into the field.",
    "This course is largely what I put into it, so the strengths and weaknesses are largely just a critique of myself. For example, I think I've done a good job learning how to do more complicated procedures in the NCL language. However, I think I would do well to read more papers and reach out to more people for input. I don't have any criticisms of the senior thesis course itself, however."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Do 1 year research instead of the senior essay it's worth getting really into a project. Start early!",
    "Love it so far! If you're in the major, do a fun thesis and get to work with a great professor. It's a wonderful way to do some independent, self-guided learning and work in a research setting.",
    "Students in the major obviously have to take it, so it's hard to \"recommend\" it per se, but I would recommend this course over the 1-semester, \"senior essay\", especially if you plan on going on to graduate school. The experience of doing research is very helpful and I wouldn't want to jump head-first into grad school without having done a big project like this!"
