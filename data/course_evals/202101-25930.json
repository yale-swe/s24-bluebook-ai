I would have preferred meeting twice a week for less time each day than once a week. The strengths, I would say, was the contact and Prof. Syrimis.",

                "This course was excellent. Professor Syrimis is wonderful and made all of the seminars really engaging.",
                "Strengths: one of the only sports history courses at Yale; Professor Syrimis is very engaged and interested in the topics; study of change over time; provides a historical foundation for understanding current events and how we see the Olympics and what they mean to us and to athletes today.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, class felt a bit disorganized and we would go off on tangents or get off topic easily, class could dissolve into just the professor talking to the athletes and not engaging everyone. I think having a clear agenda at the start would help to stay on topic or address overarching themes at the beginning so we can follow along."

Even if you're not an athlete, this is also a really interesting course to understand the predominant role sports plays in our culture today and since ancient times."
