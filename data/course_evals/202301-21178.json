                "I learned so much about how culture creates the ways we see and interact with the world. I learned to critique and notice aspects of everyday life and connect them to bigger ideas. I learned about the history of anthropology, anthropological theory, and read a lot of ethnographies. \r\nThis class also showed me how academic/theoretical ideas can be applied to the real world.",
                "I learned about different concepts of sociocultural anthropology and gained a deeper understanding of human behavior. I also learned how to practice anthropology in my life as a student which helped me appreciate my surroundings.",
                "This course taught me how to perceive my surroundings through an anthropological lens - to always ask questions and seek to understand why certain groups, environments, etc. are the way that they are. I learned to inquire like an anthropologist, and I feel like I am coming away from this course with a toolkit of ethnographic techniques that I can apply to other contexts.",
                "I developed an understanding of basically cultural anthropology concepts and their application in everyday social settings.",
                "In this course, I learned about many famous anthropologists, both present and prior, as well as different methods of extracting information from the world and the proper ways to do so. We also covered a wide range of topics from structural violence to cultural relativism.",

                "The most valuable insight as an anthropology major is the review of the intellectual genealogy of anthropology. I enjoyed the discussion as much as Prof. Harms enjoyed it. It was important to know of the history of the discipline and its criticism. In doing so, I believe this course has prepared me for future courses in anthropology. It also provided a background on different ways to think about culture that I have not encountered before. If anthropology is a type of thinking, then this course has taught the critical ways of rethinking culture from an anthropological perspective well. I feel more confident in my choice of anthropology as a major. \r\n\r\nThe course assignments emphasized my writing skills. The ethnography assignments and the feedback I received made me more aware of the process of writing: how do we tell a story through ethnography and analyze it theoretically. In this sense, the course ensures my awareness of the discipline of anthropology in comparison with other writings.",

The most important thing I learned -- a theme that recurred throughout the course -- was what it means to have an anthropological worldview, whether you're explicitly doing anthropology or not."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: I loved how Professor Harms used music, movies, and relevant examples to explain the concepts. The sections were also very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I would come out of class and not be sure what I learned and how it related to Anthropology. We would spend so long talking about something and I either wouldn't understand it or couldn't relate it to anything else in the course. I don't know if I actually gained a strong basis in socio-cultural anthropology or just spent a semester listening to whatever Professor Harms wanted to teach us. Additionally, while the assignments were interesting and I like the idea of exploring the culture of Yale, the instructions were so dense with words that they were hard to understand, and yet they said very little about what we were supposed to do. Sometimes it felt like my TA and I were trying to decipher what he had asked us to do, and it often had little relevancy to the course material, or asked us to use skills that we hadn't developed in class. Additionally, the midterm and final had a weird matching section that felt like rote memorization, not productive to deepening our understanding of the complex themes and ideas of anthropology.",
                "Strengths: My TF was incredible and helped us to understand the core concepts and why we were reading certain texts. Professor Harms is a great lecturer who tries to engage with students and is extremely enthusiastic about anthropology. \r\nWeaknesses: 9am on MW is a brutal time slot. Lectures sometimes felt disjointed in relation to readings. While this isn't necessarily a fault of the class, lots of sociocultural anthropology still feels very rooted in its colonial origins and even modern pieces of ethnography still have roots of this legacy.",
                "Strengths: Eric Harms is such a great professor and makes the class really fun. The topics are also very interesting, particularly in the first half of the course. But the biggest strength to me was actually the ethnographic assignments. It lets you try out anthropology for yourself, and I learned a lot of interesting things about the discipline and about Yale itself doing them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, the lectures and readings feel a bit all over the place. I think the course could be streamlined somewhat, perhaps by cutting the documentaries and making each topic a little narrower. It's great to get exposure to so many different ideas and anthropologists, but sometimes it felt like I wasn't learning as much as I could have if we delved in a little deeper. I feel like the first half of the course did a better job staying on topic than the second half. Also, I didn't find the final paper particularly helpful. It would have been fun to do our own project on a new idea, but it didn't add very much to my learning to go over old assignments.",
                "Sometimes it was difficult to understand which topics were important to remember, and how the readings directly tied to the themes we discussed in class. However, everything we did discuss was fascinating.",
                "strenghts: The flow of the course through the semester was great. lectures can be very engaging.",
                "This is a great class. Strengths: the readings are manageable and actually interesting!! The lectures are engaging and variable (videos, songs, texts, discussion) and the professor is super passionate and takes an straightforward approach to teaching, showing all sides of each debate/issue.\r\nWeaknesses: you have to do ethnographic observations of fellow Yale students which is dumb and annoying. I didn't learn much from these. Luckily they don't take much time to complete.",
                "The strengths were the lectures. Professor Harms was incredibly passionate about the subject matter and relayed it in an engaging manner. I think however, that the lectures could have been reduced to 50 minutes because they often felt slightly long. The readings were a strengthnot too overwhelming and they all contributed to a better understanding of the course material. Another weakness I would point out is the exams. I wish there had been study guides for concepts, because I often felt like I studied the wrong things and was tested on authors and concepts that were briefly mentioned and not thoroughly covered.",
                "The lecture style was incredibly structured, and I really loved how enthusiastic Professor Harms is about the material. I also found the amount of reading each week and the general workload to be very manageable.",
                "This strength is very accessible to anyone in that everyone has the skills to engage with and learn about cultural anthropology. The content learned is also very applicable to everyday life. One weakness of the course is that some of the key terms and ideas of the course have loose definitions, which may make it challenging to understand them.",
                "The lectures are a nice amount of time, and the material is interesting. The professor is a proficient public speaker and always comes prepared. I wish we could have spent more time reviewing for the exams or have had a study guide to go off of though.",
                "Good professor, engaging lecturer. Good slides, interesting material, good job at covering a wide range of anthropological examples from throughout the world and over time. Good attention to the racist, problematic nature of the field of anthropology historically (and now), and how anthropologists and others should learn from this history and engage in better practicescould be delved into even more. Fun, interesting writing exercises. A little name/place memorization heavy for my taste, but understandable for the type of course. An excellent intro anthropology lecture.",
                "I think a great strength of this course is the lectures. The lectures were engaging and helpful, and connected to the reading just enough so that we see how it thematically fits into our weekly discussion, but not too much so that more time can be spent expanding the discussion. The best part of the course was the discussion section.",
                "The course is very well organized, and the readings are very connected to what we learn in class. The assignments are magnificent and help us get involved with what we learn through our own observations of Yale Culture. However, sometimes we had too much reading assigned.",
                "Strengths: The amount of content covered is just right, and the overall arc of the course (cultural difference, power and the \"dark turn\", resistance and possibility) is built well to make the course engaging and transformative -- a bit of a ritual analogue in its own right. The readings are all incredibly interesting in their own right. Prof. Harms has a deep conviction about the importance of anthropological thinking, and makes the case extremely effectively through this course."

                "I probably wouldn't, especially if they were really seeking a firm base upon which to build more complex understandings of cultural Anthropology theories. If you don't care about anthropology as a field, and instead want a course where you can learn some ways to think about culture, sure take it. But if you are hoping to learn the principal ideas of the field, this is not the right course.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in the origins of the subfield.",

                "I would recommend this as a course to any anthro major, as well as a \"fun\" social sciences credit to students looking for one. The course does not have any pre-reqs, the assignments were fun to do and engaging, and the methods we learned could be useful outside of the field of anthropology.",
                "Yes. Take this course if you'd like to do engaging assingments that make you think about different socio-cultural things about the Yale student body",
                "Take this class! It introduces you to the discipline but isn't too broad -- you still learn about specific cultures and learn about theories/critiques in depth. The class strikes a great balance of learning theory so you have an intellectual foundation, but not too much so it doesn't get boring. You read a lot of ethnographies and learn about all the different ways people can see the world! And you yourself will see things differently after this class.",
                "I would recommend this course if students are interested in human behavior and this side of anthropology.",
                "Absolutely! I think that learning to see the world through an anthropological lens can be incredibly helpful and useful in other disciplines as well. I feel like I am much more insightful about the spaces and environments that I occupy and visit.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students regardless of their major because it provides a very interesting lens through which we can analyze the social environments that we navigate in our everyday lives. The content of the course is very interesting but not too challenging, so it is a good course to learn applicable information in a low pressure environment.",
                "Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed this course. So much so, that I am considering taking another class in anthropology next semester.",
                "Yes, particularly to first years and sophomores. This is an excellent intro to anthropology and an engaging lecture for students of any major. For juniors and seniors in humanities majors some of the material is review and the course is not as challenging as one might want.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in anthropology. It is a good introductory course that shows the history of the discipline and how it evolved over the course of the last century to address new questions. I find this course to be useful for thinking about and being aware of culture while also seeing its application across other disciplines.",
                "Definitely, specially to students who want to get out of their comfort zone, because anthropology challenges many of the conventional views that many students hold regarding their careers, the economic system, the culture of the united states, and more.",
                "I would strongly, strongly recommend! For some reason, lots of Yale students tend to avoid intro lectures as if they're not interesting enough or unlikely to be taught well. That may be the case for some, but it's certainly not for this one. Prof. Harms is amazing, and the course is simultaneously a comprehensive-feeling introduction to its field, while also prompting and allowing a lot of space for deeper/critical thought that you might not assume you'd get in an intro class."
