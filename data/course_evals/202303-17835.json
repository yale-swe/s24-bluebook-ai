From the TAs, the professor, and the other students, I gained insights on the different rehearsal techniques and ways to improve the sound of a chamber group. Through commenting on other groups' performances, I learned how to properly critique others' playing while remaining polite.",

                "Overall a good course. Scheduling coachings and rehearsals is complicated especially with a large group. Nice to get to give and receive feedback in performance class. Great opportunity to get to perform entire chamber masterworks. It's too bad that so few people get to experience the class because it's so selective, but also if it was larger it would not be such a special experience.",
                "This course is great! It could be improved by ensuring that all groups could have time to play all their movements in class without going over the scheduled time of the class.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there does not currently seem to be much training for the teaching fellows for the course. On several occasions, members of the fellowship quartet spoke in unnecessarily harsh and critical ways without much positive constructive effect. This could certainly be mitigated with a more extensive required training for the coaches.",
                "Strengths: great opportunity for students to continue developing chamber music skills through weekly coachings and biweekly performance class",
                "The strengths of this course include lots of opportunities to perform and get feedback from peers, as well as excellent weekly instruction.",
                "Strengths: I loved it! Rehearsing with my chamber group was my favorite part of the week and I always looked forward to class to listen to the other groups as well. The talent in the class is outstanding and the coaches and professor are both amazing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Great structure of classes and enjoyed faculty coachings",
                "While the caliber of playing is very high, the course lacks diversity of composers. It seems that the same pieces are recycled, with no effort to include contemporary works or works by women or composers of color."

If you are a first year, don't bank on getting into this class; definitely audition, but plan to find people to play with on your own as well: there are so many people who love to make chamber music at this school!",

                "Yes, this class is awesome.",
                "Definitely audition for this course if you want to play chamber music, but it is very competitive. Additionally, the course is currently designed for strings (but not bass) and pianists. If you are a wind player, good luck."
