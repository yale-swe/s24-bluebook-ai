    "I learned how to write better and how to analyse primary sources.",
    "There is a ton of content in this course. It is super interesting stuff about the relations between Jews Christian and Muslims. I particularly like the emphasis on primary sources. This class also prepared me well for writing long form history papers.",
    "One of the greatest skills I developed by taking this course was analyzing primary source documents and developing historical research questions from that analysis.",
    "Strengthened historical analysis skills, learned how to more rigorously assess the reliability of historical evidence, theological and historical fundamentals of Jewish-Muslim-Christian relations in Medieval times.",
    "A strong foundation in the religious culture of Medieval Europe, focusing of course on Jews, Christians, Muslims, and their interactions with one another. Valuable experience analyzing premodern documents and images, and exploring the impact of religion on politics, culture, and lifestyle during the middle ages."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are easily the content. It is incredibly interesting. Professor Marcus relays the content so well and makes class generally interesting. The weaknesses are that there is not much else besides the readings and the final paper. There is no other engagement with the material and there is no incentive to do the reading because we are never quizzed on it. Also the class is definitely run more like a lecture than a seminar so it is a little awkward when the professor just talks at a group of 8 students for 2 hours.",
    "One of the greatest strengths and super cool things about this course was the course packet and the assigned readings in general! We were able to discuss  material I would have never been exposed to or really able to find on my own with a professor who is incredibly knowledgeable in the field. If I had to identify any weakness of the course, I would say it was the limited amount of time we had each week to discuss these readings and to give sufficient background for all of the readings. I think some time spent at the beginning of the semester course mapping some of the trends against a chronological and geographical look at the period could have been useful.",
    "The course covers a ton of really fascinating content, and Professor Marcus helps students tackle a lengthy and difficult research paper in a very manageable way.",
    "I loved that the seminar was so small, as it allowed close interaction with the professor and with my peers. The readings were very well selected, lots of primary sources to give you a more accurate sense of J-M-C relations. Professor Marcus is also very engaging and structures his seminars as a long interrogation of the sources he has assigned, always with a clear learning objective in mind. He also is very attentive and so makes himself available to his students via email or office hours.",
    "Background information provided by the instructor (both in assigned readings and during class) were very strong. I always felt well-prepared to discuss sources that had been assigned once each session introduction was over. Course material was well-organized according to coherent themes, with sufficient overlap to ensure thorough understanding of the most important concepts.\r\nUpon occasion, I felt that more class time could have been devoted to discussion by the students, and this might have been facilitated with reading responses or something of the kind."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in religious history and who wants to have experience with doing independent research and writing a long paper.",
    "I would if they have an interest in the subject material!",
    "This is a fascinating course for people who enjoy the topic. If you don't find the topic that interesting, you probably won't be that engaged. If you like learning about history or religious studies, however, then this course is definitely worth taking.",
    "Yes. This course was certainly a departure from the kind of coursework I have done in the past, and unless you have studied premodern history extensively, you are likely to gain valuable skills from it. The religions under consideration were put into interesting conversation with one another, and the instructor provided us with the tools to learn from difficult and often quite obscure sources."
