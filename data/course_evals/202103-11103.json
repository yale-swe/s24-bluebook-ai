It was definitely eye-opening to see the huge extent to which our sensitive information was being handed to third-parties and sold and passed around\r\n\r\nKnowledge - I learned about the economic, political, and social factors that contributed to privacy concerns. \r\n\r\nSkills - Presentation and essay writing, though because it is a CS class, I felt like the level of expectation of writing was lower than the average Yale course and didn't really learn much from it.",

Although I thought he was very nice and sweet, his lecturers definitely could be kind of dry and boring. Also most people were taking this for a gut cs class so a lot of the class wasn't engaged, which was a shame since it was a discussion seminar. \r\n\r\nHow it could be improved - bring in more guest speakers, more engagement from the class.",
