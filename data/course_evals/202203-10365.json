                "I learned about many different aspects of American politics in the 20th century. I was already familiar with a few of the topics, but most I had just a peripheral understanding of before this course, so what I learned was quite substantial. I now feel more comfortable talking about political parties and thoughts in the contemporary US and analyzing 20th century events within their political context.",
                "I learned much more about the development of modern liberalism and conservatism. There were a number of subjects that I thought I understood, but after doing the readings, came away with a whole new understanding (e.g., the rise of the new right). I also have a far better understanding of my town's local politics after learning more about the regional politics surrounding us. I liked the road-trip format of the class, where we learned how to dive into a particular place rather than covering politics at a national level.",
                "I developed a pretty thorough understanding of US politics and political trends since the 1930s, an area which I had previously assumed I knew quite a bit about. I could not have anticipated the incredible intellectual growth I would experience taking this class; Professor Gage curates a rigorous yet positive and open classroom environment, and it encouraged me to engage with the material more than I have in practically any other class.",
                "I learned about 20th century American political history and gained familiarity with archival research.",
                "An overview of 20th century US political history beginning with the New Deal. Some of my favorite topics included the New York fiscal crisis in the 1970s and the war on drugs.",
                "I learned about the evolution of liberalism and conservatism in the U.S. and a great deal about conducting archival research.",
                "Knowledge of the trajectory, conflicts, and surprising details of post-New Deal US politics; understanding of how American liberalism and conservatism developed into their current forms; greater ability to think historically, formulate historical arguments, and interact with historiography; and greater skill at reading a lot of reading very fast.",

            "comments": [
                "I really liked the road-trip structure of this course. The support for our final papers  library workshops, presentations on structure/footnotes  were super helpful. Sometimes our class would end up mostly discussing the short primary sources by famous politicians, rather than spending ample time on our secondary works, which I found somewhat disappointing because I generally felt I learned more from the in-depth secondary readings.",
                "Some of the reading was lengthy and dense. Would have been nice to have slightly smaller and more meaningful extracts selected rather than just half of a not super interesting book.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gage is truly incredible! She is a master at leading an interesting discussion and chose fantastic readings. I was sad when the semester was over because I loved the content so much. Weaknesses: None!",
                "Strengths: the readings were fascinating and varied. I think each of us walked away with a different favorite week -- anyone can find something they find interesting in the seminar. I was also impressed by the other students in the class, who came from a range of perspectives and departments, including history, political science, and philosophy. Professor Gage was very accessible and gave great advice for approaching our term papers (this was especially impressive because her book, G-Man, came out in the middle of our term). I also really appreciated the workshop at the library and the inclusion of workshop time for our papers during seminar. Weaknesses: Because of the road-trip format (which I liked overall), sometimes the chronology got a bit confusing. I would've liked an extra week on the 1990s and the Clinton presidency. I also might have appreciated one more writing assignment, say a short paper on one of the week's readings. I enjoyed the political autobiography, but it would have been good to have more historical writing practice ahead of the term paper.",
                "Strengths: Quite literally a *brilliant* syllabus. The place-based and chronological structure results in connections and comparisons being made between political trends, events, and phenomena from week to week, which means that knowledge is not lost, but is developed and synthesized throughout the semester. The readings were engaging, and there was not busy work aside from the traditional weekly discussion posts (which I actually found valuable for once, given how committed my peers were to meaningful posts). The political autobiography assignment rocks-- it is something I will keep for the rest of my life, and was an opportunity for political self-reflection that I never would have pushed myself to complete were it not for this class. Professor Gage is probably the best seminar leader I have had at Yale-- she deftly balances guiding the class and contextualizing the readings with her own knowledge with letting her students share their thoughts and reactions to the material. \r\nWeaknesses: I think that the pre-Thanksgiving paper draft opportunity great in theory, but I (along with others I spoke with in class) found this to be a little overly ambitious/early. I would have appreciated the opportunity to turn in an outline or a partial draft. That said, I understand why Professor Gage had the expectation of a full draft and it's probably my own incompetence that made it feel overly ambitious.",
                "The readings Prof. Gage selects really dive deep into certain regions of the United States and shine a light on the way regional politics develops. The road trip format was really helpful for me because I haven't been exposed to most parts of the US and it's often difficult to resonate with politics without understanding the history and community behind it. This format also helped narrow down the focus of liberalism and conservatism and avoid broad assumptions about national politics--of course, we covered that lens too. I think the course was extensive and informative, but we often failed to discuss the supplementary readings each week so it was harder to connect them to the central topic/region. I also think that minority voices were crammed into the week in Northern California, but that may have just been a by-product of the lack of diversity during this period.",
                "Weaknesses: None. It was quite a bit of work, but completely worth it. Strengths: Excellent readings, interesting discussion, and well-timed writing assignments",
                "Strengths: very engaging readings with a great mix of primary and secondary sources; lively class discussions; opportunity to do a major research paper with archival materials.\r\nSuggestion: I think it would've been helpful to workshop our research papers in small groups",
                "Strength: Course is structured to ensure students do the readings and can meaningfully engage with material.",
                "Strengths: excellent mix of professor's explanation of the political trends observed in that week's reading and student conversation. Never felt like a lecture (as some seminars do), but provided the necessary professor-led explanations and moderation.",
                "I think the course was really well-designed, and I very much enjoyed its structure. Im not sure the weekly reading response model is the most valuable, but Im not sure what an alternative would be."

                "Yes! I think the course syllabus did a great job of tackling a huge topic and balancing social history with more high-level political history. The reading load was reasonable for a junior history seminar.",
                "Yes Prof Gage is great. Also it's important to understand American history and the 20th century is incredibly influential.",
                "100%. This was one of the best classes Ive taken at Yale. Conversation is riveting and the opportunity to write for one of the Universitys best is unmatched.",
                "Yes, especially for a student who is interested in modern politics or wants to learn more about the second-half of the twentieth century in the United States. Much of the course covered the topics that we had always rushed through in high school history courses, and it was nice to slow down and zoom in on individual places. The political autobiography is also a great opportunity for personal reflection. Professor Gage also supports the term paper throughout the semester with intermediary deadlines and the chance to turn in a draft for feedback, which I really appreciated.",
                "YES! IF YOU CAN TAKE THIS COURSE, PLEASE TAKE IT. Fight tooth and nail to take this course. It is, perhaps uniquely, universally important material taught by a brilliant professor in a well-structured course. American politics is a mess largely because of the ignorance of what this course covers. This syllabus should practically be mandated reading for every university student in this country. Take this course, commit to it, and you will be eternally grateful to yourself.",
                "Yes! Absolutely take the chance to learn from Prof. Gage if you can.",
                "Yes please take this class! You will learn so much about 20th-century American political history (if that's your cup of tea) and gain experience writing long research papers.",
                "Yes. Professor Gage is an excellent seminar leader and the material is fascinating.",
                "Yes, but be prepared to either allocate many hours to reading each week, or learn how to skim like an expert",
                "Yes, highly. Especially if you are interested in US politics."
