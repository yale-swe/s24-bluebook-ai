                "This course opened me to new perspectives through which to view literature. Both the seminars and the reading materials (the latter of which featured quite a bit of literary theory) featured a wide variety of approaches. Each paper was written according to a slightly different format as well, which further helped me to solidify grasps on several different modes of writing.",
                "This course offered students the opportunity to practice their writing skills and to analyze some of the greatest novels through the lens of technology (both the influence of technology on the novel and the novel as a technology itself). The assignments were structured similar to a ENGL 114 or 115, so there was ample support when completing assignments. Through in class discussions, we explored ideas from key figures in media and communications theory. The syllabus also included some fantastic novels that any person should read in their lifetime.",
                "An incredible set of tools with which to examine the mutualistic relationship between the novel form and the world of technology, under the umbrella of a pun -- because, of course, we ponder deeply the identity of the novel as a technology itself. We got to read some wonderful novels (Defoe, DeLillo, Ellison), write papers using skills ranging from close reading to historiography, and benefit from Prof. Shechtman's razor-sharp insights on everything we discussed.",
                "I learned about the intersection between literature and technology as well as the history of the novel as a mode of storytelling. I improved my skills in close reading and building a strong claim."

                "The course's core strength is its broad range, which is tackled with enough depth to avoid a \"skimming over\" feeling, but not so much as to be overwhelming. A clear lineage of the evolution of novels is presented throughout the course, and the secondary reading materials make learning about this lineage an engaging process. The only weakness I would note would be that there are--at times--awkward silences in the seminars, but that's more Zoom's fault than it is the class's.\r\n\r\nFeedback on the papers was engaging and detailed throughout, and I feel like my academic writing quality has drastically improved over the course of the semester. A lot of time in class is spent on what it means to form an /interesting/ claim, which is an entirely distinct process from the simpler one of forming any claim at all.",
                "The number one strength of the course is Professor Shechtman. She is one of the kindest teachers I have ever had. I consistently looked forward to class despite the Zoom seminar format. She is accessible and will help you improve your writing and critical reading skills. The syllabus is also well-structured and spaced out so that the class never become overly stressful. The assignments will improve your writing and challenge you to engage with the texts in a deep way.",
                "I can't say that anything needs improving. Prof. Shechtman is so good at putting together what are just smart, smart courses. You get to improve as a writer (while preserving your own personal style), read cool things, and ponder literature from so many angles. True to the principle of predicting the complex and multi-faceted 'future' of the novel, nothing is off limits, but at the same time, nothing feels cursory.",
                "The readings are a strength of this class and they touched on a wide variety of topics and time periods. Professor Shechtman was fantastic and she was always available to answer any questions and gave detailed feedback on all our work."

The class's focus on what makes a good academic paper turned out to be unexpectedly deep, and equipped me with tools I'll be using in future classes.",
