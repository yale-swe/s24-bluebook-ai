                "more advanced organic chemistry; electron arrow-pushing, synthesizing products",
                "By taking this course I gained further insight into topics covered in orgo 1 such as the reactions of alkynes, conjugation, the Diels-Alder reaction, and aromaticity. I also learned new content, reactions, and arrow pushing specific to orgo 2 related to the reactions of aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, enols, adols, and amines.",
                "Learned about chemical reactions and mechanisms, particularly those involving alkynes, carbonyls, enolates, carboxylic acids, amines, aromatic systems, and more.",
                "Learned valuable organic chemistry knowledge",
                "A better understanding of synthetic organic chemistry",
                "This class was useful in developing skills for thinking about molecular environments and reasoning as to why chemical reactions can and cannot occur via certain pathways. The class was also useful for developing an understanding of how to apply chemistry to different fields of research.",
                "We learned about alkynes, the Diel-Alder reaction, aromaticity and reactions of benzene, carbonyl chemistry, carboxylic acid chemistry, and amines.",
                "I gained a better understanding of forces driving reactions and improved my intuition for how reactions will go given the structures of reactant and reagents, which I feel like I did not have a good handle on last semester. That being said, I think I will only retain a small amount of the reactions we learned due to the sheer number of topics covered. We learned about interesting applications of chemistry in biology (not a major focus of the class but just mentioned in lecture) which I found interesting.",
                "I learned many reactions regarding the synthesis of organic materials, but I think my biggest takeaway is why certain reactions occur from a conceptual standpoint. This course very much focused on the thermodynamic versus kinetic products of reactions and the electronic and stereochemical explanations for why.",
                "I learned how to think about carbonyl reactions conceptually and pick out the bigger idea and pattern that relate in all the reactions mechanisms.",

                "I gained a solid understanding of a broad range of organic chemistry topics, particularly carbonyl chemistry. I was also able to develop a \"chemical intuition\" that allowed me to approach and solve retrosynthesis and mechanism problems that I had never seen before.",
                "Learned a lot of organic chemistry... Diels-alder, aromatic reactions, carbonyls, amines, amines, nitriles. Fundamental arrow-pushing skills. Spiegel gave nice examples of bio connections."

            "comments": [
                "What I enjoyed about the format of the course was that lectures were easy to follow and taught general mechanisms rather than going through every single example/reaction from the textbookthis allowed me the freedom to think more creatively when faced with psets and exams involving reactions and molecules I hadn't seen before.",
                "The TAs were the best at preparing us for the PSETS and exams, but did not fully live up to their expectations. Spiegel was a good lecturer but the content he covered in class was not at all the same difficulty of the exam questions. The course could be improved by having better communication between the TA's and Spiegel regarding the level of the work given and covered in class.",
                "Strengths: The PSETs are very manageable, and the class is not too workload-heavy compared to CHEM 174. You can drop one exam, and the class is curved, so you don't have to worry as much about your grade. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The communication between Professor Spiegel and the TAs and students was pretty bad. For example, Professor Spiegel was annoyed that the TAs did not show up to his first class, but that was because he had not sent them the zoom link. He also says that he's really bad at responding to emails, so you have to catch him after class to ask him any questions, and this might be difficult if you have a class right after. Also, we had no idea that you could drop the final until the week before the final, which should have been communicated way in advance. Additionally, the review sessions were very disorganized and not helpful.",
                "Strengths are that the lecture portion is well taught, and Prof. Spiegel always gives each question considerable thought/time. The practice problems given by the TAs were very helpful for practicing concepts and preparing for exams. However, some of the p-set questions did not align with the course material especially at the beginning of the semester, it was sometimes frustrating to work on a problem and then discover that we had not learned the reaction yet. While I appreciate the review sessions, I believe answer keys with office hours afterwards would have been more helpful so we could ask more specific questions about the mechanisms, problem, etc.",
                "strength: supportive TAs and good discussion worksheet practices. weakness: sometimes class feels like it drags on a little with all the side-track stories, which could be fun if it's not at 9 am. i feels like those time could be better used to help us solidify the topics. exam review session is always a mess.",
                "Strengths: The TAs, the course material was interesting to me, it was a bit easier conceptually than first semester orgo.\r\nWeaknesses: the professor and his lectures.",
                "strengths-- good lecture style, easy-to-understand lessons, TA's provide really helpful advice, professor answers questions very well, not too much work/problem sets (just difficult exams)\r\n\r\nweaknesses-- lectures can drag on, exams are very challenging, not enough practice problems before the exams",
                "A strength of this course was that the lectures broke down and simplified material that was covered in the textbook, and the discussion sections provided further clarity and insight related to content that wasn't covered in class or that was on a problem set. A component of the class that could be improved was that the lectures felt slightly disorganized which made understanding what was happening a little difficult. Another area for improvement was that sometimes problems on the problem sets would require knowledge either not covered in class yet or content that would never be covered in class, which made completing the problem sets without going to peer tutoring hours or asking the teaching assistants nearly impossible.",
                "The class is well taught with good examples and lectures were recorded. But the exams should better represent past examples given.",
                "The class was a bit disorganized at times; however, overall I really enjoyed it. The disorganization really came from how the past exams didnt line up with what would be on our exams, which caused a lot of stress for the exams.",
                "The course is strong in developing a students understanding of organic chemistry. It is, however, deficient in providing students with enough practice problems that the mechanisms and reasonings become second nature. There is often a disconnect between lecture and homework exam materials.",
                "Strengths: this course was overall amazing! It was very well organized and pedagogical. Professor Spiegel and the TAs were extremely friendly and more than happy to help struggling students. Also, the problem sets were very useful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the only thing (which I dont know if it is really a con) is that discussion section is almost as important as the lecture. A lot of key material was gone over in detail in discussion sections which was only briefly mentioned in lecture.",
                "I liked that there was a lot of help available from TAs and peer tutors, and most of the exams (except for one) felt like a good medium between being too easy and feeling impossible. Practice tests did not seem to align well with actual exams which I think stressed a lot of people out because they couldn't do the practice tests and worried the exams would be the same. I think review sessions for exams could have been more organized, as it would have been nice to either go the whole practice exam, or if that took too much time, to get answer keys for the practice tests or have different TAs cover different sections of the practice exams during the review session. There was a lot of variation in exam difficulty. Also, I would appreciate if the grading policy (exams that can be dropped, how the curve works) would have been explained at the beginning of the semester because there was some confusion about that.",
                "This class is poorly organized. I often felt like the TAs and the professor were not on the same page. Some things we never even talked about in class would be on the exams. I also thought that the course lacked sufficient practice material. The PSETs and practice exams often did not align with what the actual exam was like, which was really frustrating. How the class was graded was unclear as well. The class was also not recorded. There were attempts to make it be, but there were always problems (like blurry video/no video or no sound) that would not be addressed. Recording the class would have been helpful. \r\n\r\nI think this class does a good job of explaining overall conceptual ideas.",
                "The strengths of this class that I finally started to solidify my organic chemistry understanding and understanding the general patterns and reasoning behind many reaction mechanism.",
                "Strengths: Practice exams were helpful and relevant. P-sets were manageable. Good pacing with little homework. Good TAs that responded to questions quickly. Lecture and textbook readings were standard and felt like it consolidated understanding. One exam can be dropped. \r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were not always recorded for some reason. The disorganization and uninvolved professor made learning difficult especially since the course is challenging and material is unfamiliar. Course could have reviewed more material from CHEM174 to solidify understanding as my foundation felt weak which made additional concepts more difficult. Did not review NMR like sophomore orgo which may be a more helpful application to organic chem lab.",
                "Strengths: Professor Spiegel explained course content very clearly. A lot of supplementary resources were made available to us, such as the textbook, the TAs, and the peer tutors. The examples that Professor Spiegel gave in class to illustrate the applicability of reactions we were learning about to biochemistry, medicine, etc. were really interesting. Weaknesses: the course was not always very well organized, and some questions on the problem sets didn't reflect course content. I think that there definitely could have been more communication between the Professor and the TAs.",
                "Strengths: interesting material taught generally well, you really learn a lot.\r\nWeaknesses: the admin part of the class felt a little disorganized sometimes. The psets often had material we hadn't covered yet, and sometimes the tests randomly had super hard questions."

                "Absolutely, although I am someone who was already interested in organic chemistry before starting this course. The workload was very reasonable, and carbonyl chemistry was taught especially thoroughly. Keep in mind, however, that the course almost exactly follows the textbook; therefore, there are times when the subjects are discussed in an order that is not ideal, although everything comes together at the end of the semester.",
                "Nope. Only take it if its required. Not the best course, not the worst, just not worth my time.",
                "Yes, more than CHEM 174. Although the material was harder, I felt like this class was taught at a better pace. Spiegel is pretty good at explaining concepts, although you will probably still go to the TAs for help.",
                "Absolutely not. I did not get any of my practice sets back for weeks, and I went into the final having with so little feedback it was comical. First-years should most definitely take the sophomore version of this class.",
                "Yes if you're pre-med or chemistry major. You learn a lot of synthetic methods that could be fun at points, and those concepts were reinforced with lots of psets and discussion worksheet practices. However, this class is honestly a lot of work, and the curve is much more brutal than it seemed since you are curving with all the REALLY smart first years. Spiegel has cool stories, but sometimes he goes really slow or sped through topics he didn't want to talk about, then just talk about random applications.",
                "Choosing between CHEM 175 and CHEM 221 is choosing between staying with your friends/TA or choosing a better professor. For CHEM 175, you learn a lot of mechanisms and I found it conceptually less difficult than CHEM 174. You will likely receive the same grade in either class. Spiegel is a terrible professor, he doesn't seem to want to be there when he is lecturing, he says he dislikes the textbook but will put in no effort into changing his course to not go along with the textbook, he doesn't like teaching but instead likes to have a room of people that have to listen to him brag about himself, about 20-30 minutes of class is used up either talking about a med school thing like amino acids in chemistry or more likely about him and his accomplishments. In lectures he does put up on the board everything you need to know. If you know you will have a great TA, then this won't be a problem. The TAs were the ones to teach me orgo to be honest. Also, I hear that we go more into mechanisms and a few more topics than CHEM 221, but they probably have a better foundation as they have a better professor. All that being said, I don't regret taking CHEM 175.",
                "this lecture style is significantly better than the first semester of organic chemistry, but I honestly still would not really recommend this class-- it was very challenging and I don't feel like I learned a lot of applicable material",
                "I would not really recommend this course to another student because the problem sets were very difficult, the lectures were sometimes hard to follow and not too engaging, and the exams were somewhat unpredictable. I want to say that the class was not horrible since Professor Spiegel does break down the content and textbook well, the teaching assistants are amazing, the workload for a stem class is not bad at all, and the class is curved generously. However, the sophomore orgo class is also curved and, from what I heard, had lectures that were more organized and engaging than this class (though I heard that the tests were equally as difficult and you have more homework). Also, sophomore orgo covers NMR which would have made orgo 2 lab a lot easier, and for that alone I think I would recommend 220 over 175.",
                "I would mainly recommend this course for those who are very confident in their chemistry ability. The other students in this class are generally very strong in chemistry and may skew curves against your favor.",
                "Only if they need it as a prerequisite or are very interested in the subject, as the work and challenge is so intense.",
                "Yes, it is well taught and develops useful skills for thinking about molecules in meaningful ways.",
                "Yes, absolutely! This course is well organized and Professor Spiegel is very good! We also go over some interesting applications to biochemistry.",
                "If this course is not required for your major and you are not very interested in chemistry, I would not recommend this course. In order to feel on top of the material, it requires a very large investment of time and it often feels like there is too much material to have a chance of learning it all. This course is doable if you have good time management skills and if you have a strong understanding of the topics from the first semester, but I didn't enjoy it and there was a lot of stress surrounding exams and grades. I wasn't sure about majoring in MCDB versus MBB before taking this course, but it convinced me to choose MCDB mainly because I was worried subsequent chemistry courses would be similarly draining. I think that if my study habits had been better starting in the first semester, I might have had an easier time, but I don't think it would have been a positive experience overall.",
                "If you are not interested in being a chemistry major or do not have to do it for a pre-med requirement, do not take this course. I was often extremely frustrated with the lack of organization and it was difficult to feel sufficiently prepared for exams because it was never exactly clear what would be tested. The PSETs are not too challenging and do not take too much time, but studying for exams is really intense and time-consuming.",
                "I would recommend this class if you want to solidify a strong foundation for your understanding of organic chemistry.",
                "I would not recommend this course if it is not necessary for your major or pre-med. It is more workload than other science credits and not particularly well taught. Unless you have a great interest in organic chem, I suggest courses focused on other chemistry topics.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn more organic chemistry and develop a kind of \"chemical intuition.\" However, I would be prepared to put a lot of time and effort into understanding the material.",
