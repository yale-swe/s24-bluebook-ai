                "Strengths: \r\nThe instruction  Professor Moreno is one of the best professors I've had the privilege to learn under. She is passionate about her work, competent in her field, and she truly cares about her students and their educations. \r\nThe workshops  we were able to participate in Yale Library resource workshops, as well as collaborate with the ESRI team to learn geospatial analysis skills.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Almost every class consumed the full four hours of lab, which became difficult to maintain focus behind a screen for that long with very little break time.",
                "I would have preferred to have focused more on molecular biology, but given the COVID pandemic, I think the ArcGIS project was also useful and engaging. The labs were all designed really well; however, I would have appreciated some more guidance on the lab reports (like perhaps benchmarks from time to time to encourage us to complete the reports further in advance of the deadline).",
                "In terms of strengths, Dr. Moreno is very knowledgeable, and she cares a lot for her students. She was very flexible with moving due dates and taking our opinions into consideration. Lab classes are definitely the hardest to adapt to the online format, but Dr. Moreno did a good job by first giving us a lecture and overview of the experiment and the techniques used. She would even film videos of herself performing the experiment so we would have a better idea of what we would be doing if we were in person. This class was also very collaborative, which is definitely a strength since it reflects the reality of research and made the experiments more engaging when we could discuss our ideas. While the lab reports were definitely time consuming and hard to write at first, feedback was very clear and I could feel the improvement in my writing over time. I also learned how to use some new programs like Prism and ArcGIS, which was very unexpected but will be very useful for some of my future classes or research. The only weakness I can think of is that the instructions for the lab reports were a little confusing at first, but that also did force me to do more of my own critical thinking, and I was always able to go to the TFs for clarification or help.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Moreno and TAs were always open to help and offered lots of guidance in helping us develop and learn through the semester; Dr. Moreno also was changed the syllabus for us to learn GIS and gain more skills out of the virtual lab than just watch recordings of the lab done by Dr. Moreno",
                "One of the biggest strengths of this class was that the professor allowed us to be flexible with how we used our time both within and outside of class. When it became clear that we wouldn't be able to conduct the labs as you would in a normal year, we were able to re-adjust our class focus and still learn a lot about arcGIS and public health research. Another strength of this class was that we received incredible feedback on the labs that we wrote."

                "Professor Moreno took the time to record and edit videos of her performing lab experiments. These were valuable. Professor Moreno also ensured we participated in a virtual workshop for learning about Yale's Library research resources. Additionally, Prof. Moreno held many additionally zoom tutorial\/workshops with the ESRI team in preparation for the final project presentation.",
                "The class times were a bit long, and I think it's hard to stay engaged that long over zoom. Maybe some of the less important parts could have been cut in order to make sure people were engaged for the important parts of the class.",
                "I thought the videos Dr. Moreno filmed were a great resource to try to simulate a lab environment, despite the online format. I also liked that Dr. Moreno changed her class content a lot from what it was like in person and decided to introduce us to some more technological tools like Prism and ArcGIS, since I can definitely see myself using both of these programs in the future. Finally, I thought reducing the number of lab reports and replacing the second half of the class with the ArcGIS final project was a great idea. This gave me a better chance to work together closely with a small number of classmates, and getting to partner with the Esri team and hear about all the different ways ArcGIS can be used was really inspiring.",
                "It was sometimes hard to be on zoom for the entire 4 hour duration of the lab",
                "Zoom what somewhat successful, although it was definitely difficult to translate a normal lab class to a zoom. I appreciated taking breaks throughout the class, especially because there were times when being on a zoom for so long could be tiring."

                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to any student looking for an MCDB lab. The work may feel like much more than 0.5 credit's worth, but the class is engaging and Professor Moreno is one of the best instructors to be able to learn from.",
                "The course definitely forces you to figure some things out on your own and do your own research. It is a challenge, but if you are OK with that, you can also learn a lot from Professor Moreno's guidance.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who needs a biology lab credit or who would like to learn more about different techniques in biology lab. While I'm not sure what the content of the class will look like once the pandemic is over, I'm sure certain aspects will remain the same. For one, I found the lab reports to be very rewarding. Although they take extremely long and might seem confusing at first, they really forced me to hone my scientific writing skills, whether that be being more concise, pushing me to analyze and interpret my results, having to decide for myself the best way to present my data, and creating my own figures. Each lab report gets easier as you go, and the type of thought process you go through while writing these lab reports is necessary for anyone who wants to go into research in the future. Also, there is a lot of support from the TFs and Dr. Moreno. They try their best to answer your questions, and they give very clear feedback. Finally, Dr. Moreno is a super passionate and understanding person. She takes into account students' feelings and personal situations, and I think what is most important to her is that students learn the spirit and the logic of the research process.",
                "Yes, good WR credit to develop writing skills in science and Dr. Moreno teaches a great MCDB lab",
                "I would recommend this class to others, although I'm sure that the class will look different in future years and in a non-zoom context."
