    "Good intro to accounting. The class is hard, and you need to go to every lecture.",
    "I learned about why accounting rules and fundamentals are critical to understanding the finances of a company.  The course focused on how to build a set of financial statements and the crucial differences between economic and accounting valuations. Accounting 270 will payoff long into the future for me.",
    "Although I learned a lot from this course, I would have learned much more if the course a better structured in a way that the quizzes and homework actually reflected the this we were leaning in class. Rick is such a great person, but most of what I've learned was because I attended to most of the office hours.",
    "None",
    "good for understanding the basics of excel and finance. very applicable and practical",
    "Basic accounting, balancing T accounts, and general financial terminology.",
    "Rick is AWESOME.",
    "I have a much better understanding of the critical \"language of business\" that is accounting. Challenging but interesting information.",
    "I developed a strong understanding of the basics of accounting as well as the time value of money.",
    "I learned how accountants account for monetary activities in firms and how to look at financial statements\/year end reports.",
    "An introductory level of accounting that gives great exposure to the creation of balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. Also an introduction to what constitutes assets, liabilities, equities, and other accounts",
    "Preparing, Reading, and Understanding company financial statements",
    "Great introduction to Accounting. Highly recommend.",
    "I learned how to read financial statements much better.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of accounting and valuation. We learned how to to classify various business transactions and how to read financial statements.",
    "Basic accounting",
    "I learned the GAAP.",
    "I learned the basics of accounting and business finance",
    "Excellent course. Well taught and teaches you everything accounting.",
    "A much stronger understanding of how to obtain information from\/prepare cash flows, income statements, balance sheets.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Prof. Antle is by far the greatest strength. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I think you could improve the course by assigning one assignment a week that covers both lectures on like a Friday after the concepts have been taught. Having two assignments due a week was a bit fatiguing.",
    "The course was very interesting and covered a major part of business and finance that I haven't learned at Yale or my previous internships. I loved taking the course and look forward to using what I learned in the future. However, I wish homework was graded quicker and I could see the responses to my homework.",
    "We didn't learn in class what we were required in the HM and quizzes. That made me spend so much timing trying to understand what kind of information I had to apply and where to get the information from. Rick didn't corrected our HM and gave us the answers, so it was impossible to know what we were doing wrong.",
    "Really poor organization; lost any sense of high level concepts to the specifics of inputting into the proper excel columns\/formats.\r\nWould suggest a refocus on key takeaways of accounting and get out of the ExPrep\/excel system.",
    "SOM 845 is brutal...",
    "Rick is a great guy, but there is a great disconnect between lessons and homework.  That, and daily homework seems like it is almost optional.  I think it could be greatly improved by giving feedback on homework assignments.",
    "It was a great course, and it could potentially move forward even faster to cover more material.",
    "It would be nice to have the homework be more doable and count towards the final grade!",
    "I think actually less weekly assignments and more psets would be helpful. I did not learn through the weekly assignments but the psets really helped me solidify my learning. I viewed the weekly assignments (especially because it was graded on completion) as busy work and the psets as actual assignments.",
    "Strengths were that Professor Antle is very approachable and is highly passionate about the course material and the class itself. The material was also challenging and rewarding.",
    "Need more multiple choice easy assignments to supplement the harder ones. let us get some mental repetition.",
    "It did a good job of giving me general idea of accounting. I think the homework is a little unrealistically long. Also I dont like how this is a flipped class. Some homework assignments I didnt know how to even start.",
    "The course moves quite slowly, which is great because the students have plenty of time to become familiar with the concepts. the homework assignments are not graded and students get credit just for completing them. The emphasis in the class is very much on learning and not how performance. A weakness of the class was that often the lectures fell behind the homework schedule, so we were assigned to do homeworks on subjects that we hadn't learned yet.",
    "Strength: instructor\r\nWeakness: pacing -- sometimes too fast, sometimes too slow",
    "The strength is that you (eventually) learn the basics of accounting. The weakness are how unorganized the class is and how useless lectures and homework were.",
    "Excellent Professor. Rick Antle is AMAZING.",
    "Strengths:  Very relevant topic\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none really",
    "Strengths: very organized, office hours frequent, TFs were incredibly helpful, Professor Antle is incredible\r\nWeaknesses: due dates for things were very unclear, grading for everything (except the final) seemed arbitrary at best, the whole ExPrep thing (online submission and grading of Excel problem sets) had tons of technical errors and I hope it is not used in future versions of the course",
    "I think Rick's a great engaging teacher and agree that practice is the only way to learn it. I would have benefitted from more assignments and more time with the TAs to go over the material"

   "comments": [
    "Yeah, Yale doesn't offer many pre-professional courses, so this is a great way to get some practical knowledge about a topic foundational to all business.",
    "Yes. Accounting is a course not otherwise offered in Yale majors but a valuable tool, and professor Antle's course is very fair and reasonable.",
    "This class is worth taking regardless of whether or not you are going into finance. Knowing how to operate a business and handle the money has even been helpful for me in organizing off-campus rent and group budgets with friends.",
    "It's a huge skill, but it could be way better taught.",
    "No",
    "yes great prof for learning accounting",
    "Only if they want an easy class to pass, but a hard one to master.",
    "Yes. This information is very important, and Professor Antle is easy to learn from.",
    "You definitely have to be very driven to stay engaged with the subject, but I would recommend it for anyone with a strong interest.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you have an interest in finance and are willing to get to SOM at 8:45 on Mondays and Wednesdays!",
    "I would since the workload is very light and you learn helpful accounting techniques. I did not find the textbook helpful, so it was better to go the TAs or Prof. Antle to clear anything up.",
    "I would if they have a desire to go into finance or related fields since most of what we learned was very applicable to that line of work.",
    "Yes - you learn to understand real company financial statements",
    "Yes its good for learning accounting but definitely has some faults.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless you need to learn accounting for your future job or your major. That said, it was definitely a very pleasant experience given a dull topic and the professor really tries to make it as interesting and engaging as possible.",
    "Yes",
    "If you are planning on going into finance, then this is a useful course. Youll probably need it for your internship or career, but it is not an enjoyable class.",
    "Sure! Rick Antle is great. Take accounting with him.",
    "Yes - accounting and valuation are extremely important skills for the corporate world.",
    "100% Yes! This is a great class to get a good introduction to accounting and valuation. If you are interested in entering investment banking and\/or consulting (which statistically is almost half of Yale undergrads), this is an essential class. Yes, in the corporate world there are training programs that teach you these topics too, but all of your co-workers in those training programs will have had accounting\/finance exposure  taking this class (and actually paying attention) will help level the playing field for you.",
    "I would, but this is also a subject that can be learned online"
