    "I found this course incredibly helpful. Louise's comments are deeply specific and she does not sugarcoat things. This course let me dig into my poetry on a level that I had not done before and come away with a greater understanding of how to write a poem.",
    "honing the craft of poetry; how to write poems that are more \"alive\"; that have some motion, some verve to them; that say something important without trying too hard. Also, how to better read\/edit\/analyze poetry",
    "Louise's introduction to poetry is an opportunity not only to generate a substantial amount of poetry but also to understand what makes that poetry successful in a workshop setting.",
    "I gained tremendous insight into some nuances of writing poetry beyond what I had learned previously (in high school or otherwise), and learned to better apply constructive criticism to my projects and other forms of work.",
    "I feel like I have a much better idea of what makes a good poem now, and a much better sense of what the poetry-writing process looks like for me. Glcks distinction of alive versus dead work was really crucial to reframing my writing process from a top-down pattern, where I would start off with an idea and try to execute it, to a bottom-up process of putting words on the page and letting them take me where they will, as a way of generating language thats alive. I also have a more developed idea of what characterizes my poetic voice, and the elements I like to play with as well as the areas where I can improve.",
    "\"English 408: Introduction to Writing Poetry\" is a course focused on teaching students the basics of poetic craft, including the elements of thought, form, and voice. Throughout the semester, I learned skills that helped me improve my writing skills, as well as my ability to critically analyze literary works.",
    "I gained a lot of insight on how to express ideas through poetry and what it takes for a poem to be memorable. I also learned how to examine my own writing as well as the writing of others and figure out what works and what doesnt.",
    "I gained a much stronger sense for how poetry is discussed and received on a technical and emotional level by different kinds of people. It was useful to gain insight into the different writing styles people had, and receive clear and direct feedback from an acclaimed poet.",
    "I learned a lot about poetry as well as writing in general. I have become more adept at figuring out where certain poems falter and what separates a good poem from a great poem.",
    "I learned how to be clearer in my poetic style.",
    "I learned a significant amount about ways to evaluate poetry through this course -- both my own and that of others. As the weeks went on, I could feel my writing becoming sharper and I was much better able to see the strengths and weaknesses in the writing of others. Professor Gluck's commentary was always incredibly thorough and eloquent, and her feedback on what made a poem alive and dynamic was extraordinary. It's certainly changed the way I think about poetry and creative writing as a whole."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course takes the same format the whole semesterwriting one poem every week and workshopping three of them in class. Louise does not use technology so the mechanics of turning in poems and figuring out which ones will get workshopped and distributing them to rest of the class are a bit convoluted, but not bad once you get used to them.",
    "Strengths: small class size, office hours. If you do the very manageable work and stay engaged your poems will improve.\r\nWeaknesses: Only meeting once per week means that any individual student's work won't be workshopped very often. Professors can also get very particular about their preferred style and feedback can be unclear\/hard to interpret at times.",
    "I loved the workshop format, and felt like I grew a lot from engaging with Glck and my peers in such a collaborative way each week. Glck does everything hard-copy, which was a little inconvenient when I was pressed for time to print out my classmatess poems to have a copy in workshop or had to walk to LC to turn in my work, but it pays off when nobodys hiding behind a screen in class. The one thing I would say is that I would have loved access to an official syllabus, if only to reference the schedule of assignmentsthe structure of the course is pretty self-explanatory, but Glck plays it by ear a bit surprisingly at times.",
    "The workshop format of this course provides students with an intimate, personal atmosphere in which they can improve their writing through collaboration and peer critique. However, due to the course being held only once a week, there is a limited amount of time to discuss student works within a single class period. As a result, only a select few people are able to be workshopped, and it is often the same people being workshopped over and over. I think there should be a system of rotation implemented, in which three students are workshopped one week, another group of students the next, and so on. This would ensure a fair system of discussion, and allow students equal opportunity to have their works discussed throughout the course of the semester.",
    "Workshop discussions were very fruitful and office hours with Louise were especially enlightening. The assignments were all interesting and unique and I really enjoyed the whole process of writing a poem and then analyzing it in workshop.",
    "The teacher's explicit but also broad feedback, as well as the well-chosen prompts were the center of the course. The group atmosphere was strong and diverse, bringing in different voices and ideas every week. More office hours would have been helpful to not only listen to feedback, but also learn more specific strategies for my own writing that weren't as directly discussed in class. Otherwise, the class's simplicity made for its power.",
    "While I learned quite a bit in this course, I wish the feedback was offered the week we wrote each poem instead of the week after. I found myself repeating the same mistakes because I didn't know what went wrong with my previous poem. I also wish there was an easier and more structured way of securing appointments with the professor, because it felt like some students got to meet with her many more times than other students.",
    "I really enjoyed the way that the class was structured, and can't think of a way to improve it."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Go into it knowing that you will not have your hand held. Louise is not interested in breaking down the emotional content of your poems and digging into what it means to you, but as long as you come at everything from a place of purely improving the poetry itself and not as a personal assessment, it is a great course.",
    "yes, if you are interested in poetry or in writing of any sort. Meticulous care in phrasingwhat is said and what is not said,  how things are described, how a voice is createdthese are tools that are important in all writing.",
    "Yes-- If you are committed to a semester developing your own idea of yourself as a poet (in the rudimentary sense as someone who has to grapple with the difficulty of actually creating a poem) then this course is a wonderful opportunity.",
    "Absolutely! The workload is manageable and its a great way to integrate creativity into your academic schedule without it being overwhelming. The class environment when I took it was social and respectful, and people came in with a variety of different experience levels. The class is workshop-basedeach person submits a new poem every week, and each 2-hour long class is devoted to workshopping three of that weeks poems, selected before class by Prof. Glck. Be prepared to do a little outside reading, but not to analyze it in class so much as to inspire your own writing.",
    "I would suggest this course to a student who is truly passionate about writing, and who is seeking an opportunity to improve their craft. The critique delivered during workshop can at times seem harsh and blunt, but it is necessary feedback that provides a critical point from which emerging writers might grow their personal style and voice.",
    "Yes. It was illuminating to understand poetry in such an intimate way and to hear everyones thoughts and how they approached a poem. The workload was not heavy but it did require great depth of thought.",
    "Just a great course for anyone who wants to write better poetry. The process of direct critique, diverse student opinions, and then participating in the act of criticizing others poems generates empathy and understanding of poetry as a process of communication.",
    "I would recommend this course. I really did learn a lot. It was very challenging a lot of the time, but I'm really glad that I took it.",
    "Yes, definitely -- it was unlike any of my other classes and I took pride in the work I did in a different, more personal way. It was an exercise in humility to share my writing and have it workshopped, and it was particularly interesting to learn what the consistent strengths and weaknesses were in my writing style."
