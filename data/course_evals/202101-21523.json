                "Strengths -- very interesting material, Cosmin is always available on discord for questions",
                "Strength - Using Discord as the class communication software. This needs to be done in more classes and was a very clever and useful resource.\r\nWeakness - This course was much harder than it needed to be. While I appreciate the in-depth understanding of graph theory that I now have, I believe the pace of the class began to be set by one or two very smart students that could answer any question the professor threw at the class. This wasn't really the fault of the professor, as he set up an anonymous email for students to contact him if the class was getting confusing and repeatedly encouraged us to use it. I just believe that the pace of this course got much too fast towards the end, beginning with the module Ramsey Theory.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting course content. You learn to think in a different manner which I really appreciated. Professor is clearly very passionate about discrete mathematics and very easy to communicate with (please keep using Discord! I wish all my professors did that). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like the difficulty of the course, especially closer to the end of the semester and the final, skyrocketed. A handful of students in the class (who also participate the most) are clearly very experienced with USMO-style math problems. As such, I think that Professor thought that everyone was at that level. As someone who has never done a proof before this class, it felt like I was just on a completely different level than other students and felt very demotivating. \r\n\r\nAlso, I think having prewritten slides (like at the beginning of the year before transitioning to mix of prewritten and writing on the slides) was better since Prof's writing could be a bit messy and hard to read.",
                "Strengths: the content is really interesting and well-organized; the problem sets (and exams for the most part) were very high quality and are really satisfying to do but not too much work; lectures were clear; Discord discussions were helpful.",
                "The lectures were very interesting to watch with material that was very clearly explained. Also, the problem sets had a good range of problems of various difficulties which made them enjoyable to work through.",
                "I thought the course didn't cover material efficiently. We would cover a new topic maybe every other class, while the majority of the time was spent proving some obscure theorem. I would have liked to spend more time learning new topics or doing shorter examples.",
                "Recitation sessions were a fantastic addition that diversified the usual office hours. The class discord server was a great resource and I think it will benefit other classes in the department to follow this trend.",
                "This course was very difficult (some problems were graduate level math problems) and very hard...",
                "Strengths: homework assignments (these were challenging problems that were always approachable by reviewing the techniques of in-lecture proofs), cosmin",
                "strengths:\r\n- material was very interesting and well chosen\r\n- good pace\r\n\r\nimprovements:\r\n- I think problem sets could be a bit more challenging \r\n- I think writing proofs during lecture is a bit time consuming - maybe leave to recitation or notes, and describe general argument",
                "This is a wonderful course whose structure is well-established to facilitate students' learnings. It covers a wide spectrum of math, from counting to graph theory to probability, yet the transition is clear and every new concept is understandable. Another thing I love about this course is the extensive proof it involves. Every theorem is proof-based, so eventually students will understand how everything is derived, and at the end of the course, it can be surprising that some proofs can be subtlely interconnected.",
                "Cosmin was an engaging professor, he was obviously very passionate about the material. The problem sets and exams were pretty brutal though. They used concepts we had covered in class but applied in ways that took a lot of creative and abstract thinking.",
                "This was my favorite course this semester. If you like math, you will like this course. The problems are more intensive problem-solving questions and not traditional text book questions. I really enjoyed spending hours thinking about the problems and coming up with solutions which is not typical in Yale courses anymore. It is similar to Math 230/231 in that sense. No weaknesses",
                "I think the lectures could be made more engaging as I felt like we were being talked at a lot. I do think that a strength is the \"learn by doing\" that we got in class, although that type of learning may not be for everyone",
                "Strengths: I found the content of the course fairly interesting. The content was especially applicable to outside fields like computer science, which was nice. A lot of the proofs take a lot of effort to solve, but writing up the problem sets was not too bad. For the most part, homework problems followed from material covered in lecture, which was good. Weaknesses: a lot of the course material relies on having a solid intuition and basic proof-writing skills, so more introduction to proof-writing would have been nice.",

However, with Cosmin this semester, the problem sets often felt like biweekly olympiads. This is not ideal, as Math 244 is a foundational course in multiple majors (including but not limited to S&DS, Math, Applied Math, and Computer Science), and its only prerequisite is Math 115. I have friends who did well in Math 115 but dropped this course by the end of the first week, as the step up in difficulty was unreasonably drastic. If a student has a strong background in proof-based mathematics and competition math, I would surely recommend this course to them -- it would probably be fun. Otherwise, if Cosmin is teaching the course, I would advise them to stay away unless they wanted a semester of intellectual suffering and perpetual feelings of ire and inadequacy.",

                "Yes! The content is very applicable for math/computer science, and the class improved my problem solving in general. The problem sets were just the right challenge level and were enjoyable to work on.",
                "Yes, although if Professor Pohoata is teaching, I would be wary if they didn't have some preparation with proofs - the MATH 115 prerequisite is a bit unfitting.",
                "Yup! Cosmin's a great guy and he's great at conveying intuition of the material. He's also very receptive to feedback, so if you feel the course is going too fast/slow for your liking I'm sure he'd take your experience into account.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material was really interesting, and Cosmin did a good job explaining the different concepts in a clear and easy to follow way.",
                "If you're already interested and already have competition-math experience and extraordinary preparation in the subject, go for it. If you're really interested but don't have this type of experience, take the class if you're willing to spend 5 hours thinking about a problem your classmates can do in 5 minutes. You'll probably get a lot out of it actually. If you're not completely interested and don't have such experience, you will struggle and probably should prepare on your own before taking this class. No math class at Yale is without prerequisites.",
                "If you are very proof minded and ready for a very difficult class that requires a lot of time outside of class spent thinking about proofs.",
                "Definitely, if this student was a math major or interested in sampling the best of proof-based math.",
                "Yes\r\n- very good for learning graph theory, which is important\r\n- general math problem solving skills",
                "Definitely to anyone who would like to see fun math. The problems discussed in this class are super interesting, and since most topics are still unsolved, one could readily come to the frontier of combinatorics by digging more. This class also provides useful skills for algorithms, so people considering majoring in CS should also try this course out.",
                "Probably not. If you're really interested in math and enjoy challenging math problems, I'd say this is a good course to take credit/D/fail. The material was interesting and the lectures were engaging, but the problems sets and exams were VERY difficult.",
                "Yes! Take this course if you like math and/or problem-solving. Really glad I took this with Pohoata since I got a solid challenge and learned a lot",
