                "Strengths: assignments and teacher \r\nWeaknesses: readings were sometimes spaced weird (70 page reading for two nights vs. 5 page reading for 5 nights) but this was uncommon.",
                "Strengths: Professor Voigt is really great, she fosters an amazing environment where everyone can share their ideas and information. The class was structred pretty well where it was mostly discussion based. I think the one weakness was that later on it the class there were more big discussions that didn't give as many students opportunities to talk and engage as much as they wanted.",
                "Strengths: Excellent instruction by both the professor and TF. From in-class discussions to feedback, Professor Voigt and Brais were wonderful resources and provided clear, helpful feedback on all assignments. I also appreciated the classroom environment they were able to foster -- by the end of the semester, we grew quite close as a class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No real weaknesses, except it was a bit unclear how we would use discussions on Canvas...I believe the idea was if you did not speak in class, you should post a comment on the discussion. However, this wasn't really enforced.",
                "Strengths:\r\nEngaging class discussions\r\nWarm and kind-hearted professor and TF\r\nOverall very welcoming for Spanish speakers of all backgrounds",
                "Prof Voigt is very kind and doesnt make anyone feel dumb for making mistakes when speaking in class. because of this many people talk during our in class discussions which led to fruitful understandings of the material. The only weakness of the course is that sometimes the readings were a bit boring or too long or too difficult to read because colonial Spanish is much different from modern Spanish.",
                "I really enjoyed this course! I liked that everyone had to pick a quote to share for everyone was engaged in the discussion. Also Seora Voigt and Brais are amazing!",
                "The Professor and TF are a great combo. They assigned a good balance of independent readings, longer presentations/essays, and group work both in and out of class. Moreover, the course was interesting in its material and diversity of documents surrounding indigenous resistance and Spanish colonization. \r\n\r\nGroup discussions were sometimes difficult to follow, just because we read documents in ancient Spanish and introduced jargon that was previously unfamiliar to me. I think this could be improved by incorporating a brief (1 paragraph or so) summary into each lecture slide, recapping the reading we had to do."

                "I would! However, I will say I didn't expect so much historical literature (pretty much everything is autobiographical or biographical). At first I was disappointed but I grew to appreciate it as the semester progressed!",
                "Yes for an enjoyable L5 credit! As long as you do the readings and actively engage in class, you should be totally fine."
