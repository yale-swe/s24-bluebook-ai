                "This class was essentially writing multiple essays in a short amount of time and discussing readings during class.",
                "I gained a deep knowledge of the Neo-soul era and gained skills in how to close read all types of sources from papers to live performances.",
                "I learned how to thoroughly close read passages that I previously may have been daunted by. By doing this nearly every class and receiving feedback on my writing, I think I became a writer much more confident in my ability to make perceptive arguments.",
                "I received an introduction to college writing through the lens of neo-soul music. We read academic articles about the genre (as well as other aspects of black music), discussed them (both stylistically and in terms of their contents), and completed our own academic writing.",
                "This class has strongly impacted how I interact with music and academic writing. Listening to neo-soul, I've thought more about the complex role of music in black culture. Due to the materials and discussions in the course, I've developed of repertoire of scholars and scholarly works that I can engage with. From feedback on my papers, I've developed my prose with a much greater understanding of academic essays at the college level.",
                "The class taught me a lot about a genre of music I was previously unfamiliar with and also helped me to develop my essay writing skills.",
                "I learned how to critically think about the umbrella terms that we often utilize in life. In this class, I learned how to close-read music performances, describe and articulate what makes an album unique. Most importantly, Jeong Yeon taught me how to alter my writer's voice so it catered to my personality and not just what I perceived to be the \"proper\" academic writing.",
                "This course not only thoroughly developed my writing skills, but it also was extremely interesting and taught me a lot about neo-soul. The course material is extremely interesting, and some of the topics we researched\/wrote are not found anywhere else at Yale. It taught me how to think about something I was already familiar with more critically, and how to correctly analyze that in various different papers.",
                "The course was a great introduction to college-level academic writing and I feel much more confident in my close-reading skills as well. The course helped me find my own writing voice and add a depth to my analysis that was previously missing",
                "How to better formulate thesis statements and building arguments."

            "comments": [
                "This specific version of the course (In the Wake of Neo Soul) was great because some of our reading was supplemented with album listenings which definitely kept me engaged when my other classes became harder. Plus Prof Jeong Yeon was great at keeping us engaged in class with fun questions and discussions.",
                "The biggest strength was the teaching and the content of our leaning of neo soul.",
                "The strength of this course was that it covered neo soul with a great deal of depth, addressing everything from commentaries on different neo soul artists to theory about the genre as a whole. One way it could possibly be improved is by expanding the scope.",
                "Strengths: excellent writing feedback, manageable workload, interesting articles\/course material, good number of enthusiastic students, generally well organized\r\nWeaknesses: Class discussions sometimes got a bit quiet, but this seems common in English 114 classes and is not a fault of the instructor (I also regret not participating more)",
                "The combination of having readings and albums to listen to every week helped diversify my study and made studying more enjoyable.",
                "I think this is the type of course where you get out exactly the same amount of work you put in. Each week, there is an album and reading that coincide with each other, and in class we spend a majority of the time discussing the correlation. I would say that I would've enjoyed discussing the actual musical elements of each album more in depth, but not everyone had the same level of musical vocabulary so that made it a bit difficult at times.",
                "Strengths: Great teacher, course material was super interesting, feedback was great to improve writing skills\r\nWeaknesses: Class was somewhat long (compared to most others)",
                "Strengths: Well structured and paced, manageable workload, enjoyable content, great professor \r\n\r\nweakness: N\/A",

                "I cannot recommend this course enough!! It's engaging, insightful, the conversations are fascinating, and the readings are brilliant.",
                "I would recommend this specific class. But it depends somewhat on your fellow students. Prof has done all he can to make a great syllabus with good readings and album selections but it depended on who came to class that made it. Don't do seminar classes if you don't like speaking up and contributing. That being said, this class helped me voice ideas that I might have thought stupid or dumb but Prof would take them and turn them into another segment of the conversation which was always interesting.",
                "Definitely, especially this section and the professor",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because my confidence as a writer greatly increased throughout the course, and listening to music albums in a critical way was a new and engaging exercise for me.",
                "For students interested in neo-soul music (or other areas in the humanities), I would definitely recommend this course! It is a well-taught, well-run seminar, and feedback on writing is very detailed and personalized.",
                "Yes, the instruction was very invested and very reasonable. Studying neo-soul and it's academic analyses have been a great way to begin my college writing experience, especially as someone interested in the performing arts and African American studies.",
                "Yes, especially if youre interested in music\/neo-soul. It added great variety to my class schedule which made the work more entertaining.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in African American Studies and\/or music. You engage directly with a lot of the materials we are given in class, and each paper allows you the space to write about something you're truly interested in. Jeong Yeon makes the class an open, inclusive, and fun environment with cool icebreakers every session, while also challenging us to think introspectively each class.",
                "Yes! The material was unique and interesting, and I feel that I learned a lot about writing in a way that was not \"boring\" - I loved being able to take my favorite albums and deeply analyze them and their artists.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants an introduction to academic writing and is interested in the intersection of music and cultural expression. The course was very enjoyable, paired with a helpful and passionate instructor.",
                "Yes, the subject matter was really interesting and I enjoyed having a reason to listen to music outside of class.",
                "If you need a writing credit, I would suggest the class because the work is pretty light"
