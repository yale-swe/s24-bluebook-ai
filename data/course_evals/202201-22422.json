I ended this class knowing how to distinguish the various Confucian and Daoist philosophers, the various Buddhist schools of thought, and some Neo-Confucian thinkers. It was great to learn about non-western traditions of thought for ethics, political philosophy etc.",

I ended up thinking a lot about how various philosophers engaged with language as a tool for conveying reality because that was what interested me, but this class allows for many different approaches. The professors and TFs emphasized comparison in lectures, paper prompts, and discussions, which I found especially helpful as I'd never taken a philosophy class before, so comparing the different schools was an approachable entry into the content of each school.",

It was also particularly interesting to gain an understanding of their philosophical styles: the importance of redefining versus replacing terminology, focuses on political philosophy versus ontology for its own sake, etc."

                "I really liked everything about the structure of the class. Lecture slides and readings were posted on Canvas, making everything accessible. The professors were incredibly open to answering questions and engaging in discussion. I also really appreciated that the profs would each sit in on at least one discussion section!",
                "Almost all of the weaknesses that course had can be attributed to the general format of the introductory lecture. Qua introductory lecture, it excelled. The only area in which the course itself could be be improved would be the sections.",
                "Generally pretty interesting but Buddhism unit is a bit confusing",
                "Both professors are fantastic and really helpful at summarizing reading material and offering main points during lecture. Sometimes I felt like the quality of section was lackluster but that has more to do with this being an intro course.",
                "The midterm and finals are very doable, the essays are a little more difficult (because it's a very unfamiliar topic and my TF had very high expectations).",
                "Strengths: You learn a ton.  A ridiculous amount of information enters your mind that you never knew you needed to know.  That aspect of the course is really fun, and forces you to stay engaged.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The Buddhism unit really should be a separate course.  We did not have time to fully analyze the topics due to their immense complexity, and generally it felt a bit outside of the domain of the course.  I would recommend maybe keeping just the Chinese Buddhists since understanding some of it is essential to understanding Neo Confucians, but maybe just Sengzhao and the Platform Sutra are all that are really necessary for that.  That would free up time to do some of the 3 Kingdoms period philosophers, and maybe a lecture on how Ancient philosophy got coopted/ignored/transformed by the CCP.",
                "Strength: namely Professor Bender is an absolute gem, a superb and witty lecturer. \r\nWeaknesses: over-ambitious syllabus, much of Buddhist thought seems extraneous (or at least was over-covered) to understanding later Chinese thinkers.",
                "The course was pretty coherent until the onset of Buddhism. For future iterations of this course, I think the lecture slides on the Buddhist thinkers could be more clear.",
                "Strength: provides a very comprehensive overview of the chinese philosophical thoughts\r\nWeakness: could have more depth in each / specific thinkers. Maybe consider 75 min lectures instead of 50",
                "The course lecture slides were very helpful for material review post lecture.",
                "Strengths: Nice teachers and section leader. Pretty easy to get a good grade.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like the content was not very engaging. We ended up talking about one Chinese Philosophy concept for a while (non-self/emptiness/existence) that kind of dragged on for way too long. I wished we learned more about the practice of Buddhism rather than the philosophy (although I know this is a philosophy class) because I feel like the information we learned wasn't very applicable to anything in life.",
                "Strengths: great TFs, good readings, lectures are excellent and accessible. No real complaints.",
                "The professors were very knowledgeable and lectures were engaging. \r\n\r\nHowever I do think the pacing was very fast and at times skimming the surface. We couldve attempted a less ambitious course scope.",
                "Strength: lecture and section were a delight. Every subject and structure was interesting, witty, and accommodating.\r\nNo weaknesses. At all.",
                "Very great instruction, Buddhism was hard but was interesting as well",
                "Strength: It was very well organized in terms of the 3 major topics (Ancient Chinese Philosophy, Buddhism, Neo-Confucianism) and the lectures on each philosopher/main idea.\r\nWeakness: I wish the lectures were recorded so that reviewing for exams could be easier. Some of the slides only had quotes, so listening back to the professors' remarks on them would have been very helpful.",
                "The Buddhism unit hit like a truck and was unexpected. It might be better to have some sort of introduction to those ideas during add/drop period so students have better expectations for the course.",
                "Interesting content at measured pace and well-explained depth. Well-designed and honestly presented exams. Could benefit from more methodological guidance on papers.",
                "strengths: professor Bender's lectures were so good! very clear and with concrete examples to help students grasp difficult philosophical concepts; on the other hand, professor Greene's lectures can be a bit more organized and not talk so much about the context or the western counterparts of the Chinese philosophies we discuss; my TF Ryan was amazing he is so knowledgeable about the course materials and makes it so fun; relatively light reading load and very manageable exams which allow students to focus on the content rather than worry about their grades; something magical about this class is that at the same time it is stress-free and low workload, it is also so intellectually stimulating and fulfilling, making you think about the world and philosophy differently!\r\nweaknesses: the course readings were relatively light but they were conceptually really difficult! If there can be a \"how to read Chinese philosophical texts effectively and with clarity\" workshop (or even a brief video or just a written reading guide) at the beginning of each of the four units, that would be helpful! Also, the Buddhism unit felt very long (mainly because the same professor Greene was lecturing all the Buddhism units), perhaps consider letting professor Bender do a couple of the Buddhism lectures to make them more refreshing for students",
                "I really like how this course is organized not only by school but also chronologically so that we can get a sense of how philosophy has evolved in China over time. The lectures in this class were truly exceptional. They did a great job of condensing often very difficult and complex texts into more easily comprehended ideas.",
                "Excellent professors.",
                "This course was really well taught. I loved all the lectures and the readings.",
                "Lectures for the Early Philosophy / Medieval Commentary / Neo-Confucian sections of the class syllabus were great!! The Buddhism lectures were also fun, but I feel like the concepts from that part of the class were harder to follow. I'm not sure if this can be helped; it's possible that the lectures are already doing the most they can do-- since Buddhist ideas are just hard to grasp. But it felt like that portion of the class was 2000% harder than the rest!! I felt like the two papers were the perfect length, since they're short enough that I could focus on making every sentence a good sentence, instead of worrying about reaching a page count. Exams were very fair!",

                "The professors explain all of the topics very clearly, but some of the Buddhist philosophy is confusing.",
                "More consistent sections because different sections covered different things.",
                "The lectures are always engaging, very clear, and often left me thinking about the content for the rest of the day. I especially loved the professors' thoughtful answers to questions both during and after lecture. I sometimes stuck around after lecture just to hear other people's questions. I also really enjoyed my discussion section; I thought that people understood the material and listened to each other especially well. My TF Yang Hua did an excellent job of guiding us towards interesting topics and gently reigning us in when we strayed too far away from productive discussion. He was also great at synthesizing and connecting various people's comments. I honestly can't think of any improvements for this course.",
                "Lecture was pretty engaging and the course is very well organized to draw connections between the Chinese philosophical schools. Reading load was manageable, but sometimes disproportionately long compared to what could be discussed in lecture, especially in Buddhism section.",
                "The early confuscius learning was amazing! But the later Buddhist sections became confusing and unclear.",
                "All the material up to Buddhism was very clear and well taught; the Buddhism units could use more clarity and structure during lectures.",
                "The course lectures were excellent and paced well with the readings. Various challenging concepts in the readings were often explained further in lecture, which occasionally made reading them before class feel redundant, but as a whole was extremely helpful and satisfying when you did, allowing you to see if your interpretation/understanding made sense in class. Bender and Greene are engaging lecturers with a strong, colloquial command of the material. The course exam structure, which focused on IDs and short answers with leeway to choose a certain amount of questions to leave blank was also well-chosen and thought-out. The short essays, although a bit unclear with regards to expectations and difficult due to the challenging nature of the material, were overall manageable. TF discussion section was also frequently really fun and engaging.",
                "This was an incredibly well-constructed class organized with what felt like an architectural precision (perhaps one could say all parts mutually dependent, a la Fazang's Rafter Dialogue). Topics/lectures were ordered perfectly, and sections gave just the right amount of time for student response. I even felt like I was learning from the exams, because they weren't hard at all if you'd been engaged, but preparing for them required reviewing exactly the brief key takeaways from each thinker and differences between them that are the most important for long-term memory. Readings were generally balanced and the right length - though it was a bit of a struggle to gain much from some of the Indian Buddhist texts just because, while not usually terribly long, their density/obscurity required several reads to even slightly make out. Nevertheless, I could count on lectures to make a confusing reading suddenly make complete sense. Really the only other slightly messy/un-figured-out parts of the course seemed to be the areas where it ran into other philosophy (for example we had an odd last lecture that drew in Kant a bit out of the blue). Figuring out whether it's worth it to spend time relating what the course teaches to Western philosophy, or really defining terms like \"phenomenology\", \"aesthetics\", \"pneuma\", etc. so that they're not accessible only to philosophy majors, might be worthwhile."

                "I'd say yes.  You learn a lot and think about everyday life in a different way.  It is accessible to those without a philosophy background, but understanding philosophy's argument structure is a benefit.",
                "I would recommend this course, though with hesitation. Professor Bender was an excellent lecturer, informative & witty, with the slickest slides a professor in your time at Yale might ever distribute. Professor Greene, however, came across as somewhat condescending and I did not gain a better understanding of Buddhist thought through his lectures. \r\n\r\nA slightly over-ambitious syllabus resulted in speeding through the complex philosophies of many fascinating philosophers. Also, the title might be somewhat of a misnomer: a beefy third of the class is dedicated toward Buddhist thought, much of which was not even written by Chinese thinkers.",

                "Not really unless you are super interested about Buddhist philosophy and it's interpretation through Chinese thinkers. It's very niche. You don't learn much about China. You don't learn much about philosophy. You will, however, know what like 16 Chinese or Buddhist thinkers thought very intimately.  You'll know what each of their opinions were on whether or not there is a \"self.\" And you'll know what each of them thought on how to become a \"sage\" or enlightened.",
                "Yes, the original texts are all really interesting.",

Worth it to break the Western bubble at the very least.",

                "Yes! Such a good course!",
                "Yep! Make sure you keep up with the readings in the Buddhism section of this class, though; if you don't, then lecture cannot save you... \r\n\r\nOverall, it felt very cool to gain a familiarity with so many Chinese thinkers starting from so many centuries ago. I had a moment when I was looking over the final exam, which consisted of pages of quotes from all the thinkers we had discussed. To see all their voices from so many different time periods juxtaposed like that kind of gave me chills... it's a little surreal that their words have been passed down over the centuries and then translated for us to read. What a privilege. \r\n\r\nAlso a few other details: lectures are pretty fun; prof. Bender and prof. Greene are really engaging speakers. Grading is super fair. I always did better on papers than I thought I would. Speaking as someone who has not taken any other philosophy class before this one, the papers and exams are super approachable, but section can be daunting. A lot of people come into this class being very good at making philosophical arguments. For that reason I kind of hung back during discussions. But section atmospheres can differ a lot, depending on who's enrolled. I say make a judgement after attending section for the first time or two; you may also find it very approachable.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in China or who may work with Chinese people in the future.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course! This was easily my favorite course taken at Yale so far. It had incredibly amazing Professors and section leaders, and the material is all very interesting and novel! Would highly recommend!",
                "Yes! Especially if you are interested in Buddhism or Confucianism.",
                "Yes this is an amazing class that changes outlook on life",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone, as it is fairly easy and approachable if you are inexperienced in philosophy, but it also keeps giving the more you put in. The other students in the class seemed really passionate about the material and they all provided unique perspectives. It also has a super chill workload the kind of course where you don't really have to do most of the readings, but they are fun and rewarding when you have the time.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to someone who is interested in learning about the foundation of Chinese philosophy or extending beyond their knowledge of Western philosophy. Workload is not challenging at all and there is a good spread of papers, midterm, final exam throughout the course.",
                "Yes. It gives you a broad understanding of foundational Chinese philosophies and covers thinkers and writers one may not come across in any other class. Workload is manageable, and if enough effort is put into reading course material, this will be a rewarding class.",
                "I would highly recommend the course to anyone interested in Chinese thought and philosophy. It's not a traditional philosophy course in the Western sense of proofs and propositional treatises, nor a typical religious studies course, and instead provides a refreshingly spiritual color/pedagogical approach that suggests new ways of thinking and un-thinking about common ethical/societal issues.",
                "I would very strongly recommend this course. It was one of my favorite classes I've ever taken: so much valuable to learn, so well-organized, and so accessible even for those with no background. And Professors Bender and Greene are both fantastic instructors."
