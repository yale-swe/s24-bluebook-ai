   "comments": [
    "I learned about the basic workings of structural systems in the world. I now understand the difficulty of being a structural engineer and realize why they tend to have a difficult relationship with architects.",
    "I learned the basics of structures, how buildings stand up, how to calculate forces, etc. Now I definitely feel like I have a fundamental understanding of structures and structural engineering.",
    "overview of structures and how to build them; what to optimize for in calculations",
    "This class was a very basic introduction to the engineering principles at play in structural and civil engineering.",
    "I learned conceptually about how different structures work, such as beams and trusses, and how they make a building possible.",
    "I learned a bit about physics and a lot about how loads travel to the ground. Gained a basic understanding of how to calculate forces in various architectural structures (ex\/ trusses, columns, etc.) and conceptual topics surrounding them.",
    "We were taught the basics of structural engineering, both conceptually and through mathematical analysis. We learned how to design different parts of a structure according to different loading and circumstantial conditions.",
    "I learned the basics of structural engineering--how to evaluate the general structural feasibility of buildings, bridges, trusses, and other structures. I learned about the complex force dynamics that can exist within structures and how structural engineers approach these systems. I also learned about the complex process underlying the design and construction of buildings, and witnessed firsthand what a construction site is like.",
    "I learned about the basic structures that define buildings. That sounds rather bland, but it was actually the best course I took this semester. I learned all about the function of beams, columns, arches, cables, domes, and other architectural systems."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: applicable and relevant concepts. Great TFs. Weaknesses: At times it felt like the section only existed so that the TFs could clarify holes in the Professor's lectures.",
    "The information in the course was very interesting and the real life examples that Erleen showed us kept me very engaged. However, I though that sometimes the course became quite disorganized and some of the topics in the PSET's would not be seen in class.",
    "Strengths -- the way the class is set up (twice a week, w\/ TA HW help session) works very well. The syllabus is also strong.\r\nWeaknesses -- I always struggled to learn the calculations in class and had to rely on the TAs.",
    "strengths: well-organized, clear timeline, not too overwhelming, very fun\r\nweaknesses: some test questions could have been worded better, often had typos",
    "This class was overall very disorganized. It often felt like concepts were not effectively taught in class leading to confusion. Lectures often wandered\/ jumped around in a way which was confusing as well. The combination of this confusion and the weight of grade categories made it feel like it was hard to succeed. I think the class would be greatly aided by some sort of system or organization that made the individual concepts clear and recognizable.",
    "Strength was that this was a good introductory course into structures, it is cool to think that these basic principles are fundamentally and undeniably seen everywhere, including really complex and beautiful works of architecture. Weakness was that I have concluded that the way this was taught was not conducive to student learning and I know that because the majority of students really struggled.",
    "The projects are fun and highly engaging. The lectures are interesting, professor Hatfield uses a lot of examples from her own work to compliment the theory. Still, the problems in class are confusing, and you need to go to office hours with the TAs in order to solve the problem sets.",
    "Strengths  TAs. Weaknesses  literally everything. Erleen is a sweetheart and knows how to teach conceptual info but cannot cannot teach calculations. That was all taught by the TAs in their weekly help sessions. Quizzes were hard and scored out of 10? So we all got like 70, 80, or 90% which was bogus. The extra credit was excessive. Class was a meme tbh but idk how i would have gotten through without friends and TAs. Book was not helpful.",
    "The course has weekly homework and frequent quizzes, which helps everyone keep up with the concepts introduced during lecture. The small size of the lecture also allowed students to ask questions easily. However, sometimes the math required on the problem sets would not be covered during lecture, and we would learn how to do the problems the night before the pset was due from the TAs.",
    "Three primary strengths of this course come to mind: the pasta bridge project, the construction site visit, and the homework review sessions. The pasta bridge project was not only fun and creative, but engaging, mathematical, and informative. The construction site visit was a great way to relate the concepts learned in class to a real-life example. The homework review sessions were great opportunities to clarify some of the concepts that were skimmed over in class, and look at them in a different way--which greatly helped with the completion of the homework assignments and quizzes. \r\nOne of the primary weaknesses of this class was the ambiguity of some of the lectures -- often times the lectures seemed disorganized (i.e. the arithmetic on the slideshow wouldn't be correct, wrong techniques, vagueness, etc. ) which left the entire class a little confused. However a lot of this ambiguity was sorted out in the very helpful homework review sessions.",
    "The topics discussed are fairly straightforward and necessary for all aspiring architects to learn. The textbook is helpful but not super integrated into the course -- having great TAs definitely will make the class more understandable.",
    "The course was very easy to grasp considering it dealt with semi-simple physics. I honestly wouldn't say there was a weakness for this course. The professor and TAs were all accessible and approachable. The teaching style was also phenomenal. Since the professor was an actual architect in the field, we got to go to a construction site and she taught us using her own buildings and whatnot."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course only if the student is already interested in architecture.",
    "If you are interested in how buildings work from an engineering stand point, or are planning to go into the architecture major, I completely recommend taking this course because it gives you a basic (and necessary) understanding of structures and their complexity.",
    "Everyone should take this course because you will leave with an understanding of how all of the buildings around you stand up.",
    "totally!! mostly because prof. Hatfield is one of the best STEM teachers I've ever had. it's also really interesting to gain insight into how buildings are structured, given that we live in them all the time",
    "No, I think the concepts in this class are far too simple to make the process of working through the class worth it. Trying to figure out what we needed to know, how to prepare, and how assignments worked was half of the work. By the time we got into some sort of rhythm our grades were hard to repair.",
    "I think that if you have a good grasp on math and physics this course will come a bit more naturally to you. If you don't, prepare to really study and practice and make sure to collaborate with others.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone looking for a gut science; it is fun, engaging, and not too difficult. I'm not sure if I would recommend it to someone who is legitimately interested in structures.",
    "If you have taken physics before then yes. If not, the no. Class is hard to understand so takes a lot of extra work to make good marks.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in gaining a fundamental understanding of structural engineering, without going too deep into the math and physics involved. This is very much an intro course to structures -- don't expect complex multivariable calculus to be used in this class -- the arithmetic is simple and straightforward, but the concepts are relevant and useful to a wide range of applications. Also, Professor Hatfield has so much experience and can really speak to the complexity of some really awesome structural engineering projects she's worked on, and she gives important insights into the process behind designing and evaluating the structural integrity of buildings.",
    "Yes (if you're an architecture major, it's required). Essentially, it's physics but in architecture terms. If you don't have a background in basic physics, it might be a little struggle, but it is definitely a do-able class, and there are some fun projects you get to do!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another Yale student. I would especially recommend it if they are a humanities major. It is a fun experience which offers either a science or math credit."
