I wish we had spent more time discussing specific examples/case studies of drug design and development rather than broad chemical biology concepts that have been covered in other courses. The expectations for the presentations were unclear and inconsistent as Dr. Spiegel opted to change the format after one group had already presented. I don't think there was anything covered in this class that was new or couldn't have been learned from a quick Google search.",
                "The course was lacking in-depth instruction on the various biophysical assays that are used to evaluate ligand-binding such as ITC, SPR, and alpha screen. It would've been great to cover how these experiments work and learn about their strengths and weaknesses.",
                "It covers a broad range of med chem concepts, but many are repetitive with the first half of the quarter in Chem 519",
                "The course had many strengths. For one, I greatly appreciated having the lecture ppt slides before class. In addition, lectures were clear and packed with information. I think the course could be improved with more optional readings. Some papers were uploaded to canvas and I really thought they all aided my understanding of the concepts we learned in class."

The lectures are basically contents on the slides, and I did not get any more insights from listening to Dr. Spiegel's lecture. Also, the problem sets and exams had very little to do with the materials we covered in class.",
