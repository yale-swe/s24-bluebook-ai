                "Strengths: it was such an amazing course, with a great topic and teacher. I loved how, despite the remote aspect of the course, Professor Chalioti really tried to engage us in discussion, so it would be us interacting instead of passively receiving information. The office hours were also great, she was very helpful in terms of the p-set and explaining some topics we were confused on.",
                "The primary strength of this course is Professor Chalioti, who is extremely eager to help her students at every turn.  She delivers the material in a clear and concise way, walks students through example problems before turning them loose on assignments and exams, and holds frequent and helpful office hours.",
                "The course was well designed to maximize net value (as calculated by the benefit of an additional course credit, knowledge, and happiness minus the costs of Yale tuition, ~2 hours of class and ~1 hour of homework a week, and stress). I think it operated at the optimal level this last semester and could not be improved further.",
                "Strengths\r\n- Prof. Chalioti is amazing!! Super passionate and knowledgeable and always willing to help and meet with students\r\n- Course material is very relevant and presented in a very organized and intriguing manner\r\n- Great use of whiteboards to show complex math \/ annotated slides\r\n- Great balance between math, qualitative content, and videos connecting the course to the everyday\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- At times, I wished class discussions could take off more, but I blame this more on the zoom structure than I do on the nature of the course itself. Great class overall!",
                "Fantastic teacher and material. I found the economic models to be less applicable and the better part of the class to be the primary research and focus on real world material.",
                "The breaks that were given mid-seminar were helpful considering the class was almost two-hours long. Great course overall. Loved it.",
                "This class was very well taught and it focused on the relevant economic concepts of the present and the future.",
                "Strengths are its involvement of students with current events in AI and trying to apply student interests into the curriculum\r\nWeaknesses are could focus more initially on AI as an introductory concept",
                "great course but the title is a little deceptive. It was essentially an applied microeconomics course with little discussion of actual AI technologies.",
                "This course was very well taught and organized! The project \/ presentation was fascinating to complete, and I enjoyed that we got to hear everyone else's as well. The homework assignments were fair and helped to solidify my understanding of material covered in class."

                "The small nature of the class, I believe it had only ~18 students, helped make the learning at home a lot better. I loved how we could actually talk to one another, get to know each other, and just interact. I really looked forward to this class in comparison to my other classes that were pre-recorded with no interaction. Some students, away from their friends and isolated at home, just don't get much interaction elsewhere, so it was great that this class was live, full of discussion, and fun. Another huge plus is that this class only met once a week. I immensely prefer this schedule over splitting the class in two, especially for online learning. It just condenses your zoom time to one sitting and gives you less zoom fatigue (the break halfway between the class helped a lot too!)",
                "I thought the virtual lectures\/discussions worked well!  The only thing I would change is this: instead of having Professor Chalioti click through the presentations on her screen, have the students share their screens and control the tempo themselves.",
                "Prof. Chalioti did a great job incorporating the use of whiteboards (with many colors) into her seminar and office hours to make it easier for students to pick up the econ theory. The recorded seminars were also useful to rewatch before exams.",
                "The use of projecting the ipad when doing math problems on the Zoom screen was incredibly helpful each class.",
                "Having recorded lectures really helped me learn more in the class since if there was something that wasn't clear during the live lecture, I could always go back to the recorded lecture and watch it again.",

                "I think the virtual format worked well, and Professor Chalioti made the most of the situation by encouraging everyone to keep their video on so that class better reflected a \"live\" seminar."

You can tell she really cares about her students and her energy in class definitely lightens up the fact it is online and remote. I have no reservations about this course. It was fun and extremely fair in terms of workload\/grading. I cannot express enough how fair the final was. She did a great job of preparing us for the kinds of questions and math problems we should know how to answer after taking this class. Also, the projects she assigned us where we analyze a company or a market for their use of AI was fascinating. You learned not only from your own research but from the presentations of the other students. This was one of my favorite parts of the class and I hope she always keeps that part.",

                "This was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale, although I'm a little biased being a Computer Science \/ Econ double major and am planning to work in big tech after college and entrepreneurship sometime down the road. I learned so many interesting and useful things in this class, and it was especially well taught by Professor Chalioti.",
                "Absolutely!! Eva is so passionate and the course material is in so many ways important to the present day, quickly changing world. The course does a great job giving students a thorough vision of concepts as well as the math behind them, and if you take this course, you will learn so much about AI and the industry!! Finally, the course gives you the chance to dive in-depth into an industry, specifically looking at how AI will impact and change it. This project (including the memo) taught me so much about an industry I never thought I would get to know well, and it truly added to the depth of information given by this course.",
