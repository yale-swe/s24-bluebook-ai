In this class, I learned how to speak and understand more complex language structures by reading and discussing topics concerning Brazilian politics, Brazilian art, and Brazil's wide culture.",

We wrote music, created our own podcast, debated on everyday subjects, watched films, consumed a variety of lusophone media, organized our own virtual art gallery, presented on lusophone poets, and created a final presentation on a topic of our choice, completely in portuguese. This course, different from PORT 110, was more about learning the vocabulary necessary to actually talk about the subjects you would discuss with someone on an everyday basis."

Topics explored include culture, society at large, food and film, etc. which were all greatly appreciated",
                "I really enjoyed how understanding and welcoming the prof and TAs were when many of us do not know the language very well and have questions in class or say something incorrectly. One weakness might be that it would be nice to be updated on our grades more frequently throughout the semester.",
                "The strengths of this course were in-class discussion, outside projects such as podcasts and presentations to be presented to the class. \r\n\r\nAs a language learner, there were many obstacles to overcome while learning a third language but they were not the fault of the material or the instructors - who helped me even more because of it.",
                "The course had a wide variety of assignments and felt effortless, yet I improved so much. Personally, I would have liked more opportunities in class to speak portuguese, but I mainly credit the Zoom structure for this weakness."
