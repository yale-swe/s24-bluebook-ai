                "Well organized. Learned a lot.",
                "The strengths of this course were that the project based model of the class is good for learning of useful skills. However the biggest weakness of this class is that it was not actually a biophysics class. This class was what I would have expected from the computation methods in biology course. There was very little theory or biological concepts being taught. It was mostly a computation course which was not what I signed up for. In many ways it was Biophysics as used in the O'Hern's research instead of biophysics that might be applicable to all students. A majority of the students in the class work for Professor O'Hern and it often felt as if the class was being taught for them and not the rest of the class. \r\n\r\nTruthfully I feel like what might be the most useful improvement of the course is to split it in to those with biology background and those with out. A complaint that has been brought many times this course is taught is that the physics is too low level for physicists/engineers/etc. and overwhelming for the biologists. And furthermore the non-biologists don't actually gain much insight in to biology from this course either.",
                "The course starting off great with statistical mechanics and polymer dynamics, but near the end started to feel a little disorganized.",
                "We only had 6 homework sets, which made my engagement very on/off. I think a more consistent workload would be very helpful. The homework sets were interesting and cool to do, but they sometimes had errors or were hard to understand. Also, I feel like I didn't need to understand the lectures to do the homework most of the time.",
                "Great matlab instruction.",
                "The strengths is that you get a lot of hands on experience with MATLAB coding which seems very practical. However, I did not have as much biology background as some of the other students so maybe it would have been nice if there was some more context provided. Or if a suggested text book reading could be posted for each topic, that may have been helpful.",
                "Strengths - assignments had interesting, visual results\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - assignments frequently had typos or unclear instructions that made it a guessing game and often frustrating. Skills needed for the assignment were often separate from lecture topics. Second half of course lectures were less about course topics and mostly about prof's own research.",
                "Very hard",
                "The problems presented in this course were novel to someone who had not taken this course or worked in the professor's group. Nice introduction to the field and the mode of thinking utilized."
