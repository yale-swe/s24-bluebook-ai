   "comments": [
    "Good survey of techniques in time series modeling, definitely more in depth than what you get in a traditional econometrics class. Cool stuff.",
    "You learn time series econometrics which is actually really important to doing any econometric analysis. kind of crazy that you dont learn this stuff in the normal econometrics course sequence...",
    "Learned about financial time series analysis, both the theory and the applications.",
    "This class was taught pretty poorly. Professor Chen is extremely kind but she is, as many Yale professors are, a silent genius. Her lectures were nearly impossible to follow as they were taught at an extremely high level and required a deeply nuanced and advanced understanding of econometrics and statistical techniques that students in the class were not prepared for. This seminar certainly felt like a graduate level course, except none of the students were prepared for it. \r\n\r\nWe discussed autoregression, autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity and heteroscedastic regression, nonlinear parametric regression, nonparametric regression, factor models, and other very important financial topics. However, despite Professor Chen's best attempts, her slides were dense, her lectures were unintelligible, and the students were left in the dark.",
    "I eventually learned a little bit about applying time series models to data. More so, because this course was so ineffective in actually teaching, I learned how to navigate convoluted R documentation to fiddle with my code enough that it worked."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: workload is very reasonable, Xiaohong is hilarious, material is interesting and not necessarily something you'd be exposed to in other econ classes. Weaknesses: you don't learn during class -- you learn by doing the psets. So just be ready for that. The lectures were impossible to follow for me.",
    "You really don't learn in class; the professor is a genius but kind of rambles the whole time. but if you do the problem sets yourself and take the presentation seriously, you can learn.",
    "Strengths: topic is very interesting. Professor Chen cares about our learning and she makes herself accessible. We also had a great TA: Xiaochuan. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the math part can be confusing. to get the most out of the course, you need to have a good understanding of math requirements. you can see an example time series textbook, e.g. Analysis of Financial Time Series from Tsay, to assess this.  one way to improve could be first introducing the topic, the intuition behind it and its importance, and then giving supplementary documents (if needed) for the theory part.",
    "Strengths -- extremely relevant material, great textbook\r\nWeaknesses -- poor organization, bad lectures",
    "The course was not effective at all in its purpose of teaching the subject. This is primarily because course communication was very bad, and teaching was done at a level too high (and ineffective) to facilitate learning. The professor for this course, who is clearly brilliant at econometrics and likely Nobel-worthy, unfortunately is an ineffective teacher. She assumes a frightening level of prior knowledge in econometrics that nobody in the class could keep up with. This would not have been that much of a problem, but the professor also talks very fast and quietly, and speaks in a stream of consciousness. While she opens a slide deck and puts the title slide on the projector, she does not use the slides. Instead, she rambles for an hour and fifteen minutes while scribbling on alternating corners of the chalkboard, changing variable notation quite literally every few minutes. It is likely that not even a skilled econometrician could fully follow what is taught in the classroom. It became impossible to sit in the lecture without zoning out, which is disappointing because it would have been great to truly learn from such an accomplished professor. The TF tried his best to teach during extra sessions, but could only do so much. We were given minimal notice before problem sets were due and were told their contents only at the very last minute. Eventually, the lectures were replaced by student presentations, making things more comprehensible, but still disappointing."

   "comments": [
    "This is a great senior fall econ elective -- even better if your thesis has a time series component, as you expand your econometric toolkit significantly throughout the semester in a relatively painless way, and you can start thesis modeling work via your final paper. Absolutely recommend to anyone interested in econometrics\/quantitative finance.",
    "Recommend if you're writing a thesis about finance or using time series. YOu literally need the information from this course. It is really chill, not too hard, and usually a small class. no exams!!",
    "yes, the topic is highly important, so i would recommend the course. the course was rewarding and i am glad that i took it, but there is space for improvement, in particular, the lectures where the theory is being studied could be more accessible.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to another student in its current shape. Though this material is extremely important, a student in this class learns practically nothing from the lectures and is instead reliant on discussion section and personal studying. Given the mathematical and theoretical sophistication that this material requires, it's very difficult to learn in this class without help.",
    "No. Do not ever take this course. The only exception is if, for some inexplicable reason, you absolutely need to learn how to handle financial time series yet somehow are already an expert at financial time series."
