I think my academic abilities have greatly improved because of the weekly practice of reading various sources, evaluating them, and synthesizing my opinions of them in a weekly write-up for Harsha and discussions in sections. As noted, I often didn't agree with the sources but I am glad that I have read them. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I believe that my ability to discuss sources has improved this year in section discussions.",

                "This class provided an excellent global history of the second half of the twentieth century and early twenty first century. We learned about a wide range of topics including decolonization, 1960s and 1970s social movements, the Cold War, and neoliberalism. The course also did a great job of being a truly global course, and focused on case studies from across the world instead of mainly focusing on one region.",
                "I learned about the roots of lots of problems our society is facing today.",
                "A comprehensive view of the worlds history after WW2 to present day. But this wasn't just a regular, broad history course, instead we learned big concepts, trends, and events through looking at individuals' stories or specific countries.",

I enjoyed when the lectures focused on specific country's histories, as I felt that I was learning something I would otherwise have never cultured myself on, such as, for example, Laos or Ghana.",
                "I learned a ton in this class. I now feel that I have a much stronger hold on the past century or so in the world. The course was very wide-reaching without feeling random. I also really improved my writing and analysis skills. I loved this class! It made me become a history major.",
                "A lot of historical events and its connection to our modern world",
                "I learned about the various social movements of the postwar period (1945-present), including decolonization, non-alignment, radical and second-wave feminism, Black power, socialism and communism, reactionary masculinity, and neoliberalism. I am able to write essays that answer vague prompts. I understand how the Global South strived for political, economic, and cultural independence as countries freed themselves from Northern empires, as well as how Southern countries influenced the new world order.",

                "I learned about the Cold War, proxy warfare, colonialism, social movements, and imperialism. I got an amazing overview of world history from the 1940s that greatly informed us on the current happenings of the world. I loved this class!!",
                "This course made me fall in love with history. Hands down the most exciting lecture and section combo I have ever experienced at Yale. I am not even a history major and I want to declare.",

                "Strengths - overall topics/themes of lecture, readings, and sections. Inclusion of readings that can challenge the priors of students. \r\nWeaknesses - unclear essay prompts. While the readings that do exist can challenge students, they are not very intellectually diverse.",
                "Sometimes I struggled with some of the readings. I enjoyed the paper topics.",
                "The course gives you a great overview of the history of the 20th and 21st century in a global perspective. I loved all of the lectures and the readings were really engaging. All of the writing assignments were interesting and manageable. My TA for the class was also excellent and I enjoyed section. There are no major weaknesses of the course.",
                "The lectures were really interesting and engaging. The 'reading' wasn't always reading (movies, podcasts, ect.) which was a nice change up.",
                "Strengths: Both professors are super knowledgable brilliant at what they do. It's so inspiring to see their own research and publications incorporated in the course. \r\nWeaknesses: As an international student it was at times hard to keep up with the lectures because the slides didn't include text and the professors spoke quite fast. They mentioned points only once so if you missed it there wasn't really a way to hear it again.",
                "a lot of information but sometimes too much information. the lectures could focus on less topics because they seemed rushed sometimes because there was so much to cover in little time. Maybe focus on the most important aspects of the world circa 2000 rather than try to cover everything",
                "The course could be improved by posting the lecture slides after the lecture.",
                "A strength is that almost all of the required readings picked out by the professors were relevant to lecture content, and genuinely interesting. I especially enjoyed reading an Ocean Vuong novel for the class. On the other hand, there were some readings that were very repetitive and unnecessarily lengthy, and I feel as if the required weekly reading material can often be quite hefty. Also, sometimes the lecture content was too much, and we struggled to get through everything on time, so I feel that some of it can be cut down.",
                "strengths: bredth of topics. discussion sections specifically the teaching fellows. I loved how the lectures were formatted. I liked how the writing assignments were layed out and I liked discusison posts. Overall this was an excellent course. I loved the lecture outlines a lot and they were really helpful. I liked how each discussion section had a topic rather than just being overarching.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the class could improve its branding: the title world circa 2000 didn't tell me much about the course content. More feedback on our writing - I would've liked more in-depth help with my essays. I thought that the second and third essay questions were a little repetitive. I also would've like a small creative project or something so it wasn't just essays. I wish that the lecture was reccorded becuase I went to class a lot while I was super sick which isn't healthy for me or anyone else. I didn't come to class when i had covid and really felt like I missed out on that week which made it way harder to write the first essay. They should have the reccordings avalible by request to the TF. I would have liked to hear about the TFs research. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if these are weaknesses but I have some suggestions. This class should be a writing credit because I wrote a lot in this class so it should also count as a writing credit. The room was really big for the amount of students in the class and so they should have everyone sit in teh first few rows so it feels less empty.",
                "Very fascinating course. The assignments could have been spaced out better in November",
                "The course was incredibly interesting, and I felt like I was always learning something new. However, because of the broad focus, it could sometimes feel disorganized, which often made the essays difficult to write. I think the course would improve from more distinct prompts, as I found myself writing about the same movements over and over again, despite the fact that we covered so much information.",
                "The class was very organized and engaging.",
                "I would like to see the lectures incorporate more information from the readings to connect them more thoroughly. I would also like to see more documents that discuss the role of women. We had one essay discussing how the World Circa 2000 is gendered, but I don't think we were given enough sources outside of lecture.",
                "The lectures were the magnum opus of this class, and our sections perfectly supplemented the material. I loved that every class began with a song, and the way in which the material was presented was honestly cinematic. Every time I left that lecture hall, I felt as though I was stepping out into the world with fresh eyes.",
                "The lectures in this course were always engaging, though they didn't always cleanly match up with our readings for the week. Still, this encouraged students to draw their own connections, which had benefits in and of itself. Discussions in section were not always well-organized, and we often ran out of time before discussing relevant readings, but my TF had a genuine enthusiasm for our section and always tried to facilitate engagement and understanding. Overall, the readings were compelling, offering up perspectives we might not have been exposed to before. Similarly, the lectures were effective in that they often addressed large issues through instances unfamiliar to the average student of the western world featuring both prominent figures and those who might not have much name recognition but clearly made their mark or exemplified some larger reality. This lecture-style was particularly humanizing, ensuring the histories we learned of were not abstractions we felt emotionally removed from. Rather, the lectures gave us concrete stories that were often profoundly moving.",
                "Lectures are awesome and interesting. Too much normative thinking presented, however. There's not much room to disagree with profs or readings, as the territory covered is quite complex and provocative. Lots of liberal bias. Still interesting/important to engage with. Why is neoliberalism embraced so widely, and what are its benefits? Would have been nice to consider that as well instead of determining that neoliberalism was inherently a problematic economic model.",

                "Yes! Even if you're not super interested in this topic I learned a lot and it was helpful for me in understanding our modern world. I loved the TFs, I loved lecture, and I loved the format. The workload was pretty low and was mostly just the four essays. The profs take this course seriousley without making it insane. I loved it so much and it was one of the reasons why I had such a good semester. They should make this class into a podcast. I would totally reccomend this to anyone who wants to learn more about the last 100 or so years.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to students interested in a global history that incorporates multiple perspectives. I like how we were given the space to interpret what we've learned and discussion sections were an amazing resource to further question certain ideas.",
                "100%. This is the best class I have taken at Yale, so yes.",

                "Ummm.... maybe. I enjoyed lectures and readings. Course material was scattered in theme and lots of bias in readings and lectures.
