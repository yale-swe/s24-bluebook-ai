                "Well let's just say without this class I will never be able to understand Hume, Kant, and Fichte. Professor Franks and all the other lecturers did a great job explaining those extremely complicated ideas to us.",
                "I learned about the foundational ideas of some of the most important philosophers of the last several centuries, from Descartes and Kant to Mill and Anscombe. Along the way, I learned how to write an effective philosophy paper (which is very different from papers in the other disciplines!).",
                "Logical reasoning and proofs, history of philosophy, critical reading\/thinking\/writing.",
                "I learned so much from this course! I learned not just philosophy, but the history of philosophy, and different ways to evaluate the world. My writing skills also greatly increased and I feel much more able to engage with different philosophers doctrines.",
                "I learned a broad range of mid-to-modern philosophical theories and thinkers, as well as how to apply those theories.",
                "I learned about the relationship between metaphysics and science, which turns out to be very important. This course felt a bit like intellectual history, and it was very engaging in that way. From Descartes to Leibniz to Hume, Kant, etc, we covered a lot of valuable ground. I feel that I now have a better understanding of what philosophy grapples with and how it has evolved."

            "comments": [
                "The philosophy track of Directed Studies suffered a major blow this year when Leibniz was replaced with Du Chtelet. Despite the skill of the latter, it made no sense to read her treatise without having the backdrop of Leibniz's thinking, which was only briefly covered in one lecture. Other thinkers like Kierkegaard and Newton were equally excluded from the curriculum for some reason despite the fact that they were referenced frequently in lecture. In other words, the philosophy track was shaken this semester and it felt vastly different than other tracks.",
                "Strength: great lectures and professor Franks is definitely a huge strength!!!! extremely kind and caring and knowledgable professor that makes Kant understandable.\r\nWeakness: I feel like we get a little too much metaphysics this semester. I would prefer if DS brings back some existential philosophers in replacement of some metaphysics readings.",
                "I really enjoyed the spring DS philosophy syllabus - the selection of texts made sense, and in contrast to last semester, it was nice to get at least a couple of female perspectives. Professor Franks' leading of class discussions was definitely a strength - I learned a lot through the questions posed by my classmates. I'd say the biggest weakness is the last two weeks or so - I enjoyed all of the authors very much, but it felt incredibly rushed and I don't feel like I have a particularly good grasp on them.",
                "It moves extremely fast which makes it quite difficult to truly keep up with and comprehend the incredibly complex ideas about which we are learning and discussing every week.",
                "I think this course was very strong! You get a real understanding of how each philosopher built of each other and the readings, while difficult, are short enough to be manageable. There are an abundance of essay prompts that allow you to write a good paper about something you actually find interesting. My only critique is that I think Du Chatalet should be eliminated from the syllabus in favor of Leibniz or Spinoza.",
                "The breadth and depth of the reading provides a strength and a weakness. The sheer amount means that some areas of each writer's theories go uncovered. The structure allows however for a great basic understanding with detailed knowledge of the text's major particulars.",
                "The strengths are that you get to learn a ton, which then helps you to narrow in on what you want to spend more time on in the future. The downside is that sometimes you don't have enough time to really digest a text. That's why you need to put in your own time to really get the most out of DS."

            "comments": [
                "This course was particularly difficult because of the emphasis on nuanced thinkers like Kant. Parsing through his metaphysical and ethical writings demanded an enormous amount of energy and the academic jargon employed in class to describe varying schools of thought was extremely difficult to follow. I would only recommend this course to students considering the philosophy or EP&E major.",
                "YESSSS!!! even though reading Kant and Fichte and Berkeley makes me want to throw my brain out of the window, in the end is very rewarding. Don't miss the chance to challenge yourself to understand (and potentially, roast) the best minds ever existed in this world.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it - fall DS philosophy is interesting, but it doesn't cover a whole lot of the 'philosophy' that's relevant today, and the spring semester both builds on it nicely and introduces you to a number of the most important philosophers of the last several years. Professor Franks is incredibly knowledgable, which is both a blessing and a curse - his explanations of difficult-to-understand writers like Kant were very helpful, but he also frequently assumed we had a better grasp of the texts than we did. Overall, this was a very good class, and Prof. Franks is an absolutely fine section leader.",
                "Yes, because it provides such a comprehensive view of the history of modern philosophy designed to complement the curricula of the other two DS classes.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. I came into this with practically no understanding of philosophy and now I feel like I not only understand different philosophies, but I see how they interact with each other. It greatly impacted how I read texts in general. Also, your writing skills will improve a lot.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Philosophy rarely gets taught in high school, but it has an excellent rigor for humanities studies and a unique writing, intellectual methodology.",
                "Yes, it's a great way for people who don't have that much background in philosophy to become familiarized with the important ideas. I actually feel that many of the ideas we discussed have some sort of bearing on daily life. The ideas we learned can help us to figure out what we're really doing when we write a proof, express skepticism, etc."
