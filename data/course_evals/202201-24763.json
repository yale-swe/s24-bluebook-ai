Overall greatly increased my understanding of the many dimensions of Latin America"

            "comments": [
                "Its very comprehensive and the professor and materials are superb. However, as Latin America is such a big, diverse region, it is sometimes too hard to understand it entirely and it felt as though what we learned was very fragmented.",
                "This course is great in that it focuses on the voices of indigenous people and women, aims to create a sense of understanding surrounding Latin America and its diversity, and is well structured. The only weakness I would cite is that lecture versus discussion balance is not consistent, which can be hard to prepare for, but this does not hinder the fact that the course was super enjoyable!",
                "I honestly don't think this course had many weaknesses at all. The balance of lecture and discussion was great to me, almost all of the readings were engaging, and the workload was very reasonable. There were a couple readings that definitely weren't as good in my opinion, but Prof. Aguilar recognized that herself and was quick to change the future plan with this in mind.",
                "Lots of material that allows for you to learn about the topics. In-depth class discussion that allowed for many to share their perspectives.",
                "The course material was really interesting and Prof. Aguilar is great, but it would be nice if there was more of a coherent narrative linking topics together. It felt like each class session was essentially independent, for the most part, so I felt like I learned a little about a lot of topics. This breadth is not necessarily a weakness, but I wish that the course could have a bit more depth and connection between topics (this might also be an effect of just how broad the course itself is  perhaps a narrowing of course material and objectives could strengthen the class).",
                "We learned a lot throughout the class, and viewed almost every topic from an intersectional perspective, which was great! However, its weakness was that there was no background taught on the topics we covered. We dived immediately into specifics in history without learning or reading about the events/time period/context first.",
                "The format as a half/seminar half/lecture was very disengaging. I think a seminar would have been more interesting.",
                "Strengths: thoughtful Professor who clearly knows a lot about the material and cares about the course. Good content from readings as well. \r\n\r\nWeakness: hard to focus through this lectured lens. Not particularly in depth in any specific region.",
                "I think a section and shorter lectures would be beneficial.",
                "I really enjoyed Professor Aguilar's teaching. I don't feel like I actually learned a lot of concrete material, but everything we discusses was definitely really interesting, and it definitely piqued my interest for Latin American Studies. I also liked doing a creative final project at the end of the year.",
                "The course covered a very broad subject matter, so we didn't have the chance to focus on any individual topics very closely. If you missed a class there was no returning to the whatever was discussed that day, so attendance was crucial despite being a large lecture.",
                "This course had a great mix of assignments, covered a broad range of topics, and was overall quite interesting. One improvement would be to have short readings that provide the broader history and overall context of what the more specific readings are talking about so that they are easier to understand.",
                "I wish the format was different. The mix between a lecture and seminar didn't work very well because the same few people ended up speaking and it was easy to zone out. Also, the themes we discussed were very important, I wish that we spent more time covering the basics. I still don't feel like a have a great grasp on the history of Latin America because our learning didn't feel particularly cohesive. Although the weeks were well organized, they were not at all tied together.",
                "Strengths: Given that it was the professors first time teaching the course, she was really good at teaching the class and giving us informative readings, films, and documentaries!!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the readings for certain classes were postponed or delayed so there were some miscommunication about that but Professor Maria was super accomodating and kind about assignments and extensions.",
                "I thought this was a really good class. I can't think of anything to improve. The strengths were that Prof Aguilar was very kind and made the lessons really accessible.",
                "STRENGTHS: covers a range of countries and topics, focuses a lot on student interactions with the material, workload is not too heavy and the assignments are interesting, guest lecturers offer diverse insight\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: N/A"

We talked a lot about colonization, race, erasure, etc. It's definitely one of those classes where what you get out of it depends on how much you put in. It's totally possible to sort of skim the readings and not pay attention in lecture and still get by with a good grade, but then the rewards are minimal.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student with no background knowledge on Latin America hoping to study the region. Students who already know something about the subject are better off taking something else.",

                "Yes.",
                "I definitely would. Considering the history between the US and Latin America I think it's responsible for people to take a course like this. This one is also very engaging and interesting.",
                "Definitely! Despite introductory courses having a bad reputation as \"too broad, too inconclusive regarding content,\" Prof. Aguilar does an amazing job providing detailed and personal works regarding historical events--more personal connection with culture--in the short time frame given.",
                "Absolutely! Especially if you have not taken a course on Latin America, this is a great intro course to give you a general feel for the region. The assignments are spaced out nicely and the readings are really interesting. You'll learn a lot about both the culture and the history."
