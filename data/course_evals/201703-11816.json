    "Elementary knowledge of reading, writing, and speaking Arabic (mostly MSA\/formal Arabic)",
    "I gained a good command of the Arabic alphabet, including short vowels, and spelling properly from dictation.  I also learned a good basis of vocabulary, both in formal MSA and Shaami dialect.  I learned some basic grammar, including idaafa constructions, nisba adjectives, past and future tense, and verb conjugation.",
    "I have developed a solid foundation for future Arabic studies. I have also generated an appreciation for the variance between local dialects and Modern Standard Arabic.",
    "Studying, insight into arabic culture (music, traditions, etc), memorization",
    "basic grammar and conversational skills in arabic"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course moves quickly, so if you don't show up to class, or aren't engaged in actively learning and reinforcing the language outside of class, it is easy to fall behind and never catch up again.  This, however, is true of most language instruction.  There is homework every night, sometimes quite a lot, which can be difficult to manage at times but is also absolutely crucial for retaining the volume of material.  The skits are a fun and enjoyable part of Friday classes, and the class's emphasis on Shaami enables you to actually speak Arabic with native Arabic speakers.",
    "This course was a rigorous introduction to Arabic. For the majority of the semester, this course required two to three hours of homework per night, in addition to class five days a week and bi-monthly language tables. That said, I believe this level of work is necessary to truly develop a foundation in such a difficult language. I did not feel like any of the work was unnecessary, though at times it did feel tedious.",
    "i learned so much but it took more effort than my other classes because i.t was so fast paced"

   "comments": [
    "Yes!  Arabic is a beautiful, logical language to learn just for the sake of learning a language.  It is vastly more rule-bound and structured than English, if that appeals to you.  It is also an extremely useful language to know in our current world, with so many humanitarian applications.  This course is a good introduction to the language.  There are also numerous study abroad funding opportunities available with Arabic.",
    "If you are seriously committed to learning Arabic, this course will help you do that. However, you have to be ready to put in the amount of work that the course requires and deserves, which is significant. If you do so, you will see returns and you will be pleasantly surprised by your proficiency at the end of the semester.",
    "YES YES YES YES YES! Ustezah Elham is  AMAZINGGGG! This course is hard, and she will push you, but BY FAR my favorite class this semester. She makes sure you're actually learning and is there FOR YOU.",
    "yes because its a lot of work but very rewarding",
    "The course has a lot of work, but students end up with a lot of Arabic ability at the end of the first-semester, which makes it all worth it!"
