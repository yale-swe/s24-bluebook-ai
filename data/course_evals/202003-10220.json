                "Yes, for sure. Professor Cleary is excellent at taking us through the individual texts and challenging our thoughts about the authors' work. It is a good foundation for anyone who might want to dip their toes in global literature analysis.",
                "I highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in reading a vast quantity of literature from a variety of different regions and time-periods. The course examines racial, religious, national, and ethnic identities through a lens of Colonialism, examining the nature of linguistic imperialism through authors such as Ngugi Wa Thiong'o, James Joyce, Jamaica Kincaid, Claude McKay, Arundhati Roy, and J.M. Coetzee. The discussions were always very engaging, and the workload is balanced nicely throughout the semester. The workload comes out to about a book a week\/week-and-a-half; however, the fast-paced nature of the course allows for the examination of multiple different texts. This course opened my eyes to a whole new realm of discussions -- about European Colonialism and linguistics -- and I could not recommend this class more, whether you are an English major or just someone who is interested in literature.",
                "We talked extensively about problems with representation or authorship in world literature, yet I felt authors from certain cultures (such as Indigenous or East Asian) may not have been represented well in the syllabus. That said, the novels and other works chosen for this class were interesting not just by themselves but also in conjunction with each other. I would highly recommend this class for those interested in issues with postcolonial representation in literature and Prof. Cleary in particular, since his leadership in discussion shaped the lively and thoughtful conversations we had."
