                "This class taught critical thinking skills, research design, and how to read and discuss scientific papers. Lots of different topics were discussed and how molecular biology principles could be applied to understanding complex disease mechanisms.",
                "I learned about how advances in basic science get translated to medical treatments for patients. Additionally, I learned a lot about medical technologies and the ethical \/ economic considerations surrounding novel treatments.",
                "The most important skills developed in this class are reading and comprehending primary scientific literature (two to three articles a week), and being able to generate novel hypotheses and experimental designs in the form of the final paper assignment, a grant proposal, as well as questions on the weekly discussion problems and the two quizzes. The mini-review is also helpful for improving our scientific writing.\r\n\r\nThe content consisted of a hodgepodge of different subjects under the umbrella of basic and translational research. One major theme was RNA splicing, but there were also lectures that focused on viruses, telomeres, nucleotide repeat disorders, V(D)J recombination, and so on.",
                "This was a really great course! I learned a lot about how to read, interpret, and analyze scientific papers, and about how basic science research factors into medicine and medical innovations.",
                "I gained a lot of experience reading and discussing scientific papers and molecular methods of inquiry. I gained further insight into how basic scientific research can be translated into therapeutics used in the clinic.",
                "I learned about a variety of super fascinating topics  novel treatment methods for disorders caused by alternative splicing defects, telomere diseases, genomic instability, HPV and learned how to read scientific papers and synthesize the information they contain. Learning how to write both the mini-review and a comprehensive research proposal based on a literature search gave me incredibly valuable skills which I will definitely take with me to grad school."

            "comments": [
                "This class is amazing! The professors are very responsive to student feedback and seem to have a genuine interest in helping us explore new topics. I liked how the discussions were group-based and focused on conceptual understanding instead of memorization of protein names. This is a must-take for any MB&B major.",
                "Joan is a great professor and the TFs were both wonderful. The combination of Monday lecture and Wednesday discussion section really helped in reinforcing the material. Additionally, the final paper was a highly enjoyable project.",
                "I thought the design of the course was a major strength. It was easy to get into a rhythm of attending lecture, reading the papers, and then answering the questions in Wednesday discussion sections. The assignments are all very reasonable and our TAs were very helpful for clarifying any issues that came up.\r\n\r\nOne weakness, in my opinion, is a lack of coherence to the course. Obviously it's hard to do in a course like this where every week is a new topic, but I thought it would've been nice if there could've been slightly more building upon previously introduced ideas. By the end of the semester, I'd almost forgotten what we did in earlier weeks because we never revisited that content.",
                "The strengths of this course were that the lectures were engaging, there were a variety of different research topics due to the variety of professors that came as lecturers, and the assignments were created to help us be better engaged with the papers and research.",
                "I honestly can't come up with any weaknesses. The workload was perfect, the selection of topics resulted in a very broad yet interesting set of discussions, and the faculty\/TAs were incredibly engaging and supportive."

                "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in biochemistry, biology, or medicine. The course was set up in a way to facilitate student learning instead of stressing over exams. This is a gem of a course in the MB&B department.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student at Yale that has any interest in healthcare.",
                "Yes! You get to learn about a wide array of interesting topics and connect what your learned in all the other mbb courses",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It was a great opportunity to learn about a wide range of research topics and to meet \/ hear from a lot of different faculty members.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in scientific research with a special interest in translational research as well. It is a great opportunity to learn from Professor Steitz and all the guest lecturers, who are leaders in their respective fields of research.",
                "Absolutely! Every MB&B major, but particularly aspiring MD or MD\/PhD students, should take this class. It's a perfect amount of work, discussions with your fellow students are super fun (I never felt like anyone was free-loading or not participating), the TAs are super helpful and fun, and the topics discussed give you a great overview not just of the cutting edge of translational research, but also the foundational studies that took the field to where it is today. An incredible experience for future scientists or clinicians to have. 10\/10, great class.",
                "Yes, this was an amazing class to take with great professors who were really passionate about the topics."
