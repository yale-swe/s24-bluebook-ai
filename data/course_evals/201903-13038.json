    "This course was incredibly helpful at improving my writing! I learned how to write and edit five page essays quickly and efficiently. Having writing assignments due every other week contributed to this.",
    "I learned about how to read and write non-fiction, especially with respect to analyzing structure and style.",
    "I learned how to write more concisely and how to draw concepts from professional texts.",
    "I wouldn't say that I am walking away from this course as a professional author, but taking this course offered me the chance to practice my writing skills in a relaxed setting."

    "Workshopping essays was an amazing experience. Reading and critiquing student work was a great way for me to see the faults in my own writing, and identify strengths that I should include in my own pieces.",
    "It's a thorough and thoughtful course, and I enjoyed it greatly.",
    "It took a long time to get feedback and so I was reluctant to start revisions until I did get some sort of feedback.",
    "I think this course is pretty near perfect the way it is!"

   "comments": [
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course if you're interested in learning how to use non-fiction topics to advance and put forward your own opinions.",
    "Absolutely. Anyone who wants to improve there writing must take this course.",
    "I took this course as a junior, and it was by far the best class of my fall semester. I loved taking it as an older student; I felt like I had written enough papers in my time in college to benefit from writing on the more creative side, and to benefit from guidance in a type of writing I'm not as well-versed with. I also loved being able to give and receive feedback in a room of mostly younger students who are starting their college careers. Overall, I loved this course, and would absolutely recommend. This is a type of writing you probably won't have a chance to do elsewhere, if you're not on a journalistic track.",
    "I would recommend this course to students as a fundamentals of writing course. This should be taken either early on or as a first semester junior, so that either you start Yale by learning via mistakes or you learn how to receive feedback to maximize the class experience",
    "Yes, it was a fairly straightforward writing credit and the class had a laid-back environment.",
    "Yes! Prof Sexton is very laid back, kind, funny, and helpful. I always looked forward to coming to class and the readings never felt like homework because they were so engaging. Dont let the amount of essays deter you from taking Eng 120. Its actually nice to have the work spaced out throughout the semester and feels very manageable. You will also be thankful that you dont have to write a super long paper at the end of the semester. Absolutely take before you leave Yale!!",
    "Yes! Great WR and the workload is evenly distributed throughout the semester, so no huge paper as a final.",
    "Absolutely yes. This was my favorite course this semester by far. The class environment is light, playful and students are valued equally, largely thanks to Professor Sexton. Readings were manageable and highly engaging. The pieces we read and dissected provided tools for our own writing. My writing improved largely thanks to these tools. The essays have a general genre but topic choice is extremely open. You get to write about the things that have always been on your mind, that bother you, that excite you as well as new people and places you discover. You may even look at Yale through a different, more engaged lens throughout your semester in this class. Strongly recommend."
