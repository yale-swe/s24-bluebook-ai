Overall, the course has been helpful in helping me view public health from a different lens to consider justice, equity, and other principles",

However, a weakness of this class is the way break out rooms were conducted. Sometimes when we came back into the big class, the discussions of the break-out rooms will be repetitive.",
                "Overall the class was incredibly well put together. The readings were thoughtfully picked and there were rich discussions in class.",
                "Very interesting, very broad and very well organized. The readings were well chosen too.",
                "The topics chosen were dwelled well in-depth and gave a holistic viewpoint of ethics in global health. The course itself is already superb and having more group activities would make it even better.",
                "I really loved this course! I think that having weekly student leaders send out the reading guide with questions was a very effective way to structure the class and helped me better prepare for discussion. I do think that this class would benefit from a wider variety of types of assignments because I found myself slipping into similar arguments for multiple papers.",
                "Strengths: Professor Fallon is amazing, really fun discussions, clear feedback on written assignments. \r\nWeakness: I am unsure what my grade will be because we did not receive clear feedback on our participation or presentation grades throughout the semester. Maybe these grades could be posted next time?",
                "I think the course was well organized and moderated. I think it could have been helpful to have more assignments besides just the papers.",
                "Strengths: Having the course be discussion-based, instead, of lecture-based, was very helpful in exploring the concepts presented in weekly readings. Instead of Professor Fallon simply presenting her ideas, she allowed each of us to share our thoughts and questions. In this way, our discussions were not linear but covered many concepts to enrich our knowledge.\r\nWeaknesses: It would be nice to still have some visual resources to follow along as we discuss. But otherwise, I thought this course was wonderful!",
                "Strengths: I liked that it was a discussion course and I enjoyed hearing the perspectives of other people in the class. Content and readings were generally interesting. Class was well-structured and expectations were clear. Prof. Fallon was sensitive to the challenges of hosting a long-format discussion course on Zoom and gave us a break during the class as well as a varying check-in question for attendance. I liked the weekly student presentations on readings, though sometimes they substantially cut into discussion time if they were very long.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Zoom whiteboards and small groups ended up with repeated information\/pacing issues. I think there could be an effort to source more readings from voices that aren't generally promoted (ex: we looked at the ethics of \"service learning trips\" for medical students, often to low-resource areas, but we didn't get any accounts from those on the receiving end)."

                "Yes! For any student studying public health or medicine, then I would recommend this course. Even if students are not interested in health, there are still topics that are relevant, including the use of data and surveillance. This course is very important in understanding that there are important principles to consider to ensure that our actions, especially in times of global crisis, have positive and negative consequences for populations. These must be balanced to induce equitable responses and truly promote health.",
                "On the whole, yes. Like with any discussion course, your milage will vary depending on the dynamics of those in discussion. If people come with an open mind and a willingness to listen, I find these types of courses are more successful. With regards to this class specifically, it makes for a good first ethics course (it was mine!) as Professor Fallon spends a week on the basics to give everyone a foundation and shared vocabulary to work off of. From there, we moved on to specific case studies and health-related ethical dilemmas. The dilemmas chosen were interesting and discussion drew heavily from the readings. The papers gave students a lot of freedom to choose dilemmas and topics of interest to them specifically."
