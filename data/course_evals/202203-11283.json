                "I was able to improve my oral skills significantly, allowing me to communicate in Japanese effectively despite being a beginner in the language. I have learned various ways to format my sentences in order to focus on what subjects I want to emphasize the most, at what time actions were done, and how I wanted to address the person I was talking to. I believe this class has helped me think in a more native manner and learn to restructure my conversations not based on what they would be in English, and instead, how they would be said in a more natural manner in Japanese.",
                "I learned how valuable it was to become familiar with different languages. During my childhood, I was very big into Japanese comics and animation yet never invested the time into learning the language that gave me the content that I thrived with. However, taking this course illuminated not only the importance of Japanese to my own life, but learning other foreign languages. I was able to become proficient, at an elementary level, at communicating through writing, speech, and reading, in the Japanese language, a fact I'm very proud of.",

                "This class was very orally based, but as such, we had minimal instances in which large writing assignments would be given. I believe my oral skills therefore highly outweigh my written skills in Japanese. If I could improve this course, I would like for more writing prompts to be given, especially those written by hand and on paper. I feel that students would benefit most from essay writing in L1, as it gives them the opportunity to put to use kanjis and writing structures that would otherwise not be used as often in conversation.",
                "I loved the way that the teaching style went. The past semester, my class was very small, so I was able to practice with the same small classroom and become familiar with my peers in a way that wouldn't be possible in the future. The instructor was able to communicate the ways that Japanese should be spoken, the order of parts of sentences, and writing characters in a legible manner. However, I'd love it if in the future, the way we learned could be more in depth. Instead of learning the way that things were spoken, why order matters in the sentence, what parts to pay attention to, etcetera.",
                "I like the small class in this semester though I knew it will not happen again in the next semester.\r\nBut the course design are always good, I like the Japanese Clinic as well."

                "This course is highly interactive and one of the best I've taken at Yale. As a language learner, I find that the assignments and activities in class are all oriented to improve vocabulary, grammar, etc. In particular, it puts emphasis on easy communication. I find that this emphasis is especially important and significant.",
                "I'd only recommend this course to a student that's engaged with, or would like to engage in, Japanese culture. It's a courses that's very heavy on work so if a student isn't prepared to invest the appropriate amount of time necessary, it'd prove to be an overly difficult experience in Language.",
