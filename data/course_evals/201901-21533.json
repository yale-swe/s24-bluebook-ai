    "I learned a great deal about the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of behavior especially conditioning, learning and memory. This classed focused on recording action potentials with electrodes to understand phenomena from the level of ion channels to the level of changes in neural responses that underlie habituation.",
    "action potentials",
    "I understand the workings of action potentials and the brain as a whole so much better than I did before I came in. After human brain, I thought that I would never understand neuroscience but this class actually taught me what an action potential is and how it works.",
    "You learn how to first dissect a sheep brain and learn all the major parts of the brain (seriously cool!) You then dissect every part of the action potential and understand what happens when conditions change through a computer program. Then, you learn how action potentials are propagated in live specimen (earthworms) and also apply knowledge to crayfish tails as well.",
    "In this class I increased my knowledge of action potentials, the brain structure, and why behaviors occur."

   "comments": [
    "I cannot think of any weaknesses. The lectures were great as was the hands-on aspect.",
    "great",
    "The Monday lectures were usually a prep for lab, which was great because when we came in on Wednesday we knew exactly what we were doing, but sometimes the lectures were not as engaging as they were mostly procedural. Labs were always engaging and taught me something new.",
    "Strength: The professor and TF. Prof Donegan is exceptional in his notes and attention to students. I remember once that we were locked out the classroom at night for TF office hours and Prof Donegan personally came from home to unlock the door. That type of dedication is what you want the most from an instructor. Also, his powerpoint will come with notes so detailed, it's almost like you don't need to come to lecture (on Mondays) to understand them, though you just want to come to class because Donegan is a great person and instructor. On Wednesdays we would do hands-on lab stuff and I thought having the lecture on Monday was great way to calmly introduce us to the technique we would be doing. I liked the TF a lot too and his frequent office hours. I felt there was a lot of attention on the students (we were a less than 10 person class) and overall this was one of my favorite classes!",
    "Strengths: This class gives students hands on experience dissecting sheep brains, and measuring action potentials in worms and crayfish."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to someone especially interested in trying out basic techniques used in neuroscience. This course does a great job of teaching you neuroanatomy and understanding in depth how action potentials work.",
    "yes but its hard",
    "I do a lot of psych research in labs through Psychology 493 and 495, so I was looking for a methods class that would teach me something new. At first, I was worried because it seemed like everyone else in the class had taken very STEM-heavy neuro classes before and I had only taken the human brain. This didn't impede my ability to learn at all, though, and I really felt like I learned a lot about the brain from this class.",
    "This is a great class. It applies much of the information covered in the human brain in an engaging way. I would recommend this class to other students."
