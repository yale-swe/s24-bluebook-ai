I also learned how to determine the rough age and gender of a specimen by looking at certain bone features.",

            "comments": [
                "I think a major strength is that the majority of the class is devoted to lab time, which is basically independent time to touch and learn about the different structures of bones. I like that lectures are short and the instructor's roles are primarily to answer questions students had regarding a bone.",
                "I really loved the setup where all of class time was lab, which meant we got to go through the study guide and learn different parts of each bone. What we needed to know for each exam was extremely clear, both Professor Sargis and TA Hannah were super helpful, always walking around and offering help whenever we needed. I learned so much in this class in such a fun and positive atmosphere! Be prepared to study lots before each exam because it is memorization based.",
                "Honestly it was a great class. My only recommendation is maybe give more time for the final unit, but that is definitely out of the instructor's control.",
                "Strengths: its a good course if you put in the work for it. you learn what you can and the effort you put in matches the grade you get out\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "This course was super great in that it was very hands-on!!! Bones are the kind of thing that are really best learned by looking and touching, not hearing about them. Therefore it was super nice that 90% of class was just spent working with peers on identifying bones and features, but with plenty of guidance with from the prof and TA whenever we were stuck. The reverse classroom format was really great and worked really well with the material. The various units of the class were also broken up really well to keep each section digestible and cohesive, and it was really nice that there wasn't a cumulative exam in the end",
                "The class is entirely self-driven so it's up to you to stay on top of learning and studying for the exam. This was daunting for the first couple of weeks but made for really engaged learning -- I'll probably never forget what we learned. The expectations and structure of the course are crystal-clear (unlike pretty much every other Yale course I've every taken) so if you put the work in you're guaranteed to do well.",
                "This may be the best course I've ever taken, not just at Yale but from my entire academic career. There were really only strengths to this course. Professor Sargis would gives us a basic foundation of knowledge for each unit with an introductory lecture, and from then on, we just got spend class time looking at various specimens and becoming familiar with their names and features. It was really fun to work with real specimens, and I loved the hands-on structure of this class. I even enjoyed the tests, which could be challenging and stressful initially but could also be fun. Professor Sargis and Hannah were also great presences in class and were always checking in on us and available to answer questions during open labs.",
                "I like how the course had a flipped classroom format, where instead of the professor lecturing, the students were able to learn everything on our own. This made me more engaged with the course and allowed each of us to learn at our own pace. I don't think there is anything that needs to be improved.",
                "I think the course got easier once the class got more comfortable with eachother. I'm not sure if there is a way to facilitate that earlier on in the semester, but maybe having students work in pairs for a few of the earlier classes would be helpful for later in the course since the specimines often need to be shared and it's helpful to work through the study guide with another person. It would also be helpful if we could discuss answers we got wrong on assessments since usually the specimines were gone so we didn't get a chance to review what we missed."

                "Absolutely! One of my favorite courses at Yale!",
                "I would highly recommend for anyone looking to go into medicine. The class is relaxed, but still intellectually stimulating and enjoyable.",
                "Absolutely. Low-stress course but you learn a lot of interesting things. Anyone interested in physical anthropology should definitely take it.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn about the human body. Its straight forward and you will never have to stress about it because you know exactly what is expected of you. It is also extremely fun and engaging.",
                "Absolutely! If you have any interest in biology, anatomy, anthropology, or just really like hands-on learning and/or touching bones, this is the perfect class for you!",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who can get in. It's a super fun, interesting, and cool course, and the vibes of the classroom are super chill and collaborative. The course doesn't require a ton of work but you still learn a lot.",
                "Absolutely! When I first learned about the class, it seemed like it would be the antithesis of everything I enjoy about school -- for each unit, you get a list of bones and features to learn, a bunch of bones and a few weeks to memorise everything. Rinse and repeat four times. It ended up being the best class I've taken at Yale. It's relaxed, independent and forces you to really engage with what you're learning. If you're a bio major/pre-med/at all related in the human body, you will love this class, even if you think you won't.",
                "Absolutely! This is the best course I've taken at Yale and perhaps my entire academic career. It's a lot of memorization, but it can be quite fun to work with the specimens and to learn to identify them and their features.",
                "I would totally recommend this course to another student. It has a low workload and it's also super fun to get to learn about all the bones in the body and see real specimens.",
                "Absolutely if you're interested. You do have to read the textbook or otherwise study outside of class in order to get the most out of the course. If you go into class (pretty much every class is a lab with bones all out on the table) without having reviewed anything you will have to learn it slowly on the spot and likely will feel a little awkard or lost. I found that just a few hours outside of class during/before each unit (there are only 4 units) was very very very helpful. Drawing the bones and labeling them was especially helpful for getting oriented and knowing what to look for. It's a really good hands-on course and unlike anything else I have taken!"
