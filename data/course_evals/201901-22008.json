    "Strengths: the lectures each week from practitioners of the traditions we were studying were amazing. The readings were well chosen \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes it felt like the class discussions had no direction and ended up in debates on minutiae of the readings that had nothing to do with course questions",
    "Miroslav Volf is a wonderman and the lectures by Matthew Croasmun were incredible.",
    "This course was wonderful at introducing us to different philosophies. However, the limitation was that we examined principles in a bit of a silo. It would have been interesting to debate and compare\/contrast philosophies more."

    "Yes absolutely! This class is seriously trying to answer the question of your lifes meaning, and while it will probably take more than a semester to figure out the answer, spending this time is an excellent use of a semester.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! This course was so helpful and interesting. It really was an important way to question our own principles and values and think about a framework to make decisions in life."
