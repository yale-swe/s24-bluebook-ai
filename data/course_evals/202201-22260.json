The readings that we had for the class were also incredibly cool and relevant to the work that we were doing. We learned how to do monotype printing, collograph, copper plate etching, silkscreen printing, mokuhanga woodblock printing, and katagami stenciling, just to name a few skills that we touched on. Professor Cornejo is an incredibly fun professor to work with and he really wants us to explore what intrigues us as artists, so we definitely have plenty of opportunity to grow and learn about not only the subject matter but ourselves and our work as well.",

                "My only beef with the course is that we do not use Canvas. We used a Google Drive folder to submit all our work throughout the semester. I think that it's cool that we can see each other's works with the folder, but I think that that could be achieved through a Canvas discussion post. It also made it pretty difficult to figure out when we were supposed to submit things and what our deadlines were because we didn't have notifications through Canvas mentioning that a reading response was due for that Sunday, especially because it was kind of flexible in terms of our schedule when we had readings to do. \r\nHowever, I think that on the flipside that that can be an incredibly enjoyable aspect of this course. Since there wasn't this kind of pressure with the structure of the Canvas page, deadlines were admittedly flexible, which is incredibly valued with art classes since there is often a pretty decent amount of time that goes into just the whole process of creation. Professor Cornejo is incredibly mindful of that process and wants the class to be structured in a way that is radical and works well for the students under his care.",

                "The course was great overall. There were a few too many topics covered which made it hard to take in all the information. The demos were essential and informative but sometimes took up a lot of time."

                "Yes!",
                "ABSOLUTELY!!! I've been telling so many people about what an amazing professor Oscar Cornejo is. The readings that we did were incredibly radical and his feedback for our reading responses were incredibly encouraging. He was very excited to see us learn and grow as artists and wanted to do everything he could to structure the class to encourage that process of development and creation. I had an incredibly enjoyable time in this class and I wish that more people had the chance to take it because I was absolutely obsessed with my experience in it. However, I will admit that this is a class that you should go into with at least some rudimentary experience of art. I think that students will get a lot more out of the course if they go in with some background in art and design because I think that this course expands upon some really foundational principles of art and design. Going in as someone who has never really drawn before might make this class way less fun to experience.",
                "Yes! But this is a very you-get-out-what-you-put-in class. It is conceivable that you could come out of this class without developing many skills in printmaking if you don't go to any of the out of class printshop hours. If you put in the time though, it can be insanely cool.",
                "Yes I would recommend. The class is a great overview of many printmaking processes, and has intersting readings throughout the semester. I truly enjoyed the flexibilty and freedom we're afforded while learning as well.",
                "Yes! A great prinkmaking overview with a good history and thoughtful structure",
