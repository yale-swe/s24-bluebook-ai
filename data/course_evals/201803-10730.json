   "comments": [
    "The course is very organized and very well taught. It stresses constant practice and review of the language, which really helps me to learn.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the setup of this course. I believe it went at a healthy pace, was very engaging in class, and the homework and workload was appropriate.",
    "More tips for how to memorize characters",
    "I think the strength in this course is that most of the class is centered around speaking and listening practice. While this is helpful, I think it would also be a good idea to review more of the homework in class and to incorporate more character practice in class.",
    "This course is very rigorous in forcing you to learn Chinese but does so very well. The small class size is probably the most effective thing about this class. It forces you to speak Chinese everyday which was super helpful. The amount of homework, quizzes, and tests was hard but made for a great way of learning the language.",
    "More focus on learning culture.",
    "I think the strengths of this course are definitely the professors. I don't really think there are any weaknesses. At least, none that I encountered."

    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Chinese is such an interesting language and the manner in which it is taught here at Yale was very helpful and enjoyable.",
    "Yes, but need to be committed to it outside of class.",
    "I would recommend this course because I think while learning a new language is very difficult, this class does an excellent job of teaching Mandarin to new students. This class moves extremely quickly, and I learned more than I could have ever expected.",
    "I would. It's a tough class but worth the work. You pick up the language very quickly.",
    "Yes if they are interested in chinese. No if they just want to fufil lang requirement.",
    "Yes, because its a very good way to get into the groove of learning chinese."
