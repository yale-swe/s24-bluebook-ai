                "I found the course quite boring. Lab reports were tedious and not challenging. It seemed like there was more focus on lab etiquette than learning.",
                "I think the lab did a good job covering the practical side of theory that is typically learned in CHEM161 (I took CHEM163 2 years before taking this class after a change of major so my memory may not be the most accurate) and also would have done a good job introducing basic lab technique regarding certain equipment that not everyone may have had the chance to interact with in high school. As an upperclassman taking the lab late due to a change of major, however, I noticed that the summer pacing may have been a bit fast for some underclassmen who were taking gen chem at the same time, and/or did not have a very lab-oriented AP Chemistry class in high school. Basically the theoretical knowledge may not be quite up to date with what we're doing in lab due to pacing; I'm not sure if this is different during the school year (I would expect it would be so?) but if you've already taken AP Chem and/or it was very lab-oriented it won't be a problem.",
                "The strength of the course was that Dr. Cooper offered both in-person and remote sections and both were done well. He is very fair.",
                "Strength was Dr. Cooper -- would recommend getting him as a professor. He was really fair (not Easy, but fair) and patient in terms of giving us the best learning experience possible under the circumstances. Really liked that he did the actual lab experiment on Zoom -- so we had ample opportunity to ask questions. Summer session course was a HUGE amount of work though. 2 labs a week is a lot. The pre- and post- lab quizzes were very difficult and often felt unnecessarily poorly worded in the sense that if the question was more clearly written they might've been more understandable.",
                "Experiments in person were much better than online. The class was so compressed we skipped an experiment.",
                "Too much focus on irrelevant details and formatting in lab reports",
                "was a good course overall",
                "I think that the material is presented in an understandable format and was explained really well by Dr. Cooper. I do think the homework questions are a lot easier than the exam questions, and I think it could be helpful to have more exam style questions on the homework. Additionally, I think there was too much time spent on the simple concepts and the complex concepts like Lewis structures were done very quickly.",
                "Remote learning makes it difficult to truly get a hands on experience",
                "The instructor (Dr. Cooper) was very kind, funny, detailed, and clear on instructions. However, the instructions/exemplars on how the lab reports should be written was a bit unclear, and students often were deducted points based on expectations that were nowhere mentioned on the rubric."

                "Well, it's a required course for many majors, so I don't think you have too much of a choice...that being said, if your high school chemistry classes never gave you any lab experience, I do in fact think this is a pretty good intro",
                "I would recommend this course to a student if they need it for their major or premed.",
                "I would only recommend this course for students that need to take the class. No point in taking on the extra workload if not for major/pre-med requirements. However, if someone has a relatively easy course schedule otherwise and wants to see the science they learn be put into practice, this course really helps students apply the knowledge they learn in lecture and provides a lot more practice for Midterm/Final exam reviews for the lecture course.",
                "If you have to take this course, all things considered, it's really not bad with Dr. Cooper. It will be very time-intensive and heavy workload due to the short summer semester, but Dr. Cooper is a good teacher and the labs themselves are ok.  Pre and Post lab quizzes are often time consuming, difficult, and poorly woorded though.",
                "If you are thinking of taking this course with the lecture course over the summer, definitely reconsider. Between the two, it is FAR too much work in such a limited time frame. Other than that, definitely try to take the lab with Dr. Cooper because I've heard that other lab profs can be really unreasonable and difficult, and I enjoyed Dr. Cooper's lab a lot.",
