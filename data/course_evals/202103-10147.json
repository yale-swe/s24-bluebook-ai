                "I don't think that the way the exams are set up is demonstrating the understanding of the students knowledge. It is more of a regurgitation of all of the random facts that were in the lecture. There were very few questions on the exam that were showing how you could apply it to problems.",
                "Heavy memorization; engaging lectures",
                "Strengths: appreciated engaging lecture format and breaks in between\r\nWeaknesses: really heavily weighted exams",
                "Course periods are way too long (one hour 15 minutes) to stay focused. But the instructor did give breaks which was great to re-focus.",
                "Strengths: Professor Near is a great lecturer. Passionate and quick-paced while always checking for understanding. I learned a lot in this class and despite not being overly interested in E&EB) found myself really enjoying the course content. I liked that there were no high-stakes assignments so I could just focus on understanding and enjoying the course material.\r\nWeaknesses: The assignments are fair and not stressful, though I wish that there was more guidance on the second half of the class. I found myself unsure about the final because there are no practice problems or p'sets to intermittently check for understanding. Perhaps a short weekly problem set that checks for understanding could be helpful.",
                "This course was very interesting but the format of testing was quite difficult. The midterm and final are worth the majority of the class grade, yet we were given no exposure to the sort of questions we were going to see on these tests. This resulted in many of us in the class getting bad grades on the midterm (we have not received the grade for the final yet), but I assume the same holds true for the final. I think a practice test would help prevent this.",
                "The course is well designed for learning and was very engaging.",
                "Strengths: Really interesting content! I love living things in general and I find learning about how they're related and their features fascinating. Lots of cool pictures and \"news you can use\" or just cool facts. Also builds an intuition for how ecosystems work and in general what life is around you.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I know some of my friends found this course a total turn-off if you are not interested in the above. Personally, I felt that it covered a really broad range of concepts in a very shallow way. I wish we went deeper into the molecular techniques of some of their analysis. It sometimes felt like lectures were all over the place in terms of the types of topics you choose or the types of organisms we chose to focus on. A more consistent style and way of introducing concepts or clades would be great. Also, I wish the sections were a review of class materials instead of overviews of papers that will never be discussed/tested again.",
                "Course is based in memorization. Obvious that Near is very passionate but this course falls short to others in the bio sequence because it just tests memorization rather than any application of topics that would require deeper thinking.",
                "Professor Near is awesome and organizes and teaches the class really well. Main weakness is just that we could use more guidance in understanding the key takeaways about the papers we read in section.",
                "The course was well-organized and Professor Near made lectures very engaging, even though I previously didn't have much interest in evolutionary biology. The course allowed me to better appreciate all the little things that had to happen and come together to create the world we live in now. However, one thing that could be improved is that I wish we were given a practice exam prior to going into exams. The first exam was a bit unexpected to me.",
                "Weakness is you need to know a lot of random information.",
                "Strengths: Professor Near is a wonderful lecturer. It is really clear that he cares a lot about his students and is truly passionate about the class material. The lectures were clear, engaging, and well-organized. The papers chosen for discussion selections were relevant to the class material. Ed discussion boards were extremely helpful to ask questions and get clarification on the class material. PSETs and writing assignments were useful and helped me to understand important concepts. All assignments seemed to be fairly graded. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think the exams properly tested our understanding of the class material. Both exams relied on pure memorization and made it feel like I was just mindlessly regurgitating information directly off the lecture slides. Before taking the exams, I felt like I understood the material well and could apply the information properly, but the exams didn't really test that. The exams just checked to see if you could recite things from lecture. The exams are fair and you know what to expect, but I felt more pressure to memorize the words on the slides than to really understand the content. Memorizing phylogenetic trees seemed a bit pointless. The writing assignments were useful, but I felt like it would've helped more to understand the lecture contents if we had PSETs instead.",
                "The material was approachable, however the course was heavily based on memorization, rather than problem solving/critical thinking, like the other intro bio courses.",
                "Strengths: 2 exams rather than one. enrichment. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: discussion section felt pretty pointless. it would have been a better use of time to review concepts from class rather than scientific papers. I know reading scientific papers is a skill we should have, but unless you went to enrichment, there wasn't much provision for reviewing the concepts from class because we didn't have the weekly quizzes. \r\n\r\nalso it was wholly inconsiderate how they handled the whole final exam situation. for reference, the deans told us on Saturday night that exams would be moved online and some professors would make their exams optional. organic chemistry, physics, and other exams were made optional. not this one. not only was it not optional, it wasn't open note. and I know that some students had an unfair advantage because the exam was structured in a way that made it very easy to cheat (we all weren't taking it at the same time and you were able to see all the correct answers after taking the exam, so theoretically you could have sent a friend who was taking the exam later pictures of the questions and answers. also students fully could have had their notes open while taking the exam.) additionally, we were allowed to take the exam anytime between the 21st and the 23rd, even though the 23rd is technically after the due date for all exams. it was really stressful trying to decide whether I should be studying or packing because of the silence that we received from the teaching staff on what would happen about exams. it would have been more considerate if at least they told us when they would make a decision by. the whole situation was handled poorly, and I don't see why the exam couldn't have been optional. \r\n\r\nthe slides were so text heavy. it was hard to understand what we needed to know and what we didn't from lectures due to the lack of detailed lecture study guides like we had in bio 103. \r\n\r\nthe memorization. it doesn't seem like he'll be changing this course due to how adamant he is that it's sooo important, but it really isn't. memorizing the entire tree of life is pointless. my life before and after this class are the same. I did not gain anything from having to know the tree of life. but I know there's no point in me saying this because he's so set on making everyone learn the tree of life.\r\n\r\ned discussion: deleting people's questions and responding sassily to our comments did not make for an enjoyable learning environment. I should not be worried about censorship when I ask a question on ed.",
                "I thought the course was pretty good",
                "There was a lot of material to go through, but I think Professor Near did a very good job conveying the information. The slides were very informative and was very helpful for studying purposes.",
                "strengths: great organization (in terms of course and Canvas), lectures and slides were very interesting and informative. good professor.\r\nweaknesses: I felt writing assignments were not necessary -- they were a lot of work and did not add much to the course itself.",
                "Professor Near covered a lot of topics, and while it was a lot to remember, I feel that all of it was very relevant and interesting. Im studying evolutionary biology, so this was my favorite of the BIOL sequence, but I feel that it would be very important for premeds too. I disliked that grading did not rotate to different TFs - my TF seemed like a harder grader than some that my friends had, and this is alleviated in other courses by randomizing who grades different assignments.",
                "I think the grading is really nitpicky and I don't think the memorization style is conducive to learning actual skills that can be applied to being a scientist or doctor. Also, I'm sure a lot of people cheated on the final because it was unproctored and premeds have no ethics. I'm interested in research and I think the intro bio sequence is kind of a mess because the focus is on testing and not research, which is more important to me. Everyone gets a 100% on the written projects, which means that people who actually put a lot of time and effort in don't get rewarded. Also, I feel like the exams are less skill-based and more focused on remembering everything the prof said in lecture. That being said, the lectures are very interesting.",
                "Strengths: discussion section. The papers for this class were genuinely interesting and relatively easy to read, and I found section surprisingly helpful in unpacking them. \r\nWeaknesses: Dr. Near was not the greatest lecturer. His slides were messy and confusing and sometimes had nothing to do with what he said out loud. In addition, the class and exams were mostly based on memorization. I just made Quizlets with 200 words per exam and did fine. This is not learning.",
                "strengths: professor near. this man was 110% the reason why i even bothered to go to lecture. he is extremely engaging and passionate about what he does, and it's almost impossible NOT to listen to him.\r\nweaknesses: the exams were memorization-heavy, but i guess that's how it is with fundamental courses. i can't help but feel like there's a better way of testing knowledge in order to ensure students remember it after the exam, though",

                "I thought the strengths were the professor's high level of engagement in the material, which made it fun to learn. However, the weaknesses were in the exams which were pure memorization and did not build upon conceptual understanding.",
                "Professor was very engaging and the problem sets at the beginning of the course were very helpful for the exams. The writing assignments during the second half of the course were not interesting or helpful at all.",

Problem sets are approachable and exams are pretty reasonable (though they require ample preparation and memorization). Writing assignments and discussion sections seemed a bit off topic and tedious sometimes but were overall not too bad.",
                "Professor Near is an excellent lecturer, and the course contained the perfect blend of p-sets, short essays, and tests; I never felt bored with only type of assignment because our knowledge was assessed in multiple ways.",
                "Interesting and pretty well taught. Not a ton of practice or review sessions.",
                "All in all, I thought it was very well balanced. It placed more of an emphasis on learning than grades, and I was able to truly absorb knowledge while still excelling.",
                "Strengths: Prof Near! Amazing professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes Near goes through the slides very quickly so it is difficult to understand exactly what he wants you to know but go to enrichment!! Dr. Loreng is very helpful.",
                "I liked that we were given breaks midway through each lecture. The lectures were however extremely long.",
                "The readings for section for this course are very interesting and engaging. However, the pure memorization necessary for the midterm and final of this course do not give an accurate assessment of a student's engagement with the course. This course could be improved by changing the test formats from memorization to more of an assessment about an individual's understanding of a concept presented in the lecture.",
                "The lectures were extremely well delivered and very interesting. The PSETS and writing assignment were helpful in consolidating our understanding of the concepts. The exams were fair. One weakness was that some of the papers were either too technical or too broad as to not be that engaging."

                "I would recommend this course to another student if they like/are good at memorization. It was very vocab and concept based rather than application based.",
                "If you are interested in the topics or if it is required for your major/pre-health track, yes.",
                "If you are an ecology student or need this for your major, then yes. Its definitely the most approachable class in the bio sequence, but it would be a better use of your time to take something in the EEB department if thats your interest.",
                "No, I would not recommend this course to another student. but I assume you're not taking this because you want to but for a major requirement or pre-med.",
                "Yes, for premed",
                "Yes, I think this course is a great introduction course for the evolutionary biology major. I wish that this course was a full semester, it would give the class more time to dive into the interesting material.",
                "yes, probably one of the best portions of the intro bio sequence. great professor and cool material.",
                "Best course out of the BIOL intro sequence.",
                "Unless you have to take this avoid the intro bio sequence at all costs. Not good for people who actually want to learn about biology, completely destroyed by morally-barren premeds.",
                "No. If they don't have to take it, they shouldn't. I thought one point of the bio sequence was kind of a sales pitch for each bio major. If so, I am definitely not buying whatever Near is selling, even though I was considering EEB before the course.",
                "yes!! i recommend this course even if you aren't a bio or premed major. actually, if you enjoy anthropology or history, this might be the course for you! prof. near taught the course in a manner that reminds me of storytelling - the story of life, perhaps.",
                "only if they are required to take for the premed course",
                "Yes if it is required.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in evolutionary biology. If you are not and looking for a less involved biology course, I would not.",
                "Yes if you are pre med",
                "This is a great introduction to E&EB  would recommend to anyone interested in the major.",
                "Yes, especially if it is a prerequisite, but also it was a very interesting experience learning about the subject matter.",
                "Yes",
                "It's not a gut but is somewhat interesting. Not the worst premed or bio prereq course, but a more focused bio class may be more interesting for someone looking to fill the science distributional requirement!",
                "Definitely! This was my favorite course in the intro bio sequenceperhaps because it's so different from the others. If you're MCDB or pre-med, this might be your only change to explore evolution and ecology. Professor Near is a terrific professor; the lectures are engaging, and since a workload's quite light, this course tends to be interesting rather than stressful.",
                "Yes, the new perspective you gain of life and bio from this class is quite useful",
                "Not unless required for major or graduate school",
                "Of course! Its general knowledge of our origin and I think each of us ought to learn it.",
                "Yes! Honestly Bio 104 is the best part of the bio sequence. Although at times it felt a bit useless to memorize how many species are in monotremes, eutherians, metatherians, another part of me felt that it was nicer that most concepts were more memorization-based, especially compared to Bio 103 Genetics. I just felt that for the first exam, there was so much content tested and we were given such little time. Exam 2 slightly makes up for that because you're given twice the amount of time for a same length exam.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another Yale student. It was very interesting and Prof Near did a great job at keeping lectures engaging.",
                "If you dont need to take this class I probably wouldnt recommend it, but its required for most people taking it. Its not that bad.",
                "Yes for students interested in evolution and biological sciences.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in ecology and evolutionary biology or anyone who needs to fulfill this prereq.",
                "Yes."
