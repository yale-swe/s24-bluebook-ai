                "The course covered many current events and modern sociopolitical issues, so there was a topic of discussion for everyone. Class topics were very interesting and highly relevant. Flipped classroom format of watching materials on the topic then dedicating class to spoken discussions was very effective in creating an interactive seminar, giving students many opportunities to engage with class content and practice spoken German. Homework written pieces were also effective for practicing grammar topics and written German in general, and were enjoyable to prepare as they left much room for students to express their personal views on complex and relevant issues.\r\nTo even further improve this course, a bit more written materials could be integrated to further practice reading German, and maybe a few more student-led discussions or short presentations. Also, to balance out the workload, the two written essays could be done earlier so the second essay doesn't clash with the final project.",
                "Using 13 Fragen was a good way to orient the course and present material. Watching the 13 Fragen youtube videos was easier for me than doing readings for homework."
