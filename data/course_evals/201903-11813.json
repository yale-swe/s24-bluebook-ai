    "By taking this course, I developed basic language skills that allow me to have simple conversations in Spanish, and obtained a knowledge of simple vocabulary as well. I also received some insights into Spanish culture.",
    "I learned basic reading, writing and speaking skills in Spanish.",
    "Basic introduction to spanish. Just what the syllabus says.",

   "comments": [
    "Strength: Lots of practice, and frequent exams to test your knowledge. Practice every night with nightly homework.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Homework can be repetitive or just \"busy work\" at times.",
    "It is very interactive and makes learning Spanish relatively easy. To improve, the course could have more emphasis on oral practice.",
    "more listening practice would have been nice.",
    "I thought that this course moved extremely fast and mainly those with previous Spanish knowledge (it was fairly clear who had taken it in high school and I know a couple of the kids had parents who spoke Spanish) could keep up without putting 2+ hours in every week day and a lot more on the weekend. I did learn a lot of Spanish but I really, really had to grind to stay on top of it.",
    "I liked the way that this course was structured. I enjoyed the variation in the lessons and I also liked the presentations and occasional kahoots.",
    "The major strength of this course is the complete immersion in the language for five days a week, which makes learning the language all the more engaging. Additionally, the frequent use of the language in class was beneficial, and the short novel was a great way to review everything we had learned. The main weakness was the lack of writing. There were very few writing activities, which I feel would be useful in developing skills if they were implemented more.",
    "This course had well-organized classroom activities and the online homework website was useful in practicing grammar and vocabulary. I think it could benefit from more conversational activities in class.",
    "Variety of content. Interesting material.\r\n\r\nNeeds more focus on speaking\/listening, and less content. It is too fast paced.",
    "I think the course would benefit from a slower pace with more focus on vocabulary practice in class."

    "I think that if you are looking to learn a language well, this course would be great for you. If you are looking to fulfill your language requirement, there are much easier courses.",
    "Yes. I personally thought that this course was structured in a way that help facilitate learning well.",
    "Yes! It was a great introduction to the language and convinced me to continue taking the next levels of Spanish.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who wants to learn Spanish (or needs a foreign language credit).",
    "Yes, but it is difficult, don't think it's not. Very hard to get an A, and you better hope you get a good teacher. Most of them are.",
    "I would recommend any Spanish class taught by Maripaz."
