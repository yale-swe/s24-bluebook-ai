                "This course's strengths were its teaching and the material covered. The problem sets were also very helpful for learning the material.",
                "Strengths: excellent lecture notes provided, clarity of explanations by the professor, topics well organized and well ordered throughout the semester (smooth transition from one topic to another)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the workload was very light at the beginning of the semester and near the end there were more problem sets close together as well as our final paper. I would have appreciated if the workload would have been distributed more equally.",

                "The teaching was great! Assignment and project deadlines felt slightly ad-hoc and rushed.",
                "The course was excellent, yet challenging. First off, the professor is very kind and treats the material with very great care. The course was well-organized and carefully structured, though it seemed more to be a lecture than a seminar at times (though this was not bad in and of itself--I very much liked this format). The workload was moderate and fair: there were five problem sets over the course of the semester, which I thought worked well for the course; a reading response; and a final paper. \r\n\r\nHowever, I wish that there was a textbook for this class. I also wish we did more examples in class or at the least, had additional examples uploaded to Canvas that students could go over and build intuition before doing the problem sets. In addition, I wish that answer keys were uploaded for the problem sets.",

                "This is a well-organized and well-taught course. The lectures were somewhat difficult to follow, but I think this is mostly due to COVID virtual learning."

There are a lot of basic topics that are covered in mathematical logic that we very briefly went over in order to understand modal logic and it would be helpful for students to have a deeper understanding of these topics prior to taking this class.",

                "Yes, the course material is fascinating and the professor is great. However, I would recommend that students take this course after taking another lower-level logic course at Yale. That isn't required, I don't think, but will help with building intuition and foundation for some of the concepts we cover in modal logic.",
