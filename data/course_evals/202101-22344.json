I think this course would be interesting and helpful for Navy options, especially given how closely the Navy and USMC work together. With the case studies, it is possible to do individual reading on the side into the Navy's role and learn how we can better support Marines (for example, I was able to choose for my presentation the landings at Tarawa in the Pacific Theatre of WWII, which was part of a much larger operation involving close coordination with the Navy). I also learned a lot from Captain May's feedback, which she gives for each position paper, and her insights in class."

                "Strengths - I think that Captain May was very knowledgeable about the material and clear in presenting it. She was also very clear about the expectations for assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were times especially at the middle of the semester when we werent sure which readings to do because of deviations from the syllabus so clarification on that would be helpful.",
                "Captain May was very organized, gave great feedback on all assignments, and had interesting and helpful insights on the material we were covering in class. It was a privilege to learn from her. The class itself was very organized, the reading material was all relevant and helpful, and I learned a lot from every assignment; I thought the workload was relatively light most weeks compared to most Yale classes, which allowed time to cover everything carefully and then do additional reading on areas of interest brought up from the material. \r\n\r\nA suggestion I may have would be to post the slides at the end of the semester so that we have access to them for later. While most professors post earlier than the end of term, I understand there are advantages to not posting them before or immediately after each class (ie, I took better notes since I knew I would have to refer to the notes and couldn't go back to the slide deck later). Frankly, I think it was more productive to not have the slide deck at the time, but now that the class is over, it would be great to have the slides for reference later."

                "I absolutely would recommend, and frankly I would tentatively suggest that Navy-options consider taking the course as well (for reasons discussed in a prior response). I understand it does not count for Yale credit and everyone has a heavy workload as it is, but this class has lighter preparation time than most Yale classes but still covers a solid amount of ground. I would say it's absolutely well-worth it to squeeze into a schedule as a 5th, 6th, or 7th class. I left detailed comments for prior questionssee the paragraph about knowledge/skills learned and the paragraph about strengths/weaknesseswhich can provide more specifics. For general Yale students, I would say consider it if you already have some basic understanding of how the military is organized and speak to the instructor about this point; for my part, the NROTC unit permitted me to borrow the Marine Officer's Guide, which I looked through before starting the class (unnecessary, but definitely helpful!)"
