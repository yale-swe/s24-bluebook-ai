                "Strengths: great research experience and great way to synthesize knowledge accumulated over four years in the econ major",
                "I really appreciated the recap on methods and writing tips provided through the 491 lectures. However, I think 491/492 in their current forms fall short of their goal of providing students with experience conducting independent economics research. Academic research is far from an individualistic undertaking. Peer groups are a good way to drive this message but the consensus is that these existed only in theory. There should be stronger incentives for engaging with your peer groups, potentially by factoring it into the final grade. I also think there should be more formal opportunities for students to share their work with others throughout the essay-writing process (for example lunches or presentations before spring break). This would increase the quality of the final works produced and also encourage students to have a tangible product at least a month before the deadline.\r\n\r\nGiven that the senior essay is a pretty large undertaking for most, I think it deserves to be celebrated. Other departments host dedicated events for students to showcase their work. I think following suit would be a great way to end the year and increase underclassmen's exposure to the senior essay.  As it stands, their only points of reference are the works nominated for prizes on the website and this can be intimidating. I understand that this year 32 students submitted a senior essay and only 9 of them were women. I find this alarming and think allowing prospective writers to engage with the full sample of writers would reduce their anxiety about the process and possibly increase the number of people who choose to write one. \r\n\r\nI don't mean to sound harsh. I really appreciate all the support provided by my advisor, the instructor and the TA and think this was a very meaningful experience. However, I think certain improvements would greatly benefit the students and their learning.",
                "I recommend that there be a suggested first draft deadline for the essay, so that students have a formal progress checkpoint on their essay before its final deadline.",
                "The strengths of the course was that I was given a lot of flexibility and responsibility to pursue a topic of interest to me and that I could leverage the resources around me to best execute my report. The weakness was that it was quite difficult to meet with my writing group and to establish a regular schedule of deadlines to meet.",
                "For the most part, it's very self-directed so this depends on who you choose as your advisor. I recommend picking an advisor who cares a lot about supporting undergraduate research. This is really important. I can understand the motivation to want to pick the flashiest, most famous professor in your field, but if you don't know them at all/don't know how they've worked with undergraduates in the past, it can be really challenging. I picked a professor who I had previously worked with, and it made a big difference. Not all majors allow you to choose your own advisor, so I think it's definitely a strength of the econ thesis that you get to choose your advisor (and take advantage of that)! I think now that registration is moved a bit earlier (to the semester before), students should be encouraged to pick an advisor/reach out at the end of their junior year and start using some of the summer to look at ideas for research.",
                "The success of the economics thesis is extremely dependent on choosing an interesting topic and working with a good mentor. I was very lucky to have worked with an amazing professor and researched a novel topic during my time in the course. One thing that may help students in the future is having a database that would give students more information on how different professors and mentors interact with senior undergraduates pursuing a thesis (ie. hands off? hands on? expectations?)."

                "I would recommend writing a thesis to students if they have a strong econometrics background and if they have a topic they are passionate about to write a thesis on. If students choose to write a thesis, I would also recommend doing this two-semester version rather than on the one-semester one, because this gives them ample time to expore different potential essay topics, find a dataset, and clean the dataset.",
                "I would certainly recommend this project to someone who would like to pursue a topic of interest to them and to learn the format and writing process of an economics published paper. You learn research skills, writing skills, reading skills, and how to condense enormous amounts of information into a short paper that contributes to the field of economics literature.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in doing original research. It's a really exciting opportunity, and it will challenge you a lot, but it's one of the best gifts of Yaleto work with some of the world's best researchers on your own research! It's not a literature review, which makes econ different from other majors! For a lot of other majors, the senior \"thesis\" is just write a 20-page lit review. Econ is not like this. Econ wants you to produce new knowledgebut yes, that's a tough thing to do. It takes a lot of work, and sometimes you'll try something only to realize at the last minute that you missed something and it won't work out. Failure is a part of the process. That being said, it's an amazing feeling to finish your thesis and feel like you have a final piece of work that you can be really proud of in the end. I highly recommend it IF you are interested in doing something like this. That being said, if you want a spring semester where you can go to Feb Club and be a Feb Club all star and have a very social (not very work intensive) senior year, maybe think about the tradeoff. The thesis will take a lot of time, and I do know people who don't necessarily get a straight A. If you're writing a 2-semester thesis, you're getting 2 of those grades, so you want to make sure you're willing to put in the time and and hours to do well. \r\n\r\nUltimately, if you're at all interested in taking advantage of Yale to its fullest, I'd say yes, do the 2-semester thesis. The reason why profs at Yale (for a large part) are profs at Yale/so famous is because they are world-class researchers and they produce the best research out here. It really is an amazing opportunity for us as undergraduates to be able to have them advise us on our research!  It's by no means easy, and it'll take many long nights (and some missed parties and other social events), but in the end, I don't regret it at all.",
                "Yes! Writing a senior thesis in economics is a great way to cap off the economics major, and is extremely rewarding when submitted. I think there is a beauty in creating a final product that showcase the concepts students learn in the economics major."
