                "I believe there were many strengths to this course! First, Professor Klemann is awesome. She makes class extremely engaging and provides a fun atmosphere to learn. Second, the guest speakers were all so interesting and adds a change to class throughout the semester. Third, all of her feedback was to the point and I believe that is the best way to improve your writing. No weaknesses!",

                "The assignments are both manageable and varied in content, Heather provides excellent feedback, class discussion is always lively, and the guest speakers were a great addition.",
                "Professor Klemann is the greatest strength of this course. Her innovative curriculum gives students access to her wealth of personal experiences, and provides students with mentorship from her vast professional network. Her inspiring guest speakers serve as role models to her students, providing them with exposure to other industries and experiences, which is so much greater than any one person could provide on their own.",
                "The course was titled writing about finance, but in reality there was near to no financial focus on finance with the exception of the guest speaker interviews.",
                "Strengths: Really interesting guest speakers, amazing feedback on your writing, a variety of fun writing assignments\r\nWeaknesses: None that I could think of!",
                "The course was very engaging and time spent in the seminar always flew by. As far as weaknesses go, I wasnt always able to tell how each week of the semester built upon each other; the different units didnt tie together as much as I would have liked."

                "Absolutely",
                "Yes- interesting and diverse course content and always very good, thoughtful feedback from Professor when assignments are graded.",

You'll learn a lot and, if you put in effort for the different assignments, it's not super challenging to do well. Also, take this class for Prof. Klemann!! She's one of the best professors I've had at Yale, and she will definitely make you a better writer.",
