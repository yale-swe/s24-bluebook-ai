Second, the guest speakers were all so interesting and adds a change to class throughout the semester. Third, all of her feedback was to the point and I believe that is the best way to improve your writing. No weaknesses!",

Her innovative curriculum gives students access to her wealth of personal experiences, and provides students with mentorship from her vast professional network. Her inspiring guest speakers serve as role models to her students, providing them with exposure to other industries and experiences, which is so much greater than any one person could provide on their own.",

You'll learn a lot and, if you put in effort for the different assignments, it's not super challenging to do well. Also, take this class for Prof. Klemann!! She's one of the best professors I've had at Yale, and she will definitely make you a better writer.",
