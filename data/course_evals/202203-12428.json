                "The problem sets were too hard and unclear all the time",
                "I think this course is perfect!!!",
                "This class is pretty abysmal all around - from the instruction to the materials to the assignments to the exams. It could be improved by finding a teacher who has studied Linear Models themselves and/or has experience teaching the subject. I cannot think of a strength of this class.",
                "Harry is a kind, funny, and likable professor. Unfortunately, that was the only strength.\r\n\r\nThe class was extremely disorganized. There was often little connection between exams, homework assignments, and lectures. It was hard to prepare for exams as study materials were limited. Exams often felt like they were testing general mathematical ability rather than course content. The homeworks were some of the hardest psets I have had at Yale, and lecture did not adequately prepare us to complete them. Office hours were not at accessible times (many were on the day the homework was due, which is not great). The course Canvas page was hard to navigate. Poor communication about exam dates, when homeworks would be released, etc. Sometimes homework was not graded until a month after the due date.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting material, and heavily theoretical\r\nWeaknesses: The psets are very difficult, and it was hard to predict what could be on the midterm/final since a lot of the lectures covered proofs",
                "The professor is very humorous and patient at the same time. He explains things extrordinarily well. The course itself isn't so hard (in fact, I personally think it's easier than 241 or 242).",
                "Moved too fast",
                "Better lecture recordings would be great, but beyond that I think Linear Models is a must take for all Stats and even broadly applied math.",
                "I thought that lectures were a bit hard to follow at times, but I think the course covers many important topics and the theory behind them.",
                "Everything is great with the best class and instructor, I really enjoy this course.",
                "Professor is very helpful but the course is a little bit difficult",
                "Would appreciate quicker turnaround on PSET grading!",
                "very basic and important topics in linear models covered\r\nmathematical proofs given for almost all important theorems/conclusions\r\nmore homework would be better for practice",
                "Professor harry was a huge strength. he was a great lecturer with the right mix of structure and flow to his lectures. He took a pragmatic approach to teaching and I really enjoyed it.",
                "It is very theoretical and math/proof based. I wish there had been a bit more usage of real models/datasets and R.",
                "Harry was very kind and approachable. He always took the time in lecture to address students' questions. I appreciated when we were given simple geometric proofs to clarify the more elaborate proofs we discussed. I just wish we were only given these rather than spending the time discussing more complex ways to prove the same exact thing. Also, some more guidance and information on lecture slides would have been useful when reviewing class content.",
                "The course was very confusing and disorganized, but I'm hopeful that after a year teaching it Harry will have a better idea of what he wants the curriculum to be. The biggest positive was Harry, who was maybe the nicest professor I've ever had though.",
                "The course didnt feel very structured and sometimes it felt like things werent connected at all",
                "Professor was very easygoing and the pace of the class was very manageable",
                "Overall really enjoyed the class, and Prof Harry was super engaging, understanding, and helpful. The class had a very nice learning to stress ratio as the things were paced well and every topic covered was explained clearly and in detail. The main improvement that I think would be valuable is a little more consistency in difficulty/abstractness of assignments as I felt most of the homework was reasonable but a few problems throughout the class were very abstract (or seemingly distinct from topics covered in lessons) and caused some level of overreliance on office hours.",
                "Strengths of the course are that it is a comprehensive overview of linear models. Students are expected to become proficient in applying linear algebra toward solving statistical problems. The course is quite rigorous and challenges students to go beyond their comfort zone with mathematics. Many of the tricks introduced for transforming random variables to fit a given distribution are helpful. The course also challenges students to prove statements about linear models, which helps to deepen understanding. Conversely, many people find that the course does not spend adequate time explaining each new concept or generalizing proof techniques so that students can solve a greater range of proofs.",
                "Fun course that covered some interesting topics! Overall the course felt a little bit disorganized (psets were not on a very regular schedule, did not always finish the slides that were written for a given day, etc) but the material was interesting.",
                "Harry is a great lecturer and I very much like his slides, but a lot of the homework material has no relation to the content taught in the course. The midterm wasn't similar to what he taught in class",
                "Its a wonderful course",
                "Course homework was very useful! Lectures were great. The exams were fair.\r\n\r\nCould be more proof based / incorporate more linear algebra. Grading took forever for assignments. I had no idea how I was doing until the last week.\r\n\r\nOffice hours just hand out answers which makes it so you have to go to keep up with course, as everybody will get a 100%."

                "Yes I would recommend to anyone quantitatively inclined. If you're planning on going into industry, this class is great for preparing for quant interviews as it literally builds up linear regression and frequentist analyses from the bottom up. Think 242 but more rigorous. If taught by Harry, do not be fooled! This is definitely not a gut, and I think it was only a gut under Brinda. A good amount of work with hard psets, but well worth in the end.",
                "Only if you are interested in learning the theory behind linear models, which I think is important for those that will end up using these statistical models in the future. Professor Zhou is very nice and cares a lot about his students' learning. Granted, some of the problem sets were quite challenging and required office hours, but it was helpful in hindsight to learn from those problems. Given that the content in this class provides the foundations for some important areas of statistics, consider taking this class.",

Coming into this class, I was excited to learn some more advanced methods (Lasso, mixed effects, etc) and how to implement them. We spent very little time on these subjects and mainly focused on the mathematical reasoning behind basic linear models. All in all, I learned quite a bit from this class, but not of what I was expecting.",
                "I wouldn't recommend the class in its current form. It was really disorganized and hard to follow, although maybe it can improve",
