As part of this, I learned how to practice daily in a way that keeps my voice healthy and ready for performance throughout the semester.

                "Easy and nice to learn voice lessons",
                "I think building in practice time would be more helpful for scheduling when to practice (ie give us a slot each week at the music school)",
                "Strengths: you put in what you get out, voice lessons are an easy credit if thats what you're looking for. I was hoping for serious instruction and was disappointed. \r\nWeaknesses: voice lessons are incredibly disorganized. I didn't know we had to learn three songs (I was told two) until a week or two before final jury. Further, we weren't given a jury date until a week before, and we were not provided time to rehearse with the pianist beforehand (we had to find our own accompanist if we wanted to practice). My voice teacher was also not great, and tried to get me to use unhealthy vocal techniques (belting higher than I could, told me to \"sing from my throat\"). Prof. Baty was hard to reach, but very nice.",
                "The lessons program is really nice and helped me improve my playing a lot this semester! I wish that the professors at YSM for certain instruments were less limited in being able to teach only graduate studentsI think the undergraduate music department could benefit from more access to the school of music in general and especially the professors.",
                "Its great",
                "No complaints!",
                "The chance to work one on one with Professor Sharp is a truly wonderful opportunity.",
                "I think the flexibility of this course is where its value lies. I was able to work with my private teacher on whatever was musically pertinent without the need to prepare for a final jury or any external motivators other than a love for music.",
                "Weekly one-on-one lessons at the Yale School of Music are a phenomenal, unique experience that Yale has to offer. No immediate weaknesses come to mind.",
                "I think this course is a great way to allow students to take music lessons for free. The only thing I might change is giving the option to increase the number of lessons as 10 can occasionally feel a bit restrictive.",
                "the class being 1-on-1 is both a strength and weakness, since more engagement with the professor comes with less engagement with peers that have similar interests; i'd advocate for events\/studio recitals with the other students from the same teacher (or it can be with different teachers and\/or instruments)",
                "Strengths: one-on-one instruction with a lovely graduate student, continuous check in, accomodated me even as someone who had very little experience with classical singing.\r\nWeaknesses: would have loved more robust feedback at the conclusion of the course... I was happy to have passed but it would've been nice to have some things to reflect on\/work on so that I can continue to grow in the next semester."

                "If you want to train your voice and learn a lot, TAKE THIS COURSE! Everyone I engaged with was very welcoming and friendly. Besides, it's not the trickiest credit if you're at all familiar with singing, so it's a nice way to supplement a busy term.",
