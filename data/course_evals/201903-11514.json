   "comments": [
    "I developed a different way of thinking about games and life in general. I understand now the difficulty of defining a concept that seems so common and frequently used in the English language. I also learned how to write a philosophy paper.",
    "How to think about a topic that I didn't previously spend a lot of time contemplating in a non-scientific way and explore aspects of games that I hadn't previously considered. Also got to study topics such as game theory that I had previously seen in economics in a philosophical context and learn how to write a philosophy paper.",
    "How to write a philosophy paper, how to analyze a philosophy text and discuss philosophy.",
    "I gained a much deeper understanding of the notion of games as well as the ability to think critically about various aspects of the world and my life.",
    "I learned how to write a philosophy paper.",
    "I learned how to properly reflect on things I have read and discussed with others. I also learned how to write interesting arguments with proper defenses.",
    "In taking this course, I was able to passionately discuss what it means for something to be a game. Games are much more than they may appear at first glance and influence many aspects of our lives. Our class learned about how we define terms and what qualities go into doing so."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: discussion format where students' opinions valued equally and built upon by other students and the professor, very interesting content, passionate professor. Weaknesses: would have liked more discussion about life as a game, as we only briefly touched on this in a rather depressing way. Would have also been nice to receive more feedback on our writing.",
    "Strengths - small class size and close discussion about many interesting topics, professor was receptive to what the class wanted to discuss and changed topics and readings accordingly, made class engaging through games that illustrated the topics in the philosophy of games course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - grade is largely dependent on the two papers and professor doesn't read drafts so it can be hard to get feedback unless you come up with very specific questions.",
    "Few if any weaknesses. The course was interesting and required almost no previous knowledge except knowing some common games. Discussions were lead well by the instructor and critical discourse was encouraged.",
    "I really liked that it was discussion based, as this was where I learned the most. However, I would have liked a little more practice writing philosophy papers under less pressure than our midterm and final papers. Something that lands between the regular reading responses and the two large papers would be helpful in developing this skill.",
    "I think the discussion-based way that this course ran was really effective. It was awesome to be able to hear my peers' points in addition to my teacher's.",
    "(Covered in #10)",
    "The course was highly engaging and interesting with active discussion in a small class. The topics we discussed were also very fun to talk and debate about. We explore many different elements of games that I had not considered before.",
    "Some strengths are: passionate and engaging discussions, high-level thinking without extreme pressure to fulfill a standard knowledge requirement, openness to any and all topics regarding games, playfulness, etc. This class has the benefit of being engaging and beneficial without extra added on stress. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Since the class is dictated mostly by the students level of engagement or types of statements made in the discussion, sometimes the discussions are not as engaging as you may want it to be."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this is a fascinating course that all students should take if they can. It is one of those classes I believe I will look back on and always remember just because of how cool and different it was.",
    "Yes,",
    "Definitely would recommend. The course is very interesting and great professor.",
    "Absolutely. This was an incredibly interesting course based on a subject that I found really fascinating. It was really fun studying games on such a deep level.",
    "Yes! I think this course is super interesting, especially for those who enjoy board games, card games, and sports.",
    "I would recommend this course to most other students, but perhaps not ones with little patience, or ones that gain insight through reading volumes of carefully put-together arguments. For those with little patience, this course (and I would imagine most other philosophy courses) can feel quite pedantic and annoying at times; and for the other kind that loves long readings, this class may not be enjoyable because the assignments are usually relatively short and are meant to give an introduction to the topic without going into too much detail. But to the 'average' student, this class would be fun and interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who is remotely interested in any type of game and is willing to discuss and debate different social and gameplay-related aspects of such activity.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to anybody who plays games, whether that be sports, videogames, card games, mind games, or even in a relationship. I say anyone who plays games, but everybody plays a game at some point, I would recommend this class to anyone. I suggest that they be passionate about learning however because what truly makes or breaks a class is how invested the students are into the material."
