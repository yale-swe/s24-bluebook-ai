                "I think the readings were awesome and of reasonable length, the weekly response question was a great system, and Peter is incredibly smart and thoughtful in the way he responds to basically anything!  So much was awesome about this course - one thing that unfortunately had a big impact on my experience was the relative lack of classroom discussion.  Much of class was Peter talking and when someone would ask a question Peter would respond at length - very thoughtfully and helpfully, but I think as a seminar it should have involved more group discussion.  \r\n\r\nI also think we should not have been allowed to have our computers out, as the majority of the class were on their computers during discussions.",
                "None.",
                "This was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Wicks designed the course very thoughtfully - the readings and topics were all very engaging, and he offered a lot of insight during seminars. I appreciated how we spent a significant portion in small groups and broke up the time. The class discussions were always very interesting, and I also liked that we were given just the right amount of reading to meaningfully engage without being overwhelmed. The assignments were also interesting and I learned alot from them. The only area for improvement would perhaps be to have a bit more structure to the whole-group part of class discussions, as conversation sometimes trailed off and maybe with some more specific questions we could stay more engaged.",
                "Strengths: interesting material! Students get freedom to write what interests them for papers\r\nWeaknesses: I was looking forward to more class time Dedicated to student discussions",
                "Strengths: Really engaging interesting materials. Different perspectives on persuasion, and thoughtful discussions. \r\nWeaknesses: Maybe just the name of the course. Should be called \"The Philosophy of Persuasion\" since we didn't really look at psychological studies, and mainly focused on philosophical wisdom on argument, civility and persuasion.",
                "Could be more practical versus theoretical",

                "Yes. It wasn't quite what I expected but I learned a lot of interesting information that I don't think I would've known about otherwise. Some of the readings (mostly philosophy) were a bit denser / more difficult to get through than I would've liked but otherwise the readings were enjoyable.",
                "no. Professor Wicks lays out a great syllabus and then does not give it any room to breathe, to be engaged with, or to care about.",
                "Absolutely. Primarily, I think it gives students a special opportunity to reflect on some of the most important topics of our day, including the health of our democracy, the way we interact with one another, and the ethics of influence and persuasion. The readings, class discussions, and assignments all offer alot of insight on this, to the point where I genuinely enjoyed writing papers for this class. Professor Wicks is very thoughtful, knowledgeable, and supportive, and I really enjoyed learning from him and the carefulness with which he facilitated the course.",
                "It was interesting if youre interested in persuasion and influence in politics mostly. Its less about the psychology part of what happens in your brain and more about how it applies, especially in politics.",
                "Yes very interesting",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, I definitely would, especially if you're interested in learning more about the nuances of persuasion and argument and how it varies based on power dynamic, politics, social structure/order, and generally from person to person."
