Readings covered feminist literature, colonialism, consumerism in the 18th\/19th century, contemporary scholarship, slave narratives, and more. Despite the wide range of readings, the class was well organized and intentional in how readings were presented and paired with each other. We were able to form many complex conversations together about each of these themes\/areas as a small group.",
                "I learned so much about the literature of the long 18th century and read many novels I had no prior experience with (e.g. Oroonoko, The Woman of Colour, etc.). I especially appreciated our unit on indigenous feminism and early European feminism. Even though I am fairly involved with the present-day feminist movement, our readings showed me that there is still so much gender history I have yet to learn. I also gained more knowledge about the transatlantic slave trade and the influence of the slave trade on modern Black art and research.",

                "This course had a really great syllabus and supplementary readings.",
                "Some strengths include the reading list, Prof. Campbell and they way she leads discussion, and the feedback you get from Prof. Campbell (and other students) throughout the course. Though the language in some of the literature is difficult to read, the themes are interesting and important. I sometimes felt burdened by the amount of reading, especially in this semester of online classes, but I always got something out of each reading and class meeting.",
                "Strengths: Professor Campbell is a very supportive, knowledgeable, and clear instructor. She allows us to lead the discussion to topics that we are interested in and always offers interesting insights to enhance our discussion. The literature that we read is very diverse -- it spans multiple centuries, continents, and genres. This diversity is one of the best parts of the class because each week's reading would always bring something new. My classmates are another strength. Everyone was very engaged and contributed ideas that I had not considered before. Overall, a fantastic course with interesting material and even more interesting discussions!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!"

If you are interested in the Black Atlantic at all, English major or not, consider taking this class!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to others, especially those interested in social justice, history, and older literature. I learned so much about the origins of racist thought in the West and about non-Western systems of gender. I also was able to read some interesting texts that I had no prior exposure to, such as The Woman of Colour.",
                "Yes of course!! Professor Campbell is absolutely fantastic. She is so sweet, supportive, and helpful in improving my writing. She provides very detailed feedback on every essay and gives opportunities for revision, which I really appreciate. The course itself is also so interesting. It covers a ton of authors who are not typically introduced in the core classes. Taking this course greatly expanded my knowledge of English literature and made me more aware of non-white, non-male authors and their brilliant publications. A must-take for all English majors!",
                "Absolutely yes!  The material is interesting and full of pieces that are not often included in long 18th century literature, and you will gain or maintain experience in discussing race, gender, and many other themes in depth. Prof Campbell is also wonderful, cares a lot about her students, and gives very helpful feedback on writing."
