This also pushed my language skills, as I was pushed to articulate complex analytical thoughts in Spanish. I also learned a fair bit of theory about the creation of borders and the process of globalization, and how they appear in real world examples (both historically and contemporarily).",
                "I learned about the history and present of bordering practices as well as some interesting geography theory.",
                "I learned more about the processes of globalization and racial capitalism that have both promoted and been promoted by the fronterizacin of the world as well as the xenophobia we continue to see today. Taking this class in Spanish added a necessary layer of understanding and accessibility that a course of its nature in English could not have accomplished.",
                "I learned a lot more about how to reflect in Spanish.",
                "I improved my Spanish oral and writing skills through class discussions and weekly journal assignments. Additionally, I learned a lot about global migratory patterns and how our history affects current border placements + the way we think about globalization."

                "Strengths: The professor is the best. The course has a great structure, engaging projects, and the readings were manageable and very interesting. If you put in effort you will get a good grade. \r\n\r\nWeakness: None",
                "Strengths: Prof. Najera is very passionate and engaging. The topics and readings were well thought out. The projects are really interesting and the multimodal approach teaches you to think in a new way.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings are quite long and difficult to comprehend/complex. Also, on the projects/major assignments, there is sometimes a lack of clear guidance/expectations.",
                "Strengths: in-class discussions were rigorous and challenging, and I always felt like I walked out of that class with some deeper intellectual insight. The frameworks of analysis that Profesora Njera incorporates are also helpful for understanding what we are studying on a deeper, more complex level, and I feel like they actually improved my overall analytical skills, which I can now apply to other classes. // Weaknesses: The descriptions of our major projects were very ambiguous and it was hard to figure out what was actually expected of me, since Prof. Njera only wrote the abstract learning goals, not actual instructions. Also, this class definitely has a heavy workload. While the day-to-day homework was usually manageable, the projects were very involved and given in very short periods of time. They compounded with the weekly work, causing me to have to devote a lot of time and stress to this class.",
                "Strengths: The material is very interesting, which motivates a lot of fruitful discussions in class. The professor is also quick to return graded work with plenty of feedback. Weaknesses: The classroom environment sometimes felt tense, and the professor would sometimes express frustration and chastise us rather than encourage us when we were not participating enough. This and other comments and practices had the effect that it felt like she didn't trust/respect us as much as other professors I've had.",
                "Material was not particularly engaging, Professor was a stickler for rules but not for grammar.",
                "Strengths: SUPER interesting topics, a wide variety of media used (you're not just reading 100 pages of antiquated language every week), and creative projects that included analyzing poetry, redesigning art, and creating video art. The lack of a long midterm and final essay was a breath of fresh air. \r\nWeaknesses: At times, it may be clear that Prof Najera has one answer in mind, so students might be more hesitant to answer, and class discussions might get somewhat quiet.",
                "Strengths: Professor Najera obviously had a lot of passion for the course, and the materials and themes were very interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes expectations felt extremely arbitrary, guidelines for final project were close to nothing, sometimes class environment felt hostile",
                "Strengths: There was a great variety in the class assignments. Work ranged from writing in our journals to watching documentaries to creating oral projects. Overall, the class material was very interesting and we focused on new subjects every week! The topics were well-structured and fell in line with the assignments. Additionally, Professor Najera did a great job of facilitating class discussions. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Towards the end of the class, work really piled up! But, after those final assignments you're done with the course."

                "Yes. If you are okay with taking on a bit of a workload, you definitely will learn a lot and gain really valuable analytical skills which are applicable to a lot of social sciences and humanities. I definitely feel like my understanding of bordering and globalization has deepened a lot due to this class. My Spanish speaking skills are about the same conversationally, but I definitely improved in my ability to articulate analysis, especially through writing (but also in class discussions).",
                "Sure, if they are interested in borders, their history, and their impacts. There are also ample opportunities to practice speaking, listening, reading, and writing in Spanish.",
                "YES. A lot of students found issues with this course, and I believe a large part of that is because discussions were at times too structured, and if you expressed an incorrect analysis of a text or video, you felt the silence that followed, but I feel as though my vocabulary regarding la globalizacin, la fronterizacin, la eugenesia, y el racismo en Mxico, Guinea Ecuatorial y Colombia increased tenfold, and the sources we were provided were fascinating (and not your usual, at times boring, antiquated readings). It's true that you have to be willing/ready to speak up in class discussions if you want to get participation points, but I am a naturally anxious person, and I found that if I set aside 2 hours to complete the readings before each class and wrote down notes beforehand, I was excited to speak up and share my interpretations. Especially if you're majoring in ER&M or a related field like History or American studies, this course is super helpful and interesting.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. I think there are other just as interesting Spanish courses where the expectations feel much clearer and the environment is warmer.",
                "Yes! The class taught me so much about intellectual concepts and current global situations that I had never learned about before. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in taking it!"
