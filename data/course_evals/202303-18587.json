                "I thought a strength of the course was having the structure of the different exercises since this was the first building-scale project for us. The pace of the exercises and pin-ups felt manageable too. \r\n\r\nFor me, a weakness was the way desk crits were held. I think it would have been more helpful for our TFs to meet with us separately from the professors, so that we did not have to wait so long to talk to someone. I also thought the idea of splitting into 2 groups made sense at first, but in the end it meant we were really only getting feedback from one TF when the TFs had different skill sets and I think I would have benefitted from both.",
                "Program could be introduced earlier in the semester; site plan\/collaborative quality w cohort was limited (but understandably difficult to coordinate)",
                "Professors and TAs are very engaged, ensuring students get the feedback they need to progress.\r\n\r\nWorkload is very high but that should be expected....",
                "Strengths: two professors and two TAs were really beneficial since all students got equal attention and feedback. The assignments and deliverables were clear from the handout packets for each step of the project. I thought the entire design process was quite unique and exciting, i.e. starting from the Albers piece, creating a figure, doubling the figure, then thinking about circulation etc. That broke the whole process of design down in a fun, manageable, and memorable way. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wonder if having more information about the next design step in the current design step would have made the entire process smoother. For example, I think the deliverables for \"program\" were a larger jump from the previous \"aggregate\" than any of the earlier assignments because we had not been thinking about what was actually going on in the building until that point. As an aspiring designer, that experience was quite fun but felt a little detached from reality. Maybe encouraging students to think more about the building program earlier on would have helped some of us create more successful projects.",
                "Teaching excellent, TAs so available, well structured in terms of breadth and number of assignments",
                "Strengths were the teaching staff and the feedback that was given each step of the process. The number of deliverables and assignments often felt unachievable for undergraduate students and I think that could use some improvement."
