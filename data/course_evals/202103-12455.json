Overall, it's a good survey of the different forms of inequality, and through this class, I learned that inequality is very multi-dimensional and there's a lot more to inequality than what you learn about through media/other conversations. Also, we covered some important economic models that discuss inequality (e.g., how do you model inequality in the labor market when you have different skill levels, automation, etc.). Lastly, you learn how to read and discuss economics research. One of the assignments that was very useful was a group project where you work with 2-3 other people to read a paper and present it to the rest of the class. Overall, the focus partially on understanding the models, but the main focus of the project is to practice reading economics literature, synthesizing the findings, and being able to communicate it in an effective way."

Group presentations were also graded harshly with no actual feedback provided (just the number grade).",
                "Strength: has the potential to be a very interesting topic. read some of Chetty's work in class so if you have been following Chetty's work and found it interesting, this means this class has that potential (except it fails to live up to it)\r\nWeakness: Everything - pset, the lack of delivery on what the class expectations are, lectures",

                "Assigning the problem sets earlier and making them due at specific time points rather than all together.",
                "Really cool material. Lectures can be hard to follow, and ideas loosely strung together.",
                "Strengths: The material was all super interesting and lots of little gems and big picture insights to be gained from engaging with the material. It raised important questions at the outset about why inequality is bad as answers to that question can potentially shape what types of inequality we find more problematic and thus determine what is most pressing to study. The course introduced me to a variety of study designs which try to measure inequality as well as theoretical frameworks to think about inequality, both of which helped expose me to different approaches which economists take to answer difficult questions, a valuable skill for someone such as myself trying to get greater exposure to such economic methods. Also, having each individuals present on papers really helped me practice reading papers and made me dive into one topic and see just how interesting it was at a level I might not have if I hadn't had to present on it.\r\nWeaknesses: Due to the grading of the course (4 psets which you only need to do 3 of and one presentation) it was easy to disengage either by not attending class or by not really spending as much time thinking about the material outside of class. This is a shame since it seemed to me that when I did really dive into the material more (either by asking questions in lecture or by the PSET questions which asked about specific results) I learned so much more. Also this grading scheme meant that we had no feedback until the last day of classes, which is pretty not ideal for knowing how you are doing. Also I think that lectures could have been more engaging, as it often felt like a sort of basic routine of running through the results of a paper in a pretty dry way. The topics are so interesting that we could (and occasionally did) have important and interesting conversations, but the dryness of lecture took away from this and made it easier to disengage.",
                "strengths: interesting content \r\nweaknesses: organization/format (see below)",
                "Professor Attanasio is an asset to the class because of his amazing work in this field. However, overall, this class was disappointing to me. I felt like i could've gotten the same knowledge from just reading the papers. It avoided all relation to political, racial, classist, and societal significance of actual levels of inequality and only focused on trends in the literature. Also, the student presentations were just a confusing way to learn the important material at times. I would've much preferred to hear from the professor on these important papers and had student presentations on interesting projects they chose.",
                "In terms of strengths, I think the class does a good job covering economics in depth. What I mean is that Professor Attanasio tries to go into the economic models while also covering the empirical findings. I feel like he did a good job of balancing the math plus the findings. Sometimes, in other classes, professors will breeze over the math and jump straight to the findings, which I feel like is a lost opportunity. That being said, towards the second half of the semester, Professor Attanasio started explaining the models in even more depth, which I felt was very useful. The group project is also a great opportunity to meet new friends and practice reading/understanding economics research. That being said, because there was such unequal participation (some people never showed up to class), I feel like some people got stuck with partners who were just completely uninformed about what was going on. There were some people who presented who I had never seen before in the class, and I feel like that was unfair to their group partners who did attend (and got to see how the presentations should go).\r\n\r\nAlso Rosie was a great TA and very helpful with the assignments!\r\n\r\nThe main thing I would change is the flow of the assignments. All the problem sets are due at the end of the semester before reading week, and many of them were released in the 2nd half of the semester. I think the problem sets should be due at intervals throughout the semester. It also would encourage more students to meet and work together during the semester which can be very enjoyable. Plus, having feedback about grades and areas to improve would be useful.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think the class should be taught at a later time slot, if possible. It was taught at 9am, and because of this, there were only maybe 7-9 students who consistently showed up to class while there were some students who didn't attend at all. It made the class seem very unequal in terms of participation (ironic for a class of inequality), but there's technically not a participation component of our grades. Perhaps a participation component of the grade also would encourage more people to attend. Also, the fact that lecture slides are so thorough meant that a lot of students felt like they could skip and just read the slides. There was little incentive for them to come; I think most of the students who came were genuinely interested in the topic and learning.",
                "Professor Attanasio definitely is very knowledgeable. The course feels like a lecture and I wish there was a bit more discussion/seminar style, but could be a personal preference."

                "If you want an extremely chill Econ senior seminar that has the lowest workload imaginable and is still Somewhat interesting then yes. I found it interesting that all the psets were due at the end of the semester. For most of us, that meant scrambling to do them at the end but that also meant literally no work for the class all semester barring the presentation (that was extremely easy btw). I found the psets kinda fun to do because you learn a lot of the material that way. I found the material itself fascinating but the lectures were not too engaging. You may prefer that though since its a 9 am",
                "If you are HIGHLY self-motivated then yes. Professor Attanasio is brilliant and one of the leaders in this field. If you ignore the problem set due dates (all due on the last day of the term, just do them the week they are assigned) and pay attention during lecture, you could get a lot out of it. Some of the most interesting material in senior econ class.",
                "Maybe. If you are interested in the material and/or think you will be able to self-motivate to engage with the material beyond graded assignments then definitely. The concern is just that if this course is taught in a similar way to how it was done this year then if you aren't so motivated it will be easy to check-out of the course (and possible stop coming to lecture at all) and put off basically all the work until the end of the semester. If you do that you won't get very much out of the course at all, and I think if you do this and don't get very much out of the course probably you would be better served by a different course.",
                "Probably not, unless the format changes substantially. The content is interesting and the instructor is an extraordinarily talented economist. The actual problem sets were fun too, if a bit vague at times (perhaps intentionally though). The major issue for me is format. The three problem sets due by the end of the semester sounds like a great  setup during shopping period, but students (myself included) inevitably procrastinate, creating a mad dash at the end of the semester. I think having the problem sets be due at set points throughout the semester would pace people's learning better and create a more organic learning culture (e.g. study groups) among students. Even if the professor insists on having the due-by-the-end-of-the-semester policy remain in place, I would strongly advise allowing students to receive grades or at least feedback on problem sets once they submit them, rather than having all feedback on them after they are all due, even if the student submits it early. For one, this would incent students to actually submit the problem sets earlier/throughout the semester. For another, students have a right to know at least a substantial portion of their grade by the Yale College midterm deadline, as is stated in the instructor handbook.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to come across too punitive -- it generally must be hard to know what a desirable  course format is given what I'm sure is a capricious student body. But I have seen similar feedback for the course's format  in its past iteration, and I really think these changes would allow students to profit more fully from the instructor's incredible wealth of knowledge and the course's pressing, interesting content.",
                "Overall, not really. I think it didn't really cover the important relevance of how bad inequality currently is and why it matters. You really could get about as much out of this class by just reading the papers included. Professor Attanasio is brilliant and kind, but the class felt fairly pointless.",
                "If you are genuinely interested in learning about inequality in the United States, yes. If this class is still at 9am, and you feel like you are willing to get up and go for the sake of learning, yes take the class. It's worth it. Professor Attanasio is a good professor who does care about teaching, and if you show up, you'll get something out of the class. \r\n\r\nIf you want an easy econ class or if you don't particularly care about the topic, I'd hesitate to tell you to take it. I know some people who were less interested ended up never showing up. At the end of the semester, they were the ones who had to think about Cr/Ding the class because they were so unsure if they'd end up with a bad grade.",
                "Yes, it's not a bad courseload at all and actually does survey some great papers. Professor Attanasio knows many of these economists/economics papers personally and it's interesting to read your professor's own work in class!"
