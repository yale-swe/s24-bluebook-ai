                "In addition to learning a variety of perspectives on key economic phenomena in American history, I learned how to read and digest economic-historical academic writing. Specifically, I became more adept in recognizing weaknesses in economic research and forming my own opinion after reading various authors' stances.",
                "basic understanding of American economic history",

Answering these questions may involve using certain econometric techniques, employing economic models, addressing endogenous variables and finding causal explanations, and the selection of papers (which spanned the antebellum period to the present in America) employed a variety of these methods.",

                "The field of economic history was certainly a mystery before this class; while this class is structured essentially entirely around a set of published papers focused on quite a number of subjects in economic history, you get an appreciation of the kinds of methods and analyses economic historians have turned to or innovated in order to test and answer fundamental questions in American history through an economics lens.",

I found out what worked and what did not work when trying to review and learn new material. In terms of the course, I developed a richer understanding about America's economic history and the influences which allowed it to become what it is today.",

                "The class is fairly broad in terms of the topics it tackles, so there is a good chance you may have a topic or two which you find particularly interesting. This makes the essays and midterms easier since you have the ability to optimize for what you see as the most interesting topics. One of the weaknesses of the class is that it is mostly focused on the late 19th century and early\/mid 20th century, so if this is not the most interesting period of American history to you this class might not be ideal.",
                "Professor Eli is one of the best professors I've had at Yale. Really cares about the wellbeing and success of the students. Really laid-back lecture that encourages learning in a low-stake environment. Great Class.",
                "The course covered many great research papers that introduced new analysis techniques. A weakness was the class wasn't very engaging, but the virtual format made that particular detail difficult.",
                "Maybe add discussion sections. Would help give extra practice with the material",
                "I think the main strength of this course was the teacher. I had never been a history person in the past, but Prof Eli truly made it engaging in fun. I think the main fault is that there wasn't much student engagement. I feel if we had weekly discussion sections, that would be a lot more helpful to learning. Additionally, we only had two assignments, a midterm, and a final. Because of this, it was hard to receive feedback about how we were doing in the course and if we fully grasped the readings. In the first half of the semester, there were also quite a bit of readings that were quite long.",
                "Strengths include organized lectures and readings.",
                "Strengths: Shari is an amazing and empathetic professor who genuinely tries to engage and accommodate students. Exams were all very fair",
                "Nice and reasonable professor and teaching staff. Material itself is a little dry. Perhaps a general review of concepts like exogeneity\/endogeneity or a basic overview of statistical methods would be helpful before delving into the papers.",
                "This course was completely centered on the economic academic papers and varying interpretations of different historical development in American economic history. I personally did not find this very engaging, because it was very hard to keep track of the various topics.",
                "Long readings but interesting",
                "Professor was great, understanding and interesting.",
                "The greatest strength of this course was definitely the professor (see later section). Also, I really appreciated the writing\/historical aspect of the course, which made it stand out from the other economics classes I have taken. At the beginning of the course, the workload was pretty unevenly distributed (we would have up to three readings for one class and then none for a week), but after mid-semester feedback, we switched to a one reading per class system, which was a major improvement. I felt that class expectations and exams were very fair, and it was very possible to do well in the class if you put in the effort.",
                "great content, but the pace was fast. lot's of readings are expected",
                "This class was very dry, and the material focused on a series of economic papers rather than actual economic history. I was initially very excited to take this course, but by the end of the semester every lecture was a chore.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting papers, cover a wide range of time. Cons: Sometimes there was a lack of unified progression throughout the semester, i.e., we would jump between papers broadly under the umbrella of american economic history without the clearest connection.",
                "This course exposed me to articles that were really interesting to read and discuss during lectures. They often caused me to think about topics in American history from a very new perspective than I have had before.",
                "No weaknesses\r\nAll strengths: Fantastic course, amqzing TAs, great readings, reasonable exams, loved it!",
                "Strengths: good survey course, very low stress, fair grading\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: little engagement with TFs (weekly office hours or optional section might've helped with this)",
                "Interesting topics. Could be improved by not making each class solely based on summaries if the readings.",
                "Strengths: I realized I learned a lot about economic history when I was able to make arguments on topics such as slavery and inequality by citing the work of economic historians and their data. Shari is also amazing and genuinely cares about her students. And the workload is not too bad at all. \r\n\r\nWeakness: You definitely have to be interested in the material, or else it will be boring.",
                "The strength of this course (besides the course material) is that it is straightforward in its expectations. Between Professor Eli's lectures, the slides, and reading the papers, you can get a solid understanding of the important aspects of a paper. The assignments and exams simply ask you to be able to explain these aspects (e.g., question, hypothesis, methods, results, conclusions). That said, I never felt like I was regurgitating the material; I truly understood it. I think this course gives you a reasonable amount of information to learn in a semester and doing just what is expected of you is not only enough for you to do well but also to appreciate and understand the material.",
                "This was a great course! One of the strengths was definitely the lectures, the professor did a great job at going in depth into the material. The amount of papers to read was reasonable, and they were all for the most part quite interesting.",
                "I think the course would benefit from it being less writing intensive (maybe no WR credit?) and instead focus on learning the actual content of American history rather than focus on analyzing papers.",
                "Strengths: The content of the course was really interesting. I enjoyed the assigned papers. Additionally, Professor Eli summarized the key points of every paper in the next lecture which helped reinforce the key points and helped me prepare for the exams. \r\nWeaknesses: Professor Eli can sometimes lecture monotone, which can get difficult to listen to.",
                "Strength: the course covers a wide variety of topics, so students interested in economics will be able to find something that they're interested in. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I think lectures would benefit greatly from being taught in person since there is never really much participation in class over Zoom.",
                "The first half of the course consisted of a large set of readings that proved to be difficult to handle, as they were essentially all economics papers going through quite a bit of both qualitative and quantitative analysis that seemed dense on first read-throughs. While the reading load decreased in the second half, I personally felt significant burnout long before the final exam that made those last papers even more difficult to go through.",
                "The class was a great option for a STEM major looking for a writing credit (it was low workload and Professor Eli was extremely nice and welcoming), but the course wasn't the most intellectually engaging or interesting.",
                "A strength is that the workload is manageable. However, classes could have been more engaging and there could be less focus on research papers.",
                "Prof. Eli is amazing, take it with her if you can!",
                "The professor did a wonderful job given these virtual circumstances. The professor was especially skilled in creating an environment on zoom that still felt personal and connected through side comments, questions about how we are doing... etc.",
                "It is a reading-based class and if you do the readings you will do well in the class. But missing even one reading can leave you unprepared for the tests. I like the class as it is.",
                "It covers significant historical material and hits many time periods between the mid 19th century and the late 20th century. Some of the topics covered were interesting, but very precise, and although the class does teach a lot, the specific topics seemed to have been chosen a bit randomly and few of them pertained directly to the macro-economy of the nation or its place in the global economy throughout the nation's history (with the exception of the unit on the Great Depression), which is what I would have liked a bit more of.",
                "Strength: I absolutely loved the readings and the format of reading and then discussing in class. I learned a lot, and found what I was learning to be incredibly interesting. \r\n\r\nImprovement: The only thing I'd say is maybe facilitating more discussions among students, though I understand that was difficult during COVID"

I also think that this class may be better suited for online exams, since essays are much easier to type than to hand-write, which allowed us to write more coherently.

                "If you're looking for a writing credit with some interesting papers and a relatively small workload outside of the readings, this is a good choice. Especially with Professor Eli.",
                "This is a great class, especially for history students (maybe less so for economics students because I don't feel like there was much rigorous discussion of economics in units other than the Great Depression unit). As a history class, it gives a great introduction to some of the most important trends in American history. It's even better than a normal history class because the papers we read are so heavily based on data and statistical analysis.",
                "Yes! Professor Eli really cares about the student's well-being and success. One of the best professors I've had at Yale. This is a great course for any econ student, especially one looking for a WR credit.",
                "Yes, it's a great way to get a writing credit if you enjoy economics and history.",
                "Yeah, I think it helps to learn how to evaluate macro data in the US over the course of its history",
                "It's a great writing credit for Econ majors who are also looking to learn more about major events in American Economic history",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if Professor Eli was teaching. I feel like without her, it probably would have been boring at times (unless you are a total history buff, then I would recommend this). I would also recommend this as a good Economics elective. It is different from the usual STEM-like classes, and the difference is nice.",
                "Yes, I enjoyed learning about economics from a historical\/humanities point of view.",
                "Sure, it's a solid writing credit for people interested in economics. Not that much workload (at least, for this semester) and the material itself is tolerable. The grading is fair and you get good feedback on your writing.",
                "I personally would not take this course again. Professor Eli is one of the best and nicest profs that Ive had so far, however this class is all about the economic analysis and not as much about the history. The set up does not follow a historical narrative in the way that a history course usually should, which I as a history major found dissapointing. If you like Econ and discussing economic literature, this is probably good for you, but if you like traditional history courses that highlight a central narrative and themes, this probably isnt what youre looking for.",
                "Yes professor is super nice!",
                "Yes - a good and interesting Wr for an Econ major.",
                "Yes! This was a fun, not-too-stressful course in which I learned a lot and got to experience writing, history, and economics from an entirely new perspective.",
                "take this if you want a basic understanding of American economic history",
                "No. There are better Econ and writing classes that are much more interesting.",
                "Yes if you are interested in the topic.",
                "yes! I enjoyed the materials and Shari is a great professor!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The lectures were interesting, and while there were a lot of readings, the workload was very manageable.",
                "Yes",
                "Highly Recommend with Shari. Truly one of a kind professor. If it is with anyone else, I'm not so sure.",
                "It was a very low stress econ\/history elective and the information was interesting. Great 5th credit, great if you want it to count for both econ and history, Shari is really nice and easy to like.",
                "Yes.",
                "Absolutely. Not a very high workload and you learn a lot about American Economic History. You read papers from all of the major figures in the discipline and get much better at reading and summarizing economic papers. You also get a lot of practice making arguments using economists' work and data. A welcome respite from mindless psets. The only downside is that it can get kind of boring if you're not interested in the topics.",
                "Yes! This course is manageable in its workload while allowing you to actually learn something. I found it relatively accessible  (I studied econometrics and micro\/macro before taking this course, so take my review with a grain of salt if you haven't). Even if you're not crazy about American history, this course focuses a lot more on methods, solving problems (like not having perfect experimental designs), critiquing a research paper, and making questions solvable\/tractable. These are valuable skills for anyone.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who enjoys economic research papers and is deeply interested in applied economics. The papers were all interesting, but many of the novel concepts came from quantitative models or methods. I would not recommend this course to someone who is just interested in a historical overview of the US economy. This class is about economic research.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course!",
                "The professor for this year was great, but I believe only a guest professor so would be careful about that. Otherwise, the material is not super interesting overall.",
                "If you are interested in economics papers and want a WR credit, this is a solid course",
                "Yes! Every week, we had to read a few papers, without any discussion or assignments. The course consisted of 2 papers and 2 exams, none of which were too difficult. They just required memorizing the key arguments of the papers, which Professor Eli highlights in lecture.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in economics, especially if they are interested in any of the topics covered. I found the material covering labor markets, wage inequality, the Great Depression, and the rise of the urban ghetto particularly interesting because I had some initial interest in them.",
                "If you're looking for a straightforward writing credit, this is a good option, but I wouldn't choose it as an elective.",
                "It's hard to say. If you are really interested in research papers, then yes. If not, the class might not seem very engaging.",
                "Yes! This course is very accessible for non-economics majors, as it provides a pretty humanistic and interdisciplinary overview of American economic development. The readings\/lectures cover everything from the stock market crash to international economics to public health crises, so there is a little something for everyone.",
                "With Prof. Eli, absolutely!",
                "Yes, because the material is extremely interesting and Prof. Eli was a tremendous professor.",
                "I do recommend the class to any economics major, as it is interesting and also gives you a writing credit.",
                "I would recommend it, but be aware that it focuses more on specific nuances of the American economy, and sometimes on aspects of American history that aren't explicitly economic in nature (such as public health). It may be more interesting to a history major than to an economics major.",
                "Yes! I absolutely loved this class; the professor was amazing and the readings were super interesting"
