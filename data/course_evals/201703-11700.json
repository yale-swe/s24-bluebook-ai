   "comments": [
    "Basic genetics lab skills, PCR, complementation tests, it goes on!",
    "-How to do a chi squared test; including contingency tables\r\n-Genetic transformation techniques\r\n-PCR kit and gel electrophoresis\r\n-Drosophila screening techniques\r\n-linkage and recombination calculations",
    "This course consisted of experiments that went along nicely with the Genetics course. We learned complementation testing, chi square tests and DNA extraction just to name a few.",
    "I gained a much better understanding of many general and more specific concepts in genetics that were covered in the supplementary genetics lecture course.",
    "Applicable skills in genetics experiments but also overall lab skills. A lot of the techniques we did in this course are things that we have learned about in previous classes but never had the chance to actually perform.",
    "I learned how to perform an experiments, design experiments based on potential improvements to the ones we did in class and frame and write a scientific paper. This course is really well done as far as labs are concerned and I definitely learned more in this lab than I have in any of my other labs.",
    "I learned a lot about laboratory techniques for genetics, and how you can use microbiology to carry out genetics test. I also developed my ability to do statistics tests and analyses by hand. I also learned how to write scientific lab reports conveying the concepts, importance of the experiment, the results, and the analysis of those results.",
    "I learned how to perform the most essential methods for genetics research - plasmid prep, gel electrophoresis, and PCR. The most important part of this course though was beyond the technical skills. I enjoyed putting together the lab reports and thinking about the conclusions supported by the data that we collected. While the Genetics lecture taught the basic concepts and delivered information, it was truly valuable to be able to see evidence of these concepts by doing experiments myself and understanding the limitations of these experiments. I also had only previously worked with cells, and this lab gave me the opportunity to work with Arabpidosis and flies which I found fun.",
    "How difficult experiments are, yet how simple and consistent genetic experiments can be.",
    "The Lab classed enabled me to build practical skills applying genetics concepts in experimental settings.",
    "Interpreting (and perhaps more importantly, predicting) results of common genetic experiments. Also presentation of ideas in scientific writing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is super interesting and well organized. The lab reports are definitely a lot of work and time.",
    "I really liked this lab course because the professor was wonderful as was the TA and I liked that it was more like \"real science\" than the other labs I had taken thus far. Unlike gen chem lab and orgo lab, it felt a lot more like we had purpose and were looking for answers to questions in an exploratory fashion rather than straight laced labs.",
    "- Degrees of freedom explained better (discrepancies in power points)\r\n- last lab section could have more cohesive focus (like CRISPR)\r\n- Arabidopsis to be better sampled\r\n- rubrics more clearly established at the begining\r\n- more help with the chi squared tests, the first ones were difficult without prior experience, more sample materials so we all don't mess up",
    "This course was really great and I enjoyed it the entire time!",
    "The labs are well thought out, very engaging, and incredibly interesting. Many of the concepts the laboratory sessions explore are directly connected to concepts taught in lecture.",
    "Prof. Dawson is a great professor but sometimes, his expectations were a little unclear. It would be helpful to see more examples of the type of work that he expects. However, he was very approachable to ask questions.",
    "I think the lab notes, quizzes and lab reports do a good job of keeping you on top of the material. i think that the curve in this class though is unnecessarily harsh and makes you more focused on the grade than the material sometimes.",
    "The class is well designed. I enjoy having the pre-experiment lectures and going through the different techniques. The professor and TA always come around to answer questions. I enjoyed the class immensely. I don't think there are any weaknesses.",
    "The strengths of this course were how straight-forward the lab was and how accommodating the professor and TA were.",
    "Strengths: cool experiments, very good demonstration of concepts. Logic behind each step is clear.\r\nWeaknesses: Experiments are very long, sometimes involving a long wait time, and the guidance I got about how to write a lab report felt unclear.",
    "Strengths - lab experiments covered a wide range of genetic techniques and model organisms. Reports were a lot of work but very good for forcing understanding of the experiments and how they worked. Taking this concurrently with Genetics lecture was very helpful to understand concepts like linkage which were important for the lecture."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. As a pre-med looking for a bio lab, genetics lab was well organized and interesting. The lab reports, even though time consuming, are doable. Professor Dawson is very helpful and gives sufficient explanations.",
    "Yes, if you need a biology lab this is a good one! You learn tangible skills, Professor Dawson is great, and the experiments are super interesting. The lab reports are definitely intense and a lot of work.",
    "This is a great lab course! I would definitely recommend it to an MCDB major who needs to fulfill a lab requirement but doesn't want anything to intense. Professor Dawson is absolutely great and really helpful.",
    "Great lab, Professor Dawson is a phenomenal lab instructor. Not sure why his reviews are meh, he has a tough exterior but is nice and helpful. Also, these experiments he sets up are more fun than most labs - genetic screens on multicellular organisms feel more legit than unicellular yeast. Check in with TA about first lab report before you turn it in - because you should know how much background to include, and what procedure is worthy of note. Beware middle\/last lab calculations, they take a long time, and make sure you find good sample calculations if it is not distributed to you. Monique is a great TA, take it with her if possible.",
    "I would recommend this to another student because there were lab reports due about every other week, and the quizzes were fairly straight forward had you studied appropriately. Professor Dawson is also very helpful and chill. The TAs were great too, and it was a pretty chill lab and we got out early most days.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student taking the Genetics Lecture class. Genetics Lab offers a great opportunity to gain a more hands-on understanding of difficult concepts taught in lecture.",
    "Yes, Yes, Yes! Best lab I have ever taken.",
    "This is a great laboratory course to complete for the MCDB major, or to take just for fun. It will be a bit of work for non-science majors, but the concepts and techniques are explained clearly, and there are several walk throughs.",
    "If you need to take a lab, genetics is the way to go. This lab is maximum 3 hours, usually shorter if you prepare just a little beforehand. While the lab reports take time, they are straightforward and Dawson gives quite a thorough explanation about how to complete the assignment. The quizzes are at the end of every section and are fair - if you actually did the experiments and the readings you should ace every quiz. Also depending on how much lab experience you have, it's likely that you have done a lot of the experiments already - which can be either a positive or a negative depending on what you're trying to get out of this course.",
    "Yes, it was mostly enjoyable.",
    "Yes, it's a great lab.",
    "If you are thinking of doing further work with genetics\/biological research\/medicine, I would definitely recommend this course. You will learn about genetic experiments in a systematic fashion and you will gain an understanding of the principles behind them so that if\/when you do them in the future you will not be doing them mindlessly."
