I have a much clearer sense now of how to construct a persuasive argument.\r\n\r\nI also felt like I developed a much deeper understanding of not only K-pop, but also its broader implications in Korean culture, history, and media, as well as Korean influence worldwide.",
                "Through this course, I better understood the expectation held surrounding writing. While I already had a lot of experience with writing, this course gave me the ability to write about a topic which I was not only very interested in but also a topic that is rarely discussed in an academic setting. I learned about the often overlooked western influences that were pivotal to the foundation of K-Pop while exploring how they have evolved in the 21st century.",
                "I learned how to evaluate any type of media through a more academic lense. I've always listened to K-pop as a form of entertainment. The class encouraged me think critically about how mimicry and originality is tied into K-pop.",
                "I was able to enjoy writing in this class because the instructor was pretty flexible when it came to choosing topics for our papers. She guided us through each draft and provided useful feedback.",

                "I didn't know what to expect by taking a course centered around K-pop, but I was pleasantly surprised as we learned a whole lot about media, postcolonialism, and Korean nationalism and Korea's relationships with other parts of the world. I also improved my critical thinking and writing skills and learned how to write a good research paper."

                "I got great feedback, the course was well-organized and very interesting, the discussions were fun\r\n\r\nNo complaints!",
                "In terms of strengths, the class was structured at a reasonable pace and the assignments didn't really feel too stacked on top of each other. The readings were also divided into sections that we were aware of well before time. The professor was also very flexible with us and cared about the topics that we wanted to discuss. While the discussions surrounded the topic of the day or week, the professor allowed the class to diverge slightly when it felt needed. This was also reflected in the fact that videos, and even the final project, had room for us to explore artists or ideas we wanted to learn more about. In terms of weaknesses, this course had very little. The biggest one I noticed is that some of the readings can be very dense but this rarely causes any problems as we discuss them with the professor in-depth during the nest class.",
                "Strength: covered multiple areas of K-pop through a more academic lens (media); fun presentations; small class with great discussions; flexible deadline; very engaging\r\n\r\nWeakness: N/A",
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed the discussion format, flexible professor without detracting from the value of the course, a lighter load of reading gave us more time to throughly digest the assigned readings, each student had to give a presentation, mixture of fun discussions and serious discussions\r\nCould be improved: More sharing of work amongst peers, feedback given, getting to see what other peoples ideas were",
                "For people who like and are interested in K-pop, this is an amazing class in which you can connect with other like-minded people and learn together. Our class environment was very collaborative and welcoming to people with all different sorts of backgrounds and experiences with K-pop from long-time fans to people completely new. Some of the readings required for this class were really difficult, but still interesting in the broad picture."

If you are interested in K-Pop, or even if you aren't, the readings and discussions make the writing assignments a lot more engaging and manageable. Taylor was also my favorite professor this semester and I genuinely believe that this course helped me become an overall stronger writer. The class is also super fun on days where, instead of doing a reading, we discuss aspects of a music video. If you can, take this class!!",
                "Yes, if they are interested in K-pop or Korean culture.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who may be interested in K-Pop and would enjoy discussions that are mostly on South Korean music groups and history.",
                "Yes, it was very interesting to me as someone who enjoys k-pop content, but its also a valuable course for people whole dont. It brought many aspects of the k-pop industry under scrutiny and enabled students to think through the issues plaguing this industry. It brought a lot of societal norms into question. It granted students the opportunity to form their own ideas regarding these issues. It was a good combination of enjoyable, fun, deep, and important.",
                "If this course is offered again, I would definitely recommend taking it, no matter what your background in K-pop is."
