    "I learned about the canonical mechanisms that constitute development in almost all organisms. It taught me to critically think and apply what I have learned to novel situations",
    "Gained insight about fundamental principles of development in several different model organisms and applied these to organ system formation",
    "Knowledge of developmental processes",
    "I learned the various steps necessary in progressing from just a small clump of cells into a fully developed and functional organism. With each lecture we learned a new portion of this process, how we know about it, and what can go wrong.",
    "Throughout this course, I learned about the developmental processes that are fundamental to studying other areas of biology. It was interesting to learn about a field that can easily be observed and pictured rather than some other courses that require a lot of imagination and obscure thinking to understand.",
    "Developmental processes for some model organisms and those for humans too."

   "comments": [
    "The course was very interesting, but the exams expected too much rogue memorization and regurgitation, which is not something I would expect from a Yale course.",
    "The course was strong in that weakly quizzes helped you keep up with material and the three exams made the details manageable so that you could answer more in-depth questions on exams and better reinforce the principles. The three different professors taught when the topic was aligned with their specialties and that was helpful for lectures",
    "I was disappointed in this class, some lectures were interesting but most of them were very confusing\/unclear and I felt like the instructors did the bare minimum (no review sessions by instructors, no office hours etc).",
    "I think the quizzes were sometimes far too vague. I would study these intricate pathways of signaling expecting that to be the main focus of the quiz and then the assessment would be something very general. It almost made me feel like I was wasting my time at some points by studying so much. The exams were better but I think the quizzes could be a bit more streamlined to test important information.",
    "Strengths of the course are that professors are always willing to work outside of class hours and provide extra resources to understanding the topics. It is also helpful that the 3 professors lecture in their respective fields. \r\nWeaknesses of this course is that most of the content and tested material is memorization based. Tests are structured around how much content one can reiterate rather than how much a student actually learned in the course.",
    "This course is very good. The professors are good and the tests and quizzes are fair."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, the content is interesting, but a lot of work to keep up with the weekly quizzes and exams",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it ties the underlying mechanisms of embryogenesis to human disease and organisms so its more interesting to those interested in human biology than others Ive taken",
    "Would",
    "It is interesting material if you are into this type of stuff. I would recommend doing a good bit of reading in the book to supplement the lectures, though. Sometimes I felt like I wanted to learn more in depth why things happened and it was just not specified quite as much as I would have liked.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students in the MCDB major, especially if taken concurrently or after genetics. I think it is an interesting background to gain from taking this course.",
    "Absolutely. Definitely the best MCDB core course. Would strongly recommend this to anyone no matter what the reasons for wanting to take this course are."
