                "I learned a lot about political theory and history.",

I also got better at drawing connections between different writers, ideas, and events, and evaluating these ideas in writing."

                "The Historical and Political Thought track of Directed Studies is the most resplendent of the three and has not been tampered by an institutional desire to always replace ancient texts with something contemporary or out of the ordinary. The connections that can be made between the thinkers are striking but extremely relevant. The course divides itself neatly (Machiavelli and the big three, revolutions, post-modern thought) and is rich with general ideas that force us to think and develop our own critical perspectives.",
                "The biggest strength was the professors. I felt very supported by all of them: I always felt like I could go to them for assistance, and every lecture and section was very engaging and helpful. The only weakness would be that the amount of assigned reading often felt very overwhelming.",
                "The reading list is incredible. The in class discussions were really good. No improvements needed in my view (except, take Hegel off the syllabus  he's completely incomprehensible, and no one in my section actually read it).",
                "In general I feel like History and Politics is the weakest of the three DS tracks because it tries to accomplish too much in terms of the scope of what we study, and the combined focus on history and political philosophy. It tends to place more emphasis on the latter topic, but I often felt like I couldn't actually engage with the material in a substantive way because I lacked historical context. I wonder if H&P might benefit from a different structure than the other DS tracks--for example, having two lectures and one discussion section a week. I think a fuller background on the thinkers we read would enable everyone to engage with the texts on a far deeper level, which would raise the quality of the discussion sections and the papers. I also thought the transitions between thinkers felt abrupt and it was sometimes difficult to see how they connected on a larger scale.",
                "One strength of this course are Professor Barasch's required discussion posts. The process of writing a weekly analytic post raised my engagement with the texts and greatly improved my understanding. Likewise, it enabled me to come to seminar with one or two prepared ideas to share and debate with my classmates, which made for an exciting and competitive learning environment. For me, one way the course could be improved would be to require not one, but two discussion posts every week."

                "Absolutely. The second semester H&P track of DS was particularly memorable because of a series of poignant lectures, a well composed curriculum, and a dynamic seminar to support our individual learning. Of course, the workload of DS can always be minimized if a student shirks the reading, but if done in its entirety, it proves to be incredibly satisfying and can reverse your entire worldview. I experienced this personally and witnessed it with some of my colleagues through our weekly discussion posts. It was invigorating to see this inversion of previously held opinions due to an author's eloquent articulation of an idea.",
                "Yes. The curriculum and surrounding discussions allowed me to see the world through a diverse set of lenses and truly broadened my thinking.",
                "Yes! H and P was my favorite course in DS.",
                "I would recommend this course because I recommend DS, but I also think that second semester H&P is generally more engaging than first semester and feels far more relevant and accessible."
