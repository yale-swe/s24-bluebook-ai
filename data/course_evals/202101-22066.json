                "The readings were interesting and thought-provoking, and I think we spanned a good number of different traditions without turning into a survey course. Our discussions took place in both the larger room and in breakout rooms, and those were always great opportunities to share our own thoughts while hearing other people's interpretations of the readings and what stood out to them. Our discussions really helped me consider different perspectives and reflect on my own values. The course really pushed me to think about why I believe certain things or why I prioritize and do certain things in my life, and I am so grateful for that. The only weakness would be that there were too many interesting points in the readings and overarching units and we sometimes didn't get to discuss things as fully as we would have hoped. Good problem for a class to have though!",
                "Out of all the courses I have taken at Yale, I enjoyed this one the most. The usage of Facebook posts, lots of small breakout room discussions, and talks with the professor allowed me to be most attentive and thoroughly enjoy my class.",
                "Discussion did not flow very well in seminar, broken up by a lot of opinions by the prof. I really enjoyed the readings though!",
                "only strengths!! i loved learning about various philosophies of life, and many of the ideas we learned will really stay with me in future years",
                "The class was very laid back which was nice. It felt like a comfortable space to reflect on our ideas, which seems to stand out from the stress of other Yale classes.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I really got a handle for some of the religions we studied.",
                "I really enjoyed the breakout rooms in this class. In many of the other zoom breakout rooms that I've been in, the goal is to solve a problem or come up with an answer to some question. I liked how much I was able to reflect in these breakout rooms and in the larger group discussions.",
                "The syllabus for the course seems to use different schools of thought to help students find out what their visions of a life worth living are. However, I feel like the readings on the syllabus were more fit for a survey course on world religions. While some readings were interesting, others just gave background information about the belief we were talking about (like the Islam readings). It might benefit the course to update the readings."

I think having structured self-reflection times and spaces was very important to me, especially since I'm graduating, and this class gave me so much more than just a space to reflect. It gave me a clearer vision of what I want my life to look like and what steps I can take to achieve that vision.",
