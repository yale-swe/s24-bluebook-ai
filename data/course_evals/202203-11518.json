                "I learned how to approach texts through a comparative literature lens. I had never taken a comparative literature class before and this class taught me how to approach texts in a multidisciplinary fashion and how to apply knowledge from one field and text to another. I also was able to delve into the field of psychoanalysis in a way I had not yet been able to at Yale--as this class offered a rare opportunity to explore this field. I learned a lot about Greek myths and psychoanalysis, and how to think about literature in a wider way--beyond the text itself.",
                "We learned about psychoanalysis from Freud and authors in the later 20th century, and saw the field's trajectory. We read and analyzed lots of Greek plays, both with a \"standard\" analytical lens, and through the lens of psychoanalysis. It's a good class for developing familiarity with these two bodies of knowledge that show up everywhere.",
                "I learned a lot about Freud, having never read him before. I also enjoyed reading Greek tragedies and finding the sites of intersection with psychoanalytic work.",
                "foundational understanding of the key writers and thinkers who influenced and formed the psychoanalytic tradition\r\nread a lot of greek works from antiquity that i also likely would not have been exposed to otherwise",
                "I got so much better at analyzing work and also articulating my thoughts much better.",
                "I learned a lot about Freudian psychoanalysis that I didn't know previously. I also learned how to write a keyword paper, which I now appreciate as a helpful genre of essay.",
                "Lots of psychoanalysis and its interplay with Greek Tragedies! Mostly Freud with some Lacan and other psychoanalysts\/philosophy sprinkled in.",
                "I became acquainted with the basic theories of Freud and his commentators, while also developing my ability to read literature through a psychoanalytic lens."

            "comments": [
                "There is way too much reading in this course.",
                "I think that this course was very strong in its exploration of psychoanalysis and of Greek myths. We also had amazing opportunities to examine these texts through interesting assignments, corresponding readings, lectures, and visiting professors. We also had discussions that went to larger and relevant themes in society that sprung from these texts.\r\n\r\nI think this course could be improved in the way we examined the intersection between both psychoanalysis and Greek myths. While it was a collaborative thought experiment and process of discovery in comparing these two fields, but I think that a bit more probing of the intersection and a bit clearer way of developing the comparative literary analysis would have been helpful. Nebo was so good at letting students speak and leading a seminar, but I also think loved when Nebo interjected and guided the discussion and think that if he shared more of his insights, and talked more, this class would have benefitted a lot from that.",
                "Strengths: The syllabus! The texts keep showing up everywhere for a reason--they evoke strong reactions one way or another, whether you like\/agree with them or not. There's also lots of opportunities to be creative in this class, since it puts two not obviously related fields side by side.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The syllabus! It's way too much reading. You can only pick and choose like half of it to actually try and understand\/close read\/internalize. Also, it would be helpful to get a straightforward glossary of psychoanalysis terms at the start of the semester that none of us had ever heard of (cathexis, transference neurosis, even what Freud meant by conscious vs unconscious, etc.), since it's assumed we know all those terms right from week one. A glossary would make the first few readings so much easier.",
                "The strength of the course is Nebo and the texts we read, many of which are very interesting. There was occasionally challenging material, and I think some more instructional work, such as small lectures from him, would have helped guide discussion, particularly in the first two weeks. Much of Freud can be very dense and confusing, but Nebo is very eager to hear and help students confusion. He is a good discussion leader, and a very lovely professor.",
                "strengths: quality of readings\r\nweakness: quantity of readings (a tad heavy)",
                "I liked the seminar style and the readings. Perhaps better structure to the course would be better.",
                "I think that the reading load was quite heavy. Making it lighter would make it easier to engage in the class. In addition, I think it would be beneficial to make the structure of the course more clear from the outset  not every Freud reading will match up directly with every Greek tragedy. Rather, we're building an arsenal of Freudian works and tragedies.",
                "I loved the discussion during class and hearing from my peers. However, a more lecture style\/guided discussion may have been helpful especially in the beginning when dealing with Freudian jargon.",
                "I thought that overall the flow of the course was very well-chosen, with a good balance between Freud, the tragedies, and other relevant commentaries from both literary theory and psychoanalysis. I will say that I would have enjoyed a bit more time for lectures on the Freud material, because some of it was quite complex and it was therefore difficult to launch straight into seminar-style discussion."

                "This course is a bit chaotic but if you are interested in both psychology and theater I would definitely recommend it. You also should probably like to read.",
                "Yes, it was a fascinating probing of topics, with an amazing syllabus, and Nebo is a fantastic person and teacher. If someone wants to learn about these subjects and feel immersed in the cannon of psychoanalysis and Greek myths, while learning from a wonderful professor, then they should take this class!",
                "I'd recommend this course only if you have a background in psychoanalysis. It'll be very difficult to take in the weekly psychoanalysis readings otherwise; either you'll have to devote lots and lots of time to them, or you'll have to skim them--and skimming never really taught me anything when I was forced to do it. Discussions were middling at best. I'm not sure any of them really changed me or challenged me as a person.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning about Psychoanalysis and Ancient Tragedy (arguably it is easier if one has some background in Ancient Athenian tragedy but I think no background for Freud is needed) and the ways in which these frameworks of thought can generatively interact with each other.",
                "Yes, I would. I think its unique to have the opportunity to read Freud college with such depth, and it is fun to read in conversation with such excellent plays.",
                "yes! nebo is great, the course is interesting, and seldom do we get to take literature courses that also touch so heavily on other disciplines. cannot recommend enough!",
                "Yeah I would recommend it if you are into Greek tragedies and into reading these peripheral intellectuals. You will read a lot of interesting works and the assessments are flexible and creative.",
                "Yes, if they're very interested in both Greek tragedies and in Freud, and they know that from the outset. Students who are more interested in one or the other might be disappointed.",
                "Yes! This is a great course for anyone interested in psychoanalysis or greek tragedy or both! You cover a lot of material and can tailor the assignments to what your interests are."
