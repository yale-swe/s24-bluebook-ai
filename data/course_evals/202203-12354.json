                "Honestly this class was in itself a work of art that I wouldn't change. Sometimes I wished for a little more explanation on the readings, and a little more clarity on requirements. But overall the class's flexibility was its greatest strength. \r\nHOWEVER Yale NEEDS to give this woman a room to teach her class for god's sake.",
                "chillest class you will ever take but so disorganized",
                "Strengths: passionate prof, inclusive class environment. Weaknesses: time often got away from us during class, so our schedule wasn't always consistent.",
                "I absolutely loved this class. The instruction and structure were great.",
                "Strengths: Very relaxed environment with an ethos of just trying things out and collaborating with those around! I mean I just loved it, bro it was so fun and a class I would look forward to every time!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, I would have liked to explore the academic literature a bit more; though the artistic practice was important, a better understanding of theories through discussions wouldve been helpful.",
                "Strengths: Professor Stokes is incredible, she is literally the reason why I'm continuing the major, if you get a chance to take a class with her, do it. The content is really good. Having the opportunity to create your own content based on weakly readings. Increasing your knowledge as a performer, dramaturg, director, and producer. Having a professor that is understanding and will not penalize you for stepbacks.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Although the content is really good from a performance perspective, some of them are quite gruesome and Professor Stokes may forget to give a trigger warning, although she tries to give one every week. I think if maybe some of the content from students also came with a tw, it would be more pleasant.",
                "Strengths: Assignments/performances allowed for tons of flexibility, and we got to learn about some really cool artists. It was also great to see the work that everyone else in the class was doing and get immediate feedback on our performances. Weaknesses: There wasn't much structure to the class, and to be honest, I'm still not sure I know what performance art is. That being said, the class was more enjoyable than I expected, and Shilarna is great as always."

                "yes you will be shocked that you are getting credit for it but you will learn a lot about yourself and others and what performance art is",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class. The atmosphere was amazing and everyone was able to produce work they were excited about.",
                "Yes. Just take it. Lean into it, and youll see!",
                "Yes! Please take any classes with Dr. Stokes, she is amazing. She is single-handedly carrying the theatre department here and she is super understanding of anyone's situation. She is willing to listen to students and loves to receive feedback. She is extremely humble and cares for her students. The content in class is also eye-opening and lets you have a new understanding of what performance is. I would love to take a continuation of this class and keep exploring my body's response to different texts that ultimately allow you to become a better actor/director/dramaturg.",
                "Yes. Even if you don't consider yourself to be a performer, there are ways to get through this class with many different comfort levels. I feel like I learned a lot about performance more broadly, and anyone (regardless of major or performance background) can get something out of this course."
