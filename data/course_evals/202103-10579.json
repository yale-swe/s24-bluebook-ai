I learned several lab techniques: how to perform thorough dissections, how to plate and differentiate cell culture, how to run FLOW, how to construct graphs in prism, how to stain for lipids, and so much more.  I also learned how to construct my own experimental timeline and navigate general problems that arise when conducting research.",

                "This \"course\" provides students with very little information, which is at times frustrated. For example, there is very little instruction about the requirements for the proposals due at the beginning and end of the semester. This is extremely frustrating for students.",
                "It would be helpful to be able to engage with other students doing senior research and hear about their progress and struggles. This could be in the form of a \"Research Update Meeting\" so course instructors can check in with students in different labs.",
                "It is great for the research experience but very inconsistent from lab to lab.",
                "The research was great, but there wasn't too much to the course itself. I wish there had been a little more personal advisement at the start of the course. Even an email saying \"we will check in at the end of the semester but if you have questions in the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out.\" Instead all of the information was in the syllabus, so it was up to the students to read it and direct themselves. I was kinda confused about the general structure of the \"course\" and honestly didn't really know who was in charge.",
