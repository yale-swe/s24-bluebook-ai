                "It would be helpful to be able to engage with other students doing senior research and hear about their progress and struggles. This could be in the form of a \"Research Update Meeting\" so course instructors can check in with students in different labs.",

                "The research was great, but there wasn't too much to the course itself. I wish there had been a little more personal advisement at the start of the course. Even an email saying \"we will check in at the end of the semester but if you have questions in the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out.\" Instead all of the information was in the syllabus, so it was up to the students to read it and direct themselves. I was kinda confused about the general structure of the \"course\" and honestly didn't really know who was in charge.",
