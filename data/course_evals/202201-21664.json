                "A strength is the lecture notes are posted and are a pretty in depth coverage of all the topics. I found it very helpful to be able to read through the lecture notes before the exams as a review. A weakness is the final month of lectures are absolutely packed with content. It feels like we cover ten times more in the final 4 lectures than we did in the rest of the class. Another weakness is that the psets are incredibly challenging. They were almost impossible unless you went to office hours or recitation, and even then, I often felt like I did not have the resources to complete them.",
                "I liked the hybrid teaching style where professor Amir would write on his ipad and recorded each lecture. However, this also made the class difficult to follow at times since it seemed that Amir just copied down his lecture notes.",
                "Strengths of this course are that the material connects pretty well with itself and it is somewhat feasible to see how it progresses and becomes more difficult. One of the main weaknesses of the course is that the material is really challenging and I don't know if there's a way to make it any easier."

The math is quite hard to comprehend and only take if you are a ChemE major. The need for a very strong background in math cannot be over-emphasized!",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student that is not committed to Chemical Engineering as a major. This is probably the hardest course I have taken in the Chemical Engineering major thus far in terms of my understanding of the material, and it really did not click for me. Some advice I would give is to be flexible and ask for help working through the material with the TA or going to office hours with the TA and/or professor and it will be more manageable."
