                "Strengths: good lecturer \r\n\r\nWeakness: content was boring sometimes",
                "Strength: lots of good information given, interesting material",

                "I think the main weaknesses are a lack of organization in the course and a lack of clarity around instructions for the final paper. I think including a slide show presentation to cover the notes would go a long way for the organization.",
                "Strengths: very intriguing",
                "Professor Marcuss lecture is gem and I enjoyed every class. Maybe one thing of improvement can be done with class reading materials. I thought the packet was quite expensive, an free online version of it wouldve been really helpful.",
                "I think that Professor Marcus is extremely knowledgeable and always has content to discuss during class. He is relatively organized, sticking to an outline that is very helpful for exams but it would be useful if lecture notes or slides or definitions were posted along with the outline as when we would ask clarifying questions he often said the answers were in the texts if we read them. I think that this course was great in terms of learning new things each week and providing a new perspective on various faiths. One weakness was that the second midterm was during reading week which was more stressful than if it were the week or two weeks before.",
                "Strengths Prof Marcus provides the materials to do well in this class and lectures well\r\nWeakness: it is only a lecture and doesn't cover all the stuff on the outline he provides",
                "It is pretty good, I do not know what would be improved on",
                "The course is focused on primary sources, which is one of its great strengths. Prof. Marcus encourages students to derive history from the primary sources, which is later supplemented by broader overviews which he offers during lectures. I do not think the course has any weaknesses.",

                "The course covers super interesting material and the readings are carefully chosen to cover many different aspects of Jewish life in Muslim lands. Professor Marcus brings up a variety of topics in his lectures but they can at times be difficult to follow. I think the course could be improved by having two 50-min lectures and a discussion section with a TF to be able to go through the sheer volume of material discussed in the class. I also wished that the final essay could have involved research instead of just comparing primary sources  the opportunity to research into this part of history might have been interesting.",

Coming from a Jewish parochial school background, I came in with a decent grasp of the background information and was able to help out classmates who weren't familiar with this material.",

                "Yes, definitely. This class covers a very niche topic but successfully relates to the modern world, especially its current political conflicts. It is quite interesting to learn major historical events such as the Crusades and the rise of Christianity from a perspective different from how we usually learn. I definitely recommend this to any major, especially to those who are looking for a fourth or a fifth class since this class doesnt have a high workload.",
                "I would, but only if the student is willing to force themselves to remain engaged during all the lectures. I found towards the end of the year that it could be a bit difficult to remain focused but overall, the content was interesting. It's a great course to take to broaden one's knowledge/ cultural knowledge.",
