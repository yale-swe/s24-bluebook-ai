My parents are both Indian immigrants, and I'd grown up in culturally Indian settings with many native Hindi speakers. As such, I had a very good intuition for Hindi going into this course. I'd hoped that taking this course would allow me to better connect with my cultural roots. By developing my Hindi and understanding of Indian culture and its traditions, I am grateful to say it did."

                "Strengths - Mansi Ji is a great professor who truly cares about her students and their success. The class was very well organized and it was easy to see what things were required when. Also the small class size makes it so that you and your fellow Hindi classmates really bond throughout the semester. Weakness- My one weakness might be that it felt sometimes like there was an uneven course load, like some weeks we would have significantly more work than others. Mansi Ji was receptive to feedback about course load and difficulty though!",
                "Strengths - It was a small course and there was a lot of personalized attention. The teacher could change the topics taught in the course to reflect our requests and what she thought we needed more help with.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - None.",
                "Strengths: Mansi Ji always brought energy to class, small class gave everyone more chances to practice speaking, workload was always manageable, felt like we developed a sense of community, always appreciated the feedback on assignments.\r\nWeaknesses: none really, though I think it's even possible to assign a bit more work, just to cover more and keep us practicing, even just a few sentences and even if it isn't possible to give feedback on every piece of homework.",
                "The course was overall well taught and organized. There was some inconsistency with the workload and format of the course towards the beginning of the semester, but it was all figured out by the end.",
                "I loved the amount of authentic sources we were exposed to -- real Hindi stories, media, songs; it was a very fun class because we had interesting discussions and debates; the only improvement I can see to make is to make the grammar exercises correspond a bit more to the topics we're discussing in class",
                "Strengths: Mansi Ji was an exceptional lecturer. She was great at breaking concepts into digestible chunks. Above all, she was committed to making the activities/assignments fun. Likewise, she fostered a sense of community amongst classmates. I've never felt so close to my classmates as I did in this course.\r\n\r\nImprovements: This class really drilled my ability to read, write, and comprehend Hindi. Although we often spoke in Hindi, I would have loved more opportunities to develop my speaking skills."

The workload was very manageable, I now feel proficient in Hindi, Mansi Ji actively makes the class fun/engaging, and I really liked the sense of community amongst classmates. My parents are both Indian immigrants, and this course helped me feel closer to my cultural roots. Overall, great course and highly recommend."
