    "I learned how to use basic science equipment, extract DNA from ear samples, and run a PCR. I also learned how to analyze genetic data with excel.",
    "Not much. Just something you need to check off in order to fulfill your major.",
    "I have learned more in this research course than I have in any of the labs or classes I have taken at Yale. Found the right lab and I couldn't be happier!",
    "I learned a lot about conducting research in a lab and about the process of scientific writing in biology.",
    "I learned lab techniques, including tissue sectioning, staining, and FACS. I practiced scientific writing skills.",

   "comments": [
    "I learned so much this semester and my post doc is super helpful and kind. My PI is also very kind. I don't have any weaknesses. I like the hands-on aspect of this course. Bio students learn a lot about experiments in courses but it is so different when you actually do it in person. I'm glad I have learned how to do some new things in a lab.",
    "Not a course. All it does is takes a student job away from students who need the money to live day-to-day at Yale. You should figure out a way to allow students to continue getting paid or make some sort of agreement. Taking 10 hours of work away from low-income students or students on financial aid is a lot. The major\/department has no sensitivity to student incomes.",
    "The only weaknesses of this course are the time commitment, but it really is not that bad. You will learn so much in your research and learn to conduct real science. You will also meet great people and develop great relationships!",
    "I think the workload of this course is appropriate for a senior class. It really helped to be receiving credit for the time spent in lab, and I feel that the expectation of 10-12 hours per week is enough to get work done in lab but also enough to not be overwhelming. I also appreciated that the final submitted report was not overwhelmingly long.\r\n\r\nHowever, I felt that I would have benefitted from more guidance on assignments. The information provided on Canvas or in additional documents was still sparse, which left me and my mentor confused in terms of what the expectations were that I needed to fulfill. There was also minimal communication for this course after the beginning, and I feel I would have benefitted from a little more communication (such as about upcoming deadlines).",
    "No guidance at all",
    "No faculty support from the MCDB department. I tried to reach out and ask for help near the end of the semester and could not get in touch with my adviser, and there are few guidelines or check-ins to make sure that we're on track and having a good experience. I have felt really lost in labs in my time in college and have worked to make my own experience better with limited success, but now that this is a course and a required course at that, there should really be better infrastructure to support the students. We had one meeting at the beginning of the year, little to no feedback on our project proposals, and one assignment at the end. My thesis feels like the shakiest and most confusing academic endeavor I'm taking part in right now when it should be the one that makes me feel the most confident.",
    "This course is very, very poorly run and organized. In fact, it is quite unorganized. The assignments at the end of the semester was poorly communicated, and the expectations were non-existent. The instructions for the final assignment given were vague, and different from those given elsewhere. There is very little communication, and not much in the ways of guidelines.",
    "There was very little guidance given to us about what our project should include or information about submissions.",
    "I think hands-on research experience is an essential part of the major, specifically the B.S., since it teaches so many skills that cannot be taught in the classroom. I liked the meeting that we had at the beginning of the term to all get on the same page. One area of improvement would be getting feedback on submitted assignments (proposal, 5-page grant, etc), even if the feedback was minimal.",
    "it's highly dependent on your lab"

    "Yes, it is fun to carry out your own research and to learn from others in your field who have a lot more experience under their belt.",
    "No, but you have to take it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student intending to continue their career in any department of science. I can't explain enough how valuable this course has been for me.",
    "I would recommend this to students in MCDB who are hoping to get a Bachelor of Science degree but who do not want to commit all their time to laboratory work. I have learned a lot from my time in lab, but I am also glad that I am able to spend something like 10-16 hours in lab per week and leave myself time to pursue other interests as well.",
    "You have to if you're an MCDB major. I wish this requirement weren't so strict. None of my friends in the major enjoy their lab work, so it would be nice to have another option to complete our theses.",
    "You have to take it to get credit for the BS, so not really an option.",
    "For all MCDB majors doing the B.S. this is a required course. It is not available to other students.",
