This is not a technical class, however, so if you are looking to learn how to build an operating system, you should find a more advanced class. However, this class is a great primer for such a class as it discusses in detail how an operating system functions (and what functions a good operating system should support) and provides an overview to various problems in systems programming.",

                "Strengths - a concepts-based class that focuses on making you understand the topic. Avi's teaching was excellent and I didn't find them at all dull. The slides are long but comprehensive, and all the class resources were available up-front and for exams etc. The class ended up not being hard at all to comprehend.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I ended up not doing that much hands-on programming (which I actually preferred, so that was a nice change) but I could see why it would drive someone away from the course. If you're interested in actually implementing anything about operating systems, this isn't the right class, take OS instead. Also, sometimes the tricky multiple-choice questions on the exams and homeworks would definitely trip me up (which I guess is the point)",
                "Great lectures! More regular homework assignments would help us to check our understanding, but as I took this course in spring 2021, the irregularity of homework was likely due to the nature of the COVID year and not any fault of the instructional staff.",

                "Honestly, yes, take this class. This took me back to how computer science concepts were taught to me in earlier schools, and in the best way. Less focus on stressful programming assignments that make you spend 90% of your engagement in the class worrying about bugs and design (in fact, there was basically no focus on this at all), and more bringing you back to the big picture and discussing the practical principles and application of the topic and would be useful for further intrinsic understanding of computers going forward. And yeah, I see how people would call the class a gut (I wouldn't, simply because I suck at memorization, but if you're good at studying, this one's for you). A great class to take as a low-stakes CS elective if you're in the major and are still recovering from (or currently taking) the more demanding cs classes (*cough* the cores *cough*), or even just as an intro to the principles of OS for your personal amusement.",
                "Yes! Great course for an overview on operating systems if you don't the stress of implementing an entire operating system in one semester (also a great course to prepare for such a course in a future semester). If you liked the theoretical topics discussed in 323, you will enjoy this class.",
                "If you've taken 323, the material in this class will feel very similar. However, there is a much larger breadth to the material covered and the course is very informative on most aspects behind OS theory and design. These aspects are definitely critical to an well rounded understanding of computer systems and Avi does a great job of covering them.",
                "Would definitely recommend this course! I wish all courses at Yale were like this-- it doesn't beat around the bush and doesn't waste our time with too much extraneous work, and instead focuses on the subject matter at hand. Highly informative and well-taught; I certainly learnt a lot. I would especially recommend that this course allow students to take it in advance of CPSC 323; I wish I had taken this class before that, this was a much better, much more clear and comprehensive introduction to the Operating Systems side of things. If the Yale CS core were to be redesigned, I would mandate this course and take away the OS part of 323."
