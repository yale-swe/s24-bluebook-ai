I also was able to improve my writing and research skills with Professor Lee's helpful guidance.",

                "I learned that water is an incredible lens through which to view the world, particularly the power dynamics of the world and how human societies interact with the \"natural\" world. I also had the chance to work on my writing a ton. Prof. Lee gave tons of helpful guidance and feedback. We did archival research which was so fun and interesting, and it was an awesome learning experience.",
                "I became a much stronger writer through Professor Lees guidance and feedback. The reading assignments were varied and interesting. I definitely gained a broad yet also nuanced understanding of the history of water issues and how public and scientific opinion has changed over time.",

I would say the only drawback was that it was hard for me personally to fully engage with the often fast-paced rhythm of the student led discussion time. As a more reflective type person I struggled to jump in on the topics before new ideas emerged.",

                "Strengths- great enviro history course, engaging readings\r\nWeaknesses- I wish prof lee had guided discussion more and provided more background for readings. I felt that I had more background knowledge about water than most students in this course, so was fine, but I and talked with others about how they felt a little lost and lacked context.",
                "Strengths: Film project. Dr. Lee's extensive feedback on papers. Good readings!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class length meant that sometimes discussions felt too open-ended.",
                "Strengths: film paper, working on writing, prof. Lee, class discussion\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, there was more reading than I could handle, but fortunately, I was able to get a ton out of the just by focusing in on what I could each week",
                "The course is strong, and I think we generally used each class very well.",
                "I really liked the course and especially the way the final paper was set up. We had goals all throughout the semester to finish the paper and I think that really helped me improve as a writer and didn't make it feel like a last minute paper."
