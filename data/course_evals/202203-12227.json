                "I learned how to make a scientific poster, conference presentation, and do research on collections items in Yale's holdings.",
                "Learned about and how to use several key archaeological machines\/ tests. I also learned how to formulate and do my own research in conjunction with the Yale Art Gallery. I learned how to make a scientific presentation and poster.",
                "This course taught practical knowledge on the operation of different laboratory equipment for examining artifacts. It also taught me about how different types of material (clay, bone, metal) are preserved and how archaeologists study them.",
                "In this class, I was able to get an introduction to several things, from different measuring instruments to processing data. I developed a keener understanding of how science-like-ish it can get with archaeology. As I am in the more literary side of things, epigraphy, history, archaeology but with discussion on power and politics, it can get very daunting to get inside STEM. Funningly this course sort of operated like a class to get me into that footing. Knowledge on tools but most importantly knowledge on how to focus on even smaller details with tools that archaeologists in the past did not have access to--it truly was an introduction to laboratory science. It was kinda cringey but even in the end I felt somewhat like a STEM major.",
                "Over the course of the semester, I learned so much about archaeological science and how archaeology research is conducted in the field. It was great to do the techniques ourselves on a variety of materials after learning about them in class (ranging from pXRF to IR spectroscopy). Finally, at the end of the semester we did research in one of Yale's collections, and I learned how difficult data collection and data analysis truly are on objects that often don't have much information known about them, from provenance to material.",
                "Learned how archaeological methods actually work and how to utilize them",
                "Plenty of archaeology lab skills.",
                "general archaeological knowledge and some techniques used for it",

                "The three hour seminar is demanding attention wise (especially right after lunch) but does a great job of exposing you to many different aspects of more technical archaeology.",
                "I really like the layout and flexibility of the class. The first half is interesting to do the class experiments\/ projects. And the personal project really makes the class. Whatever you do don't get rid of the final projects!\r\n\r\nI think a class on stats training with JMP or Excel would've been helpful. \r\n\r\nAlso I\"m not sure that classes need to be 3 hours, I think 2 hours would work for most classes.",
                "The notes offered under the syllabus were too long for anyone to read entirely, instead they were presented as reference materials alongside 1-2 assigned readings we got quizzed on. But outside of the quizzes the readings weren't really addressed in class. Overall, the course was still quite strong, however.",
                "The course was incredibly well organized. We began by learning about different materials and scientific techniques used on them in the readings before transitioning to doing those techniques ourselves in class. In the latter half of the semester, we did research on objects in Yale's collections, analyzed our data, gave a conference-style research presentation, and created a conference-style poster. I think the only thing that could be improved was more time in-class with statistical analysis and explanations of the different programs we were told about.",
                "I enjoyed the course",
                "I think the course is organized very well and very interesting.",
                "strength: we got to actually use the machines, touch real samples and work with them\r\nweakness: lectures being 4 hours is a bit long and it felt boring at some times",
                "The course material is phenomenal. However, the duration of the class is a bit long since it meets once a week.",

                "It is a great introduction to archaeology whether you have taken an archaeology class before or not! It has a little bit of something for everyone.",
                "Yes! Absoutlety. I took this as a science credit as a EPE major, and it was the perfect class. I had opportunities to work on machines, travel to the NY Met and West Campus collections, do my own research, and present my own project.",
                "I would recommend this source for anyone planning on majoring in Anthropology who needs to take an Archaeology credit. I would also recommend this course to non-STEM students looking for natural science credits. The subject matter really engaged me as a social sciences student who doesn't really enjoy \"hard\" sciences very much - connecting the lab work to history and culture made it cool enough to keep me from losing interest or getting bored with the material.",
                "Yes. For students who are anthropolgy or archaeology majors, this is a good class for learning more and reinforcing previously taught information and practices in archaeology. But I also can find it a nice class for students who are purely interested in the general topic. In fact, I might suggest this more than Great Civilization and the Ancient World for anyone interested in taking a class in archaeology. The pace of the class is a lot better and the content connects more towards a unique project where you can actually discover something new.",
                "I highly recommend this course! I'm not an archaeology major; I took it because I study MB&B and am interested in the ancient world. It was really cool to apply many of the techniques I've learned about in chemistry and biophysics courses to the study of ancient artifacts rather than to biological systems.",
