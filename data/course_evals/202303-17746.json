                "I really liked learning so many different facets of OT, and we were working mainly with journal articles etc. which was very beneficial. It was discussion-based, which was nice for some reasons but also a little difficult because I think I learn better from lecture-based, and I think the material was pretty dense so sometimes it was hard to learn things from primary literature instead of from lectures before reading the literature.",
                "This course is excellent, and I don't think it has any kind of weaknesses in terms of the course structure.",
                "I think the strengths of this course are that it encourages a high level of involvement. It pushes students to use critical thinking to solve problem sets (which had interesting datasets and questions), and to come up with novel analyses for the LP assignments. Some of the weaknesses lie in the structure of the class itself. Since OT was a new topic to me, I would have found it more useful for the class to be more lecture style, at least at the beginning, so we could spend more time on some of the core concepts of the theory. I think that the presence of student discussions form the start made it more difficult to get a full grasp of the framework itself. If more time was spent on basic concepts, we could have moved onto more higher level engagement later on in the class (like the discussion questions, critically engaging with the theory more). I would have also liked to read more of the foundational OT papers to see how the theory developed and changed. I also think timely feedback on the assignments (especially problem sets) would have helped with this issue as it would have helped me understand where I was going wrong in my implementation of OT/ what concepts I was misunderstanding."
