                "The course is taught in a very dry way. There is virtually no attempt to apply the concepts to real life outside of mathematics. Plus, since 85% of the final grade is based on three exams, 85% of students effort is spent cramming for said exams. In conclusion, if you like calculus, you will like this course; otherwise, avoid it. If you are unsure, take it and you will quickly figure out which side youre on.",
                "The instructor was engaging in class, especially for one taught first thing in the morning. Guided notes were very helpful in keeping up with the pace of the class.",
                "The course is well-structured with regard to the material covered by each mid-term. Further, the class explorations due every morning before class were useful in priming yourself for the day's material. It was, however, a pain to remember to do them the night before.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exams could occasionally have the odd tricky question, but they were easy to deal with if you had the concepts clear in class.",
                "The course is very well designed  the explorations, problem sets and exams definitely ensure students get a strong grasp of the material. The fact that there are multiple sections for the course allows for a fairly intimate class environment, where it is very easy to ask questions during class.",
                "This class could be improved by providing more opportunities for practice in a low stakes setting. Having graded quizzes could encourage quicker skill mastery but also provide a lower-stakes examination setting. The biggest challenge of this class was the drastic differences between exams and the rest of the class (pre-class assignments, lectures, p-sets).",
                "I found this course to be very well structured and conducive to learning and applying the material. I thought that the later sections on polar functions and polar curves were very different and not necessarily related to what we had learned up until that point. My biggest critique of the course is that the Professor Demers videos were pretty random and didn't help my understanding of the material whatsoever.",
                "The greatest strength was the level of support in this course. I appreciated the videos, office hours, and peer tutoring that this course had to offer, and took advantage of everything as often as I could. Sometimes I found that the content in the psets, textbook, and lectures didn't always line up, which was sometimes confusing. Additionally, I was weirded out by the order in how everything was taught, and it took me a long, long time to figure out why we took a sharp detour into sequences and series, for instance.",
                "The strength of this course is that it is taught in a small class which allows much better access to the professor. Some of the weaknesses of the course come from the rigidity of the curriculum.",
                "Curve exams",
                "The strengths: The instructors are always eager to help and they provide you with an abundance of resources (like classroom handouts, past exams etc). \r\nThe weaknesses: Maybe the topics go by too fast.",
                "Strengths\r\n- James Barnes and Brett Smith as lecturers, if you're lucky enough to get either of them\r\n- The friends that I made in this class\r\n- How forgiving Brett Smith is with extensions \r\n- Straightforwardness of problem sets\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- There are a lot of small assignments that are really easy to forget about... In hindsight I don't think there was any late penalty but it's frustrating at times because there are many, many tiny things that are due every week and are easy to accidentally look past or forget about",
                "It was pretty well-organized and well-structured and matched up with the textbook well.",
                "I liked it honestly. My teacher was great, some were bad tho and the inequality that caused in the course was a problem",
                "The tests are fair, the concepts you are expected to know for assessments are clear, the skeleton note packets provided in class are very helpful, and a large amount of concepts are covered without feeling overwhelming. That being said, sometimes the problem sets can be quite challenging and often contain concepts/problems that are more difficult than those seen on tests.",
                "good overall, but no feedback",
                "very good class with recourses and help nothing to change",
                "The strength is that it definitely teaches you a lot if you are willing to put in the effort. The weakness, if any, is that the department is sometimes a bit rigid and disorganized. for instance, it was quite stressful and hard to schedule a makeup exam when I was sick. Also, there's explorations due every class which is sometimes annoying/stressful. However the course gives you a lot and the psets are very very helpful in helping you better understand the topics.",
                "I wish we went slower in the class",
                "Strength: Lectures were well-organized and covered information in decent depth\r\n\r\nWeakness: No major weakness at all.",

I found the class to adequately teach calc II concepts, so that I'm comfortable to deploy them in other settings, so regardless of my few gripes about course structure and pacing, I'd still recommend it.",

                "This class is fairly challenging, but also very manageable if you work hard on the problem sets and prepare well in advance of tests. That being said, unless you need to take this class to fulfill a prerequisite or other major requirement, it might not make sense for you. If it is a requirement for you, just embrace the challenge and find a way to enjoy the journey.",
                "yes if it were required",
                "Yes but only if necessary for your field because it is hard but there is a lot of help support and resourses",
                "Definitely recommend this to a student who likes math our wants to push their math reasoning skills further, if they are willing to put in the effort and time. I was very lucky to have a great professor in my section, cause other students in 115 had worse professors and didn't have as good of an experience. Professor Barnes, however, was very clear in his explanations, and always available to explain and address questions/doubts. he is also very funny and makes classes more pleasurable. Also, his office hours were great!!!",
                "Math 115 is usually taken by students as a pre-req, but I took the course because I was interested in continuing my study of calculus. The course did not disappoint. Although the material at the start of the semester was not very interesting, the class progressively became more and more interesting as we progressed further into the semester. If you have any interest in math, I would highly recommend the course.",
