We started off with the basics of supply and demand -- which in and of itself was very helpful & interesting -- and then moved into more models of consumer / producer behavior and all the different things you could do to affect a market. I particularly liked the last part of the class when we discussed Game Theory.",

                "I learned to grapple with material that I did not understand when it was presented the first time since the lecture environment made us ingest an enormous amount of knowledge rapidly.

Beyond the material, I also learned how to learn in a big lecture environment. I think my note-taking skills improved dramatically. I learned how to study from my notes and reviewing lecture slides. I learned how to use problem sets and section to my advantage, and work with classmates. Just a great class, especially for incoming first-years who haven't taken a big lecture before.",

We learned about supply, demand, perfectly competitive markets, monopoly, oligopoly, monopsony, social welfare functions, and lots more. I feel like I have a really good foundation to work from. I also learned so much about how to learn in a big college lecture course through this class. I got a lot better at note-taking, time management, finding a study group, studying, and pacing work.",

                "This course gave my a strong understanding of the basics of microeconomics. The many, many graphs one must learn to draw for this class and how to manipulate them given a particular situation is certainly a skill I will take from this course. The course was also a review of basic algebra.\r\n\r\nI think it's fair to say that this course helped me understand how complex the decisions of firms and consumers are and the numeric and contextual information that conditions their decisions.

It was difficult at times because the problems, equations, or definitions would not really answer problems or would obviously be excluding parts of the situation, which makes it harder to understand the concept if you really break it down, but I think that is the nature of an intro course.",

                "A strength was some of the great TAs and peer tutors. Specifically, I had Rodrigo for my section and found his teaching style very engaging and helpful. I also benefitted from Aidan Lee's peer tutoring hours to go over problem sets. I also liked the way that work was managed / assigned, with manageable psets and readings each week. I think a weakness was the slightly unbalanced distribution of course difficulty. I found the first midterm very straightforward, but the second midterm was very hard for me. I think we could have used some more help / instruction to get from the first exam to the second.",
                "Using only elementary math seems like a nice concept in theory but it ends up overcomplicating some of the concepts and makes the course more difficult.",
                "Taught very well, hard content though.",
                "This course is extremely well-organized, and Cormac is a very talented lecturer. I found that lectures often went too slowly and were quite repetitive. However, it was a pretty low-stress and enjoyable class.",
                "Strengths: Well-organized, helpful sections, helpful psets\r\n\r\nWeankesses: Large, overcrowded lectures made it more pleasant to do the class virtually than in person. Also, although individual concepts were well-explained, I never felt like I understood why we were learning each concept, and how it fit into the bigger picture; I feel like I have come away with a piecewise understanding of the microeconomics, not a good, comprehensive foundation in the subject",
                "Prof Cormac is an amazing lecturer and this is a must-take course especially when it's recorded. The only real downside was that all of the TF's were foreign exchange students with thick accents and it was often hard to understand them during section/ office hrs",
                "Strenghts: Cormac O'Dean is such an amazing professor who made the lectures interesting and he is funny too. I absolutely loved having him as my professor.\r\nWeaknesses: In a large lecture setting the learning experience is a lot more on students responsibility. It might be hard to focus or be brave enough to ask questions.",
                "The course is organized very well especially considering it is such a large class. The main weakness from my point of view is the discussion sections. I attended sections taught by four different TFs, and the only section I found helpful was the one taught by the course director Dr. Morar. My regular section leader was an ineffective teacher and we never completed all of the assigned problems. I think it would be helpful for the course director and professor to sit in on some of the discussion sections and provide more feedback to the TFs.",
                "This course is perfect if you are able to learn in a large lecture. There are plenty of ways to learn outside of class as well (office hours, section, etc.) if you need some extra help.",
                "The discussion sections were a very useful part of the course, especially with Dr. Morar who cared deeply about what her students were learning. She made extra videos on the side to complement our learning which was incredible to see. The availability of peer tutor office hours was also greatly appreciated because it felt like we could almost always turn on our laptop and jump into an OH session when having difficulty with a problem set.\r\nThe course could be improved by making use of the textbook more often. There are certainly some great problems at the end of the textbook chapters which were almost never referenced or included in optional problem sets so the purchase felt wasteful.",
                "One strength is that there are a lot of resources available for students. I can honestly say that I am not able to think of any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: good lectures, solid material, fun class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: hard to tell what will be tested and what will do",
                "Strengths of this course: Cormac was a great lecturer and answered many questions. Lectures were also recorded which helped a lot. No weaknesses.",
                "I think the section teachers were very hit or miss and didn't help much. Having better section teachers would have helped. Cormac O'dea was amazing. I also loved how lectures were posted online because I could go back and watch them later as review. This was a huge help and wish other courses offered this.",
                "This course was executed relatively well for such a large lecture.  After talking to my peers in the smaller Econ 110 section I realized that would have been a better fit for me.  Personally, the content of the lecture seemed very detached from textbook and problem sets.  The lectures were not necessary nor were they beneficial to my knowledge. I found myself learning more from textbook readings and my peers.",
                "Strengths: pretty easy content. Weaknesses: TF's not the best, math will confuse you a little because they don't go over it even though it is like 6th grade math.",
                "Good course",
                "I appreciate how lectures were recorded, especially in covid times, I felt that I could watch the lectures if I didn't feel comfortable. I thought the material was presented well in lectures, and psets really helped me solidify my understanding",
                "The material was very interesting and it was taught well!",
                "Prof. O'Dea was a strength and I think the workload was fair in the class too. I think the biggest weakness is how easy it is to get disconnected from the class but I don't know how that's solved with a class so large.  Another weakness was that section was never particuarly helpful in my opinion and if it was that could make the class easier to connect with.",
                "Professor was very caring of the students.",
                "I really enjoyed the large lectures and felt like I learned a lot in each one; discussion sections were also super helpful to review the new material.",
                "I liked the structure of the course. There were ample materials for review and aid, which I really appreciated. I also enjoyed getting consistent grades through weekly problem sets, as it kept me on track in terms of reviewing course content. A weakness is that the lecture style was not always very engaging for me, but this is also due to the fact that the class was so large.",
                "The strengths: Cormac O'Dea is great. I mention it later, but just putting it here. He makes the course pretty fun. It's such a big class, especially among first-years that it's more or less a social event, which is pretty hilarious and fun. The coursework is stimulating but not too challenging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't know. I don't really have many complaints. Great class. I loved it. Tests were pretty hard. They were curved, but still a little disheartening to feel prepared and just get wrecked a little bit.",
                "The amount of support in the course is incredible, from the peer tutors, to the TFs, to the course director, and the professor. The class is incredibly interesting and very highly engaging, if you are interested in truly understanding the material. The lectures were incredible and sections were very helpful.",
                "Strengths: Cormac is a great lecturer, lectures are recorded which makes it easier to understand some of the harder topics because you can go back, depending on the TF section was also extremely helpful",
                "I thought this was a very well taught and crafted course. I didn't love the course material, and thus found it a bit difficult to remain engaged, but I don't think that was a fault of the course!",
                "Strengths: Cormac is a super engaging professor and a great intro to econ and lecture style classes. The lectures were something I always looked to. Definitely a class worth taking in my humble opinion.\r\nWeaknesses: Sections were sometimes less productive.",
                "The course was well-organized, review sessions were very helpful, and the material itself was pretty straightforward. The only downside was that it was a huge lecture, making it a little difficult to focus.",
                "Strengths: Problem sets every week to check in how well we understand the concepts taught in class.\r\n\r\nWeakness: huge lecture class, so it is hard to ask questions and stay engaged",
                "I think it is hard to understand the material in the lecture. Sections were not as helpful as I was hoping for. I often was missing the basic concepts that were brushed over to start a problem.",
                "It's a large lecture, which can cause disturbances at times. Cormac handles this extremely well, and it just comes to show how greatly this course is taught and organized.",
                "The strengths are in the lectures. I think Dr. O'Dea did a fantastic job explaining and contextualizing the content of the course. My only problem with the course was not knowing what the curve is or where I lied in the class. I think knowing your grade throughout the course would help.",
                "I would appreciate more practice, especially with difficult conceptual problems.",
                "The sections werent as helpful as they could have been since the class was so hard and confusing the instructors sometimes explained in the same way as cormac instead of a different approach.",
                "Prof. O'Dea's lectures were very well-organized and well-organized, and he worked through lots of examples for every topic, which was incredibly helpful. Problem sets were an appropriate length and difficulty, and we were given an enormous number of resources to help us prepare for the exams. I'd say the only weakness was the sections: while I had a great TF, I heard really bad things about most of the TFs being really unhelpful and explaining things.",
                "very hard to understand information and discussions sections were not helpful",
                "I  think the course was well taught. I preferred watching the lectures at 2x speed but yeah, well taught. I felt the exams were well made and tested my knowledge well.",
                "Strengths: Cormac O'Dea is a super engaging lecturer. Weaknesses: none.",
                "good explanation of the content in lectures however sections moved a bit slow and didnt cover all of the content",
                "The class was well taught and well structured. It could have been more engaging, but with basic concepts and such a big class size there's probably not much that can be done.",
                "The strengths are the layout of the course and how it logically flows from topic to topic. However, I felt the sections were quite confusing and often, the work is rushed through.",
                "The strengths were that they could be watched online, where you can control the speed of the lecture and also stop to take notes. Weaknesses were that because it is such a huge class, there is minimum individual attention even in sections.",
                "The course was well taught and lectures were engaging and clear. I think discussion sections were often not very helpful and the practice problems we did were not always helpful in furthering my understanding of the material.",
                "Professor O'Dea is a very clear and engaging lecturer. It was clear that he cared about the quality of his teaching and often grounded lecture topics in current, real-world examples. I can't think of any suggestions to improve this course.",
                "Very strong teaching and allows time for questions, also improved course based on midterm evaluations",
                "I think sections could be improved.",
                "This is a really great introductory course, accessible to students with no economics background and needing no high-level math. A strength of the course is Professor O'Dea. His entire course was incredibly organized, well thought out, and engineered to help students learn. There were tons of available resources to help learning and he made lectures super engaging. It would have been really easy for this to be a boring course in a big lecture hall, but it wasn't. One small weakness is just that it was hard to get through all the material covered in class during section, so. if you needed help, you had to tackle asking for it on your own.",
                "There are a lot of people, and that can be either a strength or a weakness for some. It was easy to get lecture material and the problem sets were not too difficult.",
                "Sometimes it was hard to keep fully engaged in the lectures because the material was not as interesting.",
                "Strengths- For a lecture format, the course is as engaging as can be\r\nWeaknesses- Tests could probably benefit from being more cumulative, because the result is that by the end of the semester I could hardly remember what we learned in the beginning of the year.",
                "Strengths: very well organized, great textbook, very clear and concise lecturer, very cool content\r\nWeaknesses: the instructor for my sections was not good -- did not offer anything more than just doing the section problems yourself",
                "Strengths: professor, low workload, good material\r\nWeaknesses: large lecture, grades depend mainly on exams",
                "The strengths of this class were definitely within the workload -- it was just the right amount and didn't feel overbearing. Also, professor O'Dea was a very clear and concise teacher, which definitely helped. A weakness of this class is probably the huge amount of people in it, and so sometimes the basics weren't always covered as in depth as some people would have liked it to be.",
                "Strengths: availability of office hours, sections, and instructor\r\nWeaknesses: I was not truly engaged since I realized I did not enjoy econ, but that is my personal experience.",
                "Strengths: as good as a large introductory lecture can get, Cormac's agreeableness and friendly nature, clear course format and organization, communication with students, recorded lectures; Weaknesses: discrepancy between content in lectures and material covered in exams (there's only so much extrapolation / application that students can reasonably do), lack of critique of the overall socioeconomic system that the field of microeconomics functions within",
                "The TF's were so different and the quality of the DS differed drastically (I went to a few different ones). Cormac is a great lecturer. There were many resources for students to use on Canvas which was helpful.",
                "Strengths: Cormac is a great professor; well organized. No weakness.",
                "The biggest weakness of this course is its size, as it is a huge lecture. But there are proportional resources to help students out. The professor, TFs and peer tutors were always readily available to help. The psets did not take too much time to complete and were not terribly difficult. The exams were hard as they were extrapolations of concepts covered in class onto new scenarios, but there were many resources to prepare for them.",
                "Strengths: taught logically, nice pace, wonderful lecturer\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: tests, at times, were pretty brutal",
                "Professor O'dea's approach to teaching and also the fact that the lecture was recorded were both strengths. One of the weaknesses is that you didn't really have to engage with econ more than three times a week (lectures and problem sets) unless you wanted which made it easy to forget material.",
                "The lectures are informative and the livestream/recordings are helpful and convenient. The problem sets are an appropriate length, and the optional questions are helpful to reduce the required time commitment but provide opportunity for further understanding. I felt feedback on problem sets could have been more informative and detailed. Discussion sections are beneficial for practice problems, but not so helpful for reviewing material.",
                "I learned more in section than I did during lecture. Problems on exams were not shown before.",
                "I think it was very impersonal teaching style and sometimes, the discussion sections were not interesting.",
                "Strengths: clear format of all lectures, problem sets successfully deepened understanding of lecture content, many study resources provided, helpful TFs and peer tutors\r\nWeaknesses: only complaint was that the second midterm seemed more like a puzzle game than a good evaluation of our understanding",
                "Strength: O'Dea is a great lecturer and does a great job explaining all of the concepts. \r\nWeakness: not the most engaging concepts, but that is to be expected of an introductory course",
                "This course is highly organized with a very friendly workload. The lecture is recorded and Cormac uploads the slides as prepared and as presented every time. With his notes on them plus the help of the recordings, the slides are extremely helpful for review.",
                "The lectures are really fast.",
                "The teacher was passionate (and funny) which made it easy to engage with the content.",
                "Strengths- online lectures \r\n\r\nWeakness- lectures feel long",
                "It is very well organized. With all the slides and recordings posted after every class.",
                "lectures online were good",
                "I thought one of the strengths of this course was the weekly lectures. I thought they were very clear and insightful. Another strength was all the materials that were provided to the students on Canvas. I found them very helpful when preparing for exams. I can't think of any weaknesses at this time.",
                "I think the primary strength of this class is how well-organized it is. There was never any lack of clarity about when assignments were due and where different documents (problem sets, practice problems, lecture slides, etc.) were located. The lectures themselves were also highly organized, and it was easy to find a particular topic within a lecture when rewatching them. Office hours were also very organized, and it was also easy to log on at a time that was convenient for me. \r\n\r\nI suppose one of the weaknesses of this class, though not really the fault of the class itself, is its size. Due to how large the class was, I felt very anonymous, and it was hard to engage with the material when it felt like no one in particular cared how I was doing in the class. The class requires you to be pretty much teach yourself a fair amount of the material, as there are so many other students in the class that you can't really find any individualized help from TAs or peer tutors. I think another weakness of the class was the sections. I think the section problems themselves were helpful to use when studying for exams, but my TA never really furthered my learning in the section, and most people viewed sections as being optional and thus would just skip, so it felt like a waste of time all around.",
                "The professor is a very skilled lecturer and can deliver course content in a way that is concise and engaging. The weekly sections aid in understanding the week's material and tackling the problem sets. I found no particular weakness in the course.",
                "The problem sets are definitely a strength of the course because they test exactly what was learned in class. The only thing that would be helpful is if there were more examples similar to the problem set done in class.",
                "The class was very good at going through important information and identifying applications, but the problem sets could have been more in-depth.",
                "Sections were not the most helpful. Basically just practice problems, not answering any questions of reviewing lecture material. Also there was not a ton of engagement with the lectures. The pollEV was definitely a strength because it made students apply what we were learning, but many times it was learning things and basically just writing it down without comprehension. Also a lot of the terms would be abbreviated rather quickly, so instead of saying the full term and learning what each curve was etc, I could get lost just because I didnt know what a certain abbreviation stood for. Also many times I was very confident in my answers, and believed they were correct on midterms etc (even sometimes seemingly the same as the answer rubric) but would be marked wrong with no explanation, and even after regrade requests were still marked wrong without ever knowing the reason.",
                "Strengths were the professor, speed of the class, consistent workload structure, access to recorded lecture materials, access to teaching fellows, and open lines of communication between the teaching staff and students. The only weakness was feedback- although there were many opportunities to meet with TF's, their feedback often seemed aimed at helping you obtain the right answer versus understanding how to get there.",
                "Strengths: Professor O'Dea was an engaging lecturer who focused on integrating the concepts into the real world, the course covered important foundational concepts, and the P-Sets were not too time-consuming but still had challenging elements. \r\nWeaknesses: the class is really big so getting individual attention can be hard",
                "I think the biggest weakness of this course was that half the class had taken an economics class before where as the other half had not. I think this made the class unfair, especially because of the way the curve works. While it was a good introductory course it was fast paced and some students were able to keep up because they had previous exposure to the material. A strength of this class was that classes were recorded.",
                "It is very clear and organized. Hoerver, it is much too mathematical and not very social, which drives many people away from the study of economics. It also moves too fast and covers too many topics at once",
                "I was in a lot of emotional distress taking this course. Not having a strong background in math or any background in economics, I had a hard time applying math to this class which lead to a lot of difficulties. That being said, I understood a lot of concepts in this course which gave me a broader view of the world, and the curve in the class gave me a lot of flexibility to make mistakes.",
                "The material could be pretty dry but I felt Cormac taught it in the most engaging way possible.",
                "Strengths: Super organized, lots of info, very flexible for self guided learning outside of class.\r\nWeakness: Nothing in particular.",
                "Strengths: A good intro class, well paced.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is huge. It can be difficult to get individualized help.",
                "This course is very organized. They have many resources for students and many office hours. It is a larger class, but every student still gets a positive experience and proper instruction.",
                "I liked the lectures, especially when we used Poll Everywhere. The peer tutor office hours were helpful but the TA office hours weren't very helpful. Professor O'Dea is a good instructor.",
                "The lectures were long and conducted in the same manner each time. I think it would be more beneficial to meet more, decrease the class time because there is much information crammed into just two days per week (excl. section), and switch up the format of class every now and then. However, if a student was unable to make a lecture or wanted to circle back to a specific lecture, it was nice that they were easily accessible online and presented in an understandable format.\r\n\r\nI also wish I could have been prepared better for the two midterms and final exam. I felt like these were much harder each time than I thought they were going to be.",
                "Strengths: I was so impressed with the curriculum and teaching of this course. The problem sets were short but effective; the lectures were engaging despite the huge class size; the slides were helpful both during and before/after lecture; the Zoom recordings were well made; the exams were challenging but fair; the discussion sections added to the class. Honestly, I loved pretty much every aspect of the class.\r\nWeaknesses: pretty much none! Sometimes the outside office hours were cold.",
                "Strengths: Amazing professor, class was very organized, lots of support. Weakness: Huge lecture environment can sometimes be difficult to learn in",
                "Strengths: very well-structured with lectures, sections, tutor office hours, and additional resources provided. Real life applications were integrated in lecture, and emphasis on building economic intuition were very helpful",
                "This course was well-taught and the material was often tied to real life scenarios. There were interesting tangents during lectures about current research in economics and the applications of this type of work. \r\n\r\nThe sections and review sessions werent always super helpful in clarifying the material because Professor ODea sometimes taught things differently than the TAs.",
                "Strengths: Cormacs a great lecturer. Weaknesses: section really varied based on who your TF was.",
                "strengths: amazing teacher, good lecture format, interesting material\r\nweakness: need more practice problems",
                "Lectures are quite engaging, and the Professor does a good job of tying the material to real world examples. The second midterm felt a bit too hard, while the first midterm felt a bit too easy, such that it is unclear what level of understanding is expected of us.",
                "The problem sets are helpful in consolidating the knowledge. The PowerPoint slides were very helpful.",
                "Strengths: professor lectures very well, problem sets are pretty easy, provides strong economic foundation\r\nWeaknesses/Areas to improve: Sections were not that helpful, review sessions were also inconsistent in quality",
                "This course was well taught. Overall I wouldn't change anything.",
                "Very well organized, lots of resources, accessible P Sets.",
                "The organization on canvas and having the lectures recorded and slides posted helped a lot. I didnt find the section useful though.",
                "The course was pretty fast paced but the content was very interesting. The review sessions for most teachers could be a bit more structured.",
                "One strength of this class is the coverage of material. One weakness was that the office hours with TAs/TFs were not very helpful and the sections are very hit or miss depending on your TA. I learned nothing from my section and very few people ever showed up.",
                "The pace of the course seemed to be uneven",
                "The course provides a broad and important introduction to economics as a whole. It is an excellent introductory course for someone who has not had any prior exposure to economics. However, the following course is extremely large, and it can be hard to keep up for those who are not used to extremely large lecture formats.",
                "I think this course can be improved by improving the sections.",
                "The strengths of this class are that its well taught and covers a lot of materials. However, in such a large class it can be hard to focus. To improve the class I would suggest doing more examples of the work in class.",
                "i think that the discussion sections were the weakness of the course and instructors often made the information more confusing rather than clarifying",
                "Despite the large nature of the class I thought the problem sets helped to solidify the information learned in lectures.",
                "I really enjoyed this course",
                "Strengths: very clear lectures, lots of office hours support, sections were helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Truly, not many. My only complaint perhaps would be that sometimes the problem sets were a little too abstract. In a perfect world, problem sets are extremely application-based rather than theoretical graphs.",
                "Lectures very good.",
                "Strengths: online recordings to wtach at a later date. \r\nWeaknesses: the TAs and section structure.",
                "The lecture is very helpful. Cormac is a very good teacher, and he makes sure to make is class entertaining and engaging. The TAs and sections, however, were not very helpful. It really depends on which section you are placed into, but mine was a complete waste of time. On the bright side, though, the course provides you with more than enough practice materials for exams, and the workload is minimal.",
                "Fantastic, engaging and passionate Professor. Course was incredibly well organised and the material was interesting and very enjoyable.",
                "Strengths: Good material that is useful in the real world \r\nWeaknesses: Not a very engaging class which i think is caused by such a big class (not really my style of learning).",
                "The course is very flexible for a course with 500 students. I'd say that section could be run a bit smoother because a lot of the sections felt unproductive. It would have been helpful to receive some feedback on problem sets and midterms as well when they were returned to us. Other than that, everything was great!",
                "Strengths were the number of topics that we covered but we did not go into that much detail in any of them. Also we were given very general advice on how to solve problems.",
                "strengths: lots of extra help\r\nweaknesses: fast pace",
                "Prof. Odea was a wonderful teacher. TAs were hit or miss.",
                "I think that one area in need of improvement is the experience at section. To be honest, I rarely got anything out of section and had to do the problems on my own. This was partly due to the fact that my section leaders did not explain the problems in an intuitive way, and sometimes were hard to understand because they did not speak english well. I think that a better experience in section would have allowed me to understand the course material significantly faster.",
                "I think its a good large lecture course. The sections worked well with the large lecture style.",
                "I actually really liked the pace of this courseit didn't go too fast or too slow. The problem sets were engaging and helped me improve my understanding of certain topics. Professor O'Dea was a great lecturer, always prepared to answer questions, and provided online access to those who were unable to attend for whatever reason. The exams were challenging but not unreasonable; if you paid attention in class and in discussion sections, you could definitely manage them. There weren't any major weaknesses to this course, although it might have been nice to see a stronger connection between lectures and discussion sections.",
                "Strengths: Professor O'Dea, the lectures, exam study resources, peer tutors. Weaknesses: sections, feedback, review sessions.",
                "Strengths: fantastic lecturer, clear expectations, reasonable workload \r\nWeaknesses: discussion sections are a toss-up (some good some bad), slightly hurried at times, limited feedback",
                "The course provided me with a great basis for microeconomics and I can confidently say that I learned more in this class than I did in any of my other ones. The strengths were that the lectures were live recorded, the slides were provided beforehand, and the professor was completely clear.",
                "Prof. ODea did a great job of engaging such a large lecture. He was the strength. Lectures were also well-organized, and the recordings helped when studying. The course material does escalate pretty quickly, and if we didnt have the lectures to rewatch, it wouldve been quite difficult to keep up. Sections and TFs were very hit-or-miss.",
                "More cohesive lesson plans from TAs - preparing for discussion sections with friends outside my own section became difficult as plans diverged.",
                "Strengths: Cormac O'Dea, availability of office hours and peer tutors, simplicity of directions, predictability of weekly schedule\r\nWeaknesses: Large class can make you feel insignificant, difficult to participate, section effectiveness varies",
                "Better TAs",
                "It was very helpful to have lectures recorded the ability to pause and rewatch enhanced my understanding of course material. Additionally, office hours were useful when I needed help on problem sets. Furthermore, Cormac O'Dea is an incredible professor and is particularly fit for such a large course. His poise and elegance for maintaining focus and attention with hundreds of students was crucial.",
                "Strengths - Professor O'Dea was without a doubt the biggest strength this course had to offer. His lecture style was easy to follow, clear, and covered the topics very well, and he was an absolute joy to listen to. Dr. Morar as my section leader was also a great strength, as she was extremely knowledgeable, clear, and concise in her explanations of relevant course content. The course was very well-organized, which also helped to expedite studying, as well as problem sets. The problem sets accurately covered the exam content. Finally, the option to take the course asynchronously was a big help in terms of study efficiency and scheduling. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - There isn't much to cover here, but the fact that the grades are curved is something I've never quite understood. We also didn't receive feedback on problem sets, so when I got some back with points taken off for \"minor errors\", I couldn't use them as a study reference to help prevent future errors from occurring. Finally, the course is a very large lecture, so it is difficult to get individual questions answered, other than in section. Professor O'Dea did a great job trying to answer every question in lecture, though.",
                "Class size is very large and pace of learning very fast, hard to get help when falling behind, even section moved at a fast pace",
                "Strengths: well-taught, numerous practice materials. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 500 person lectures suck, there's no way around it. There's very little opportunity to engage with the material in a group setting (discussion sections were pretty useless), the class is graded on a curve which promotes individualism, etc.",
                "It got a little boring just because of the lack of engagement.",
                "Its very very large, which is both a strength and a weakness. Theres so many resources available for help in the class, but I also tended to feel slightly more engaged in my seminar classes.",
                "It can be easy to disengage yourself from the content of the course. The content itself is delivered wonderfully by the professor.",
                "I thought this course was organized beautifully. O'dea is an amazing lecturer, so the larger lectures were engaging and easy to follow. The recordings are very well done too if you need to use them. There is a lot of support for students through teaching fellows and peer tutors, so despite the large size of the class, you can get all the help you need. The only weakness I can think of is that the lectures occasionally felt unsafe in terms of COVID-19. We were told to wear masks, but many students disregarded this rule completely and would come to lecture visibly ill.",
                "Very organized",
                "Strengths: thorough, mostly engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: large lecture course, difficult",
                "I thought it was fantastic. Organizationally, there were ample resources available to help in a large lecture setting, from abundant practice materials, to review sessions, to frequent office hours and accessible instructors/TF's. Lectures were coherent, and even if I struggled with the content, the lecture recordings and office hours helped me synthesize the materials I needed to. From a student-support perspective, I found it exceptional. \r\n\r\nDiscussion sections, though, didn't feel particularly useful. I didn't gain much by attending discussion sections, and oftentimes, when we asked questions, they seemed deflected or half-answered, or otherwise, the TF wouldn't know. Pre-exam review sessions were also hit-or-miss: some were particularly useful, while others were monotonous because they didn't have a plan or covered content that wasn't of concern. I am glad that review sessions occurred because they helped me contextualize and understand examinable content.",
                "One thing that was both a strength and weakness was that lectures were recorded. Because they were recorded I was able to go back and rewatch the lectures in which certain concepts were taught in order to strengthen my understanding of the topic, but also when I fell behind, I got into a bad habit of just relying on the recorded lectures instead of going to class.",
                "I appreciated how little requirements there were for the course, I thought that the weekly problem set was enough. However, it led to me being out of touch with the class because often there was little I could do, and I often forgot to study, reiew, or engage with the content",
                "Professor ODea was an excellent teacher for this course. I think the course could be improved by being less exam-focused.",
                "Professor Cormac made the course incredibly interesting.",
                "Make grading standards less rigid. Emphasize understanding of material and course content not simple mentions of buzzwords / matching the rubric.",
                "The math and more explanation regarding the theory of concepts. It was very difficult to follow these more complicated ideas such as Monopsony",
                "Strength: The lectures were well mapped out and organised.\r\nWeakness: Some subtleties could have been explained better, lectures could have gone through more problem examples.",
                "Great course",
                "Great lectures - very glad that they were recorded. Recordings facilitated my studying a lot.",
                "I liked the weekly p-sets because they were a good way to make sure you never fell too far behind in the course. A weakness was that even if they took points off on the problem set they wouldn't say why so you received no feedback on them.",
                "Lecture format didnt provide good teChing",
                "Cormac is amazing! Best lecturer possible for such a class. The class size is bug but the slides, lecture recording and peer tutoring made it absolutely doable to learn well",
                "Strengths: Extremely well-organized, lectures were clear, topics well-explained, textbook and problem sets allowed for additional practice and resources, & Professor ODea was an engaging, clear lecturer",
                "I really enjoyed how content was available online, including lectures, past exams, and problem sets. This meant that I could engage more with the content of the class and ensure that I learnt the course effectively.",
                "I love the large lecture setting and the weekly sections. I think the problem sets were excellent practice for the exams",
                "There were a few concepts that I didn't fully grasp after lecture, but discussion section and officer hours were extremely helpful ways to fill in any gaps in my knowledge. I was impressed by how the content was prepared in lecture and then reinforced in section, but I know that many people were not too satisfied with their section. I saw why when it came time for the review sessions before exams, and some of the TFs appeared unprepared.",
                "Strengths- the many formats in which the material can be seen (in-person lectures, recorded lectures, live-stream); the emphasis that the course has on economic intuition as opposed to memorization of the material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- some of the TFs explain material in different, contradictory ways to how we learned the material in the main lecture",
                "Strengths: Cormac O'Dea was a GREAT professor. His slides were very clear (good organizational structure for each lecture) and he explained concepts well. The review at the beginning of each lecture of what we had done in the past was super helpful to synthesize and recap knowledge. Also, I liked when he drew out graphs and explained them as he went. The Canvas page was very well organized and Prof. O'Dea was prompt with putting up lecture slides and review material. The optional Pset questions were also helpful because I could go back and do them before exams, but not be worried about perfecting them for submission that week. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was a lot of memorization for the exams (and they could be difficult, but the class is curved). Also, it was a very large course, as is the nature of ECON 115. I didn't go to the in-person lectures at all, but watching the video recordings of the lectures was just as good (and in some cases, even better so I could pause the lecture and take a break). But because of that, it was easy to fall behind in the lectures.",
                "I thogijt the way the course was taught was confusing. Not many practice examples were done in class.",
                "nope",
                "Sections should not be mandatory",
                "Strengths: Lectures were very engaging and helpful. Peer tutors were an amazing resource. Problem sets helped to challenge students. Weaknesses: Getting a good teaching fellow for this class was a luck of the draw. I had a horrible teaching fellow for the first part of the semester, and by the end of the semester only 1-2 students ended up showing up because of how bad they were. They need to prepare all teaching fellows with the same skills and knowledge necessary to properly teach.",
                "I think that I didn't find myself engaged with the subject matter a lot, and maybe more interactive study methods in section would have helped with that.",
                "I think that the course was very good for the most part. I thought that the lectures were very good, the peer tutors were helpful, and the sections were sometimes helpful. I think that the lectures were run just about as well as they could have been. I appreciated that they were recorded, too, which helped with study/review. Whenever I had a question, usually felt like I could resolve the issue by attending office hours. However, sections were not always as useful. Though we were given practice problems during section, it was difficult to have my specific questions answered or concepts explained.",
                "Biggest strength is in the psets, they do a great job at moving through the content and giving fair questions that walk through the week's lectures. Made it feel very manageable, especially with the drop any two psets. They were a huge aid in studying for the exams.",
                "despite the course being very large, there were many resources available to help students succeed",
                "I think it could be improved by doing more examples is class or going over the tough test question from the last problem set at the beginning of class.",
                "Many concepts were not fully explained and presentation was not the clearest.",
                "I liked the lectures and the tutors were helpful. I do think some of the practice exam had content we didnt learn in class and it would have been nice to have more practice problems.",
                "I really enjoyed the material. I feel sometimes the course was over complicated on topics that have simple explanations",
                "It can be improved with more practice problems and bettering the sessions.",
                "S: Teacher was easy to follow and very good at accepting feedback and understanding.",
                "Strengths: many resources to offer help when needed. Weaknesses: is a lecture course so harder to stay engaged",
                "The courses strengths are the quality of the instruction, the engaging was of the class. A weakness (potentially unavoidable), is the class size makes it difficult to completely engage with the main instructor. However, that is also a facet of it being such a large class.",
                "Moved through the material very fast.",
                "The TFs should be more aligned with the course material. Often, what we learned in class was not taught the same way in section, and the TFs did not seem to know what we learned in class.",
                "Big lecture class; in terms of accessing resources, it was good. I did however feel lost from time to time",
                "The strengths of this course are that the professor explains things very well, the lectures are zoom recorded, and my section leader is amazing. The only weakness is that there aren't a whole lot of other ways to be evaluated for a grade outside of the two tests and doing the weekly problem set.",
                "Great course overall.",
                "Strengths are that the slides are very helpful and the TFs are helpful. The weakness is that the class is so big it is easy to not pay attention.",
                "Strength- solid workload\r\nWeakness- sections seem pointless",
                "Stengths: professor Odea is very engaging and makes the information feel relevant\r\n\r\nweekensses: sections suck",
                "As the course is a very large lecture, the weekly sections play a very important role in implementing the theoretical skills into algebraic or numerical examples. The textbook could be better incorporated into the course and additional practice problems posted for every lecture, so that you dont easily run out of exercises.",
                "I think the slides that summarized a lecture quickly at the end (one slide per topic) would be beneficial.",
                "TA program is good. Could have better explanations of certain concepts that with more practical examples.",
                "Strengths: Professor ODea is an excellent teacher. Lectures are clear and informative, and psets helped me build an understanding of the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was unclear what role the textbook served in the course. The lecture slides and additional materials were more than sufficient for learning the course material. Perhaps it would be helpful to treat the textbook as optional reading material instead of required course material.",
                "Strengths: Clear expectations, consistent and predictable workload, recorded lectures, and many resources to turn to for help (e.g. sections, office hours)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "Strengths: moves at a manageable pace, there were reviews at the beginning of every lecture because it kept building throughout the course, manageable workload and relevant topics (never felt like the material was unnecessary)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion sections were not helpful or greatly varied by the assigned teacher, no feedback was easily accessible likely just due to the large class size",
                "Evaluation types of units were easier for me, some conceptual things were more challenging.",
                "Great professor, but it was hard to tell how one was doing at any point in the course because of the curve, and no updates on grades.",
                "Some strengths were in having the lectures online, as well as having optional problems on the problem sets so thst u could review more material I was confused with. Some weaknesses were in the teaching fellows who often times did not speak English very well (in my experience) and would therefore confuse themselves in the process of explaining Econ as well confuse me and my peers. This was extremely frustrating, as I would go to office hours, and often leave more confused than I started. So, I think there needs to be more attention in the selection process of TFs.",
                "Lectures are recorded which was useful for midterm/final preparation. PPTs are also available on canvas, which help you to prepare in advance for lectures. Although the discussion sections were great for individual attention, the large size of the lecture hall (~500 students) sometimes made it hard to concentrate.",
                "Strengths: The slides were an excellent resource, tons of support was offered to those who sought it out (so many office hours, review sessions, practice tests, etc.), Cormac has a gift for explaining concepts in simple ways, Psets reinforced concepts from class without being too strenuous, the recordings were very high-quality, class was super organized (really appreciated the short outline offered at the beginning of every lecture), I liked the inclusion of economic research into class when it was appropriate. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: TFs are very hit-or-miss. Also, I know online finals put the teaching staff in a very hard spot but there didnt seem to be super robust protections against cheating on the final. Forcing students to take the test in lockdown browser and to put their phones on camera in Zoom mightve helped. I worry about the curve on the final being distorted.",
                "The strength of the class was most definitely the professor, Professor Cormac O'Dea, who organized the lectures in such a way that it was fun to learn the material and provided a wide array of real-life examples of the material of each lecture before each class. There was also a great amount of resources available to all students. A weakness was the structure of discussion sections, and I would stress that it really does matter who your TA is and attendance is very helpful!",
                "The courses content was presented in a logical manner - starting with very general notions common to microeconomics and macroeconomics before a deeper dive into consumer/producer theory and then a discussion about market failures. I really appreciated the courses lack of bias towards a particular economic system and Cormacs acknowledgment of the benefits and shortcomings of many common ones. However, I feel that the pacing was not entirely ideal. Certain topics - particularly those in the last few weeks - felt a bit rushed compared to those at the beginning of the year, which perhaps required less thorough explanations.",
                "Very well taught course. Content was straightforward and cohesive. The large lecture setting made it so that your level of engagement was 100% determined by the individual though.",
                "Great professor, only problem is that the clas is really big",
                "There is very little engagement with the teaching fellows and it is detrimental to the education of the students.",
                "more tutoring hours not during athletic practice times",
                "-Strengths: the professor\r\n-Weaknesses: the size of the class",
                "I had a great experience! My one suggestion is, even once pandemic restrictions expire, to continue recording lectures for later review. The amount of material covered in this course is daunting, and my note-taking improved dramatically once I availed of myself of the option to pause and catch up when I needed to. I would've been fine either way, but it was certainly nice, and I encourage you to consider conserving the option.",
                "The professor was very good at teaching concepts clearly, but the pace of the course requires a lot of outside preparation as well.",
                "Strengths include how well-organized it is. Weaknesses include the breath of material we need to cover over the short period.",
                "I really liked the lectures. Section could be improved.",
                "Lectures were fun",
                "My TF wasn't particularly engaging, so the class often felt very impersonal. The lectures were of high quality and the tests felt fair, though. I really liked the recorded lectures.",
                "strengths: lectures thorough, discussion section questions helpful\r\nweaknesses: some gaps in knowledge not clarified",
                "Strengths - definitely the course format. I think many people really benefited from the discussion sections especially and working through those problems personally helped a lot with revision. Also how well lectures were recorded - when I unfortunately missed one or two lectures during the semester, I found that my notes were as good if not better after watching recordings of those lectures because all the slides were posted, annotated etc. (which wasn't the case with any of my other courses). Especially for a large class, I really appreciated that.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - can't really think of any. I wholly enjoyed the course, perhaps a little more focus on the mathematical aspects would have been nice (for example, I feel like a lot of the questions in review sections were because of us not grasping the maths side of the topics but I understand that with the pacing already structured so well, adding an emphasis such as this might be difficult.",
                "Strengths: Recorded lectures, real life examples used to illustrate abstract topics, plenty of office hours",
                "Strengths - great professor, great lecture slides, it was very helpful that the course lectures were recorded so revising for the exam was very easy\r\nWeaknesses- sometimes the material tested on the exams felt like it wasn't covered in the lectures. Midterm 2 especially seemed out of the course's scope",
                "Strengths: very good teacher, engaging lectures, easy to understand, contents clearly explained, interesting topics",
                "Couldve gone slower",
                "The class was very well organized, and I felt very supported even though it was a large intro class. I appreciated the sheer number of office hours and review sessions, and I found that Professor O'Dea, Dr. Morar and all of the TAs were very approachable.",
                "The lectures are long and fast-paced, but the material isn't too hard to study on your own and develop a better understanding of the material.",
                "Strengths: Organised and consistent schedule structure. Sometimes excellent teaching assistants; sometimes not always the greatest help. Lectures are enjoyable and very well taught. Workload is not unnecessarily heavy or over-the-top. Weekly discussion sections are particularly helpful for the final exam. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Past exams not easy to find, and often not enough are provided before tests for practice - especially when tests are very particular. Sometimes office hours for teaching assistants are not the most helpful or well-explained - it might be easier to have a source to send questions to before meeting them.",
                "Strengths - love that there is a lecture and discussion section, that is incredibly helpful\r\nWeaknesses - discussion sections should be longer so we can actually cover all of the information we are setting to cover",
                "Very strong class with good in-person lectures. Problem sets are helpful and good for exams.",
                "I don't think there is much wrong with this class. It was an ideal lecture class.",
                "I would hope to see more engaging lectures, more explanations of how the following material connects back to the material already learnt rather than simply reading from the slides. Yet, I believe Professor O'Dea did an excellent job with this course and I am very thankful for such a great introduction to Economics!",
                "Strengths: all material is in the lectures and the lectures are recorded and posted online, along with practice problems and old exams, knowledge is very relevant to real world. Weaknesses: the material is kind of dry. Personally, I found the material difficult and somewhat boring, but highly important to understand. I fell asleep in class frequently. The format is the same from lecture to lecture, which can limit engagement. In the beginning of the semester, there were few worked examples in lecture, but Cormac took student feedback and improved this over the semester. Oftentimes, the material felt too fast-paced for me to ask a question. Very little feedback is provided on problemsets, so it's hard to know exactly how you need to improve. I would've liked to see clearer problemset feedback.",
                "Professor is great and clearly cares about the students but the class is a little impersonal because of how big it is",
                "Strengths - Professor ODea is highly organized, attentive to detail, and prepared. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Limited opportunities for individualized attention, and challenging to cover so much content during lecture.",
                "Very well structured. Lots of resources.",
                "I really loved this course! I think Professor O'Dea was a very engaging lecturer and explained concepts really well. I appreciated how after our midterm course evaluation, he began to incorporate more algebraic examples into our lectures because that helped me understand and tackle the problem sets more efficiently. I also appreciated how many office hours and peer tutors were available to me. Pretty much whenever I was working on a Pset, if I had a question, I could log onto canvas and find a tutoring session that was currently live on zoom at the moment when I needed help. I also really liked having access to previous exams because I found doing old problems was one of the best ways to study. I also really loved the review sessions, those always clarified for me what would be examined, what I needed to study more in-depth, and what topics I felt comfortable with.",
                "Strength: I truly feel like I mastered the material and understand the basics of microeconomics\r\nWeakness: At times the material and lectures could be dull and tedious",
                "Strengths: I felt that there were ample resources students could reach out to for help on problem sets and exam preparation, including numerous TA and Peer Tutor Office Hours. I also liked the online nature of the class, where lectures were recorded and office hours were held online, provided students greater accessibility to learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that there was a great disparity in the quality of TA's lessons; those with TAs who invested more time into the course benefitted substantially. In addition, I felt that exam material could test not just mathematical understanding but conceptual understanding.",
                "A strength in this course was the many office hours offered throughout the week, which were really helpful in order to ask questions, discuss topics seen in class, and work on problems that were confusing.",
                "Very straightforward about when things were due, where and when exams were, and what was expected from sections. The huge lecture style made it difficult for me to pay attention sometimes, but is necessary with such a large class",
                "Strengths: excellent lectures, problem sets apply course material, exams are reasonably difficult, there are many opportunities for extra help (office hours with the professor, TAs, and peer tutors)\r\nWeaknesses: size of the class, lack of clear feedback on what errors were made on psets and exams",
                "My strengths were participating in lectures and working with my peers on problems sets and exams. My weaknesses were reaching out to the professor and TA's when I needed extra help. For the future, in big lecture classes, I need to be more on top of the task of reaching out, not to my peers, but to the TA's and my professor when I'm struggling with a concept.",
                "The course is very well-designed, and there really were not any issues with the way it was carried out.",
                "The strengths are that it builds a very solid foundation of the course, and there are many office hours to attend if there are any questions. However, because it is such a large lecture, I found it difficult to stay focused during lectures at times, and possibly lowering the capacity could help with that.",
                "Even though I attended almost every lecture in person and when the sections, the single Pset per week caused me to fall behind conceptually since I didn't do much work outside of the course except to finish the PSet. Maybe splitting up the PSet into two parts and assigning them for different days would create a more balanced learning experience.",
                "A great strength was the constant opportunities to practice concepts talked about in lectures. The nature of the class, being so large, is oftentimes tough for students. Connection with professors has helped me with understanding concepts in other courses, and it was tough to create those connections in such a large class, where there was a more social aversion to participating.",
                "I think it is hard to stay engaged overall with such a big lecture setting",
                "I actually think the lecture format worked really well for me for delivering material. It was nice to have clear slides/notes/videos to look back on for each specific thing we learned. A bunch of office hours and tf sections meant there were good ways to get help.",
                "Strengths: pretty engaging lecture, lots of office hours\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: in lecture we only learned the concepts and didn't focus on how to apply them, which was supposed to be taught in our sections but wasn't done very well. I found myself understanding the concepts of the course but unable to do the p-sets or exam material, which was frustrating.",
                "Prof. O'Dea was a strength. He is a wonderful professor who will lend a hand and send a quick, detailed email whenever necessary. Weaknesses were that sometimes both problem set and test questions were hard to comprehend."

                "Yes! People take this course for so many reasons  I took it because I didn't know any econ and wanted to take a useful class that would use my brain somewhat quantitatively.",
                "Yes; of the two options for introductory microeconomics, this seems like the better choice.",
                "TAKE IT IF CORMAC IS TEACHING IT! He is a fantastic lecturer and clearly cares about his students. This year the course was recorded and posted online which was extremely helpful as well",

                "Yes, I think the class is taught well for a lecture, and it teaches skills in quantitative reasoning that are useful for understanding the world. I also think that there is a level of human-ness that is provided by the support of peer tutors, the professor, and the discussion section leaders, that many QR classes don't have, that I appreciate.",

                "100 percent yes. Even if you are not interested in an economics major, this class teaches things that are applicable to everyday life.",
                "For students who want a straightforward, comprehensive introduction to economics, this is a great start. An impressive variety of topics are taught and the real-world implications are underlined frequently.",

                "The material of the class was important and a foundation for the rest of economics, but it was not the most exciting or interesting class.",
                "Yes, this course is a great intro to microeconomics. You will learn a lot and the material is enjoyable.",
                "Yes I would highly recommend this course to another student. I think this course is great for students just wanting an overview of microeconomics.",
                "Yes, it is a very good introduction to economics and a good test to see if it is a field that you might be interested in pursuing.",
                "No.  This course was useless. I was hoping to receive a good introduction into supply and demand, and instead I got a few clumsy explanations.",
                "Yes. Everyone needs Econ in their lives.",
                "Yes",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it was fascinating to learn about how firms, individuals, and markets function using graphs and math as well as intuition.",
                "Yeah if you wanna take Econ you have to and it's fine. Also if you're looking for a QR, there are easier ones out there but this isn't too bad and is a nice way to also get the credit and do something that's a prerequisite for lots of other stuff.",

                "I would recommend this course, as I think it is a great foundational class to understand economics. My only complaint would be that it felt as if students who had previously taken econ classes were very ahead of other students in terms of understanding the content. For me, everything was new, but for some of my peers, it was mostly a review of content that they had learned in the past.",
                "I would highly recommend. Just a great introductory class. Not too hard, very fun, and teaches a lot of valuable study skills.",

                "I would definitely recommend even if you are not looking to major in economics. It is a useful introduction to the subject and Cormac was a really great professor - honestly pretty entertaining lectures overall. It was a class I always looked forward to and a great way to bond with lots of other first years!",
                "I would definitely recommend this as a starting point for anyone looking to study economics or just to get a taste of what economics is. It is catered to a variety of individuals, meaning that there is not need for a background in the subject area.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes.  This class gives you a basic understanding of how taxes, monopoly etc, works. Even if you are not interested in economics, you will learn something helpful in this class.",
                "Yes, I believe it is a vital course in establishing basic economic concepts.",

                "I would if they have a background in economics because if you dont you have to do a lot of outside work.",
                "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class with Prof. O'Dea. His lectures are incredibly good: the explanations are clear, he works through lots of examples, and he's funny and engaging (which can be tough in a class of 500+ students). Put simply, I looked forward to coming to this class each time. Additionally, the workload was very consistent and manageable - problem sets were not incredibly long, and they did a good job of cementing the topics we'd learned in the lectures.",
                "no unless you like economics and math",
                "Yes, but specifically with Professor O'Dea. I believe that if it weren't for his teaching, I would have strongly disliked the class.",
                "Yes. As someone who was interested in pursuing econ as a major it was incredible. If you're not, the combination of it being an interesting subject, fairly simple to learn, and a strong instructor makes it worth it. I would avoid 115 specifically if you don't want a big lecture because it's literally 500 people but I didn't mind that.",

                "If they have interest in economics, this is a good intro course!",
                "Yes. It's an interesting course that was taught well, and the content is interesting whether or not you want to major in economics.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student as it is an interesting, and real-life applicable course which you do not need prior economics knowledge for.",
                "Yes, if you have to take this course as a prereq, you'll take it anyways. If not, might not take it, just because to grasp a good understanding of econ, this course alone is not enough.",
                "I would only recommend this course to econ majors to be honest because although I definitely learned a lot I also did not enjoy the course content that much to be honest.",
                "If you're interested in economics, this is definitely a very good introduction. I've heard some horror stories about the other professors that teach this class, but Professor O'Dea was one of the best professors I've had thus far at Yale.",
                "Yes, strong introductory economics course",
                "If you are interested in economics then I would recommend but if not no.",
                "I was recommended to take ECON 108 -- but 115 was totally fine. You don't need any background in calc/higher level math to do well in this class. I'm not hugely interested in Econ, but given that, Cormac does a fantastic job. He's a great lecturer and very organized and empathetic to students!",
                "Yes, the professor is great",
                "I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in economics or looking for an interesting QR credit. I learned a bunch and it wasn't an incredible amount of work.",
                "Yes, especially if you are interested in basic/intro economics.",
                "Although intro classes are not always the most interesting, I would absolutely recommend this class to students as it teaches fundamental concepts that are very important for life. Economics is one of those classes I think everyone should take at some point in their life.",

                "Yes. Very well organized.",
                "Yes! Whether you are econ major or not, this is a great course that will help you think differently about the world and make you realize how much economics truly infiltrates your everyday life.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in economics and are thinking about pursuing this major.",
                "Why not, it is an introductory course.",
                "Absolutely. The curve is awesome and psets are easy and graded super easily (plus you can literally drop the two lowest). I found the lecture to be super fun and I absolutely loved Cormac.",
                "I took this course as a major requirement, as was the case with many other students. It's not too bad as an introductory lecture course, especially because nearly a third of the first-year class seems to be taking it. I did learn a lot of technical skills and microeconomic course content in the class (as this was my first ever econ class). It wasn't a transcendent learning experience, but it did provide a lot of context as to how the economy functions as I continue to critique and question systems of power and wealth.",
                "Yes. Though maybe only if Cormac is teaching it.",
                "Yes if you are interested in the world or economics or how people make decisions.",
                "Yes. Its an interesting introduction to economic concepts. If you are a STEM major and need to get a social science requirement, this course actually involves a lot of math (though it is pretty simple).",
                "If they're interested in learning the basics of microeconomics, it's an essential. Try to take the class during a year when Professor O'dea is teaching.",
                "Definitely. With no prior experience in economics, I found this course manageable and the material very understandable.",
                "Yes, even though it's just a requirement for many majors/tracks, it was taught very well. It's challenging enough to be interesting, but not get totally lost. If you're looking for a QR credit, though, I think there are easier ones.",
                "Yes, but only if necessary. You will not learn anything riveting in this class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone whos even remotely interested in (or even suspicious about!) econ. I didnt like econ at all before I took it and Im not sure I do now. But Im glad I took it as this course really taught me new ways to look at the world, which I think everyone should at least be open to learn about.",
                "I would if you need econ courses",
                "Yes! The teacher was amazing, and the content was interesting.",
                "Only if its required for their major",
                "Yes! Learned a lot about the actual material as well as study/learning methods.",
                "yes",
                "I would recommend this course to another student looking to gain a basic understanding of economics. It's very well taught and will be very useful, especially for prospective economics majors.",
                "I think if you are simply looking for an easy QR class, this is not the course for you; it is not easy and requires a fair amount of effort to be successful in the class. However, I think the concepts the class teaches are ones that everyone should at least have some understanding of as an informed citizen of the world. So, yes, I do recommend this class, but students should not expect it to be a walk in the park even if they are strong at math.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any Yale student. In fact, I view it as an essential course that all undergraduates should take irrespective of major. The course gives a foundational understanding of economics that will be helpful in understanding real life consumer theory.",
                "Yes! Cormac is a great lecturer and this is a good introduction to microeconomics. There's plenty of opportunities for extra help if you need it.",
                "Yes, it is a great introduction course especially since it is a large lecture. The content of the course is also very basic and fundamental knowledge which is beneficial to everyone.",
                "No, doing ECON is just not worth it because it is horribly dull and you will either want to credit D Fail or drop it if you don't really care for it..",
                "Yes, I would recommend because the fundamental skills of economics are taught in this course, and in an engaging manner.",
                "I think it is necessary as an intro course, but there were many parts of the course that really frustrated me (especially with grading and mistakes in PowerPoints or grading rubrics).",
                "Yes, because it is a great foundational course to have. No, because econ as a subject is terrible :)",
                "Yes, if you need a QR and/or need the class for a prerequisite. I'm not sure if I'd recommend it for students purely interested in studying economics for an intellectual challenge, and might recommend the smaller seminar (Econ 110) instead, but I don't have experience with that class so I can't say for sure. Professor O'Dea put a lot of effort into making the big lectures as interpersonal and interesting as possible, which I appreciate.",
                "I would. It is a good introductory course to the economics faculty at yale and it shows some clear concepts that one would study if one pursues the major.",
                "Yes! This course, at least when taught by Prof. O'Dea, is great for students who aren't big on STEM to learn about how the world works through an econ lens. The curve makes it hard to get less than a B+, so I would definitely recommend as a QR and just a good way to gain econ literacy.",
                "If you are curious about economics, especially microecon, then definitely. Otherwise, the material will probably be pretty boring. Cormac teaches at a reasonable pace and does his best to show real-world applications of what we learn",
                "Yes, so long as they like being in a huge lecture. Its a good intro class and isnt too difficult.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, if you like econ or think you might like it. The psets don't take too long to do (2-3 hours/week if you do both the required and optional questions). Professor O'Dea is a good teacher and explains things clearly.",
                "If he/she needs it for his/her major then yes, but I did not particularly enjoy this course.",
                "Yes, absolutely. I think this course teaches skills that every educated citizen/voter should have, and it was done very well.",
                "Definitely! The course was organized very well, and the professor was amazing! You will learn a lot about the basics of economics with this course.",
                "Most definitely. Even if you aren't an econ major, it teaches you a way of analyzing problems.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, if youre looking for an introduction to the field of econ. Professor ODea is a great professor. I think its great to have a foundation in this area, but also make sure youre doing your own thinking about how the models you look at in class can play out in real life.",
                "Yes! Great introductory course to micro.",
                "Yes this class was great and engaging. You dont even need to be an econ major to emit this course, you meant a lot about how society works.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend taking this course if you need to take micro for a major or if you just want a strong introduction to economics.",
                "This class is a great foundation for further economics at Yale College. I certainly would recommend it.",
                "I would recommend the course to another student if the student would like to gain a very basic understanding of microeconomics.",
                "Yes - it allows you to understand microeconomics very well and provides a strong foundation for moving to other economics courses",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. Everyone should take some econ. This course won't blow your mind, but it's a very solid, comprehensive intro into an important topic.",
                "Yes. Micro is essential to start thinking like an economist, a rather useful way of viewing the world.",
                "Yes, it provides a great introduction to economics.",
                "Yes, only if they plan to major in Econ or take more Econ classes. It is definitely not a gut or a course just to take for the QR credityou must be somewhat interested in the material.",
                "yeah i would, it it good to get an introduction to economics",
                "Yes, it isnt much work, and the material is very interesting.",
                "Yes. Despite having no prior introduction to economics and as someone who does not intend to be an economics major, the skills that were taught in the following course were extremely important and truly changed my worldview and conceptual understanding of fundamental economics. It teaches important fundamental skills that are extremely applicable to real-world settings. I would highly recommend this course to anyone.",
                "yes I would, odea was an amazing professor",
                "Yes, I would it is a great introduction to Microeconomics.",
                "If someone is looking to get a taste of economics to see if it interests them, I would recommend this class.",
                "yes. beneficial as introduction to economic concepts",
                "I would as this was a good way to learn introductory microeconomics.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes. It is essential for thinking economically and it was wonderfully taught.",
                "I would not recommend it as an easy QR req, which was what I was looking for in this class.",
                "Yes if you want to learn more about the decision-making process in a mathematical way. No if you are looking for an easy A as a QR.",
                "Yes, particularly with Professor ODea! The lectures were always fun, the exams were fair and there were so many great resources on offer to help aid improvement from peer tutors to Professor office hours.",
                "As a baseline for economics, yes. If you are wanting to be an Econ major I highly recommend it but if not I wouldnt say it is super necessary to take.",
                "This course requires a lot of self-teaching, with the right initiative anyone can handle it, but it will require work.",
                "I would recommend this course to those who have an interest in the subject. It's not an easy QR code, but if you are interested in majors that use or require these skills, obviously you should take the class, and it's not a bad class.",
                "I would recommend this course even if they are only slightly interested, because this is valuable knowledge to have.",
                "yes, if you are thinking of declaring your major in economics",
                "Yes. I think the material was very useful and the professor was great.",
                "Yes, I think this is a good course if you are interested in economics.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students, especially if they are considering economics as their major. It is a great introduction to microeconomics and it will help you see what you're going to get yourself into.",
                "If you are interested in microeconomics absolutely. Professor O'Dea is an amazing teacher and the class is superbly well run and with abundant resources.",
                "Certainly, as a major requirement or just if youre interested.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in economics and learning more about markets.",
                "I think everyone should take intro micro, regardless of your interests or intended major.",
                "Yes- the course serves as a good foundation in economics at yale, and I feel it prepared me for  the possibility of taking other economics courses. Professor ODea is very knowledgeable and made the lecture as engaging and informational as possible given the size of the course.",
                "I would recommend this course because I think it is a great introduction to microeconomics, which is exactly what is promises. If the name sounds promising, it's definitely worth taking. That being said, someone who's not interested in economics should not take this class. It can be very dull if you don't like the general subject.",
                "Yes, because it can be used for a lot of things.",
                "Absolutely, especially with Cormac O'Dea as the professor. It is a foundational course regardless of your major and will provide key frameworks for understanding the world we live in.",
                "Absolutely, especially if your major is pertinent to economics. Professor O'Dea made the course enjoyable and easy to follow, and the course content was interesting and quite painless, especially for a QR credit. Microecon is a great course to take if you're looking to better understand the world around you, as well.",
                "Yes",
                "If you want a basic foundation in econ/need it as a prereq, sure. Because of the curve, I think you can save yourself a lot of headache by taking it credit/d or auditing it.",
                "I would, especially because the knowledge gained applies to many things outside of the class and in the real world.",
                "Yes. It is a good into to econ. The professor is also a very good lecturer.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. It is a great way to get an easy QR credit, and it was the course that made me want to be an economics major. You learn a lot (particularly with O'dea), and the workload is very easy to handle. All the problem sets were graded based on completion and only took about an hour or two each. The tests were a little difficult, but the curve is very generous. Overall, it was one of my favorite classes this semester.",
                "yes because it is a good entry level course",
                "I would only recommend to someone who needs to take it.",
                "Yes, very much so. Partly because it's a prerequisite and a solid foundation for several social science majors, but also because it develops a mode of thinking that I find useful as a consumer and a member of society. The course provides insight into foundational structures and interactions that occur in economies, so I'd recommend it to anyone interested in a social science-adjacent discipline or for an interesting class at all.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course because it was interesting to be a part of an experience shared by so many members of my first year class. it also is a good introduction to economics and I'm sure it inspired many people to want to pursue the subject and also helped people realize that it was not something they wanted to further pursue.",
                "Yes",
                "If youre looking for an easy QR, look elsewhere, but if you want to learn something useful and somewhat challenging, this course is a good fit.",
                "If its with Professor ODea, absolutely. Otherwise, it depends whether you think a basic economic intuition would be useful for you.",
                "Grading is somewhat unpredictable especially in the second midterm. Only take the course if you need it for a major.",
                "No I would not simply because it was extremely difficult for me to get through and hard for me to focus on since I wasnt as interested in the subject matter.",
                "Yes, if its required.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. Great to have a basic understanding of economics no matter what major you are in.",
                "Eh it was a good course if you're interested in econ, but I wouldn't say it was life changing. Very mediocre in most ways. The lectures are super large so it's easy to fall behind and stop going or just not pay attention. Some sections/teaching fellows are good and some aren't. There are a lot of office hours, but they are also just hit or miss. All in all, I would say it's a fine course but nothing special.",
                "Yes to learn econ",
                "Yes absolutely! Its a very cool combination of sociological thinking and math (easy algebra) so its intellectually engaging. It may seem sterile at times but its the starting tools needed to access the more interesting econ topics.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would very much recommend this course because of how it provides a very good foundation for the future economics I will learn throughout college.",
                "Yes! I think all undergraduates should take this course because it is widely applicable to other courses and everyday life",
                "Yes, even if you aren't interested in microeconomics. It is a pretty easy QR credit, and I thoroughly enjoyed the concepts we learned.",
                "Yes- as an introductory economics course, it is clear cut and helps establish a good foundation for future courses in economics. The problem sets are accessible, and there is lots of academic support.",
                "Yes, particularly with Prof. O'Dea. With O'Dea, lectures are clear and well taught, Psets are (usually) just long enough to encompass the material without feeling so excessive. As someone who had never taken economics before, I actually learned a lot in this course!",
                "Yes just because its micro and its useful",
                "no",
                "Yes, if you want to learn about microeconomics or if it's a prerequisite. This will be a good start to learning about economics and if it's a subject you want to study.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in Economics.",
                "Yes, absolutely. This course taught me to think about the world in a new way, and I think other students would profit from a base understanding of economics, even if theyre not planning to major in economics.",
                "If you have any sort of interest in figuring out economy-related news articles, I think this class is a great place to start. Good intro to terminology.",
                "if you are interested in economics, then you should definitely take this course!",
                "Yes. I thought it was a interesting class if one wants to learn about markets and the economy which I believe everyone should.",
                "No",
                "I think its a good introduction to economics, but it takes a while to get used to the lecture format.",
                "yeah, was fun and was a good introduction to economics",
                "Yes I would. Especially if you are Interested in economics it is a great place to start your understanding",
                "Yes I think it is a great course that can improve your learning in seminar skills and provides interesting content.",
                "Yes, I like McCormac.",
                "Yes. Even if u are not majoring in econ this is a good course to take to learn the basics of economics",
                "Yes. It is a great course for introducing yourself yourself to economic theory and gauging whether or not economics is a potential field of interest.",
                "Yes. I learned a lot.",
                "No I would not. I was not adequately supported in this course, and material was taught in a confusing way.",
                "Yes! I think the knowledge gained on how economies work and relations between consumer and producer are useful for anyone to know no matter what major they are learning. The course is also organized very well so that there are many ways to accommodate different styles of learning.",
                "Yes. Gave important basic knowledge",
                "Yes, I would. It provides a solid foundation for economics and is good for anyone to know regardless of major.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in Econ even on the level of just wanting a deeper understanding of domestic affairs.",
                "Yes; its an important course to understand foundational topics in the economic and socio-economic world students will soon enter.",
                "Yes",
                "I think its a very easy and accessible course for people interested in Econ or not. If you are quantitatively strong the class may feel boring at times.",
                "I would! It offers a great way to engage with economics early on at Yale, even if you have no intention on following through with the major. The resources available are immense.",
                "Yes.  Very much serves its purpose as a good introductory Economics course.",
                "Yes! Even if you are not an Economics major you may benefit from taking this course. The course provides good basic knowledge of economic concepts and also teaches an economics way of thinking (for instance, focusing on the marginal cost/utility/benefit/etc.)",
                "Yes. I think this course effectively conveyed a great deal of information, and I would recommend it to another student interested in economics.",
                "Yes! It is foundational to many areas of study and gives a really solid overview on material that is necessary in the future. If you put in even a small amount of effort, you will learn a significant amount.",
                "Yes, this covers a lot of connect for being an introductory microeconomics course.",
                "Yes, I think it is a good intro course to take.",
                "Yes, if they are going in with the mindset of learning, and not getting a good grade. As someone who did not take Econ in high school, it was very discouraging throughout the course, as I always felt behind (as many of my peers had already taken this subject in high school).",
                "Yes, only if they are genuinely interested in studying economics, either to take further economics classes in the future or because they want a strong foundational knowledge in the theory of economics.",
                "Yes, the introductory class is great for students both gaining their first exposure to economics and also students who have taken the AP equivalent (given there is new content not in AP covered in the class). Although the content itself isnt too difficult, it does set you up for success for future econ classes.",
                "Yes. This class provides a good introduction to fundamental principles of micro that provides a foundation for future econ classes, and this class is as well done as possible considering it has about 500 people. Its also significantly more in-depth than AP econ, so if youre not quite ready for 121 its definitely not a waste of time.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course for any Yale student, especially as a prerequisite and QR credit.",
                "To be honest, I wasnt crazy about ECON 115 for the first few weeks of the course. It felt like a compilation of oversimplified and unreasonably generalized models with little applicability. But as the course went on, I began drawing more and more parallels between the theory we studied and the dynamics of real-world economies, and Cormacs incorporation of empirics certainly helped this point. By the end of the semester, ECON 115 was one of my favorite courses, as it helped me develop a new way of thinking that is useful in both academic and everyday life. For these reasons, yes, I would recommend this course to other students.",
                "If you like are wondering whether or not to major in econ, yes.",
                "Yes, great intro knowledge for econ that everyone should know",
                "yes it is helpful to get a basic understanding of economics",
                "Yes if you are not interested in participating/ don't mind learning in a big class.",
                "I encourage anybody and everybody to take this course. I'm not a math person, and I wasn't expecting to like economics very much, but enrolled in Econ 115 anyway because I thought that building a basic understanding of firm behavior and market dynamics was an important part of being an educated citizen. I got that and more. The material is difficult but genuinely interesting and relevant -- I'm shocked how much the frameworks I learned in this course have already shaped the way I process the news I read and the world I see around me. I also found that it was very possible to succeed and do very well given an appropriate amount of effort, and that the coursework is truly intelligible without any particular background in or aptitude for economics. \r\n\r\nIf you have the chance, take this class with Cormac O'Dea. He is a very clear presenter and obviously cares for the wellbeing of his students. I credit my good experience to him.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The concepts taught in this course are important to understand and anyone would benefit from this introductory course.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in learning the basic principles of microeconomics.",
                "Perhaps, its a good introductory class to determine if economics is your thing or not.",
                "Yes, but Id caution them that a lot of outside learning has to take place.",
                "Yes",
                "It's a solid lecture class, and if you learn in that environment well, you'll enjoy the course.",
                "yes; good intro to economics if you don't have experience",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, definitely. Intro Micro I feel is great to take for any student regardless of their academic focus, and with such a large density of first years it is also great for getting to know the people you review / revise with better. Also because of its popularity I think the course is done really well and as I said, structured such that you will learn a lot from the class.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who wish to achieve a basic understanding of microeconomic principles",
                "Yes, it's definitely helpful even for students not looking to major in economics because it gives them a basic overview of helpful economic concepts",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to whoever is interested in economics. It offered me a solid foundation for the basic principles of the subject. The teacher explained all the contents clearly and made hard topics easy to understand. Lectures were also very fun and engaging and offered real life examples of problems and theorems we discussed.",
                "This might be a bit challenging for people who have never done Econ ever, but its nevertheless a good intro course. If youve done AP or IB Econ (and did ok or well), the workload should be quite easy to manage. It will be sort of a gut class if you have Econ background (but still a good class to start with even if u can skip it).",
                "I would recommend it for those who would benefit or require from taking an economics course and might enjoy economics as a subject, but not as a random QR fulfilment.",
                "Yes!",
                "yes because there is lots of flexibility",
                "For sure. Definitely take this class if you're interested in economics at all, why not?",
                "Yes! Prof O'Dea was an incredibly lecturer who clearly enjoyed teaching and made lectures as engaging as possible for a 500+ class. There are an insane amount of resources (discussion sections, TFs, peer tutors, years of practice midterms and finals, etc), lectures are very well organized and easy to follow, the workload is very reasonable (weekly psets, two midterms, one final), and the curve is VERY generous. Overall I learned a lot and it never felt overwhelming.",
                "Yes even if you are not going to be an econ major this class gives a great foundation on economics that I believe all people should know, regardless of major.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to students of all levels of knowledge in economics.",
                "Yes, although I found the course content boring and difficult, Cormac is a great professor and I think an understanding of microeconomics, as provided by this class, is important for any citizen. However, that said, if you already took microeconomics in high school and didn't love it and don't think you'll be majoring in economics and don't need a QR, I would pass.",
                "Yes, great course just for basic understanding. Good even for students who do not plan to major in Econ",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, it is a large introductory course, but well-taught and organized.",
                "Decent gut",
                "I would very much recommend this course to another student! We live in a world where economics is extraordinarily significant and shapes so many aspects of our lives. It's so important to have an understanding of economics, no matter what career path one ends up choosing. For me, I had never been exposed to economics in an academic setting before, and this course made me realize that it is a subject I really enjoy and want to continue to pursue at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course for students who are required to take it for the Econ major or need a QR requirement, as economics underpins almost every area of study. I would warn students that taking high school economics won't necessarily provide you a leg up in the course, and encourage students who've never taken economics that it's a fairly level playing field; much of the material covered after the first four lectures confronts advanced economics topics incorporating algebra and critical thinking.",
                "yes if interested in theory of economics",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if it is a requirement for their major or a topic they are interested in. It was a challenging class with difficult topics and as such, I think students should be aware of that before enrolling. In addition, adapting to a 500 person lecture when coming from high school will prove to be a little difficult at the beginning.",
                "Yeah, if they want to get into the finance / econ field, this is a pretty good base or refresher course, but I dont really feel I got much out of it that I hadn't learned in high school. Since i don't want to take the next classes following, it was a little less useful but I can see its appeal",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. As consumers, it is important for us to understand the market forces at work that influence prices and producer behavior. Additionally, economics teaches a unique way of problem solving. The course is well-taught and well-organized.",
                "If I was speaking to a student who is interested in intro/basic economics, I would 100% suggest this class to them.",
                "This course is a good course to take regardless of the path you wish to pursue at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the amount you learn during the semester is amazing, and the teaching is very clear. The lectures are also recorded and put online, which is helpful when studying for tests. There are also many resources you can use when you are stuck, available both on Canvas and through teaching fellows.",
                "Yes. This course is definitely challenging, especially as an intro course into econ, but the material was definitely interesting. My professor was excellent, but I think I got lucky. I'm not sure I'd recommend this course to students not very interested in econ when a worse professor was teaching.",
                "I would, because it sets a great foundation for future courses in the economic realm. Lots of students in the course provides opportunity to interact with others to understand key concepts. I would recommend that they do their due diligence in taking opportunities to do practice problems and read the textbook accordingly.",
                "Yes think it was overall good",
                "Yes!!! Professor Odea is a great instructor!",
                "Definitely would recommend this course, but especially with Professor O'Dea  I think he was a large part of what made it good.",
                "Neutral; decent QR but there might be easier ones. I'm sure if you like econ it'll be good, but it didn't come to me naturally and I didn't find it that interesting. I'm glad I know a little about it now though.",
                "Yes! I found the content important and applicable to real life."
