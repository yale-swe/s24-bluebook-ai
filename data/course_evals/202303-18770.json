                "I thought the preclass videos were really helpful and I relied on them. One weakness for me is that the majority of sections are taught by students in the graduate school. It felt really evident to me that my teacher wasn't experienced in teaching math and it made it a lot difficult to adapt to and is part of the reason I had to rely so heavily on the preclass videos. I am not critizing my teacher specifically, I thought she was great and learned to adapt to her teaching methods and I can understand why it is good for the graduate students to teach lower level math classes but it definitely didnt help my learning.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Plethora of resources to help you with the course. These include the myriad online resources, and the various tutors\/TFs for MATH 120 students. You could basically teach yourself the entire course using all these resources. \r\n- MATH 120 did an effective job of covering the sweep of multivariable calculus. We got through a ton of material! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The weekly PSets are really tedious and take a very long time to complete without being very challenging or interesting, and thus rewarding. \r\n- The pre-class assignments basically cover all the material we went over in class, which made it feel sort of unnecessary to show up to class at all, since most of class time was redundant. \r\n- Hardly any of the material we were learning felt motivated. I never felt like I understood why we were learning a certain concept when we were, or how that concept fit into the course as a whole. The course kind of came together in the final class, when it was explained to us how all the various integrals we had learned were really just an extension of the fundamental theorem of calculus. But why did they have to wait until the very last class to share that with us? \r\n- Our approach to the material was quite hand-wavy. We covered very few proofs in the class, and the theorems were never given to us in precise terms. In fact, for the duration of the course, we were basically supposed to assume that all the functions we covered magically satisfied the criteria for the theorems. In lieu of rigorous understanding, much of MATH 120 could be summarized as: 1. Memorize some theorem 2. Memorize how to apply that theorem to a certain kind of problem 3. Do some practice problems that are all conceptually equivalent, with only superficial variation. \r\n- No feedback on the final exam",
                "Strengths:\r\nHaving video lectures as homework was beneficial because it allowed us to go back and revisit any material we didn't understand on demand.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nOne's experience in the class varied based on which TA\/professor\/lecturer taught their particular section. Also, I felt there could have been more practice in class on the topics learned."

                "Don't take MATH 120 just for fun. The class is pretty drab, and the weekly PSets felt like an endless, unfulfilling grind. If you need to take multivariable calculus for your major or just as a stepping stone to higher level mathematics, then I would recommend taking MATH 120, since my impression is that it covers a lot more content than the alternate multivariable calculus courses.",
