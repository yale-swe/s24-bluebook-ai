                "I genuinely learned so much in this course. We learned about different models of birth and care, differences across cultures and the effects of westernization and medicalization of birth. We learned about techniques for positioning the baby, the physiology of labor and different birthing positions and techniques, various obstetrical procedures, we examined statistics and trends among various populations, about birthing support, companions, and doulas, about ethical issues and obstetric violence, and so much more. In addition to the wide range of content we covered, we also learned to look at birth from many different perspectives. I had previously only learned about birth as it is viewed in American culture, so it was very eye opening to read personal stories, look at data, and watch videos on how birth is treated in different cultures. My perspective on birth has really done a 180, and my mindset when I potentially give birth one day and go into obstetrics and gynecology.",
                "I learned about birth all over the world. I learned how birth is facilitated, about how it is viewed in different countries, and various aspects of giving birth.",
                "As the title of the course suggests, I learned so much about birth. Some of the topics were more interesting than others, but we learned about a wide range of topics concerning birth from the role of doulas/midwives to postpartum cultural practices to the obstetrical dilemma. We also had a couple of guest lectures that were pretty interesting (my favorite was a doula who came and let us try out different techniques for pain management during labor).",
                "I learned so much about how medicalization of birth, especially in the U.S., can harm birthing people and their infants. I was also able to learn more about the role of doulas and midwives, which is rare to learn about as a pre-med.",
                "So many gems about birth beyond a biological framework.",
                "The biology of birth and female anatomy, in addition to the cultural practices surrounding birth and the history of birthing trends within the United States and much of the Western World.",
                "I got a deeper dive in the process of birth through social, cultural, and biological perspectives",
                "More on birth, doulas, and science",
                "I learned about the biology of birth and labor and delivery(including the pre and postpartum periods), as well as the different cultures surrounding birth and the intersections between the two.",
                "I developed skills in critical thinking surrounding scientific papers and studies. I also developed communication skills.",
                "A truly eye-opening course. I learned about different cultural birthing practices, the benefits and drawbacks of different obstetric care models, and different determinants for positive birth experiences. As a prospective OBGYN (and hopeful mother), this could not have been a more valuable class.",
                "This class teaches you SO much about the biosocial elements of childbirth and the ways in which childbirth practices/systems vary around the world. Not only do we get to learn about the biology of childbirth, but we understand the ways in which cultural and societal pressures shape the ways in which childbirth is both perceived and practiced in various geographic contexts. We also become more confident in utilizing critical thinking skills when reading articles that discuss childbirth and present findings from academic papers.",
                "I learned so much! The class was a great marriage of the biological rationale for human birth as it occurs today and the different cultural perceptions and treatment of it. Because of the readings we were assigned, I've also developed a more critical eye when reading 'scientific' articles and their methods. The more we learned about labor and delivery, the less fear I had surrounding the process (which is remarkable given the way media normally shows birth!).",
                "I learned about the U.S. medical system, the physiologic process of birth, and the cultural practices and beliefs that inform our experiences of bodily processes. I developed critical thinking skills and the ability to understand cultural practices more deeply  both within and outside my own experiences.",
                "There was so much to learn! It was an extremely comprehensive review of birth as a practice in the contexts of so many diverse cultures."

            "comments": [
                "This was one of the most engaging courses I have taken at Yale. In addition to a wide variety of topics and how intriguing the content of the course was, there were also several excellent guest speakers and hands-on activities that the whole class got to participate in. Another strength is that I could tell that everyone in the class was very passionate about the subject and had so much to contribute. This class was very flexible with assignments and gave us room for creativity and the opportunity to explore our personal interests with several of the assignments, which made it such a great learning experience. I have never taken a class that has so encouraged me to explore topics of my own interest throughout the course. Another thing that I loved were the meditation and breathing exercises we did at the beginning of class. It really created such a peaceful and relaxing learning environment. \r\n\r\nGenuinely, this class has no weaknesses.",
                "The strengths of this course are innumerable. The flexibility of deadlines made it very easy to engage with the course. I found myself doing assignments with vigor and passion I had not seen in my other classes. The lectures were fascinating and I liked how we had time to discuss the readings as well. This course has no weaknesses.",
                "I really appreciated how Claudia and Vicky were very flexible with due dates. They have a system called \"expected due dates\" where you can technically submit your assignment by then, but there is no penalty if you do not. The lectures were also quite engaging and Claudia and Vicky were very receptive to answering questions. I think the one weakness I could point out is the lack of clarity with grading. There were times when I got a grade back for a T&Q and was surprised that I missed points for something that wasn't mentioned on the rubric.",
                "Strong course overall - ample discussion, manageable projects/assignments, every class is interactive\r\nWeakness - not a lot of discussion about Indigenous birthing culture",
                "Class engagement is super fun.",
                "The use of Expected due dates took off a lot of stress regarding the class because I always knew that if I had an unusually high workload, there was something I could put off until later, and it usually got done in a few days after it was due. I recommend that other professors implement similar practices when possible. A discussion section added to the course could help a lot.",
                "The course was very exciting and always interesting. However, some of the readings could be dense",
                "Very strong teaching and community feel, fair amount of work",
                "I loved how this course was very fluid and the expected deadlines instead of hard ones as they very much were accommodating to different situations students may have been in. I do not think the course could be improved as I very much enjoyed it.",
                "This is an amazing course!",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe curriculum was fascinating, the work felt purposeful, the schedule of assignments was incredibly manageable, and both Claudia and Vickie were very accommodating of peoples interests and needs throughout the semester. The class was also structured so that we learned a lot from our fellow classmates which was a huge benefit. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe one weakness of this course I would say is that, at times, Vickies biases were pretty clear in her lessons to the point where I felt that I was learning more about her opinions rather than the facts of the matter. Still, I appreciated her passion and the class was co-taught between her and Prof. Valeggia so it wasnt too much of a problem.",
                "This structure of this course was really wonderfully and intentionally thought through. There was never a dull moment, as we got the chance to engage with content in a variety of contexts from lecture-style presentations to small-group discussions. We also had the opportunity to learn from incredible guest speakers, including a local doula and nurse-midwife. Another major strength was the experiential learning element of the class -- we got to interact with various models, exercises, and meditative practices to allow us to engage with the material at a more intimate level.\r\n\r\nThere weren't many weaknesses of the course. However, I do think that because there were many different elements to the course,  it was not always clear what the structure of each class would be. Presentations from the lecture-style classes often carried over into the seminar-style classes, which wasn't really a problem but made it unclear at times what to expect from each class / what the class would be focusing on.",
                "Strengths: Claudia and Vicky obviously cared a lot about the subject. They were always open to questions and their teaching style allowed us to take discussions in any direction, so we covered topics that the people in class really cared about. The guest lecturers were also awesome.\r\nWeaknesses: The class was too big to have any sort of in-depth seminar-style discussion, which could have added a lot to the course. It was generally a lecturer-student discussion.",
                "The class has extremely engaging content, and the instructors are certainly its greatest strength. Both instructors are very available to students and involve themselves in students' lives out of genuine care. The class could benefit from more rigorous assignments. Instead of several small assignments, students could engage more deeply with a few topics once or twice during the semester. I enjoyed the discussion posts, as they highlighted several students' personal experiences with course material and fostered a sense of community.",
                "It was great! I think they did a fantastic job making the class very low-stress. I felt like I was learning, but could do so at my own pace. They made sure the class didn't feel like extra academic pressure, but rather a space for all of us to have discussions and clarify our understanding."

                "Absolutely, 10/10 would recommend. This was one of my favorite courses ever. Vicky and Claudia were not only excellent professors, but wonderful people as well. I learned so much from this class, and everyone on in the class was so respectful and had wonderful insight to contribute. I especially enjoyed the hands-on activities in class, and the various guest speakers from fields we were learning about who came in to teach. I will never forget not only what I've learned in this class but also how it taught me to look at things from different perspectives and genuinely think for myself rather than just taking things viewed as \"standard\" as facts. It was so refreshing to take a class that made me genuinely excited to learn.",
                "Absolutely! Prof. Valeggia and Vicky were both so helpful and understanding. They were highly knowledgeable about the material and clearly passionate about what they teach.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It's overall a pretty laid-back course, but you do learn a lot of interesting information. Claudia and Vicky are also wonderful and really try to prioritize the well-being of students. We started every class by meditating and sometimes Claudia would even bring us treats.",
                "Absolutely! This was one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale. If you're at all interested in OB/GYN, midwifery, or being a doula, this class is perfect for you.",
                "Yes! I think anyone looking to go into the medical field should take this course. Those looking to learn about the realities of childbirth and how beautiful it can be would be great candidates.",
                "Absolutely. Both of the instructors are fantastic and knowledgeable about the subject. They appreciate any and all views on this topic and strongly encourage cross-cultural communication.",
                "Yes! I have taken two classes with Professor Valeggia and they have both been phenomenal",
                "Yes, very interesting and learned a lot",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I loved it so much and will definitely be taking the professor's future classes offered. This was one of my favorite courses I've ever taken at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. It seems that any course taught by or with Prof. Valeggia is amazing. This was the first time Vicky taught and she did so well - definitely follows similar approaches to Prof. Valeggia. The teaching style, materials, guest speakers, and conversations made for an amazing course that everyone should take.",
                "Absolutely, 100%, no question. I could not stop talking about this class, so much so that I think my friends feel like they took it too. Regardless of your interests (but especially if youre interested in medicine, womens health, or anthropology) this is a must-take.",
                "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student. Professor Valeggia and Professor Harries do an incredible job not only at making this class not only conceptually engaging, but at building a true learning community where we thrive alongside one another. I really appreciate their pedagogical approaches because it showed just how much they cared about our success as learners and about the environment we were building.",
                "Yes yes yes! The course is amazing, there is so much more to birth and the practices around it than meets the eye and Claudia and Vicky do an amazing job of guiding you through all of it. The historical backdrop of modern obstetric practices helps you understand how we got to where we are today with maternal and birthing processes; it's such a well-set-up course. I would 100% recommend it to anyone thinking of taking it.",
                "Yes, this class is very interesting and everyone has a personal connection to the topic. The instructors are stellar.",
                "Yes, only if you are interested in the subject though. Even then, it might interesting to learn something new you didn't think you were interested in before."
