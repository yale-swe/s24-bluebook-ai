                "Lots of strategy for plot and character development and shaping narrative tools to the genre of TV writing. A focus on storycraft over the publication process, though many insights on the industry as well. Excellent workshop opportunities - met a lot of friends and we're continuing to write together!",
                "The structure  of a TV pilot, pitch desk, series bible; the basic elements of building a character and world; craft-based anaylsis of TV pilots and feature film scripts; basic script coverage techniques; industry insights",

The biggest thing we learned is how to develop a storytelling machine by creating developed characters that start to act by themselves. Class is very collaborative and teaches what its like to work in a writers room."

            "comments": [
                "Loved the half seminar\/half workshop format of the course - starting the semester reading a bunch of scripts and materials and then applying what we learned to our own creative projects.",
                "Strengths - subject material of this class is phenomenal and unlike anything else really offered at Yale (except for the advanced version of the course, ENGL 461). Derek is also one of the best professors that Ive had at Yale - so funny, kind, and in the few more lecture-y classes of the semester, he was phenomenal at explaining\/breaking down aspects of television dramas. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - weekly assignments were often posted very late in the week\/weekend to Canvas and due before the next class on Wednesday. This class would be even more amazing if weekly assignments were posted earlier in the week, to allow more time to finish writing projects rather than scrambling on Sunday\/Monday night to write pieces that adhered to the specific prompts.",
                "I love this course. I do think that it could be a little more structured at times but overall really great. We had a guest speaker talk about his writing work and we read a lot of pilots from popular TV shows.",
                "Strengths: Explicit lessons\/worksheets on how to develop any given aspect of the story. Very good workshop group who provide comments before, during, and after class. Best creative writing class I have taken in terms of clarity of instruction, practicality of technique, and generosity of feedback.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Many of the lessons covered foundational storytelling techniques that I have learned previously (online), so more specific instruction on TV-specific writing (i.e. how to develop a scene, write dialogue, account for visual\/audio storytelling, film\/TV language, etc. would have been very appreciated. Accountability for individual email responses (CC'ing the professor, canvas comments, etc.) to workshop drafts is necessary if the expectation is that everyone send comments on everyone else's pieces.",
                "Strengths - Derek! Derek is the absolute best and his lectures about story and structure are so incredibly informative and stick with you. I also loved the selection of TV scripts. Having exposure to incredible scripts that we can analyze is truly valuable. I also loved the workshop environment and I felt the class was very supportive and offered helpful critique when working on our own shows. Weaknesses - sometimes deadlines were unclear or way too early in the day. Having a more consistent deadline that was later in the night would be very helpful for balancing the work.",
                "All strengths. Class is so engaging and the syllabus is awesome. Each script is carefully considered and teaches a different thing. Derek keeps the course organised and the course transitions nicely from short assignments and readings to a writers room. \r\n\r\nOne weakness is that I think Derek should have made sure we switched seats every class. I wish Id been able to engage with the other students in class. Fortunately we started working together outside of class but only towards the end."

                "YES! Take it if you get into it! Derek is the best and you will learn how a creative thinks, which is a process that is important for many aspects of life. Getting a group of writers in a room and letting them talk about ideas, characters, worlds - it's a blast!",
                "Yes. Take this course if you love television, writing, and imagining worlds into existence. Theres a reason this class has one of the highest application rates in all of Yale College. Its a privilege to be accepted into this class - dont throw that opportunity away!",
                "I would recommend this course if youre looking for a low-work class to improve creative writing skills and you have an idea for a TV pilot that youre passionate about.",
                "Absolutely! A very fun and informative course that gives clear instruction on the specific genre and foundational storytelling as a whole. Students already familiar with film language and screenwriting would probably be better-served in the advanced course. Out of the creative writing courses at Yale, this is probably the most pragmatic in terms of lessons and workshops, and there is a TON of freedom to pursue the writing that you want. I've taken a few creative writing classes at Yale and found them frustrating because feedback was vague and highly dependent on the opinion of the professor. This course suffers less from that both because Prof. Green is so open to many different styles and gives very fundamental story advice and because the class is so student-driven, especially once it comes to workshops.",
                "YES! Take this course with Derek. Derek is amazing and is always there to talk and help you. He chooses the best scripts, has the best way of explaining how to write, and is overall an incredibly fun and genuine professor. If you've ever wanted to write for TV or are just interested in what that looks like, Derek will get you there.",
                "Absolutely - if you are interested in TV screenwriting, definitely take this course. Derek offers great scripts to read, exercises, and a writers room vibe that is extremely fun to partake in. I left every class feeling inspired to write and incorporate tools\/techniques from class.",
                "I would 1000% recommend this course to another person. It was a course Ive wanted to take since I got to Yale and completely made me want to pursue a career in screenwriting. You learn so much in such a short amount of time  its the most awesome crash course."
