                "Strengths: Great job adapting to the COVID format -- students could engage as much or as little as their time allowed with the extra material (office hours\/guest speakers) without missing out on the core information from the class. It was clear that Prof Bloom was quite cognizant of how challenging this semester would be for some, and I know I really appreciate the efforts he made to adapt. \r\n\r\nWeakness: By virtue of being an introductory course, nothing will be gone into in much depth. As such, a lot of the material felt a bit shallow. It's also completely unnecessary to take this class if you got a 5 in AP psychology in high school, there's virtually no new information -- if you took psych previously, only take this class if its a requirement for something. Also, section was unnecessary -- TFs should hold office hours, but the material was not hard enough to justify live-sections.",
                "strengths: pre-recorded lectures are high quality and on coursera, light workload (short readings + 1 reading response every week)\r\nweaknesses: professor Bloom isn't as caring and good at teaching as everyone else make him to be, the weekly reading response wasn't very good at making us think and wasn't fun to complete",
                "I loved the Coursera format, especially because the lectures were broken up into manageable chunks. I also loved having office hours and guest lecturers. Section was great, too.",
                "Strengths: the topic is interesting, the workload is extremely low. A weakness was relying on Coursera to deliver content, which made the course feel extremely detached and impersonal.",
                "Strengths were in the organization of the course, it was very clear. The course could be improved with the readings, because sometimes the readings weren't very engaging.",
                "I think that the strengths of these course was that Professor Bloom was very engaging even through pre recorded lectures. Also discussion sections were very engaging. I think that there could have been more ways to gauge if students understand the information or concepts.",
                "All the learning was asynchronous so sometimes it felt a bit detached.",
                "The course is a great introductory course. Its thorough without seeming like too much at the same time. It covers a wide range of psychological topics which are perfect to students who have no previous preparation in the subject.",
                "I did not like the fact that all the reading and lectures were pre-recorded on Coursera. I could've just watched and read all the things on there and taken a different class. Definitely not worth it in the pandemic.",
                "Strengths: Since lectures were pre-recorded this semester, class time was replaced by optional office hours with Prof Bloom, which were incredibly enlightening  as one of the foremost psychologists today, his insights on topics ranging from evolutionary psychology to morality were always a delight to listen to. The mandatory section was also reasonably effective in engaging with the material at a deeper level.\r\nWeaknesses: Only the final really tested ones knowledge of the course content, so it might have helped to have regular quizzes to make sure that one was keeping pace with the material (especially since the content was delivered entirely asynchronously this year).",
                "Strengths: Section was engaging because of the TFs even if it was virtual. Professor Bloom is a great lecturer; his office hours were enjoyable. \r\nWeaknesses: The available section times were not the most convenient considering we had a lot of different time zones. Just a couple of sections for different time zones was not enough for the number of people in the course. Communication was a little sparse at times, like about research requirements etc.",
                "Strengths: it was a chill course. Not much work to do. Interesting material. \r\nWeaknesses: felt like I was just paying for coursera. Pretty low engagement.",
                "Strengths: interesting lectures, knowledgeable professor, extensive material provided to expand on any topic, section was very helpful, workload manageable\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The class does a good job of surveying a wide range of subjects, which is helpful for discovering which fields you're interested in but frustrating in that you only get to spend a week on each unit, regardless of how big or interesting it is. I was a bit disappointed that we spent a week each on vision and language (without even getting much into how they really work in the brain), which meant also trying to fit an overview of all mental illness in one week. The lectures also spent a significant amount of time talking about moral philosophy, rather than actual psychology, in some weeks. I did, however, find most of the course material to be interesting and fairly engaging, and I appreciated the opportunity to discuss what we learned in discussion sections and reading responses. I think the biggest weakness of the course was its asynchronous lectures. They made me feel very distanced from the actual course, to the point that I sometimes didn't even feel like I was taking it. Even when the material was interesting, it was disappointing to get only a 50 minute period days  after completing the assignment to get to discuss it, as I had lost some of my initial excitement by then. It was also far more difficult to find motivation to do the work for this course than it was for my synchronous classes. I think the course would be much improved if the lectures were synchronous or if there were more live virtual time with the professor.",
                "TAking the course through coursera was not great, did not feel like a yale course and came across quite weird. Section also felt unnecessary with lots of times being barely related to the content we had covered in lecture or only focusing on a tiny part. Additionally, such a high participation grade meant sections were super forced",
                "Strengths--Professor Bloom is phenomenal, and going to his office hours was such an amazing experience. Hearing his thoughts was the best part of the course!!!\r\n\r\nWeakness--I wish that the lectures had been actual videos rather than animations",
                "Synchronous lectures would encourage people to attend and be more engaged with the class.",
                "Strengths: pretty solid introduction to psychology having not taken any psychology before, professor clearly invested in the field and interested to discuss his ideas and personal opinions on the topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: online nature ends up having you read and watch all of the information by yourself, psychology experimental requirement ended up not being very clear and a bit confusing",
                "Weakness: weekly lecture content was only about 15 minutes and was very low in quantity of information. Pre-recorded lectures gave mostly examples of topics and not detailed explanations of topics. Homework was very low and easy to complete so it doesn't facilitate student learning",
                "The lectures of this class are very interesting, and discussion sections are enjoyable. The topics themselves are intriguing and thought-provoking, and the workload is very small compared to some other classes. Also from my (limited) understanding, the class does a fairly good job of covering basic psychological knowledge.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bloom is an expert in the field. His lectures and office hours were interesting.\r\nWeakness: No weaknesses.",
                "The lectures were quite engaging, but the readings were often redundant, simply restating what was said in the lecture.",
                "Strengths: virtual discussion section was engaging; prerecorded lectures were well-made\r\nWeaknesses: a little disappointing to know that all the lecture recordings were from Coursera, which is free; however, the positive is that the recordings were thus very understandable and organized",
                "Strengths: Professor Bloom is extremely knowledgeable and the content is interesting.",
                "Good lectures and flexible engagement opportunities. Knowledge was very foundational--topics were covered on a weekly basis and then left behind, so this is definitely a course that introduces areas of psychology as opposed to diving in deep to any one specific area. I liked the course delivery but wish there was more solid of a lecture approach. Discussion sections were ok but did not add much to the material.",
                "It was a hands-off class with not a lot of work which made it earlier to balance other classes. However, there was low-engagement so learning often felt far removed from lectures or discussions.",
                "A fascinating course! I liked the structure and the clear material, Professor Bloom is also fantastic.",
                "This course was during covid so it was all pre recorded lectures. This helped because I was able to adjust when I watched the lectures and could easily go back and rewatch them when needed. It was a little tough because it was online but given the circumstances, it was okay.",
                "Strengths: The mandatory discussion section was a strength because it was good to have discussion about these topics and hear from my classmates and my TF about their ideas and opinions. The weekly reading responses were also a strength because they got me thinking. Having the lectures recorded was also a strength because I was able to watch them on my own time and go at my own pace.\r\nWeaknesses: I'm not sure if this is a weakness but part of me wishes that the lectures were live so that I could have interacted more with Professor Bloom, but he did hold office hours, so it's my fault for not taking advantage of them.",
                "The course provides a very well-organized overview of topics in psychology. I personally appreciated the focus on breadth rather than depth.",
                "The course covered a broad range of topics that were all vastly different from each other and were also very engaging. The recorded lectures were engaging and easy to follow. However, the course had very little interaction with other students; while this is understandable during the pandemic, I think that there could be more cohesion within the course.",
                "Overall I thought this course was very strong in the online format. The weekly videos were easy to access as well as the readings, and the reading responses were always engaging. If anything I would say that I would have enjoyed more breakout room groups during section to have smaller discussions on the material with peers.",
                "Strengths: the sections were a nice place to discuss ideas (especially considering how there was no interaction during lecture, which was on Coursera), the reading response prompts were interesting\r\nWeaknesses: the course is taught on Coursera, which I strongly disliked. Just because lectures have been recorded and are available online does not mean we should not be taught by the Professor during lecture timings. Some weeks the Coursera lectures would only be 20 or so minutes for the whole week. I'm sure we would've been able to learn more during the two lecture sessions of that week. Another weakness of the course was the final exam - it was unreasonably long. Reading period is a busy week (I had all my deadlines that week), and it was ridiculous to have to write 7,500 words for a single class. A midterm exam which looked exactly like the first half of the final exam would have made much more sense. Additionally, the syllabus claims there would be a final essay exam; instead, we got an exam with 25 questions and were only informed of the format the week the final was sent out. Yet another weakness was that information was not communicated well to the students. Since everything was on Coursera, it was all the more important that the Professor frequently updates everyone via email. In the last week of section, we were not informed there will be no reading response due (we waited for a couple of days to get this information). Almost no information about the human subject requirement was communicated. Even the reading response prompts were randomly sent out at some point on Monday. It would have been far more convenient to have the prompt in our inbox at a fixed time.",
                "I liked how the course was organized: watch lectures, do readings, go to section, write a reading response. It was very straightforward, and the amount of material to be learned each week was perfect. This course could be improved by maybe including more (optional) supplementary materials in order to see how the concepts we learn are applied\/seen in real-world scenerios.",
                "Some strengths were that the class was very accessible because Professor Bloom had wonderful recorded videos for us to watch that were incredibly engaging and easy to understand and the discussion sections were interesting and low-pressure. One weakness is that because there are no assessments where students receive feedback until the final exam, it is difficult to project what will be on the exam as well as how well one will do.",
                "I really enjoyed most everything about this course. The only thing that might have been a weakness is the lack of deadlines for the recorded lectures themselves. It took a lot to get back on pace when I fell behind but that is my own issue.",
                "Strength: discussion section was interesting, recorded lectures were short\r\nWeakness: kind of wish the lectures were offered virtually on zoom (would have been more interesting I think)",
                "Strengths: the lecture content was incredibly interesting; the teaching staff (Professor Bloom and the TFs) were extremely knowledgeable, kind and accessible; the workload of the course wasn't super heavy (1 reading response\/week + final exam). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it was a bit difficult to fulfil the human subject requirement to participate in psychology experiments because, in light of the pandemic, there weren't that many experiments available for us to participate in online.",
                "I liked the recorded lecture format, and with discussion section I digested the material more. It was a good class despite covid",
                "Strengths - reading responses were always interesting and the workload wasn't bad at all\r\nWeaknesses - pre-recorded lectures from Coursera didn't feel like making the most of a credit in my fall semester",
                "The quick short lectures were enjoyable and got all of the necessary information across.",
                "I think that a strength of this course was the schedule of our readings and writing responses gave us enough time to dive into the material and properly understand it.",
                "It is hard to say the strengths and weaknesses because this year was completely different from any other year. Not being able to learn in person was a major draw back but the structure was good for the restrictions.",
                "Maybe make some required synchronous sessions with the professor. It was taught really well, the content was engaging and interesting.",
                "Strength is in the content but weakness is in the assignment variety. Its all discussion responses and one final.",
                "Unfortunate that we could not have live in person lectures but I found the content very interesting.",
                "The lectures were well-taught and extremely interesting. I wish that the homework helped us understand and internalize the material even more. The homework questions were interesting, but I've finished the course without remembering the details of any particular psychology topic. Still, I do have a grasp of general concepts.",
                "I think that this was a very strong course. The lectures were very interesting, and the section meetings were, too. The assignments were thoughtfully crafted--the writing prompts were always engaging. I do not know if I would consider this to be a weakness, but I did not engage as much with this course as my others simply because I had less work for it and, as a result, spent less time on it. But this was in fact one of the appeals of taking this course for me, so I was very pleased with the slightly relaxed workload.",
                "Professor Bloom is very knowledge and his office hours provokes very thoughtful discussions of the material beyond the basics. I had a very good TA that made discussion sections very fun. The work wasn't too time-consuming.",
                "I think a major strength of the course was the online lectures and office hours. They were very easy to attend and the coursera website made it extremely easy to navigate and find the lectures. I wish that the discussion sections could be more engaging. The old discussion section format of sitting and only talking for 50 minutes straight is very hard over zoom, and I really enjoyed the weeks where we did something new such as do an online activity in breakout rooms or watch a video to stay engaged with the material.",
                "I think the recorded nature of the Coursera lectures helped me watch the lectures whenever my schedule permitted me to, and the lectures being recorded also was beneficial in completing the reading responses or clarifying any confusing topics. Also, the weekly discussion sections helped review important concepts and gave me an opportunity to interact with my peers. The weekly reading responses provided incentive to keep up to date on the lectures\/readings and were a good way to review concepts while doing them. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness of this course is that our recorded lectures are part of an Introduction to Psychology Coursera course that is already available to the general public for a subscription fee. Although I did learn a lot this semester, I just feel that I got shorthanded by this a bit, as I expected a little more personally from a Yale class that I am definitely paying a lot of money for.",
                "Strengths: discussion sections and weekly responses as a means of reinforcing lecture material\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been nice to have a bit of clarity on where participation grades were coming from throughout the semester",
                "The weaknesses were that the lectures were recordings. The strengths were that I was able to watch them on my own time, and each week there would be around 6 or 7 15-minute long videos. The fact that each of them were short meant that I could take breaks in-between watching them.",
                "Great class! Very fun. Could be more engaging online",
                "content in my opinion was very interesting. concepts were not hard to grasp, yet they were still interesting. the content makes it easy to be engaged in this course; i enjoyed writing the weekly reading responses. workload was not bad (weekly online articles and reading responses, discussion sections). weaknesses were online format is less engaging than in-person, though this could not be helped really.",
                "I believe that the course is very strong as it is. Perhaps one minor thing that I would change is the animations in the recorded lecture. I would rather have recorded lectures of the live professor. Otherwise, I think the course is great.",
                "I think the course did a great job of explaining material and providing resources. It was also great speaking and hearing from Professor Bloom.\r\nOne issue was that the \"office hours\" were held on Monday, which made it difficult for some students to read all the lecture materials before the office hours; if the lecture was on Wednesday then people might have been able to ask questions that were more related to the week.",
                "Everyday is a different workload, some days more than others. The optional office hours took a different interesting route in learning the material beyond the lectures. The discussion sections were broken into smaller break out rooms to interact with the material more."

                "The virtual lectures worked well. The Noba articles tended to feel redundant after the lectures though.",
                "Online office hours were great. Choice of using coursera lectures was great. Online sections still very engaging.",
                "The format in which assignments were given and graded were spectacular, and discussion sections were very well run, as there was a clear structure to them and it promoted student engagement with the material.",
                "I think the pre-recorded lecture strategy worked very well. You could divide the lecture and do it on your own time, which helped given peoples shifted lifestyles.",
                "Can't think of anything to improve. As aforementioned Prof Bloom did a great job adapting his class to the online format.",
                "Coursera was awesome!",
                "I appreciate Professor Bloom's attempts to make the course interactive by holding Zoom discussion each week, but having the primary content delivery method be Coursera lectures which were recorded several years ago meant that my actual engagement was very low, and I was not motivated to go to class. Even a pre-recorded lecture that was made this semester, featuring Professor Bloom's face rather than the Coursera animations would have felt more personal.",
                "The easy access to all of the readings and lectures made it easier to go through the course.",

                "Discussion sections allowed for engagement and did a great job clarifying any uncertainties arising from the readings. Making it optional for students to attend classes throughout the week, in the form of office hours, and view pre-recorder lectures whenever made management of the coursework easiest given the current situation and allowed for better engagement with the material.",
                "Section felt a bit forced at times. I wish it was more discussion on the readings and such than activities but it still had good days too!",
                "The pre-recorded lectures were concise and well-delivered and the discussion section still allowed for a synchronous component to the course. More regular quizzes could have helped ensure that one was keeping pace with the lectures.",
                "I think the overall use of recorded lectures was definitely a success as it gave students flexibility to watch the lectures, but I still think there was a lack of engagement with the course. Given that it is Intro Psych, I feel like maybe some more actually recorded material or resources from Prof. Bloom would have been helpful.",
                "Not much could've been improved as far as COVID",
                "I think having recorded lectures was effective, since it allowed for students to rewatch the lectures at any time to review the material. However, I personally found the asynchronous nature of the course to be largely ineffective. It was difficult to maintain motivation as it felt more like I was taking an optional online course than a real college class. There was very little engagement with the professor, and there was less engagement with the material than I think there would have been in a synchronous class, as I never really gathered at the same time as my classmates or met any of them outside of my 50-minute discussion section, so we didn't have much time to really engage with the course. Overall, I enjoyed what I learned during the course, but it felt much more self-driven than it did like an actual course with a professor.",
                "I do not think the course should be run through coursera. It felt the professor was putting the bare minimum into the course and just showing up for office hours. Sections were good but sometimes a bit unnecessary and forced",

                "Being able to learn from Prof. Bloom directly would have been amazing. The discussion sections were a good way to ensure we understood concept on a deep level, but it wasn't the same as being taught the concepts. The course did ensure that cheating was not possible which was good.",

I feel bad for people who actually are interested in pursuing a psychology degree. If I was, this would have definitely been a turn-of from psychology at Yale.",

I liked being able to operate through the course on my own time while having an option to listen to cool guest lecturers over Zoom. Discussion sections were sufficient to keep me engaged\r\n\r\nTo be improved: making discussion sections more interesting to attend? they were great, though i wish there was a way to make them more interesting\/innovative.",
                "Very well organized with each week in accordance to the outline. Easy to stay up to date with deadlines.",
                "I think that most employed practices are effective, especially the bi-weekly office hours where students get to meet guest scholars.",
                "I think everything went quite well. The lectures were interesting, the readings were fun, the discussion sections were engaging, and it was fun going to office hours. I do think that it might be worth finding something besides the discussion sections and the once-per-week Q&As that aren't available for free online.",
                "The online lectures were easily the worst part. I wonder if it would be better if we could see him lecture in person rather than an animation. I never felt engaged in the information. Rather I felt like I was absently listening to him speak."

                "i think that this course covered a lot of material, so I wasn't particularly interested too much in the class. however, as I take higher psychology courses, I will perhaps learn more in-depth into issues I'm interested in, such as mental health.",
                "Yes. The class does not have a heavy workload but the material taught is engaging.",
                "Yes, it is a great introductory course without much work. Additionally, Dr. Bloom is one of the best researchers in his field, and listening to him speak is incredible, as he explains concepts in a way that is very intellectual, but very comprehensible.",
                "I would recommend this course. The content is very interesting.",
                "This class isn't bad, but it's ridiculously easy... if you want an intellectual challenge, you can probably succeed in upper-level psych classes without having taken this.",
                "I would say take this course if you are on the fence about the psychology major and want to see if you like. I would say take this course if you want to fulfill the major requirements. I mean, this class wasn't very exceptional but it taught me that I don't want to major in psychology.",
                "For sure! I learned so many interesting things.",
                "Intro psych is a great, easy fifth class that is very little work throughout the semester. However, it is not the most interesting or life-changing class at Yale; I have taken other \"fifth classes\" that definitely affected my outlook on life more. It's good survey course and I recommend it for freshman, but as a junior I felt like this course left me wanting more stimulation or challenge.",
                "Yes, I think it is a pretty solid overview of psychology.",
                "Yes, I think that the course would have been a lot more engaging non-covid times! A good way to learn about a new field without large workload or comittment",
                "Sure! The topic is interesting and the professor and TFs actually care about the subject and learning.",
                "Professor Bloom is pretty famous on campus, but since this was not taught synchronously, it felt a little different.",
                "Highly recommended, its a great intro course for non psychology majors or even those looking for an easily social sciences credit. The workload is great and the course is very easy to follow. If you can, do think about enrolling!",
                "Yes, it is engaging, has a manageable course load, and relates the study of the mind to valuable real-life scenarios we all encounter at some point.",
                "Not during the pandemic when all of the lectures and readings can be found pre-recorded online. WOT.",
                "If youre interested in learning more about how your mind works, both consciously and subconsciously, this is a fantastic survey course. And if its taught by Prof Bloom and you think you might have time to attend his office hours, this is a must-take course  you will not be disappointed.",
                "Yes if you have never taken psychology or want an easy credit.",
                "Yes, its a chill class, especially during COVID. You definitely do get what you put in, so if youre really interested in Psychology, then use your resources, go to Office Hours, and talk to the TAs.",
                "Yes, I think it was a nice introduction to psychology and facilitated engaging with the topics very well",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in pursuing psychology as a major, since it is required and does also provide a solid survey of the field. I would caution students who are particularly interested in any one area of psychology, though, since each area is only briefly covered and at relative surface level. I would also caution students against taking this course asynchronously, as I think it did take away from the experience. I would recommend taking a synchronous psychology course instead or, if possible, taking this course in person.",
                "YEs, but in a normal year",
                "If with Professor Bloom, 100%. He made me LOVE this class",
                "Course is a decent introduction to psychology, virtual learning made it hard to be too engaged since most of the learning of the material occurred on your own, not too difficult of a course if you're piling on other heavy courses",
                "It's interesting but too easy",
                "Yes. It's a good general introductory course for the field of psychology, and I think it's a good class to take to assess how much you'd like other classes in psychology. And even if you weren't interested in majoring in psychology, I still think it's a very interesting class for anyone to take.",
                "Yes! Absolutley.",
                "Yes. The class, as an introductory course, complied with its purpose. Knowledge on the topic relates with other areas and helps us understand deeper the implications of the brain, emotions, and other components of personal and social life.",
                "Yes, I used to think I wouldn't ever like psychology, but after taking this class, I have some good bits of knowledge about life from this class that has made my life better.",
                "If you've taken AP Psych before, you won't be learning a lot of new stuff. But, it's really interesting content and a worthwhile class especially for the time commitment.",
                "I would recommend this course, but not in a virtual setting. I think that the main takeaways of this class come from listening to Prof. Bloom and guest speakers in a lecture hall. Over zoom, I dont feel like I gained the same sort of insight. Otherwise, I thought the course material was interesting and Prof. Bloom is an excellent lecturer.",
                "Yes, as it is a required prerequisite to the psychology major. It is a basic and relatively easy course. It is accessible to everyone and you will learn lots about things you already knew, or at least you will have your thoughts about the world and others confirmed by the material. In some cases, you will learn some cool new stuff to investigate further.",
                "Yes. Professor Bloom is very engaging in his lectures",
                "Yes, if you are looking to get a foundation for psych I would recommend this",
                "Yes! A fascinating, low-workload course. Take it if you are even remotely interested in Psychology. Prof Bloom is great.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. Professor Bloom's lectures are a great survey to the material and the discussion sections are fun.",
                "Yes! Such an interesting class with many great guest speakers",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class. The workload was not bad and the lessons were interesting. This is a good class for distributional requirement or just an interest in psychology.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Not an absolute gut but definitely a light workload, and you could go at your own pace (I'm not sure if this is true in non-COVID years). I learned a lot about psychology.",
                "Yes, I think this class is a great and easy way to gain exposure to topics in psychology for those that are interested.",
                "Yes! The following course was extremely engaging and covered a broad range of topics. It is largely based on more independent work, so I would not recommend it to those who are looking for a discussion-heavy course. Overall, the topics covered in the course were very fascinating and provided good introduction to psychology.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I was able to learn so much throughout the semester and looked forward to the videos and section every week.",
                "Not if it is being taught on Coursera again - it is just not worth it. Only take the course if you want a low-commitment and broad introduction to psychology. Can be taken as a 5th class.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Psychology is present in our daily lives, and learning about the basics would help improve one's understanding of self, others, and the world. The class is very interesting, fun, and not difficult at all.",
                "The course is interesting and the Professor Bloom's lectures are great. However, the reading responses, though not particularly difficult, can be infuriating at times.",
                "Yes I would highly recommend this course to anyone. I found it really enjoyable and entertaining in most every aspect.",
                "Yes, it's a good intro to psych that is not too much of a burden. I really enjoyed learning the material without stressing too much about grades",
                "Yes. Very interesting materials.",
                "Definitely! Great introduction to Psychology and very well-structured course.",
                "I would recommend this course. It is a great intro to psychology, coming from a person who had not taken a psych class before. The topics of the class are interesting and thought provoking",
                "I would recommend it. Zoom is obviously difficult for learning but it is an interesting course and the coursera videos are professionally done.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes; you'll get enjoyment out of just learning the basic principles of human psychology.",
                "Yes because it is a great introduction to psychology and Professor bloom is very engaging and informative.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The knowledge gained from this course is universal and can be used in any field. Taking the course was one of the best decisions I have made thus far.",
                "Yes, it was an engaging first look at many topics.",
                "This is a great foundation course.",
                "Yes, even if you do not plan to major in psychology, your learning in this course apply directly to your daily life and may even get you interested in becoming a psych major.",
                "I would recommend this course because psychology is such an interesting field that applies to every single one of us, and this course introduces a lot of cool concepts and ideas in psychology that are very worth exploring further.",
                "Yes, the topic of psychology is very interesting and the workload is manageable.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course. The material is interesting, Professor Bloom is an engaging and very knowledgeable lecturer, and the workload is not too heavy.",
                "Yes, Professor Bloom is an excellent teacher and being able to discuss the variety of psychological topics with him is a great experience.",
                "Yes! Prof Bloom is a star  he has the ability to make the most mundane psych topics fascinating!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. You truly learn a lot in this course, and the workload isn't a detriment. Simply engage with the material and you will learn a lot.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone interested at all in psychology or looking for a light final credit. This course covers many very interesting topics, and there are definitely some cool takeaways you can use from this course to improve your own day to day life. Some of the research results we cover are fascinating, and I have no doubt that you will see the world a bit differently after taking this course.",
                "This class was a good introduction to psychology.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Even if the student has no interest in psychology, taking this class would be a lot of fun.",
                "Yes! Great class to take to learn more about yourself and how we think",
                "Yes! If you have any interest in psychology, definitely take it. It's not really a gut, but it shouldn't overwhelm your schedule if you plan well. I had an interest in psychology and this course definitely met my goals and interests.",
                "Yes very interesting and thought provoking course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in psychology, especially if they have never taken any PSYC courses in high school. I believe it provides a great foundation of introductory knowledge in this field",
                "I would definitely! It was very fun.",
                "I recommend this class to any student interested in learning more about psychology.",
                "Yes! Especially with Dr. Bloom as the professor! I learned a lot on my own through recorded lectures but also in his office hours."
