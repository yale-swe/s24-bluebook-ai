We studied some of the major philosophers' ideas about population growth and decline and critically discussed them. We talked about marriage and its future.

            "comments": [
                "A strength of this course was in the interesting subject matter and Professor Zang's knowledge on it. Several of the papers presented in the class were co-authored by Professor Zang and she was very available to answer questions during lectures. A weakness was the volume of required readings for section, though those were diminished over the course of the semester. I also thought the length of class during the project presentations was too long. The professor and TAs for this class were very accommodating, largely because this was a newer course and it was online.",
                "1 lecture and 1 lab per week",
                "The course was very short and somewhat rushed in a sense. We had one class a week, which was confusing for me.",
                "Professor Zang did an excellent job making the material accessible and interesting to learn. I appreciated how much she engaged the class with questions. My only suggestion would be to provide students with more guidance on how to conduct research projects and write research papers.",
                "Strengths: Professor Zang is great, exams are not too hard (though I didn't do well on the first one, we got to hand in corrections for credit), all the materials including the final project is enjoyable. Above, a SC credit!\r\nWeaknesses: there's no incentives to read the paper she assigns. As a result, I wish that there are reading quizzes of some sort so that a) we can be more engaged and b) the final project doesn't have to count for 50% of the final grade.",
                "A strength is that it covers a variety of topics in sociology/population studies each week. There was a 20 page paper due by the end of term, but the professor included project presentations in the course structure to make sure that students were working on their project throughout the semester.",
                "I enjoyed the content of the course and found the lectures more helpful than the discussion sections.",
                "I didn't find this course to be that engaging. I thought our discussion sections were not very helpful, but more of a reiteration of the readings. The lectures were difficult to follow and went very quickly. One strength was the formatting of the exams and final paper. I really enjoyed those as the basis for our evaluation.",
                "Strengths: covered so many aspects of demography, gave me foundational knowledge on demographic calculations and theories, professor was very kind and willing to answer questions. Weaknesses: the class could sometimes go too fast to fully absorb the information on the slides. Also, readings from the textbook were very long and dense without too much substantial content.",
                "Strong on all cylinders no weaknesses",
                "Strengths included that the class could be approached from a variety of different perspectives: history, science, politics, etc. There were a variety of students, both STEM and social science, in the class which really helped create productive discussions.",
                "The course was very engaging since the professor constantly engaged the class in questions and discussions. For the final project, we were given a great deal of autonomy to explore what we were interested in.",
                "Strengths: really interesting material, Professor Zang is so incredibly knowledgeable and a wonderful lecturer, good discussion sections to clarify anything you're confused about, material correlates with readings really well which gives you a good chance to engage with everything \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the only thing I can think of was at times the reading load was a bit heavy but Professor Zang was super understanding and adjusted accordingly",
                "The best thing about this course was how focused Professor Zang was on helping students engage with the material. She was very receptive to feedback and was always looking for the best way to help us learn.",
                "A big strength of the course was its breadth -- it was a pretty good intro into the field of demography if you had never learned about it before (I hadn't). My TF was super helpful for the final project, and the final project was actually a really great opportunity to work with other students in the class (it's a pretty sizable undertaking, so I would recommend doing it as a group). One challenge was the calculation based content like life tables, which are very integral to the field but require a lot of practice to get the hang of. At first, there wasn't enough guidance on that but Prof Zang made sure to slow down.",
                "Strengths: lecture moves very quickly, topics were interesting and had real world examples \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: too much reading (though you could get by in the class without ever doing it)",
                "This course was very well organized, making it easy to follow along with the themes and concepts being discussed. Discussion sections did an excellent job of reinforcing knowledge gained during lectures, and academic readings helped to supplement the class's textbook with real-world examples of demographic work. With the combination of academic papers and textbook chapters, occasionally the reading load for the course felt heavy. Additionally, lectures often covered many of the same subjects which had been discussed in the assigned textbook readings. I think that giving more clear expectations of what students should look for in readings would be helpful here, and having a more clear distinction between lectures and textbook work. Lectures could move very quickly, which was mad manageable by the fact that lecture slides were available on Canvas. However, the more quantitative concepts learned were more difficult to understand from only the slides, and I think that devoting more external resources to understand them would be helpful as well. The course would also benefit from a more clear outlining of expectations for student quantitative and scientific knowledge. Many students came from different academic backgrounds, and it was sometimes unclear how much we were expected to know or learn about the math or science underlying certain demographic concepts.",
                "Strengths: fantastic professor with equally as fantastic lecturing. Wonderfully resplendent slides with lots of information, very interesting content, and not too many assignments.\r\nWeaknesses: while the lectures were very engaging, they were very dense. Without having implemented the recording halfway through the semester, I would have been unable to learn adequately. The exams were okay -- the first one was rough, because two questions wrong = 130/150, which can tank a grade very fast. They did provide a bonus points opportunity, which was very generous and greatly appreciated. The lectures were simply very, very fast. And the readings -- very long. Like, really long. Very relevant, but super super long. Final project was also a huge undertaking, with not a whole lot of guidance, especially for an introductory course. Assumed statistics background if choosing to do a quantitative project."

The group project was also a good way to connect with students (me and the other three members of my group were remote for the semester), so that was really nice.",

Prior to taking this course, I hadn't realized just how intrinsic population dynamics were to our social institutions. It was truly fascinating to learn about it.  I also appreciated getting exposure to the scientific writing process.",

                "Yes if you're interested in sociology or what a science credit that's more applicable to the social sciences! I think it's also pretty unique among introductory social science classes as being more exam-based, as well as having most of the readings be from a demography textbook and papers- if you're not a fan of that work style I would not recommend it.",
                "Yes!! Excellent professor & TAs, and interesting content",
                "Yes because it was a low stress class with no homework and a not bad final project and 2 tests",
                "As a social science student looking for an easy Science credit, I found this class super-helpful and interesting, but I'd recommend it even if you're not looking to fulfill the Sc requirement. Fascinating topics every week and a friendly professor.",
                "Yes, highly! Population studies is such a fascinating topic, and the course introduces it in a way that makes me want to go deeper into the topic.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because of Professor Zang. She was so accessible all the time and very accommodating. Plus, the material is super interesting and not too hard to understand especially for someone like me who knew nothing about sociology or demography before this.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This class was accessible, engaging, and highly informative.",
                "For sure! Especially if you're a humanities person looking for a science credit. The content covered was pretty interesting and good to know in any field. There were some kinks that needed to be worked out because this was the first year teaching the course, but Prof Zang and the TFs were super understanding and did a great job. I'm sure this class will be even better in person.",
                "Definitely! It was a great introduction to population studies, and I learned a lot of general information related to demography. Although the first exam was somewhat difficult due to the time constraint and the number of calculations, the second exam was much more doable, and Professor Zang even gave us extra credit opportunities after hearing students' concerns regarding the first exam. The final paper took a long time, but Professor Zang was more than willing to review our topic with us and help us out along the way. In general, the class is not too stressful and is great if you plan on majoring in sociology or would like to take a Sc credit related to the humanities.",
                "Yes, it is a great science gut and I learned some pretty interesting information along the way",
                "I would recommend this course to all students, because the field of demography has relevance for everyone. Although we learned not to believe that \"demography is destiny\", the dynamics and characteristics of human populations are connected to everything else in society. This is a course that should be attractive to both STEM and Social Science oriented students, and students should anticipate a variety of readings, participatory lectures and sections. Most importantly, students should be ready to actively apply the concepts they learn to the world around them.",
                "Sure. If you have any remote interest in sociology or the study of human behavior, this would be a great starting point. A lot of the concepts are intuitive, but in this class they're laid out in terminology and a textbook, and lectures, too. I left the class each day on a high, since the lectures were just that good. Professor Zang is incredibly engaging, and I'd love to hear her talk about demography all day long. She puts a picture of her dog on screen when it's time for questions. The exams aren't difficult per se, they're just difficult to score well, because even getting 2 questions wrong can give you a B. So tread carefully. And while a 20 page paper might seem like a lot, as a group project, it's not too bad. Just be prepared for a steady stream of work and keep up!"
