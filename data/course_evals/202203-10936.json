There is so much room for students to really grow and learn on their own through projects, and the course is designed to create a tight knit cohort of students who are all ~suffering~ through the course together. Weaknesses: The course is very high workload, and a lot of it is learning on your own (I didn't find the lecture part of the course very helpful). It's definitely a grind :(",

The group project near the end felt too big and then it felt like the final project was rushed. But maybe just easing off the gas a bit and better pacing. Outside of that its great."

This course is SO much fun, and as a CS major, I genuinely learned so much from this course, especially when it comes to applying my CS skills to something physical I can hold in my hands. I think this is a class that every CS major should take, and I'm so glad I took it, even though it was very difficult and high workload",
                "Absolutely. Best CS class ive taken. Only if you actually want to apply yourself though, and previous work with some of Arduino or sensors or raspberry pis or some mechanical construction makes things much easier and will save you time (you obv dont need all of this though). For sure though if you want to get to build things. I'm not an art person at all, it wasn't too artys fartsy, but did engage you and make you think about what you were building. Graded generously from my experience, mostly cares about effort."
