Tong is a very arrogant and rude TA who consistently belittles and disrespects students in the class. His lack of patience and poor communication skills often make it difficult for students to understand the material and he frequently refuses to provide additional assistance or clarification. His unprofessional behavior has caused me great frustration within the class and has had a negative impact on the overall learning experience.

                "This course ended up being taught entirely on zoom, while it was supposed to be in person after the first two weeks. I do not blame professor Avi because he shared that his health kept him from going to the class, but it felt like the class was doomed from that point on. The class on zoom was disorganized and the virtual communication was poor during class and outside of class. I think that most of the TAs were really carrying this course in terms of creating/grading assignments, even the two exams.",
                "Course was taught virtually which was disengaging. Course material was very dense and full of a ton of concepts that really needed their own dedicated lectures.",
                "The progression from one topic to the next was reasonable and well-paced. This was a strength of the course. The main weakness was the medium (Zoom). The course was listed as in-person and the expectation was that it would be. I understand that the transition to Zoom was due to a health issue, so this is outside of the Professor's control. Another weakness was that every assignment and exam was multiple-choice, and so no human feedback/grading occurred. The exception to this was our first homework assignment (the only non-multiple-choice work for this course this semester), and the first homework assignment went ungraded (everybody received 100/100).",
                "The course is unstructured. The professor and the TAs are doing completely separate things. Wrong problems appeared on almost every quiz and homework, and it takes forever for the TAs to grade the HW or just simply release the auto-graded work.",
                "The course was completely unhinged. We are in a post COVID world why are we still on zoom? The TAs were completely checked out and all of our assignments were graded on canvas (multiple choice). There was no one for help or guidance, despite reaching out multiple times on Ed there was no engagement. I learned nothing about databases. The assignments were very useless and a complete waste of time. And grades are pretty random too. This is a very low workload class but definitely is not a gut. It is like, here do 0 work the whole semester and then get a random grade. Very disappointed.",
                "If possible, in-person lectures would be more engaging!",
                "This course has some really useful information and content but the lectures were absolutely useless. The lectures consisted of Avi reading off of a powerpoint on Zoom the entire semester, even though classes have been in person for over a year now.",
                "The weakness of this class is that the lectures are just reading text of the slides which is exactly what is in the textbook. Strengths is there is a lot of information that you can learn.",
                "This class is super disorganized. The quizzes and exams constantly had typos, repeated questions, or just unfinished questions. The first homework was super complicated and touched on topics that we hadnt learned in class, and then they didnt even end up grading it and told us two months after turning it in that we all would get 100% on it. This class was also posted as an in-person class but it ended up being held on Zoom.",
                "good",
                "The weakness is definitely course organization. There was a lack of feedback from multiple psets and from the final project, and the class was online the entire semester. The only consistent aspect was taking quizzes with very ambiguous questions that were often removed because they had multiple or no right answers or were too difficult for the time limit. Strength is the pure information learned. Database understanding is a highly valuable skill in a multitude of real-world applications.",
                "This class has many strengths, including a patient and enthusiastic professor who is dedicated to helping students understand the material and is always available to provide additional assistance and clarification. The slides are also amazingly detailed and make it very easy to study for the exams in this class. One weakness of this class is how open ended it is for the final project. You'll need to come up with an original independent database system and create a web app to host it. Since this class doesn't teach web development, you're completely on your own for this project. Also, another con is a TA named Tong who was rude and unresponsive. Avoid him. Overall, while the class has many strengths, the weakness of having an unresponsive TA can be detrimental to your experience.",
                "Incredibly disorganized class, there seemed to be a main problem with lack of TA's compared to the class size and it showed.",
                "Suitable for theoretical methods.\r\nWeak for implementation.",
                "Let me keep it a buck with you so you know what you're getting yourself into: the first problem set we were assigned, no one knew what we were doing and the content on the problem set was from Avi's textbook, a part of the chapter that we were supposed to cover ourselves as Avi did not go over it in class, I pull up to Office Hours having already worked on all of the problems and I just had a syntax question - I get to one of the TAs and explain to them the confusion I'm having and he deadass just tells me he didn't write the question and the TA that wrote the question wasn't there. Then we didn't get the grades back for that problem set well after our midterm. This course was just very poorly managed and not fun to attend.",

                "The course has several weaknesses, in particular offering it on zoom is terrible for the students since there is no meaningful engagement possible when the professor is simply reading off the slides. Moreover, there is too little emphasis on SQL and database practice. I feel a very theoretical course on database is not a good \"introduction\" to the topic and is of little interest. On top of that, assignments are not helpful in learning and critically thinking about the material because they are all multiple choice. The grade is also split up into too many parts, no class needs to have quizzes + assignments + final project + midterm exam + final exam.",
                "Already perfect",
                "Lecture time",
                "The contents are not very engaging or helpful.\r\nFor students who want to do research in this area, there should be some deeper and more interesting content.\r\nFor students who just want to learn some basic knowledge about database, SQL and related topics should be involved more, both in the lectures in the homework.\r\nFrom this perspective, neither of these two kinds of students would benefit much from this class, so it's hard to see who are the targeted students.\r\nThe organization is also quite messy.\r\nProfessor did not answer questions clearly during the lectures and was more just reading the slides.\r\nAlso, I've seen classes with more students and the same amount of TFs, but they were much more organized than this course.\r\nTFs do not answer questions very quickly: some academic questions, not administrative ones, are left open for weeks.\r\nHomework was graded very slowly. In the end, everyone gets 100 for the only written homework.\r\nIt's also hard to see what TFs are doing. Perhaps they were coming up with homework questions, but that doesn't seem to take 5 TFs + the professor."
