                "Strengths: Derek is absolutely phenomenal, as was our TF Jasmina. Derek is incredibly knowledgable, and genuinely cares about teaching so that students learn. The final project was an awesome way to learn more about this field, and they both offered a lot of support for the project and essay. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None! It was a shame that we couldn't be together in-person; it was hard to get to know peers over zoom\/form relationships.",
                "Strengths: Such a fun class -- the material (re: exceptional fossils) is so interesting and combines aspects of geochemistry, paleontology, and sedimentology. Professor Briggs is such an engaging lecturer and is top in this field, so it's super interesting to learn about his research. No tests or homework (except reading research papers), just a midterm paper and a final research paper.\r\nWeaknesses: Not a lot of weaknesses to this class; the papers were dense sometimes and I would've liked it if we were told which papers applied to which lectures so I could review them again ahead of class (we just know which papers to read for the week)."

                "Absolutely! This was not my field of study, but after taking Derek's class \"History of Life\" I was interested in learning more about fossils, and this was the only class to take. Would recommend it 100 times over! Even if you have a minor interest in this field, or if you have taken something like History of Life, you are going to have a great time!",
                "Yes! While some of the lectures are pretty dense and go into a lot of scientific detail as long as you gain a general understanding its not that bad! The entire workload for the course is 1 midterm essay 2000 words on a selected topic, 1 final essay (no min word limit) on a topic of your choice, short presentation of your own essay in the last week of class, which was manageable.",
                "Yes, I would definitely take it if you are doing EPS, EVST, etc. Material is challenging but it is presented in an engaging manner. Start early on your proposal and the research paper -- reading the literature is time-intensive and the proposal took me dozens of hours to write (even though it's pretty short). Do the readings; class is so much clearer if you do so. This class is one of the best I've taken here at Yale and Prof. Briggs is a huge reason -- his lectures are really great, and he is super accomModating."
