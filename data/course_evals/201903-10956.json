    "I gained a lot of insight into questions of faith, and poems brought me so much joy.",
    "I became a much better reader of poetry through this class: both better attuned to it formally, and better able to consider its effects (I think through having the lens of faith vs the history of English lit).",
    "In this class I think I really learned how to be affected by poetry, how to let it influence me. I learned how to riff off of other peoples responses to poetry. I learned how to memorize a poem and recite it effectively.",
    "Read a ton of great poems I would not have otherwise!",
    "I developed a greater insight for evaluating both religious and faith-based poetry, as well as considering the role they play in my life .  I also became familiar with the works of a lot of incredible poets, both older and more contemporary .",
    "I really improved my ability to analyze poems, as well as discuss my analysis in class. I expanded my knowledge of poets, learned how to recite poems more easily, and also thought more broadly about religious themes I had previously shied away from (i.e. existence of God, souls, joy\/suffering, etc.)",
    "In this course, I learned to think about both poetry and religious belief in more careful and considered ways."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I love the emphasis this class places on memorization. I think it's a wonderful way to experience poetry--it forces analysis because you can't have something bumping around in your head for the rest of your life without thinking about it.",
    "Strengths: learning to better read, write, and talk about poetry; reciting poetry; integrating bits of biography of authors and other thinkers into reading poetry; comparing poems across time periods around a theme; considering faith through its expression.",
    "I think this course could benefit from addressing some more concrete theory: I love that we read so much poetry, but it sometimes seemed like the discussions about faith were sort of untethered, especially if you come in with more of a confused background. Things sometimes felt slightly divorced from the world outside of the classroom, which is why the visit from Padrig O'Tuoma was so nice: he really gave a new sense of perspective on how poetry and faith were life and death for many people. Overall, though, I think it gave me a great space to think, and I really appreciated the freedom we were given in choosing a topic for our final paper\/recitations.",
    "Strengths: Professor Wiman brings a refreshing, blunt tone to class discussions and isnt afraid to ask a question like So, do you believe in heaven? or ask us to really bring our whole selves to class and to our readings. My classmates were wise and made the class experienced so engaged yet relaxed. Weaknesses: Sometimes it felt like since we read so many different poems for each week, our discussions bounced around a bit too much in each class period. I also wish that I had more opportunities to receive feedback on my work from Professor Wiman, whos so perceptive as an instructor. That might mean having more graded\/reviewed written assignments.",
    "Really awesome, I loved the poetry and made me think a lot about beauty, joy and faith. Some lines that will stick with me for life. Only weakness is I had no idea what my grade would be as we didnt get any feedback on assignments till the very end",
    "The readings for this course were really wonderful, as well as the discussions in class led by the professor .  Because this class only meets once a week, there is unfortunately never enough time to go through all of the readings in class .",
    "Strengths: Professor Wiman creates a space that invites you to be vulnerable. People opened up about personal experiences with faith and took risks in their poetic analysis, which made the classroom feel safe and inviting. I've never been a part of an academic space like that before. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class has a lot of work, some of which feels unnecessary. There is very little guidance with these assignments, particularly the final assignment. In general, this class is a lot of learning through osmosis. Everyone gets something out of it because everyone puts a lot into it.",
    "The structure of the course is a bit loose in that poems are discussed on the basis of the student who is most eager to talk, but at the same time, I'm grateful that the discussion is primarily student-driven. And of course, Professor Wiman's impeccable taste in poetry is the core of the course."

    "No, there are so many wonderful English classes at Yale. This isn't one of them. The teaching is lazy, and presentational skills are valued over actual learning\/understanding. You do very little actual writing, and instead your grade in the class is largely dependent on public speaking exercises. I came into this class with a deep interest in both faith and poetry. I don't think that I've learned much about either. Of the eight English classes that I've taken at Yale, this was easily one of the most disappointing. I'm sad that I wasted a credit and money on a course packet. Even though the class only met once a week, the two hours dragged along, and we often ended class early, largely because the professor just expected us to talk about the poems to each other while offering minimal input or insights. Do yourself a favor, and don't take this class.",
    "Yes! This is a wonderful opportunity to think about faith and poetry together. Professor Wiman is such a wise person--he's always saying things in class that I want to ponder. The poems are glorious and the class is very thoughtful. The one weakness of the course as far as I could tell was that we don't get very much feedback over the course of the semester.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to many types of other students.  \r\n1. Anyone interested in reading great poetrythis class set me up, in reading and recitations, to be a lifetime poetry reader (both better for academics, and then to read broadly on my own).\r\n2.  I dont have a robust faith background, and this class was great for me, along with those who  came to it more from the faith side than the poetry side. I loved watching over the course of the seminar as all of us sharpened our ability to talk and think about poetry via faith, and also vice versa. The poetry is so excellent that you probably will be personally moved by it, but dont be intimidated by the faith part (and maybe all the more do take it) if youre not a person of faith or dont have a lot of experience talking about it in an academic context. \r\n3. I think its also great within English major for approaching poems thematically and as they are vs. in a history of English lit sense. \r\n4. The reader, put together by Professor Wiman, is also an interesting artifact to think about (who recurs etc) on its own, and as an example for us of collecting poems that jump out, organizing, and returning to them. \r\n\r\nThis is a poetry class; dont take a spot in it if that does not appeal to you.",
    "Id definitely recommend Poetry and Faith to another student. If your classmates are as engaged and humble as mine were, your seminar discussions are sure to be a joy. And the readings that Professor Wiman has assembled in the course packet are unbelievable. I know that Ill return to them.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The readings are wonderful. It is a great chance to read widely in poetry. I trusted always that Professor Wiman had selected excellent works. I think time in seminar could have been improved with a bit more structure, like a leading opening questions beyond just what our impressions were. Having said that, I did appreciate that this course allowed people to talk about what moved them.",
    "Yes - youll be very inspired by some moving poetry and hopefully reconsider your understanding of faith in the process!",
    "Yes-- the course is great for anyone (religious or not) who is interested in studying poetry, faith, or both. The topics in class always lead to really great and interesting discussions . Plus, everyone in the class gets the chance to memorize and share poetry .",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a safe, welcoming environment to explore really important questions about faith, while also improving your ability to write, analyze, and discuss poetry. A chance to take a class with Christian Wiman is a once in a lifetime opportunity.",
    "This is a wonderful course, even if you yourself are not religious. In studying both religion and poetry, you really end up learning about what it means to be human."
