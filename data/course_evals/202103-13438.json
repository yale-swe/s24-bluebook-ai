                "How to use Aristotelian principles to analyze films, a survey of other theories that explain a films structure and characters (Voglers, Joseph Campbells Heros Journey, Jungian archetypes)",
                "By taking this course, I learned a lot about storytelling tropes and how that carries from the plays seen by Aristotle thousands of years ago to modern action movies. It was especially insightful to return to the question, \"Why do we tell stories,\" a question that I believe still doesn't have a concrete answer.",
                "I learned the essentials in writing a script for a film; the class gave really good insights in what makes a good story and how that is applied to make a good film.",
                "I learned a lot about what components are necessary to write a captivating and compelling story. I didn't know much about the process of writing screenplays before and this course definitely gave me a good introduction into what it can look like.",
                "Film Theory, storytelling, critical analysis of movies, writing",
                "Through this course, I learned about the art of good storytelling and I learned how good storytelling applies in modern cinema. In addition, I developed the skill of thinking about film from an analytical standpoint and I gained a deeper appreciation for good cinema. With the concepts I learned about storytelling, I was able to apply them in the form of an original narrative.",
                "This class was a really great insight into what fun, niche, creative seminars could be like at Yale. We got to talk about movies and storytelling in an academic setting, and though we had a lot of fun, I also think I gained a lot of interesting perspective on human nature and the nature of storytelling. This was by far my most fun and laid-back class, and as a STEM student, it was a wonderful humanities credit and a great first year seminar.",
                "This class taught me about the enduring nature of human storytelling and its principles. Although we discussed the nature of storytelling from the perspective of topics like form and structure, we also spent time focusing on what the practice of telling and experiencing these stories means to us as people, which I thought was a very valuable insight. I would highly recommend this class to anybody with an interest in creative writing or screenwriting. You'll definitely learn a lot.",

                "Sometimes the discussions dragged on because we would simply go around the room and have everyone share basically the same assignment over and over again. However, in general the assignments and materials were interested so give and take.",
                "This class is very well structured and the assignments were also both challenging and fun to do! Dr. Price makes his points about storytelling and its recurrent pattern throughout time very clear, concise and entertaining. One way I think this course can be improved is that it would be nice to have more time discussing this tropes during the class on top of lectures and movie screenings, but otherwise, this is a great course!",
                "Professor Price is excellent; discussions were great and assignments were beneficial to aid understanding.",
                "Strengths: interesting discussions and readings, workload was very very manageable and you could be as engaged as you chose to be, assignments were interesting and were an opportunity to watch really great movies\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures at time felt like repetitions of what was already written in the professor's book",
                "Strengths: Really good lectures and discussions, you'll learn a lot about movies, fun assignments\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "I think the discussion aspect of the course was very valuable as it allowed students to present their opinions on the subjective matter that is good storytelling. In addition, the heavy emphasis on cinema makes the material learned in class very relatable. One thing that could be expanded upon is the amount of creative writing done in the class. The original narrative assignment allowed students to apply their learning in a unique way, and I think that it would be good have more assignments like that.",
                "This class was a great experience all over. Brian is a fantastic guy, super engaging and understanding. The workload is not too high at all, but I still felt very engaged with the material. This is a first-year seminar that really emphasizes the class discussion, so you really get out of this class whatever you put into it. I was always excited about the class discussions, had so much fun with the assignments, and had genuine fun in class.\r\n\r\nI can't really think if any real weakness with this class. The only thing I can think of is that this class focuses a lot more on movies than any other medium, because Brian is a screenwriter, and this class was for the most part about classical storytelling in movies, which may not have been super clear from the description. I don't really see this as a weakness, though--Brian is super passionate about movies, and it was so much fun. I got to watch amazing classics and turn them into movie nights with my friends as my homework, which was great. Plus, Brian's expertise on the topic of screenwriting makes the class all the more engaging.",
                "I really enjoyed everything about this class! It's a great first-year seminar.",
                "The strengths are that it is an interesting topic, the weaknesses are the execution of the topic. For the most part I was learning the subject matter, his power points and lectures were clear and understandable, but when it came to applying the material we learned, it was lackluster to say the least. We spent two weeks reading our homework assignments out loud one at a time to the whole class which, while it was fun to hear other people's work, felt like a huge waste of time. I never received written feedback on anything except my final paper so I felt no sense of whether or not I was progressing as a student in this class.",
                "The course material was very engaging in that the material was always entertaining. However, sometimes lecture could get repetitive, especially when it came to sharing written assignments."

Professor Price is an incredibly good professor, and he has a way with making every concept we covered in class interesting and relevantnot only to the course materials but also to our own lives. He's also an incredibly charismatic lecturer, and you will definitely be very engaged. Take it to change the way you see movies forever.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Taking this course, I not only learned about storytelling on a deeper level, but I also gained new perspectives on how to hold more interesting conversations with people and why human beings as a species tell stories to one another.",
                "YES! I am so glad I got this as my first-year seminar. It was fun, not too difficult, engaging and was a really nice respite when my other classes started to feel overwhelming. Brian is also a really great guy, and he's worth getting to know. I would highly recommend this course, even if you have no interest in screenwriting (I'm a STEM student, through-and-through, with no particular interest in movies). As long as you have some kind of interest in or draw toward storytelling of any kind, this class is for you.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The topics we covered were very interesting, and we learned to apply them in really engaging ways. As a discussion-based class, it fostered a fascinating forum to exchange thoughts and ideas about the works we read and the stories we wrote.",
