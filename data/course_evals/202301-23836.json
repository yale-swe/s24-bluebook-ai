                "Strengths: The professor and the TF were great people and they really made the class environment enjoyable. Additionally throughout most of the semester the format of the course made the class less stressful. Weaknesses: Personally, I thought that at some points the class was really unstructured and I wished that, especially during problem sets, the final project, and even the reading responses, we had clearer expectations about what we should do. As a result, I felt there was a huge leap between the course material and the level of difficulty for assignments, which made some parts of the course more challenging than others. The TF (Amanda), however, was great at addressing many of those concerns.",
                "This course was moved online for the Spring semester, which was unfortunate. I wish the course were more consistent with the syllabus, but the actual subject matter his interesting.",
                "This course was entirely on Zoom, which is not ideal but understandable given the circumstances. To compensate, there should have been more structure and organization with the course as a whole to ensure continued student engagement.",
                "The course was designed very well. The topics were interesting and well planned, the assignments and projects were helpful and matched the coherence of the course. However, the execution was not ideal. Because the class took place over Zoom, it was really hard to get the most out of it.",
                "Class went off syllabus plan in the middle",
                "Strength - very relaxed course, professor P was very nice as was the TA, Amanda Weiss. Not too much course work either\r\nWeakness - It was completely online, which can be a strength or weakness depending on the person",
                "The strength of the course is definitely Professor Aronow and TF Amanda. Working with them and learning from them as well as the engage classmates are definitely highlights of my last semester at Yale. The only weakness is that I sometimes feel that the 50-min class session is rather rushed towards the end. Wish we had more time!"
