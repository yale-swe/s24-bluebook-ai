                "Knowledge of the humanistic side of medicine, explored through related texts in Russian literature, medical writing, philosophy, and ethics.",
                "I learned more about life itself, both generally, and specifically within medicine. We covered a variety of topics and if anything I think this course made be a better and more empathetic person. If I continue on into medicine, I think that I will be far better prepared for the challenges that physicians face compared to fellow peers who haven't taken this course.",
                "I learned to think more critically about people's viewpoints, to learn about their potential biases, whether they think in a classical or romantic way, and whether they think like Aristotle or Plato or both.",
                "The intersection of faith, medicine, and the humanities, incorporating a variety of historical texts to understand the role (if any) science has on humanities and the other way around.",
                "By taking this class, I learned a lot about how medicine is related to topics in the humanities, like philosophy. Additionally, I gained a lot of insight about how there are many things in the field of medicine that are not completely certain.",
                "I developed a keen understanding as to the interrelations between medicine and the humanities and a profound philosophical view as to what goes through doctors' minds while treating patients.",

                "I learned about a myriad of ways of viewing the world, such as rationalism, romanticism, and scientism, and I gained confidence in coming to my own conclusions about them. While many of our readings and conversations helped me understand the experience and pressures of working in the medical field, they also enriched my understanding of myself and of other people. Above all, I grew to appreciate the value that the humanities play in our understanding of an increasingly science-driven world.",
                "I learned tons of content in this class - from the readings, from the lectures, and from our \"field trips.\" Dr. Morrison curated this class so exceptionally, including many pieces of literature that fit so well into the course description. In terms of skills that I learned, I learned how to take notes effectively for seminar-style class participation and how to synthesize what I learned in order to write a personal narrative.",

                "This course is very strong in the readings and assignments chosen by Dr. Morrison, as well as Dr. Morrison himself, being a wonderful lecturer and truly exemplifying the virtues he preaches. It is also wonderful how Dr. Morrison takes the class to numerous locations and bringing in many guest speakers to engage us and help us learn. This course has few weaknesses, if any; the lack of definitive structure on some of the assignments can be confusing, but Dr. Morrison is always open for guidance.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Morrison is a fantastic lecturer who is deeply, deeply passionate about both medicine and the humanities. His love for the subject matter is contagious. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that the two assigned papers were a little TOO open-ended. I did not exactly understand what was expected of us.",
                "This course is incredibly strong in both its content and the way that it is taught by Dr. Morrison. I think that weaknesses are hard to find within such a compelling and insightful course, but if I had to say anything, I think I would say that sometimes I would have liked to have more time for discussion. Sometimes lectures took up a large portion of class, and although I loved these lectures, I especially appreciated days where the lecture left time for discussion.",
                "The strengths of this course are that very valuable and thought-provoking texts and presentations are read, which allow the student to think about their world in a larger way. Reading these viewpoints and having the instructor concisely and effectively talk about these texts allowed me to best take away from this course. However, one weakness was that not all of the students regularly participated in discussions. This was sometimes because the instructor's presentations, field trips, or guest speakers took up a lot of time. Part of this was also because of how discussions were started: the instructor could have asked specific questions about each text that would have allowed students to express their differing ideas. However, discussions were started mainly on what each student felt about the text, which may have been a too broad question.",
                "S- was held in a variety of different locations and included lectures by a variety of different prominent figures in the medicine area\r\nW- almost strayed a little too far off topic- that is, did not get to the point (ie- medicines and sciences, in a modern context too)",
                "One strength of this class was that we were really able to get out of the classroom and learn about the topics of our class in cool places the YUAG, the Center for British Art, Marsh botanical gardens, and the Cushing center. However, I would say that one weakness was that the normal class lectures were sometimes a little dense and could be more engaging.",
                "Strengths: Readings and lectures were incredibly interesting! Dr. Morrison has a wealth of knowledge to share with the class that I think shaped the new view of medicine as not just a science, but a philosophy and an art that I now have.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Readings could often be incredibly extensive (80-100 pages a week), and class discussion was often formatted to where it felt like everyone was competing to get a word in in the short 20 minutes we were offered to discuss the readings - we often didn't even get to every assigned reading during the discussion! In addition, while the midterm and final papers were very freeform, little guidance was offered as to what exactly we should write for them and what was expected of us as we wrote the paper, and criticism given on the final version of the papers was often on factors that were not explicitly asked for in the prompt.",
                "Strengths: amazing professor, interesting readings, engaging discussions, opportunities to visit interesting parts of campus\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: its easy to feel lost if you dont spend time trying to understand the readings",
                "The professor is extreme caring and knowledgeable.",
                "The course covered so many different thinkers and writers and their philosophies, and it incorporated learning through lectures, conversations, and interaction with art.",
                "The strengths of this course were that it did not feel too burdensome in terms of workload yet I still feel that I learned a lot, it exposed to me writers and thinkers that I had not been exposed to before, and Dr. Morrison is an excellent educator! Weaknesses of the course was that sometimes it was challenging to participate in class and sometimes the 1 hour, 15 minute class felt like a bit too long. I would personally prefer to meet three times a week for 45 minutes each instead of twice a week for 75 minutes each.",
                "Strengths: a variety of perspectives were offered by guest lecturers and field trips; carefully selected variety of readings for the class; professor that is very passionate about the subject matter and his knowledge behind it; thorough feedback on presentation projects; opportunities outside of the class were provided (shadowing, for example)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not many opportunities for collaborating with peers; most of the course was based on passive learning from the instructor's lectures; grading was abstract and not always clear (especially with Midterm and Final papers); large amount of readings that was very difficult to reasonably keep up with"

                "I would certainly recommend this course, not only to the pre-meds (although they would all benefit massively from taking this course), but also other students who might wish to learn more about medicine and philosophies regarding how to live a more fulfilling life. The workload of this course is exceptionally low, and the readings are quite fulfilling. The class is engaging and was truly my favorite course this semester.",
                "Yes. If you are a pre-med who is losing faith or interest in medicine, this course is great at igniting that spark. I was not interested in medicine before this course, but I am now considering going down the pre-med route because of this course.",
                "I would recommend this to every student at Yale. Although it is particularly insightful in the context of medicine, I think it provides incredibly valuable insights to students of all areas of studies. At its very basis, this course examines humanity, life, and death, and through these avenues it betters our empathy and ability to understand the world around us.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course because this class offers a non-stressful yet rich way to learn about the world and people around you, what the human condition can really be, and how medicine encapsulates much of life's uncertainties. This course is a way for students to brighten their own viewpoints about morality, death, science, and the humanities.",
                "I would potentially recommend this course if a student wants to express themselves with personal writing while also understanding medicines in a less pre-med sense.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course because the topics relating to medicine and uncertainty are pretty interesting overall. However, there are quite a bit of readings, which can get quite difficult if you are unfamiliar with topics in philosophy.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student, not just pre-meds, interested in understanding the humanities, arts, and philosophy side of medicine. It gave me a greater appreciation for the work doctors do and gave me deep insight as to what a career as a doctor would feel like.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course, Dr. Morrison is an amazing professor and such a lovely person to talk to. I also found the material engaging and thought-provoking and I feel that I left the class better equipped for a career in medicine.",
                "Yes, its a great low-stress environment to learn about medicine and its intersection humanities and arts",
                "I would recommend this course because I feel like I gained a much better understanding of myself and about people, not only with regard to the medical profession but the broader world.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially to one who is interested in pursuing a career in the healthcare field. It introduced me to so many aspects of healthcare that I was not aware of before, changed the way that I perceive physicians, and shed light on certain medicine-related topics that are often considered taboo (such as making mistakes, uncertainty, etc.).",
                "Yes, it helped change and form my perspectives on what medicine truly is. It is a lot of reading, but the readings are intellectually stimulating. Dr. Morrison is also an amazing instructor that is very passionate about his work and subject matter. This course is probably not worth it, however, if you are not a premed student\/interested in healthcare. The grading is a bit abstract in this course, so that is something to keep in mind when you are deciding on this course. There were multiple points throughout the semester where I did not know what my standing was in the class."
