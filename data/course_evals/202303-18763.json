This class gave me a great foundation for calculus and math in general that will be essential as I take upper level STEM courses.",

                "The strengths of this course were that the many assignments ensured that we did not fall behind on the material, and the tests were reflective of the problem sets and class worksheets. However, I feel that I did not learn as much as I hoped from my instructor's teaching--a lot of times, the material was either glossed over or sped through, so it was difficult for me to grasp in class.",
                "Weaknesses: I almost never went to class because teaching myself was more effective and less time consuming than going to section with Meghan. Meghan knows a lot of theory but she wasn't the best at explaining things and she moved very quickly (and didn't use lecture time particularly efficiently). For example, she would do a double u substitution using an obscure property of arithmetic and then not explain how she got there until someone raised their hand and asked. I wish she would have focused on the specific tricky scenarios we would encounter on the exam. It felt like some of the questions were designed so that you could only do well if you knew some obscure theorem. For example, on the final there was a question that you would only get correct if you wrote out the entire Fundamental Theorem of Calculus on your cheat sheet that we didnt really perseverate on in class. Strengths: some of the TFs were very passionate and good at their job, but that was up to luck.",
                "Terrible course very poor organization and teaching.  I stopped going to class because I wasn't learning anything, had to read the textbook and watch online videos. The professor talked about her personal life for half the class then poorly explained the content.",
                "Strengths: The test were hard, but fair. The problem sets were reasonable but definitely challenging in a good way. The TAs and professor were very approachable and helpful. The content was taught clearly and well organized. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: problem sets take a lot of time, but aren't worth a lot of the final grade.",
                "Exam questions could be made to better match material practiced in class and homeworks.",
                "The professor was not as good at teaching as I had hoped which impacted my ability to learn and retain information.",
                "The level of support from the teaching staff is great. I think the clarity with which concepts are taught could be improved.",
                "The peer tutoring program was great as it allowed us to work together on problems and get problem sets done, which made learning a lot easier. The issue with the class can be the speed at which topics are covered."
