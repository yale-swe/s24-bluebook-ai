I felt like this semester went by especially fast due to the pace of the lessons, so not sure about how much of the new vocabulary and grammar structures I will remember, but certainly much more increased familiarity with the Chinese language and it was good to be able to apply our knowledge to discuss current affairs and interesting topics, taking advantage of our advanced level of Chinese proficiency.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: L5 Chinese focuses a lot more on social, cultural, and historical topics in its lessons than the other levels of Chinese at Yale, which allows you to get a more nuanced understanding of Chinese culture and learn a bit about its modern history.",
                "I think its made well sometimes a little stressful but nothing unmanageable",
                "A certain strength of the Chinese classes here in general is the organization and structure of the course such that all sections were coordinated, and I would always have clear knowledge of what I would be learning each week and what the expectations were in order to do well in the class. There were always opportunities to practice our Chinese in many different ways, and although I did feel at times because it was only 3 days a week that we didnt get too much practice with content that was newly taught, it was probably the best approach considering how much content we had to get through in the semester. \r\nOne thing I might have benefited from was extra non-graded grammar and reading exercises. Because every component was only practiced once and would always count towards the final grade, there was pressure to only focus on the task at hand  I wouldve loved to have a risk-free way of writing an essay or practicing grammar drills for homework.",
                "The course has a very reasonable workload and has enough assignments that while manageable also allow you to succeed as long as you stay on top of them. On the weaker side, the section on learning to read traditional characters was literally only one day, and it might have been nice to devote a little more time to it even if it still wouldn't be a major part of the curriculum.",
                "Great course, maybe a tad slow",
                "Well designed, cumulative learning"

                "I would recommend taking L5 Chinese, it lets you learn a bit more about the cultural and social issues in China that the other levels of Chinese at Yale don't necessarily delve too deep into. It also is a great way to continue your Chinese learning and the Chinese department is stellar with its course organization and teaching, as usual.",
                "Yes, its a good way to further your Chinese education",
                "Definitely if you are interested in increasing your Chinese language proficiency. It is the same recommendation Id give regardless of which Chinese level you are at. There is certainly a time commitment for the class, but for the skills you pick up it is definitely worth it.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to continue to improve their Chinese, and is serious about language study.",
                "Yup, definitely a good step in one's Chinese journey",
