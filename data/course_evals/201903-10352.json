   "comments": [
    "I learned about language and biography and some helpful theories by Benedict Anderson.",
    "This course was a perfectly-crafted introduction to linguistic concepts and the role language identities have in our society.",
    "This course provides a broad overview and introduction to the field of linguistic anthropology.  You cover some of the technical aspects to linguistics, but focus much more on the social and cultural implications and aspects to language.  We covered language and identity construction in many different aspects. I left the course feeling like I had a lot of general ideas about how language affects our everyday lives and its connections to identity and culture.",
    "This class taught me to view language not as a product of the speaker's social tendencies. Here are two of my biggest takeaways: standard languages offer global capital in conjunction with the authenticity of local language, and language is usually gendered in ways we may not expect.",
    "A broader understanding of language in context",
    "Understanding of linguistics and how it relates to identity formation",
    "I gained a better understanding of the power of language and the many unconscious messages that are transmitted through the way people speak. I learned about the linguistic bias and prejudices that occur in our society and how faulty they are. I had never taken a linguistics or anthropology course before, so I gained knowledge in completely new areas.",
    "I learned some about past research in linguistic anthropology, though most of the readings were more than 30 years old, matching the overall outdated style of the class."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "not very intersectional. units are weirdly categorized. even though the class is supposedly trying to dismantle\/question the 'otherness' of certain languages\/dialects, it reaffirms whiteness as the base. Ironic.",
    "I would have preferred to go more in-depth on a few topics than barely touch on lots of interesting concepts. This course was sporadic and didn't seem to be completely planned.",
    "This course was originally a more advanced anthropology course and it does show, especially in the way lecture slides are presented.  A lot of the information goes over your head in lectures, especially more technical anthro\/linguistics terminology and theory and it is up to you to figure out how much you want to explore those ideas to better understand them.  You can get by fine in classes without the exact knowledge but sometimes ideas can get \"lost in translation\".  However, you can see Prof. Errington's passion for the subject matter and for sharing his research.  Another strength of the course most definitely is the TF.  Bhoomika was really helpful in breaking down concepts and making subject matter more approachable.",
    "I think the topic of the course is a strength in and of itself. It's a well-rounded linguistic anthropology class that gives some historic exposition to much of the social linguistic phenomenon occurring in the United States.\r\nOne of the classes largest weaknesses is it's lecture-oriented tendencies. The class is set up as a seminar, but I found that class would progress without much discussion, instead having us listen as we flipped through the slides. I would argue that some of the best days for discussion and even note-taking happened when something went wrong with the projector. At the end of the day, though, I don't think I ever found myself bored. Despite the lack of seminar discussions, I still liked the class.\r\nOne side note: essay grades, which determine the entirety of your grade, aren't determined with much clarity. Kinda a hit or miss situation.",
    "Strengths:  Specificity of some examples, such as Mendoza-Denton reading etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very little class discussion, despite the small class and room size. I really enjoyed it once when we opened up to class discussion. Some readings were blatantly racist - which I believe was the point - and I wish we had more opportunities to discuss that in class. \r\nTo be frank, Professor Errington did not make the material very engaging. Sometimes I didn't feel like concepts were clearly explained.\r\nI wish we had structured the semester differently, rather than tackling a whole identity group in 2-3 weeks. Perhaps that is just too large of a scope to tackle gender and race and class and nationality.",
    "I learned some interesting things such as the African American vernacular english controversy. Some of the readings were too outdated. We were citing sources written in the 1950s. There was no intersectionality in the way we approached certain identity categories.",
    "The strengths of this course are in the material. Its a fascinating subject, so the in class lectures were always interesting to attend. I left every class feeling like I understood the material and the subject better.\r\nHowever the class felt a little disorganized. It was sometimes difficult to find the homework readings and for the first few essays I wasn't entirely sure what was expected. However the class made more sense over time, and meetings with the TF were very helpful and informative. The class could be improved with better access to the materials. I also think it would benefit from discussion sections. The class was in a weird grey area between lecture and seminar, and I think discussion sections would have prompted a better flow of ideas and discussion of the material.",
    "Strengths: The TF (Bhoomika) did a good job engaging students when she met with them one on one, there were some interesting topics\r\nWeaknesses: lack of structure\/clarity about assignments, outdated readings, poorly managed lecture time (discussion was a part of the grade, but the class was essentially just a recap of the readings each lecture)"

   "comments": [
    "yes.",
    "only if they need to fulfill a requirement for the anthro major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student- it was engaging and relevant to daily conversation. I see the world differently after taking this class.",
    "If you have an interest in linguistic anthropology, in whatever sense, I would say yes. If you have no idea what linguistic anthropology is, still take it if it sounds interesting!  The readings are pretty interesting if you actually do them, which can be hard at times because there's no section and the only use for them would be to get some more in depth explanations that the professor gives himself in lecture, and if you want to use them for your papers throughout the semester. However, I always found lectures more interesting when I'd actually done the readings.  The course can feel very sporadic at times and not cohesive, and at the beginning there is a lot of technical jargon thrown at you.  I hope that this will be reorganized later on, but once you can get past some of this you do get some deep and interesting insights into language and culture theory that I appreciated.  It's not too much work because it's just 3 papers throughout the semester and the final research paper.",
    "I would if they had any interest in linguistic anthropology.",
    "I do not think I would recommend this course to another student, unless they were interested in linguistic anthropology.",
    "No, unless the course is redesigned with updated readings.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who was interested in linguistics. I really do feel like it broadened my understanding of language and the power of language. I would warn them about the slight disorganization, but would tell them that it's an interesting class regardless.",
    "No, probably not, unless you have to take it to fulfill a requirement"
