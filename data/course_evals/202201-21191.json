These were extremely informative and packed with information and visual examples on each topic. The examples shown also gave me a good amount of visual inspiration for my own work. In class we would discuss our progress on our projects, and get tips/advice from Professor Scott on how to improve our designs. His comments and encouragement helped me to become a stronger designer.",
                "I learned about how graphic design started and how it evolved over time through different movements and designers. I also learned how to design a publication/timeline. Designing the projects actually takes a lot of consideration than one might think, so it was nice when we took the time to say what we learned. It was also nice to talk about the life of a designer and setting up a portfolio since the structure of the class was often fluid.",

                "I loved this course. Not only would we discuss what we had learned from his lecture videos, but also what we had learned from working on our two projects. I feel that not many courses do the latter, and it truly helped me to acknowledge my progress as a designer.",
                "This course was really nice in that we were asked to do several iterations and Doug asked us to first make initial sketches before going into the design of the whole project. I think though that it would have been nice to maybe talk about some parts of the lectures in class since it felt kind of separate elements outside of just asking clarifying questions about lecture.",
                "Love the physical examples of print related artifacts Doug showed in class. He is definitely knowledgeable, but the recorded lectures are poorly conducted. The precious time in class was wasted with tedious critiques of out-dated assignments. They could be beneficial for undergrads who had no graphic design experience, or perhaps would work better during the first semester of prelim year, but at this point they are a waste of time.",
                "The strength of this course was that the pre-recorded lectures could be sped up and viewed at 2x speed. Doug's articulation is clear and easily understandable.\r\n\r\nThe weakness was that Doug has absolutely no criticality when it comes to teaching graphic design history. His lectures basically consist in him going through his favorite posters and books and pointing out what he likes about them. He doesn't extract or distill overarching themes, concepts, or formal choices from the work he talks about. There is neither insightful visual/formal analysis nor in-depth scrutiny of social, political, or economic context. As such, it is very difficult to remember any of the works he lectures about, because there are so few critical insights to latch onto or overarching contexts to situate them in. He has no critique or even definition for what Modernism consists of. He claimed Art Nouveau was the first worldwide art movement when he gave no examples of its proliferation in Africa, China, or Latin America. When asked about why he gave progressively fewer examples of non-European/Northern American artists as the course proceeded from ancient to contemporary times, he responded that books about contemporary designers from outside Europe/North America are still currently being written, when somehow, I'm pretty sure they've already been out for a while.\r\n\r\nHis assignments, the Landmark Poster and Timeline accordion print, taught me nothing about how to design. I found very little merit in trying to remake the style of another graphic designer, which is basically what the Landmark Poster consisted of. Doug claimed that requiring the Timeline assignment to be an accordion fold engaged with the visualization of time in a particularly apt way, but frankly that doesn't need to be a choice he makes for us. For example, the book format also deals with time, but we simply couldn't make a book  it had to be an accordion fold. His feedback on works-in-progress was also for the most part unconstructive  generally he would only point out small, technical points for improvement, if anything. Class would invariably let out early because there was nothing to say.\r\n\r\nWe tried to bring up our concerns to him in class once, in response to which he proceeded to talk at us for a good 15+ minutes about why we chose to come to this program, without answering our questions or demonstrating the slightest willingness to be flexible with the way he ran the class. For the most part this class was run in a very top-down, infantilizing manner  he just treated us like children.",
                "The major strength is that this course combines historical content with hands-on graphic design experience. It is interesting to receive continual feedback on your projects and to see how your classmates' projects evolve during the semester. A few recommendations -- As the semester progressed, the classes tended to focus on critiquing projects, rather than on covering the historical content. In some cases, the class sessions ended early. Given how incredibly knowledgeable Professor Scott is, I would have loved for us to fill the remaining time in these classes by hearing more about the historical content. I also loved the classes where Professor Scott brought in physical materials for us to look at (such as old metal type) and think it would be great to do more of this in future iterations of the class. Perhaps the class could even spend a session using the old printing press in Sterling Memorial Library, or visiting the Beinecke to look at important objects like the Gutenberg Bible!"

                "I would recommend this course! It's really great, but I feel like not many people know about it. I know that most art classes are hard to get into, especially the graphic design intro courses, so this is a good alternative since most of my peers were not art majors but you just need to email Doug ahead of time to get a spot. This class was nice because it wasn't as intense as some of the other graphic design courses I've taken, but you still learn a lot and the environment is very nice and open for feedback. Doug is just super chill and so knowledgeable!",

                "Absolutely! I did not have previous graphic design experience but found course content accessible and compelling. It was cool to receive feedback each week on my projects and continually iterate toward the finished product. Especially if you are not an art student, this class can be a relatively low-stakes way to engage a different part of your brain and do a different kind of work from your other classes."
