The exercises and assignments in this class pushed my writing skills and at times, my comfort zone, but I believe I came out of it as a much better journalist. Professor Brill emphasized deadlines, punctuality, and hard work all skills I sharpened during his seminar. I learned to view the pieces I read and the pieces I write with a critical eye, making sure to questions and fact check everything. I learned how to find the right sources, to turn every stone, to ask the right questions, and perhaps most importantly, to follow what I'm curious about and always answer a question in the pieces I write."

                "I think my writing and confidence in my writing improved a lot. The course is interesting, well structured, and thorough. The only weakness is that there are many readings we touch on briefly or not at all, which was sometimes frustrating, especially when class would end 30 minutes early.",
                "I hate online learning.",
                "Strength is the content, but the professor can be unnecessarily rude and biting sometimes.",
                "Strengths: Professor Brill, the readings, the assignments, and the guests.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had done more reporting during the course, maybe have written a smaller, shorter article as well. Also, make sure you get a good editing partner.",
                "Weaknesses - The class time was too short, and the discussion not focused enough on workshopping. I think it is valuable in any writing class to exchange work, but we never read our classmates' work in this class nor had them read ours.",
                "Strengths: The guests were awesome, the teacher was succinct and clear. Weaknesses: Could be longer in time",
                "The writing assignments in this class were excellent, as were the reading assignments. It was also incredible to have guest speakers and journalists in our seminar that was a very cool and unique experience. I thought the writing partner system was a great idea, but think that it may have been useful to rotate partners at least once during the semester. This is because I think it would be helpful to get another classmate's perspective on my writing as well as get to know someone else in the class better."

When needed, we had the ability to screenshare and that was great. Overall, it was the class I had that felt most akin to a regular in-person course, besides of course the fact that we never met in person",

The assignments in this course involved interviewing multiple individuals and making sure that our stories centered around people, which meant that I felt very engaged with the outside world even though seminar was online. Professor Brill's structured syllabus and essay plans meant that I felt prepared for every class. The interactive nature of seminar, and the way Professor Brill made sure everyone was involved in the discussion, made classes interesting and lively."

                "Yes, Brill is sort of rough around the edges but he wants the best for everyone. And hes actually vey responsive, so dont be afraid to reach out, ask questions, etc. ALSO if youre considering taking this course with Bob Woodward and cant decide between the two, you should know this: Brill has a brilliant (HA!) mind for the journalism *business*, not only writing. So if, in addition to writing, youre an entrepreneurial person, or interested in being an executive, or just want a business perspective on journalism, Brills course may be a good fit.",
                "Yes, if they want to be taught by Steven Brill and learn from his decades of expertise. No, if they want a class that nurtures their skills and abilities.",
                "Yes, Professor Brill is great especially if you want to get into journalism. (Prof. Oppenheimer is also great and super on top of things behind the scenes)",
                "Most definitely. Because of its focus on the \"real world\", this class felt unlike any other I have taken at Yale. It was highly relevant and useful in the career I want to pursue and made me feel connected to the world outside of Yale's campus."
