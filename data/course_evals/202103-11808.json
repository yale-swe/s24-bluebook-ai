                "I learned so much about The Faerie Queene, which is a poem that I have truly grown to love. Reading The Faerie Queene was a pretty tremendous undertaking, as the poem is massive, but it's such a rich text. TFQ speaks to how religion, gender, race, and class were understood in the 1500s, which is fascinating. I also read some of the major literature on TFQ, learned about Edmund Spenser himself (not such a great dude, but he sure could write), and was exposed to a lot of vocabulary and history from the Elizabethan Age.",
                "This class really taught me how to integrate critics into my literary analysis. I learnt a huge amount about how to engage with a text's context in a literary research paper, and about Spenser, the renaissance writers, and how politics and literature mutually inform one another."

                "The greatest strength of this course is Professor Nicholson. She's one of the best professors I've had in my four years at Yale. She's so enthusiastic about The Faerie Queene, is an insightful seminar leader, and provides helpful feedback. Seriously, she's amazing. \r\n\r\nThe Faerie Queene was the course's second greatest strength. It's a difficult read, yes, but so deeply rewarding. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses. I loved this class. It's made me want to explore more English Renaissance literature.",
                "Catherine Nicholson was definitely the strength she was so enthusiastic in her teaching of a difficult text that I was inspired over and over again. That said, I would definitely recommend that we not read the entire Faerie Queene in a semester. There is WAY too much going on to absorb even if you read at a good pace, and I would have liked more time to really get into the details.",
                "This class has lots of strengths- it's probably got the best structure of any class I've had at Yale. Prof Nicholson provides loads of support as you gear up for the final research paper, and frequent 'critical engagements' help you develop the kills you need for the final paper. Prof Nicholson is an amazing instructor with a deep knowledge of her subject, and who really cares about each students success in the class. She provides tons of feedback, and the class moved at a great pace."

                "Yes I would. Its a great class to fulfill requirements and class discussion was very engaging.",
                "Absolutely, this is the way to get your Ren credit done and to genuinely enjoy doing it",
                "Yes, absolutely. Professor Nicholson is wonderfulif you get the chance to learn from her, you should take it. The content of the course was also just so fascinating. Highly recommend!",
                "YES! This course was one of the best I've taken at Yale. While the text is challenging (Spenser isn't for everyone), Prof Nicholson makes room for people to disagree and critique the work without it becoming boring. You'll learn a huge amount about literary analysis, and Prof Nicholson is an amazing instructor who clearly cares about the text and her students, and structures the course so that you grow as a reader and critic.",
