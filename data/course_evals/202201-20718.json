                "I think that this course was good and has the potential to be really really good if there's a little bit more time for the professor to get familiar with it. I think that the two weeks where we did not have a professor in the beginning of the semester was a little bit hard to recover from, but I think that considering all of the factors, it was a great class and I learned a decent amount. The only thing I would say is that I think she was a bit flustered/disorganized from being assimilated to the teaching environment at Yale so quickly so it was a bit all over the place.",
                "I really liked the structure of the class. I like how it was the same book and a very similar structure which continued off first semester (ITAL 110).",
                "I think uniformity across this course's instruction would have been helpful. In italian 110, each course moved at roughly the same pace and completed the same assignments, but this seemed to range across classes, and made it difficult to plan work. This section in particular seemed to operate very differently than others, which was hard when the syllabus in terms of exams was still followed. Keeping up with the same assignments etc might have been helpful when it came time for standardized exams."
