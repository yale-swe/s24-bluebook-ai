                "I'm not a STEM major, and I think this class really helped me broaden my mind and develop new perspectives. I really appreciated it for being a break from my mostly humanities and social sciences- focused classes. I also appreciated how we focused not only on a biological perspective of the diseases that we covered, but also on a social and cultural perspective, especially in regards to the polio and HIV/AIDS epidemics.",
                "I learned a lot about the fundamentals of immunology and the history and biological mechanisms of viruses. There was a strong emphasis on how to understand, interpret, and discuss scientific literature and the biological mechanisms that drive disease.",
                "Through this course I gained a good foundation in immunology.",
                "I learned the many mechanisms of the immune system, covering both the innate and adaptive immune system. I learned about how different diseases can gain access into the immune system, hijacking healthy host cells.",
                "Learned a lot about immune system, pathogenic microbes, beneficial gut microbes, various pandemics throughout history and corresponding public health responses, and the experience of living with these diseases through a multimedia approach that involved lectures, discussions, and trips to the art gallery and medical school",
                "I learned how to present work to others whether it be the previous readings or a research topic and come up with direct but discussable questions. I also learned how to read dense readings and still retain the information by looking up different terms and making an image of the pathway or mechanism in my head. The majority of the course material on the immune system and different diseases were completely knew topics, so I learned those material by scratch.",
                "I learned about the innate and adaptive immune systems and how both can work in harmony to defend the body against microbes. We applied these concepts to learn how viruses spread in the context of epidemics, but I also gained insight on the historical and social aspects of epidemiology."

                "Strengths: Good introductory overview of immunology. The NY trip was a nice addition to learn and also bring the seminar closer together. The trips to the art museum and medical school were really informative and inspiring. The guest speakers were amazing and a good change of pace. Keep the trips and the speakers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The professor failed to really focus on chronic inflammation like in irritable bowel diseases, arthritis, diabetes, etc. instead of just acute inflammation like in physical trauma, etc. I was really excited to learn more about the former before I entered this class. She did say she would fix this for future terms. Also the class is a lot of information to take in at once in such a short time without regular low-stakes checks on how well students are understanding the content. The book Polio: An American Story was not a favorite. I wish it focused on the disease more.",
                "A weakness of this course is that sometimes, I felt that Professor Kavathas was perhaps slightly hostile when students asked questions in class. That's not to say that she isn't an amazing professor (she absolutely is!). But I didn't personally feel as though the classroom environment encouraged the asking of questions. \r\n\r\nA strength of this course is that Professor Kavathas is a very generous and fun professor; she took us out to Arethusa's on the first day of class and took us to New York for a day trip to visit a science museum. All of this encourages a really fun camaraderie between the students which makes for a fun class.",
                "strengths: great content, engaged class\r\n\r\nweaknesses: too much history in my opinion (not a bad thing, but I would have rather spent some of the time on reading historical works on learning even more about immunology)",
                "The class has very engaging readings and is very participation-focused, which makes the class very enjoyable. The guest speakers and the field trip really enhanced the course too, making it even more engaging and interesting. Some of the content, however, is a little bit hard to understand, but Professor Kavathas is very good at explaining the subjects that don't make sense immediately.",
                "This course offered interesting content both lecture and discussion wise. However, there were times when the lecture material was dense or too detailed with not enough explanation on the topic.",
                "The course was really comprehensive and provided in-depth background to understanding immunology, and I am now pursuing research in the immunobiology field.",
                "A strength was the professor and the guest speakers/field trips we went on to apply our knowledge to real life. I would not really change anything about the course it was great.",
                "The class is very content heavy so a solid biology background about the immune system is needed to fully understand the lectures. However, some gaps in knowledge were sometimes filled by pre-lectures about more simpler concepts of the lecture that was going to be discussed which was helpful.",
                "I enjoyed how discussions were structured and how we all had a chance to lead discussions. At times, I felt like lectures were very dense and we often had to speed through them during lecture."

The interdisciplinary nature of the course makes it very enjoyable and interesting to anyone who is curious to learn more, and Professor Kavathas is an amazing professor who genuinely cares about her students.",

                "Yes. This course offered a good introduction into immunology and the readings and lecture material were interesting and engaging.",
