                "strengths: Rakich was super flexible in terms of deadlines, workload, etc, which the whole class appreciated\r\nweaknesses: we didn't get our midterms back until reading period... :\/",
                "Strengths: Cool material. Interesting if explained well. TA was helpful. Professor took criticism well and does seem to care about the students.\r\nWeaknesses: Recorded lectures that were literally just reading and repeating what the book said; study hall with the professor was never helpful because he never seemed to know the answers to his own homework questions so could never help us and didn't know exactly how long it would take; not particularly responsive professor; Canvas was a bit of a mess meaning that we had to get all our information from Modules and there was neither a separate assignments tab nor a separate grades tab where we could easily go in and see things without having to scroll and search; Lectures were posted at weird hours and not by the time of the actual classes which messed up a lot of students schedules and often the professor would re-record the lecture or rewrite the notes and we would have to go back and re-watch everything.",
                "This was probably the worst class I have taken at Yale. To say this class frustrated me is a drastic understatement. There were no synchronous portions to this class; everything was recorded. Though Professor Rakich offered office hours once a week, these were fairly unhelpful and only lasted about 30-60 minutes. After the first few weeks, they were sparsely attended because we realized that there was no use in going to a short session when we had so much unclarity. The problem sets were nearly impossible. Professor Rakich prohibited the use of many resources, citing academic integrity, which I completely understand, but he did not offer us an alternative to help. Instead, we were left in the dark to struggle on our own. The lectures were hardly sufficient to answer all the questions on the homeworks, and the textbooks by no means filled in the gaps.",
                "The course was good overall: the lectures and book together did a good job of explaining concepts, as did the homework problems. But I wish there had been more discussion of what we were actually doingthe philosophy behind quantum mechanics.",
                "This course spent far too much time on Chapter 3, which highlights quantum formalism essential to further study.  I understand that knowledge of this notation and formalism is important, but it didnt seem directly connected to solving quantum mechanical problems.  It felt more like a detour into the quantum analogue of linear algebra and the principles of bra-ket notation.  It makes sense to cover these topics, as they form the foundation for analysis of other, more advanced problems in quantum mechanics.  But when the course never actually gets to those other, more advanced problems, I dont see the point in spending so much time establishing the formalism to solve them.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of this course was its incoherence between topics.  Throughout the semester, I felt that I was learning concepts, but didnt see how they all fit together in the larger picture.  The material was difficult, and that made it hard to focus on the implications of what I was learning.  Instead, I was just trying to wrap my head around the ideas and make it through the time-consuming problem sets. I think Prof. Rakich could have done a much better job of occasionally taking a step back and putting our knowledge and skills into perspective - relating them to other ideas or real-world applications, showing us how they link together or how they might arise in the real world, and making sure we understand why we are learning what were learning.  The course would have been much better had this concept of coherence between topics been more of an emphasis.",
                "recorded lectures did not come out at regular\/predictable times and it was really frustrating to try to keep up with the lectures; too much content was covered in recorded lectures and the notes were pre-written with the prof just talking over it, so you had to stop the video frequently to write things down and it took three times longer to get through lectures than it should have, a workload we would never have been expected to keep up with in person",
                "The asynchronous lectures were helpful but they were very disorganized and released on the wrong days constantly.",
                "I think the structure of the course, in terms of the use of the textbook following closely with lectures and psets, was good especially when I was sometimes left confused from the lectures in their format I could turn to the textbook and fill in some gaps.",
                "I think this class could have covered more material if we just didn't spend so much time on nitty gritty details of specific examples. I think covering things like symmetries and perturbation theory are more important and fundamental than all the nasty calculations for the hydrogen atom."

                "The lack of synchronous meetings was an extreme shortcoming. I was alone, trying to teach myself everything without any assistance. What a miserable way to learn. I will acknowledge that I did enjoy Professor Rakich's handwritten lecture notes as opposed to prewritten PowerPoint slides.",
                "I wish the lectures had been live, as opposed to recorded. But the teacher and TF did a good job of reaching out to students and making themselves available over zoom.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that could be improved would be the testing. How it worked was that we had a window of several days, and any time during that window you could start the test, and had to finish it within three hours, unproctored. Now, personally I liked that way of testing, and three hours was plenty of time. But it would have been so easy to cheat (whether to use banned resources, or to talk to people who had taken the test earlier). Being that I did not cheat, I felt that this disadvantaged me on the curve.",
                "I dont think this course suffered much from its virtual format.  I enjoyed the flexibility to watch lectures whenever I wanted and the ability to speed up and slow down the playback speed.  Lecture duration, however, often exceeded the amount of time we would spend in class under normal circumstances.  The instructor corrected this after it was pointed out to him, but things crept once more over that temporal threshold towards the end of the semester.",
                "the option for pre-recorded lectures gives professors too much freedom to give students more work than would be possible to assign during a normal in-person semester. this is unacceptable. teaching course content needs to be confined to assigned course meeting times. this particular course released new lecture content over the thanksgiving break. it is appalling and inhumane to drive students this hard without a proper break. professors need to respect breaks and they need to be held accountable for it. not being able to predict when new lecture content will be released makes it impossible to balance other scheduling needs and it adds more stress and frustration to an already difficult semester and workload.",
                "As mentioned before the asynchronous format works and was extremely helpful in being able to understand the complex concepts but the timing of the releases of the lectures were all over the place and there was constant confusion among all of the students.",
                "I think having lectures fully written out and just speaking over them for the recordings, instead of classic in-person physics lectures with the prof. writing on the board, led to really dense lectures that threw a lot of info and were long. They improved after student feedback and I know the course typically covers a lot of material, but it didn't seem well adjusted to the situation of the semester. I would've been a lot more engaged with live lectures where I could ask questions as they came to me even if we didn't get to all the material, rather than the lectures as they were which took more time than a normal class and felt like something I was more so just trying to get through, not something I was absorbing most of my learning in the class through."

                "In a virtual setting, absolutely not. I am embarrassed at myself for how little I learned, but in truth, it wasn't my fault. I was looking forward to quantum mechanics. This class did not bolster my understanding of physics, but rather, made me despise the discipline.",
                "Yes, I would recommend. It's not too difficult for quantum mechanics, and you get a good grasp on the ideas of it.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless you are required to take it.  It is definitely not the type of course to take as an elective because youre just curious about diving into quantum mechanics.  It is, essentially, a math course, and students must be rigorously prepared in linear algebra, differential equations, and general mathematical intuition.  I envisioned this course as one that would illuminate many of the fascinating principles of the quantum world, which governs a substantial portion of the technological innovation driving changes in our world today.  To that end, I was sorely disappointed.  Most of the work is quite theoretical and, as I said, math-intensive.  Perhaps my expectations were just nave and unrealistic for a first course in quantum mechanics, but I felt that we spent a lot of time on concepts that didnt quite live up to my mental impressions of them.  \r\n\r\nIn short, this was not a fun or light and casual course that would serve as an engaging elective.  It was time-consuming and, at times, dull.  The general field of quantum studies remains fascinating and I dont regret taking this course.  But it does not stand out in my mind as one that was 'hard but exhilarating' - its quality was not high enough to balance out its rigor and tedium.  As such, it would be appropriate for students singularly fascinated by quantum mechanics, who envision themselves using this course as a springboard for further study in particle physics or electrical engineering.",
