                "Reading Poe and Kafka together was something very few people outside of our class have done before. They have little in common, most likely never read each other's work, if they even knew the other existed. So starting there, the class fascinated me at the opportunity it provided. Literary comparison was something I was largely unfamiliar with, and definitely gained from this class. I had never really read any poe or any Kafka, so not only was the comparison new, but the material itself as well! Lastly, the writing assignments in this class were remarkably creative, forcing us to think about literature analysis in new, fun ways.",
                "I wasn't acquainted at all with the works of Poe and Kafka before this semester, so this class was a great opportunity to dive into their respective uvres.",
                "Developed knowledge of Poe and Kafka's works and criticisms of them, ability to have really intellectually high-level discussions about writing",
                "Short stories by Edgar Allen Poe and Franz Kafka. A little bit of literary theory, as well as Poe's and Kafka's philosophy of composition.",
                "This course featured a side by side reading and comparison of the works of Poe and Kafka. Each week, we read a work of each author and spent about half of class discussing each one (or one class\/week\/author). Later in the semester, we introduced philosophical and theoretical readings to supplement our discussions as well as literary criticism on the works we had read for the week. I think this may be the most intellectually stimulated I have been at Yale. Ever. The stories were of course great, but the level to which the professors knew and understood the material was astonishing. I feel like I had a new thought ever single class.",
                "This class introduced me to a new kind of philosophical reading of literature which I'd not had before in prior English courses. We also put the works\/authors in context of social anxieties of the time, such as early 19th century industrialization and a loss of spirituality (\"God is dead\"), and how Poe and Kafka's response to those cultural philosophies differed.",
                "I was able to learn how to talk about more abstract readings.",
                "I discovered new ways of approaching two authors I was already familiar with. I had never considered pairing the two before, but now the connection seems so natural."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course is the material--there is so much more to Poe and Kafka than there really is any right to be. The weakness of this course is how the material is conveyed--very little did we actually draw comparisons between the two, spending more of our time looking at individual texts and how they should be analyzed. I wanted more cross-author comparison, broken down by theme or subject matter, and got very little of it. Because of how good the material was, I got to do a lot of it on my own, but that's not the point of a 70,000 dollar education now, is it?",
                "Discussions in ENGL 257 were always fascinating, but there were times when they felt intentionally dense and hyper-philosophical to the point of being inaccessible or unproductive.",
                "Strengths: good combo of lecture and seminar, big class so the instructors talked the most and had super interesting things to say. Reading materials were well organized and thematic (there was a Halloween-themed week with creepy stories, I don't know if it was on purpose) and class was genuinely fun.\r\nWeaknesses: The criticisms we read towards the end of the semester were really dense and hard to discuss. Also, I wished we had gotten a primer on poe and Kafka's lives and the history surrounding them so we had more context.",
                "The co-teaching model by this class is a double sword. I was able to learn from two different professors and two literary traditions. I also saw how Prof. North's and Prof. Smith's ideas interacted. But sometimes the class ran more like a Podcast, and the profs chatted with each other more than with us. The professors did do a good job facilitating group discussions, though--these discussions allowed me to know my classmates and see different readings of the same texts. The assignments tended to be more creative and academic. They were really thought-provoking and fun to write, but if you want a course to improve your academic writing, maybe this course is not it. If you're a creative writer, though, the assignments should feel like a breeze.",
                "The biggest strength of the course was the teaching team. The professors knew not just the material but also the theory and philosophy to reach a level of conversation beyond any other English or humanities class I have ever taken. The way I know this is that they spoke about 70% of the time, at least in the beginning. This is a HUGE strength. We go to Yale to learn from the best of the best, not to hear 19 year olds flex about something they may or may not know from a fancy high school class they've taken. Also, the assignments were incredibly creative and experimental and actually engaged in work far beyond the classic response paper. AND, I never feared getting punished for taking a risk. They made it very clear that ideas and thought were praised far beyond polish. \r\n\r\nA weakness if I had to give one would be that sometimes there were inconsistencies in the syllabus. They are both SO chill, meaning that things would get changed and decided in class, submission portals would not be made, etc. but this is a very small grievance.",
                "Strengths: Fascinating course with engaging readings! I loved seeing the two professors bounce thoughts off each other and think out loud. Discussion questions were also very interesting.\r\n\r\nImprovement: Group discussions really helped people who struggle to participate usually and I wish there were more of them! There were so many different types of assignments which could be a strength but it is hard with each assignment to know what the professors expect.",
                "Weaknesses is that the class discussion felt very disorganized; I felt like I did not have much guidance on how to engage with philosophical discussion for the first time. I would have liked more guiding questions to help prepare me for unexpectedly connecting a work to the abstract question it supposedly engaged with. At least the written assignments were often unrelated to the more abstract\/philosophical side of discussion, so if I had a hard keeping up in discussion at least it was not held against me, but then again I wished I had had a chance to be forced to engage in that type of thinking to become more comfortable with it.\r\n\r\nStrengths is that it was pleasant to come to class with an open mind and see where discussion lead with little stakes. The professors were very kind, clearly great friends with each other, and it was fun to hear them talk to each other so comfortably about the work and draw from their respective expertise on the authors. I also appreciated how they would often respond to student points and rephrase them\/connect them to larger points, which made me feel appreciated and reassured that my sometimes desperate contributions had value. I wished I had gone to office hours more often because the one time I did was very helpful, but they were not super prompt in responding to email.",
                "this course was extremely difficult to follow and there was very little consistency overall. between anthropomorphic apes and \"knowledge procedures,\" it was incredibly hard to understand. the professors also regularly seemed more interested in discussing the topics with each other than with the students. however, both instructors were very understanding of individual circumstances.",
                "I loved that the class was taught by very kind professors who are passionate about the readings, and I also really liked the creative assignments. I only just wish we connected the two authors more."

                "Yes! If anyone wants to be anxious all year, think a lot about death, morals, murder, etc, definitely take this class! It's some really remarkable literature, and a really fun way of looking at literature, if you're willing to be up for the material at hand.",

                "Tentatively yes. Everyone should read Kafka. Maybe not so much for Poe. The course is a fun blend between analytical and creative reading\/writing. Wish that there could've been a list of guidance questions accompanied with the readings. The reading\/writing workload isn't too heavy. Take the course if you like courses co-taught by more than one Prof--again, co-teaching has both benefits and flaws.",
                "YES YES YES YES YES YES. If it were not with the same professors, I would not imagine the course to be nearly as successful, but with the same professors, it will make you think about EVERYTHING in life in a completely different way.",
                "Yes! Fascinating course with engaging readings! I loved seeing the two professors bounce thoughts off each other and think out loud. Discussion questions were also very interesting. The assignments were also very interesting!",
                "Yes, if you think you would enjoy reading Poe and Kafka, and if you don't mind abstract\/philosophical analysis and unstructured discussions! The assignments are fun and varied, one of which included designing a haunted house intended to recreate for a participant the same experience as reading a Poe or Kafka story.",
