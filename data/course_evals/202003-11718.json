                "The combination of textbook readings, video lectures, and virtual classes was somewhat redundant- we ended up going over the same material a lot when in reality the psets were the most valuable teaching tool. The pacing was reasonable and the exams were fair.",
                "The strengths of the course were the access to resources for help, and clear instructions regarding all homework and assignments.\r\nThe primary weakness was the lack of participation during class.",
                "The course was good in that it was a comprehensive and consistent sweep of multivariable calculus. However, the fact that the videos were recorded beforehand was not effective - it basically meant that we had to know what we were supposed to learn already before even coming into class.",
                "Strengths: PROFESSOR HALL & PEER TUTORS. Hall was the head professor for Math 120 in the fall and recorded all of the videos (+ accompanying notes). Super helpful, thorough, and punctual- he answers all your questions and you can go to his office hours even if you're not in his section. USE HIM AS A RESOURCE. Peer tutors are also great, really casual and friendly and can help you through tough problems.\r\nWeaknesses: each professor got to decide how to award participation grades but weren't super clear about their policies, so many of us didn't know how our participation would get graded until closer to the final. (It's only worth 5% of your grade but still annoying). I also didn't get a lot out of the reading quizzes, and I wish we were given more time for some of the longer videos (which often just repeated what was in the textbook).",
                "Strengths: a lot of students are also struggling so I don't feel shy when asking questions; helpful peer tutor\r\nWeakness: The concepts are hard, hence a lot of students struggled.",
                "Strengths: Effectively achieves what it sets out to do (teach the course material, but not much more...\r\nWeaknesses: Effectively, you cover each topic four times in this class (in the textbook, in the video, in class, and in the problem sets). Personally,  this felt quite redundant, but could be helpful for others. It also made the actual class component difficult to be engaged with, especially over Zoom."

I was enrolled remotely so it wasn't a problem for me, and hopefully it won't be too much of a problem this semester, but the timing of the third midterm and some of the assignments weren't supportive to students.",
