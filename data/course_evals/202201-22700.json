Improved my intuition around causality (and all the potential pitfalls with causal inference), which is so central to economics and its general value as a field. After seeing them in econometrics, furthered my understanding of popular research methods like difference-in-differences and instrumental variables and how they operate in real-life research. Designed a research setup and approach for the final paper."

                "I think the readings could have been chosen that were a bit more accessible. Some of the readings were a bit too difficult, which discouraged me from reading them.",
                "Strengths: Great routine for the course -- you read a research paper each week and learn how to read them better over the course of the semester by asking the right questions, paying attention to the important parts (research design, interpreting tables). A student presentation on the paper starts each class, and then Professor Salz dives into a deeper explanation for the rest; There was a lot of repetition, which some may see as a weakness but I thought the repetition really helped me learn. By the third or fourth time we saw an instrumental-variables design in a paper, I could really understand how it was operating and how to formulate my own for a potential research project; Professor Salz did a nice job explaining papers, answering questions about them, and highlighting their core design decisions -- it made me think he'd be a good teacher explaining concepts for a larger economics lecture. Weaknesses: Not much feedback on class work and assignments (when I check my final grade after writing this, that'll be the first grade I'm seeing for the course all semester); the actual topics for the papers were hit or miss -- I found some of the earlier weeks about the China shock, automation, and agglomeration interesting and didn't love the patents/intellectual property research we ended the semester with as much; Professor Salz did spend a class reviewing some econometrics but it was on Zoom because of how we started the semester due to Omicron variant and I felt myself wanting that review later on in the course as well. It came naturally when we talked about the papers throughout the semester, but as someone who finds econometrics really cool/useful but complex and confusing at the same time, I was always wanting basic reminders of core statistics/econometrics concepts. (I regret not seeking out office hours as much, so this is on me too.)"

                "Probably not",
                "Yes. I didn't love it at first, but it grew into an enjoyable, useful, reliable, no-surprises class over the course of the semester. I sort of went into it blind (had never been offered before, very bare syllabus) but it worked out. I maybe naively didn't foresee this when I chose the course, but I think it ended up becoming an applied econometrics seminar that didn't force you to do all the scary math and statistics -- Remember this concept you learned in econometrics? Here's how it's working in this published research. See? -- and I liked it for that. Not a life-changing course, but just solid. You need classes like that."
