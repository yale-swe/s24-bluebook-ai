    "Professor Zedillo has obviously had incredibly valuable experience (as the former president of Mexico and in his current global leadership positions) that have an immense impact on the course. Professor Zedillo's experiences and thoughts drove the class forward and provided unique insights that could only be gained by taking a course with such an accomplished professor.\r\nWhile overall a great course, there were a couple weaknesses. First, there is a lot of work. A lot, a lot. Dense, long readings, weekly reading responses, two presentations, a midterm, and a term paper. One recommendation might be to allow students one or two weeks to skip reading response to use when they have a particularly heavy week (especially around midterms). Moreover, I felt that I learned so much more in writing my paper than in studying for the in-class midterm. Maybe the midterm could be made a 5-8 page paper or something of the like. Finally, we did not receive much feedback on our writing and had to meet individually with the TF to get the feedback. We only got grades around the middle of the term. But this course is really great and if you are interested in the topic, it is well worth the work.",
    "Very few weaknesses. Perhaps, it would be slightly better if the Professor talked a bit more (rather than delegating 90% of the class to student-led presentations) and there was more discussion (the student presentations aren't very interactive and the seminar sometimes becomes a lecture). However, these are both minor points and, other than that, everything is great.",
    "Perhaps a little bit less presenting and a little bit more discussion with Professor Zedillo.",
    "The best part of this course is the readings  Professor Zedillo has put together a comprehensive syllabus that covers most of the major economic issues surrounding globalization. A persistent theme is that many of the problems we face in the 21st century are fundamentally failures of national policy.",
    "Strength: the readings and the topics are fascinating\r\n\r\nWeakness: the set-up of the course is such that a group of students lectures on the reading every week. As such, it becomes far more of a lecture on globalization than a debate of globalization. I found this exceedingly boring and a disappointment. Additionally, I don't think the reading responses are a good way to show actual learning or mastery of the material."

    "Very useful course, 100% recommended.",
    "Yes! Professor Zedillo is so highly accomplished and can impart unique insights on globalization, which just happens to be one of the most topical discussions today. However, understand that this course will take a lot of hours every week, so be prepared.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course to other students - it's exactly how a senior seminar should look like. Professor Zedillo is simply amazing and, contrary to what one would assume, extremely approachable and responsive. He has a great sense of humor and is not too strict, yet also not too lenient. The course is very well-structured and the readings well-selected.",
    "Yes, prestigious and good content.",
    "No. The set-up of the course is such that a group of students lectures on the reading every week. As such, it becomes far more of a lecture on globalization than a debate of globalization. I found this exceedingly boring and a disappointment. Additionally, I don't think the reading responses are a good way to show actual learning or mastery of the material. I think there are better, more engaging courses out there for you. Do not take this course."
