    "Gained knowledge of basic macroeconomics and current macroeconomic events.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures are very engaging and informative and the course is very well organized overall. I enjoyed discussing current events during class, but we probably could have spent a little less time on that portion and a bit more on the course material, especially given the intensive nature of the summer session. I also wish we couldve gotten more feedback on psets and the midterm, but I understand that its a very short turnaround time. Both the professor and TA are very responsive to questions, generally a pretty positive experience!",
    "Strengths- The course was very analytical in nature, and introduced students to the models behind economic events.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- The course required too much of an intuitive understanding of economics for students unfamiliar with the field.",
    "Could have spent less time talking about news and more time fleshing out the concepts, especially in the latter half of the course, when we started to learn about short-run macroeconomy and IS-MP, PC, and AS\/AD framework.",
    "Strengths \r\n- Professor's teaching style (informative yet easy to understand)\r\n- Ample opportunities to get your questions answered \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- Format of the online class creates some very busy days \r\n- Also in reference to the first bullet point, the pace of the online class really picks up after the midterm.",
    "Strengths: the professor was very engaging and knowledgeable; the course was structured in a way that facilitated the best understanding of cumulative concepts\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very content-heavy (we had to learn new content for the final two days before the final); it was difficult to keep up with the workload in the short amount of time between meetings each week",
    "I think this course is efficient and covers a number of topics in a short period of time. I would maybe make smaller, substantive quizzes that have questions similar to those that may be on the midterm and final. The two exams were the only time we encountered those types of questions.",
    "Strengths: Online lectures allow for repeated watching to ensure content is absorbed. Direct interaction with the professor was great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Problem sets were sometimes unhelpful. Online lectures can be very long before class. Online was less enganging.",
    "I thought the homework assignments and quizzes were effective in practicing the material. I thought the discussion sections were excellent. I also thought the recorded lectures were effective in both how they communicated information and the order in which the information was communicated. The greatest issues were when there was a large amount of lectures and\/or a large assignment to complete between the Tuesday and Thursday lecture, becuase the shorter time span made it more difficult to fully learn all the information effectively.",
    "Strengths are that it is organized and easy to complete the work on time, and it is also very interesting and relevant.\r\n\r\nIt could be improved in the in-class lectures. They were interesting and very engaging, but I think they could benefit from some more structure and a more organized review of the material learned outside of class.",
    "I found that often times the course material on the slides did not match up with the videos or vice versa this left significant gaps in my understanding of certain subjects and how they all linked together.",
    "Strengths: Office hours were very helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, class time wasn't very helpful, as we wouldn't cover \/ go over many concepts but rather spend time discussing current macroeconomic issues. This was engaging but not helpful for my learning and consolidation of new unfamiliar concepts."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Great course even if you dont need it for a major requirement. Im a humanities major thinking about an Econ double major and this class has definitely fueled my interest in the discipline. Its very rewarding to see how the course concepts directly help our understanding of the world.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if they are an Economics major or need the course to fulfill a major requirement. I would generally not recommend this course to anyone else because the concepts are very analytical for an introductory economics class, and don't really give one an intuitive sense of economic events.",
    "Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed learning macroeconomics and feel more confident in my understanding of concepts and terms that are often used by media and the news on the economy",
    "Sure.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Not only was the professor great, but the content learned can be applicable to many fields. The skills encouraged by the class also helps facilitate any type of learning.",
    "Yes  I think a general understanding of economics is important and this class is much more interesting than micro. Marnix is a great teacher and really positive about making sure resources are available.",
    "Yes, much more enjoyable than microeconomics and I really enjoyed learning about the history of banking\/ bank failures.",
    "Yes. I believe the structure was excellent, the material was communicated in such a way it leaves students engaged and connects to effects in the world as a whole, and the discussion sections provided a great situation in which to engage with the professor.",
    "Yes I would. I feel like I have a good basic understanding of macroeconomics now and that I am prepared for intermediate courses.",
    "Yes, it offers a good foundation for those who want to go into economics."
