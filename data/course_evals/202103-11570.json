                "This class helped me really develop my confidence in Spanish and was extremely well taught. I appreciated that the emphasis in this class was learning the language and speaking about topics that interest us and impact the world like climate change, capitalism, colonialism, and more.",
                "Spanish grammar, accents, history, writing, and communication of complex ideas",
                "I greatly improved my Spanish speaking, reading, and writing skills. I grew a lot in my confidence, especially in my speaking abilities.",
                "Better Spanish skills, greater appreciation for Spanish and Latin American culture.",
                "I learned how to discuss cultural and political topics in Spanish. The emphasis was on not exams, which left room for a wide variety of assignments, hence I learned Spanish through presentations, writing, cultural experiences, and class conversations. The wide variety of assignments meant that I learned more than just specific grammar and vocabulary, but also how to apply them.",
                "Professor Gonzalez-Parada created a welcome environment for students to learn Spanish. It felt safe and students were encouraged to participate and express their ideas without fear of making mistakes.",
                "During this course, I developed greater proficiency in the Spanish language and become more confident in my abilities to speak, read, write, listen, and analyze cultural works. I learned various different grammar tenses, including subjunctive, past, imperfect, future, and imperfect. However, because the emphasis was less on grammar and more on content, I was able to be exposed to a breadth of material without needing to focus exclusively on language structure. This made it much easier for me to engage with the language and learn more about the Spanish-speaking world.",

                "- integrating content with grammar so that we can learn how to apply the grammar in a real context. \r\n- emphasis on learning and being comfortable speaking, rather than being punitive for grammatical mistakes.",
                "Weaknesses would maybe be that asynchronous days are in the middle of the week (Mondays or Fridays would be better)\r\n\r\nEverything was a strength. There is nothing that I would change about this class nor my instructor!",
                "There was a lot of variation in what we did each day in this course which I really appreciated.",
                "Perhaps a greater emphasis on vocabulary development is required.",
                "One of the major strengths of the course was that it wasn't based on exams on specific textbook vocabulary and grammar. This meant that there was more breadth to understand the language through a cultural and political lens. It meant a lot more to learn through presenting on artwork, attend cultural experiences, watch a movie and write an essay about oppression and discrimination, and read a classical book in Spanish. The variety was very beneficial and well-explained and presented by Professor Gonzalez Parada. We learned all of the vocab and grammar that we needed to, but it was in the context of topics that were actually interesting and relevant, which made it significantly more engaging.",
                "Amazing course. Professor Gonzalez-Parada is very considerate and open to extending deadlines for assignments. Ample time is given to do projects. Days are given off throughout the semester where appropriate.",
                "There were many strengths of the course, including the focus on content instead of grammar, the use of a multitude of media sources (i.e. documentaries, movies, books), and the opportunities for student collaboration in the form of creative projects. Another primary strength was the structure of the class grading, as it resulted in students feeling less concerned about grades and more focused on immersing themselves in the Spanish language. I appreciated that no single assignment carried a large amount of weight and that students were able to highlight their strengths through a variety of different grading opportunities. Another strength was the low-stakes nature of the learning environment, as it resulted in me feeling more comfortable sharing out in front of my peers and professor.\r\n\r\nI believe that a weakness of this course was the changes to the syllabus structure \/ deadlines that happened as we were taking the course. I understand that this is a pilot course, however, and that this means that things will inevitably change around. These changes just caused a bit of confusion and stress among students as we had to modify our timelines for assignments. This was not too difficult, but just an obstacle we stumbled upon. Ultimately, I know that the administration and professors are doing their best to actively make changes to the course, and I appreciate this.",
                "The strengths are that I was always very engaged. The small class size catered to this and the style of the content did.",
                "Very good curriculum."

                "I thought I would be saying to only take SPAN 130 if you have to fulfill the language requirement, but I actually really recommend this course, especially if you can take it with Professor Gonzalez Parada. Unlike the previous two Spanish courses, this class was much less based on grammar and vocabulary. Instead, we discussed actual topics, culture, and politics, which meant that the course was based in reality and we were learning to converse about important things. I really enjoyed it, so I would recommend it. Professor Gonzalez Parada is supportive and wonderful.",
                "I would definitely recommend. Professor Gonzalez-Parada is extremely nice and wants her students to learn. So long as you do your work and make an effort to succeed, you will do well in this class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students looking to become more proficient in Spanish. This course provides a stress-free and encouraging learning environment (especially with Professor Ximena-Parada), where you can freely practice your skills without feeling criticized. Your peers and professor are happy to hear from you and it is truly nice to be able to not only learn grammar, but to engage in lively discussions with your peers where you can voice your opinions and learn more about the world around you. You not only learn more about the Spanish language, but become more culturally aware (which I think is one of the biggest takeaways from this course).",
                "Yes. If you need a language requirement or want to improve your spanish.",
                "Yes, this course facilitates very close relationships between classmates and the professor. Not too difficult, and many of the assignments are fun."
