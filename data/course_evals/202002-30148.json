   "comments": [
    "I didn't learn anything.",
    "I learned the history of electronic music, the fundamentals of how songs are constructed... and most importantly how to create a song using very intricate software. I have a new skill that will become a hobby I do for the rest of my life!",
    "An understanding of Ableton Live, basic music theory, and the history of EDM.",
    "I have learned a lot of the theory behind the production of EDM and the use of different plugins to transform sound in different ways.",
    "Overall, I think this class was as good as it could have been using an online model. I think the lectures were informative and the homework, midterm, and final assignments were fair; however, I cant help but to think that if we were in person, a lot more could have been done, thats no ones fault though.",
    "This course contextualized my love for electronic music in its history and gave insights into the intertwining of technological evolution and stylistic developments in modern music. This course also covers some basics in music theory and the production of music on the digital audio workstation Ableton.",
    "How to analyze and write electronic dance music",
    "This course was incredibly enjoyable!\r\nMy biggest takeaway was definitely proficiency in Ableton Live and how to leverage its features to make professional-quality music.\r\nWhile EDM production may not be something I will ultimately use in my career, it is an incredibly fun and unique skill. \r\nI'm really glad I took the course!",
    "I learned a lot about the history and evolution of electronic dance music throughout the centuries and in various different regions around the world. I enhanced my knowledge of music techniques and strategies.",
    "I learnt about the fundamentals of music production, particularly as relevant to electronic music, I learnt how to use the DAW Ableton, and learnt about the history of EDM. This has helped me understand the music I listen to and its production and history better, and has enabled me as a musician to be much more comfortable producing my own music.",
    "Learned about electronic music history and theory.",
    "I learned about the fundamentals of EDM, the basics of music notation and how to work with MIDI software.",
    "This course was a wonderful introduction to electronic dance music",
    "I learned some basics of music theory; the histories of electronic music, the instruments used to compose it, and those who pioneered the style; and developed aural skills and electronic music composition skills in Ableton Live.",
    "I learned the history of electronic music and its instruments, as well as basic music theory, and practice rhythm and chord applications to harmonizing with music or creating it myself. I also learned how to use Ableton."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is a gut.",
    "Strengths were all of the information I learned about the history of technology used in making this kind of music. As well as the structure and techniques of how songs are built.\r\nBiggest weakness I would say is that a lot of this software would be best learned by using it. It would have been helpful to have interactive sessions where we not only learned intellectually how each tool in the software worked, but how to use it personally.",
    "My favorite parts of the course were hands-on exploration of Ableton Live. I actually would've preferred if the course did not include the 'history of EDM' section, and was instead entirely focused on creating music and analyzing current songs.",
    "I think offering this class with more than one DAW would be EXTREMELY beneficial as not everyone uses Ableton live to produce.",
    "Super interesting content, with some nice opportunities to actually use Ableton and make music\r\n\r\nWished that the Zoom lectures were different from the video lectures. They were really just a repeat, so felt unnecessary to do both",
    "Strengths: I think Dr. A did an amazing job at blending the fundamental skills for content creation with teaching the history of the genre. It was an enjoyable and meaningful course format. \r\nWeaknesses: It felt like sometimes the lectures would repeat information heard in pre-class videos.",
    "Each class during the week was a good combination of getting lecture material information and interactive exercises that kept everyone involved.",
    "This course goes over everything. Seriously. EDM music history, Ableton, reading notes, major\/minor chord progressions, synths, etc, etc. It will probably be more difficult for students who have no music background. If I hadn't known how to play piano and drums\/read music, I would've probably struggled in this class. It's pretty fast-paced, but Dr. A and the TAs were always very nice and happy to answer any questions. The lectures were a bit dry, but the material was interesting.",
    "I thought this course was thoroughly enjoyable and well taught. Some of the strengths I think were the portfolio assignments and the final project, which really gave us an opportunity to drive home our learning. I also thought the quality of the video lectures was excellent. I would be entirely satisfied if this course remained as is.",
    "Homeworks, midterms, projects, were strengths. Weakness was some of the video structure.",
    "Strengths: fun class, not too challenging, and lots of resources to be successful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures spent too much time on history and not enough on music theory",
    "Overall, this is an extremely great class. I would've liked a little more instruction on using Ableton Live software, though.",
    "*Strengths:* Dr. A is a wonderful professor! Its clear shes an expert on electronic music composition techniques, as well as the breadth of history behind it. The TAs were also great and helpful! Everything was clearly explained, and the course itself was structured very logically. I also appreciated the options and freedom we were given for the final project  to choose between reharmonization, analysis of a favorite tune, or making an original composition in Ableton. Also, overall the class was very transparently and fairly graded with clear feedback, and there were bonus-point opportunities as well. Dr. A made herself available after class for additional questions and scheduled TA office hours at convenient times. They were also easily reachable by email. \r\n\r\n*Weaknesses:* I wish that for the lecture portion we spent more time either going over more music theory, or spending more time doing examples in Ableton. A substantial amount of the course was dedicated to the history of electronic music, which is important, but we really got into the weeds in terms of the successive iterations of synthesizers developed 1970-90. Given the rapid pace of the summer session courses, I really wish we had more time to work on developing skills like working with Ableton and music theory which we can take with us afterward, as opposed to developments of synthesizers that I will likely soon forget. Also, it felt like there was a substantial amount of redundancy across the course materials: lecture slides were posted, then there were the pre-recorded lectures reading directly off the slides, then a substantial amount of the live zoom lecture was dedicated to reading through the slides as well. I feel like the slides and pre-recorded lectures were enough, and students should be accountable for that material before coming to class, with the live lectures exploring the material from another angle. When dealing with Ableton, I think the live lectures could have spent a bit less time pointing out and explaining what each control does (since that was covered *extensively* in the slides which were basically comprehensive Ableton documentation), and using the time instead for things that are best done with a teachers live guidance  like composing in Ableton or developing aural skills. Dont get me wrong; these were covered as well, but a lot of the time during lecture was used for things that could be learned equally well outside of class. I wish more of the work had us use Ableton. We only really used it twice, for the midterm and for the final. Its clear this would be more time consuming to grade, but it would be to the benefit of the class.",
    "The course was laid out in a very organized manner with clear notes. The only issue was as an online course, technology could sometimes go wrong and connection would be lost."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you need a HU credit.",
    "Yes. Even if you don't have any musical knowledge at all before this course, by the end you will be able to build an EDM song. The skills I acquired in this course are something I am proud of, and something I will continue to build upon.",
    "Yes !! Super fun course, interesting topic, well set up for online learning.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you're interested in the art of music production because it's a great starting point to learn the basics of producing.",
    "Yes, especially if you already enjoy any genre of EDM and desire a more whole understanding of the historical and technological context of the music you listen to.",
    "Yes. Especially if you have some music background and want to learn how to write electronic dance music.",
    "Absolutely would recommend!\r\nI didn't find it to be too time consuming or challenging relative to other Yale courses, but this course was incredibly valuable nonetheless. It teaches a skill that is fun and accessible for a wide variety of students, from music majors to those who have never before taken a class in music.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in music, especially dance music. I definitely learned some things I never even considered and broadened my musical knowledge.",
    "Would definitely recommend to any student interested in music or sound design, and particularly to anyone looking to get an intro to Ableton or DAW use. This was definitely more helpful and productive than trying to learn those things independently.",
    "Absolutely. Whether you're familiar with music theory or know nothing at all, there is a lot to learn about both EDM instrument history and DAW programs like Ableton.",
    "I would, great way to learn about music theory and history",
    "Yes; it is a very fun course to take, especially if you enjoy EDM. You learn a lot about music theory if you have no prior experience.",
    "Absolutely! You learn a lot and it's tons of fun",
    "Overall, I would recommend this course to another student. It was a relatively low-work, laid back course. Dr. A is great! A fun way to get a humanities credit over the summer, and learn some music composition software and music theory if youre at all interested in that sort of thing.",
    "Yes - this course is a great basic introductory for those interested in making their own electronic music or learning to appreciate how it's made."
