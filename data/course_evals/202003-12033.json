                "Strengths: reading were informative and interesting, syllabus was well planned, discussions were engaging \r\nWeaknesses: discussions could sometimes get a little quiet and then other times were would be a line of several students waiting to speak, but this was definitely a result of zoom where it is tough to get a naturally flowing conversation.",
                "Great overview of how natural resource policy connects to overarching political structures. Could have explored nuance a bit more closely (e.g. why would one policy not *necessarily* have been indicative of some larger trend or vice versa). Also readings during weeks 4-6 seemed a bit repetitive",
                "Strengths: Fantastic class and lively discussion. The work was interesting and engaging. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes lacked structure or background info on the issues we discussed."
