Specifically, I learned how to write about dance, but in a broader sense, I learned how to fuse vivid description with clear and original argument. This is much harder than it sounds, and I feel that the structure of the course assignments gave me the chance to spend ample time focusing on honing this skill. We wrote five short exercises describing single dances or comparing two dances, chose one of the exercises to revise, and wrote a final essay that gave us the chance for greater development of the skills we'd started to learn from the shorter assignments. Additionally, I learned how to describe dance verballywe would watch clips for homework along with our readings and discuss our reactions to them in class. Being specific about what you respond to in a creative work, rather than just discussing it in broad strokes, takes practice, and it's a skill I believe I'll be able to apply to all of my courses."

Talking about what worked in other people's assignments and what could be improved was extremely helpful for my own writing, I found.\r\n-the readings and videos assigned were always INCREDIBLY engaging! although the readings and videos together took a fair amount of time to complete, i always looked forward to doing my homework for this class.\r\n-the guest lectures!! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-I can't think of much, but I did sometimes feel that the structure of the seminars could be switched up a little to keep things interesting. The watch dance clips, discuss dance clips routine was frequently repeated, and occasionally (but not usually, because the material was so interesting!) got tedious."

If you are at all interested in dance, understanding how historical styles inform modern styles, thinking about how American dance reflects and\/or deviates from American ideology at various points throughout history, and\/or becoming a better writer, this course will fascinate you! Do keep in mind, though, that the writing component is significant--the course is as much about learning how to meaningfully describe dance as it is about dance history."
