I love how it bounces from topic to topic because the student is bound to find one which they love. Mine, for example, was the nuclear bomb lecture.\r\nWeaknesses: the three hour lectures are tough, but that is what i signed up for.",

In addition, the course's content is extremely interesting. I could not recommend the class more highly.",
