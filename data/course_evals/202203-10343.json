                "Strengths: content and slide decks were organized very clearly. Sigga is a very engaging lecturer and often couples content/terms with her own professional experience. She also did a great job relating the course content to everything that happened during COVID. Sigga's also very responsive to students and gave timely feedback. Weakness: a minor one, but sometimes financial jargon might be a little difficult to understand for people with less knowledge of the banking system, so I would've appreciated a little more explanation of foundational terms. But overall great course!",

This is a great overview of the banking system and financial crises (even more relevant after the pandemic), and Sigga is a super engaging, responsive instructor who brings in tons of industry knowledge. The workload is very manageable (mostly just a presentation and a final paper), and the readings were manageable and well-selected.
