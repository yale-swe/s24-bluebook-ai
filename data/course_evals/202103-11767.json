                "Improved my writing skills beyond the scope of basic academic writing (ie. learned to write for an audience beyond academia).",
                "Wrote new genres of essays (portraying a person, cultural criticism, humor, etc), and learned new writing techniques to engage the reader. Essentially, mainly learned about new machines for reading. Also was introduced to works of authors and writers I've never read before.",
                "I learned how to write different types of essays and consumed a variety of interesting works.",
                "I developed my writing skills considerably (personal experience, place, portfolio, cultural criticism) and got the chance to read a lot of great essays.",
                "I really improved my writing by writing in a genre that I never have before.",
                "This was my first writing course at Yale, and it's a great introduction to what's expected of students in that regard. Mostly, the class honed my journalistic skills. Not only could I describe a multifaceted issue in writing, I could also figure out what issues were and were not worth talking about.",
                "I learned how to write about my own personal experiences which was cool because that is not something I had ever done before. I also got to learn a lot about my classmates and their own personal experiences.",
                "I think the most valuable skill I developed was discerning the good and the bad within my own writing.",

                "The course gave great examples of essays we were supposed to write and the discussions on them were really insightful.",
                "Definitely one of those classes that you get out of it what you put into it. A really good basic writing course, especially if you vibe with the professor (Sexton is awesome!)",
                "The course was well organized with well selected material; I enjoyed most every reading! Throughout the course, we also read chapters of On Writing Well and I do think having dedicated a little class time to talking about these chapters (in class we only discussed assigned articles, essays, etc.) would have been beneficial in improving writing more generally.",
                "Strengths: expectations and pace of the class were balanced. Readings and amount of work was also a great balance.",
                "Strengths: prof is very approachable, helpful, and encouraging, we read many interesting pieces, and reading classmates' work was nice. Weaknesses: feedback on drafts was often very slow and impeded my ability to do much before the final due date.",
                "This course's strengths are how well thought-out it is and the seminar format. We read such a wonderful variety of essays styles and topics and write quite a few essays, which definitely helps build skills. The seminar format is amazing, and I loved workshops where I got to get insight into the writing styles of each of my classmates. I also really appreciated that first drafts were never graded - which allowed me to take risks and try out new writing styles. One way this course could be improved is if we had more one-on-one interaction with the professor, and if we received more timely feedback.",
                "One weakness was the essays we read; they often felt like random New Yorker articles, and I would have preferred to read some by the authors advertised in the course explanation, like Joan Didion and James Baldwin.",
                "The essays are varied, which means I learned how to write in many different styles on many different topics, with plenty of good examples from the readings. The only suggestion I would have is that more writing exercises might help with analyzing some of the readings, but group discussion has also worked well.",
                "I think this class was interesting when a topic would first be introduced but it just ended up getting repetitive because we would talk about the same things and kinds of pieces and the class was just almost always the same format of talking about two or three short readings which got old fast. I think this class could benefit from switching up the structure every once and awhile to keep the class engaged."

                "Definitely! It's a unique class and teaches a style of essay writing that you won't find in typical academic classes. English major or no, it is an enjoyable course and one should certainly take it if they can.",
                "Yes, I cannot recommend this course enough to people looking to complete a writing requirement or a general english class.",
                "Yes, it greatly improved my writing skills which are applicable to many future courses and disciplines.",
                "Yes!! I think you learn so much and really build up your writing skills in this course. It's a good course to just practice writing and have fun with it.",
                "I would recommend it. It wasn't very hard because the essays were short and creative, and the readings were short. Though I didn't always love the readings, I did learn some valuable things from some of the essays and I feel like I improved my writing a lot. I loved the workshops and got really great feedback from my professor.",
                "Absolutely, especially as their first writing credit. It's a great introduction to what's expected of Yale students. The essays feel manageable, though the class really takes some self-reflection--I'd be prepared to write about your own experiences, as that's a major part of the course. If you can take the class with Professor Sexton, you really should.",
                "I would recommend this class because you learn a new style of writing and is a good way to get a writing credit out of the way just be prepared to for all the class periods to feel very similar.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to students who want to grow as writers, readers, and editors.",
                "I would recommend this course to students interested in writing more narrative-driven nonfiction essays rather than research-heavy essays. This class is great for anyone wanting to work with nonfiction while still being able to develop their creativity and express/explore personal ideas."
