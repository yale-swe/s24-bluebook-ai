                "I thought the class was very well-taught; lectures were at just the right speed, and I was able to follow quite well. However, there were no posted lecture notes and classes weren't recorded, so missing a lecture can be really difficult to recover from. Posting lecture notes would have been really helpful. Additionally, there was only one problem set after the second midterm, no practice problems posted before the final, and no office hours to ask for any, so for a good portion of the content on the final, it was the first time we had ever attempted a problem on that topic. I would have appreciated practice problems on these later topics.",
                "Strengths: creative exams, problem sets that helped learn material\r\nWeaknesses: not recorded",
                "I think we covered a lot of contents and they are well communicated. However, it would be nice if there are materials that help us learn the things we didn't quite catch in class. We only have pset posted on canvas, no notes, recorded lectures, pset\/exam solutions or anything. We went into the final exam with no practice materials on half of the topics. The exams are also a lot harder than the psets, since it tests a lot of theories and have those mega-problems that really pushes you to synthesize everything you learned. It's nice and helpful for learning, but not under the time pressure.",
                "The lectures were always very engaging, and the psets were quite reasonable. I thought the exams were also fair, with somewhat tricky final problems. More practice with the concepts we covered in the last couple weeks of class- series solutions at regular singular points and linear systems of ODEs- would have been helpful. It felt a bit unfair that the final exam asked about these late-semester topics that we had never practiced on a pset.",
                "Good teacher, taught following the book and psets\/tests were very fair. A huge method of improvement would be the availability of resources online\/in person. Need a TA. Would be good to record lecture\/post lecture notes and tell class which chapters explicitly will be covered on the test. Would be good also to post practice exams\/solutions and keep the canvas up-to-date.",

                "Overall, MATH 246 was decent and I would recommend it if needed for major or prereq but temper your expectations with the fact that its hard for differential equations as a topic to be super exciting. The textbook was used as the primary resource and Abi pretty much taught straight out of it. Lectures were not recorded. The workload was moderate, about a 3.5 out of 5 in terms of difficulty and time commitment. The teaching style was decent, but perhaps a bit dry and not as engaging as some other classes I have taken. The problem sets were a mix of useful exercises that helped to solidify the concepts covered in class and some busy work where we would need to do multiple problems per technique. We had 8 problem sets, roughly one every week and a half, with the later ones taking between 7-10 hours each. Prof. Abi is a legit math guy and knows his stuff. The exams were creative and tested problem-solving skills. The exams were designed to see how well students could apply concepts learned in class to new and unique situations. This means you could not get by with just memorization and plug-and-chug. We had 2 midterms and 1 exam. Prof. Abi said he tries to have half the class get A- or A.",
                "I may be biased, because I was taking this class as a easy gut due to its low courseload rating. But this class taken with Abi is not an easy class! This ended up being my most stressful class. However, he pushes you to really understand the material, and we covered much more contents than when other professors have taught it. Take it with Abi if you are really interested.",
                "Absolutely, especially if it is taught again by Abi. ODEs are a fun, fairly straightforward topic within higher-level math.",

                "only if necessary for major (math, engineering). Otherwise, unnecessarily difficult and theoretical.",
                "If you have to take differential equations, I would say take it with Abi. This course was certainly hard, but I found it very interesting and it made me actually want to undertake the relatively arduous task of differential equations. Most of the psets, with the exception of one or two, were fairly reasonable.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes I most absolutely would! It has the perfect balance of proofs and application-based material to keep the engagement of the course very high.",
