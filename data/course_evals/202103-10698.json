The best way I can summarize is this: you will develop a better understanding of the world and how it works, and learn to think critically about the things going on around you in a sociopolitical sense. Because of that, you learn how what you do can help, and also hurt, society",
                "This course provides a fantastic overview of the history of fascism and the role it plays in modern politics. I learned so much about the symptoms and dangers of far right-wing movements, both past and present. This was one of my favorite courses I've ever taken at Yale.",
                "I gained a larger understanding of 1930s europe and the threat of fascism then and today. I felt like I had a better grasp on literature and theory for the themes of the course",
                "I learned much about the origins of fascism in Europe in the 1930's and the historical parallels between the interwar period and the current day.",

                "Strengths: Very interesting content and captivating readings. The discussion at the end of each class was captivating and very well run.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A very large amount of time was spent on discussing current events and other topics that didn't fully relate to the course. At the same time, very little time was devoted to allowing students to give a summary of the readings (which often was one of the more interesting parts of the course), and on lecturing on the material at hand.",
                "This course generated great discussion and insightful comments from fellow classmates. We received strong, clear feedback on how to improve our writing. While it was a challenging course, both in assignments and subject matter, the professor pushed us in an effective way.",
                "Strengths: first of all, Prof. Young. She is incredible, and one of the best professors I have had at Yale. She makes the course what it is. The reading is fascinating and relevant, the discussions are always illuminating, and Prof. Young gives amazing feedback on papers as well as the option to rewrite, so there really is a focus on making you better as a human and as a student\r\nWeaknesses: I can't really think of any. I enjoyed every moment of this course and I was sad to come to the end of the semester because of that",
                "This course has very few weaknesses. In terms of strengths: the reading list is curated to near perfection, and I found almost every reading to be incredibly interesting; class discussions are always engaging, thoughtful, and prevalent to the modern era; Dr. Young gives very detailed feedback on essays and is always willing to meet with students to talk about their work and how it can be improved.\r\n\r\nThe only potential weakness is that class discussions occasionally derailed to topics that aren't as prevalent to the course, but sometimes these instances led to very interesting conversations.",
                "The course is very well-organized and Dr. Young always leads very interesting discussions. I like how the first part of each class is dedicated to current affairs.",
                "Dr. Young clearly cares a lot about these topics and prepares thoroughly for each course. She also carefully selects students who participate often and are engaged in the class, making the seminar engaging. Moreover, Dr. Young is extremely attentive when it comes to writing. Her feedback is detailed and carefully thought out. I have definitely become a better writer as a result of this class. \r\n\r\nHowever, a large portion of the class is dedicated to presentations/lectures of some sort. We often only have the last 20 minutes to discuss the actual topic for the seminar that day, so I felt that I had a more shallow understanding of topics I was less familiar with because we really did not dive into the material. The student presentations went on for too long, and the current events section can sometimes take up to half of the class. Better pacing would allow for more class discussion dedicated to the topics on the syllabus.",
                "Dr. Young is without question the best part of this course. She is incredibly passionate, knowledgeable, and is overall a great professor. The material is very interesting. I cannot think of any weaknesses!"

                "Yes I would! Dr. Young is a very thoughtful and engaging instructor. Although sometimes the course material could be overwhelming and rather saddening to grapple with, it was a necessary course that emphasized the urgency of these issues.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Take anything you can with Prof. Young, she is a treasure, and you will learn so much from her. She is an invaluable resource and teacher. The things you learn in this course are so relevant and applicable, and it gives you a better understanding of the U.S., and also the world. Just be aware that there is a lot of reading, and it contextualizes your class discussions, so it's important to have actually done it.",
                "Yes. If you are interested in the roots of fascism and how it affects modern politics, this course is the best of the best. Dr. Young is an expert at her craft and creates a thoughtful environment for discussion and debate. She also provides very detailed feedback on all assignments and is always willing to meet with students during office hours or at other times if you can't make office hours. Any student would be incredibly lucky to have the opportunity to take her course.",
                "Yes! Dr. Young cares deeply about her students and is a delight to learn from",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in the history of the 1930's and who wants to better understand the issues of our time.",
                "Yes. The topics we discuss in class are extremely relevant today. Dr. Young does a great job of carefully tying in various readings that allow us to reflect on the harsh realities of today while also learning about the historical application of fascism.",
                "Yes, I would most definitely recommend this course to another students. Dr. Young is incredible, and she truly cares about each and every student. She cares about our academic journey, and she really focuses on our writing skills and works with us closely to make us each a stronger writer. The readings and the course topics are very engaging."
