                "There is so much going on in New Haven alone that I never realized before taking this class. I think this course has to cover such a wide variety of topics and does such a great job of giving insight into each to allow students to further explore certain ones if they'd like. You definitely learn a ton about ocean sciences, marine biology, and the current challenges coastal environments face. Plus, you get to see and participate in some really cool research!",
                "I've definitely gained a lot of knowledge about the coast, especially the coast of Connecticut, both from a scientific and political perspective! I also think I've learned a lot about writing lab reports / research proposals, so that has definitely been a very useful skill I've gained, and I feel much better prepared to undertake my thesis work!",
                "This course was invaluable in developing field techniques, data analyzing skills, research proposal writing skills, and lab writing skills. We learned so much about the New Haven area and it's coastal environments.",
                "I learned a lot about the Long Island Sound! And the complex water systems, organisms, and pollutants that interact in this area.",
                "This was my first field based class and helped learn about the tools and techniques for studying coastal areas. The assignments also helped with rudimentary data analysis and field work proposals, both of which I really appreciated. Also this class gave me such a better appreciation for the Long Island sound and the environments around New Haven.",
                "I learned a lot about coastal ecosystems and environments, field work and methods of marine research, and contemporary environmental issues as they relate to the coastlines. I also developed a greater sense of connection to the New Haven area thanks to our visits to many nearby surrounding sites.",
                "I developed an expanded understanding of the impact of coastlines on the future of humanity, and on the impact that humans have on the same coaslines. In understanding this relationship I also developed an appreciation for how unique the coastal environment is.",
                "This course allowed me to gain more experience in fieldwork and working in a lab as well as completing lab reports, papers and a presentation."

            "comments": [
                "The highlights of this course were definitely the field trips, they were so fun and interesting and made the class a joy to go to. You get a lot of hands on experience and get to see what you're learning about in real time. Professor Decker is a great instructor and it's very cool getting exposed to her research and learning some research techniques. The one weakness I would say is that things got a bit stacked at the end of the semester, I think putting one of the lab reports earlier in the semester could have spread out the workload away from the busy end of the year.",
                "I think the strengths are definitely what we do during class time -- the field trips and activities we took part in really helped me stay engaged and I think I internalized a lot of our lessons the best through these experiences! In terms of assignments, I really enjoyed the readings and liked the structure of the reading responses. For the big assignments we had due, I did think it was sort of stressful that they were all concentrated at the end of the year. I think this makes it difficult to determine how you're doing in the class because you don't get grades until the last few weeks of class, and it's just stressful because it's the busiest time of year! If there were a way to move up the p-set, or maybe the mercury lab so it's not due during finals, I think that that would make a huge difference!",
                "This course was absolutely amazing. The weekly field trips during the first couple of months of fall were such great learning experiences and gave us the chance to learn through hands-on experience. It was also fantastic getting to process and run our own samples. For those that haven't gotten the chance to work in research labs yet, it was invaluable. One way that I would improve the course is the grading/assignment structure. The first part of the semester is pretty light as we only did 2 brief reading responses a week. Then at the end of the semester, it did somewhat feel like we were swamped with all of the heavily weighted assignments. It was definitely nerve-wracking only having one to two assignments in the grade book before reading period started, as none of us had really any idea of how we would do and didn't know fully how to improve on future assignments based on past assignments.",
                "The field trips were amazing. There is nothing quite like going outside to observe the environments that you're reading about in a textbook. We went to so many incredible places that are SO close to campus and I didn't even know about! We did hands-on science basically every week, which is also incredibly unique! Also Professor Decker is awesome - very knowledgeable and great at driving a bus full of students. The main weakness of this course is that it is quite back-loaded. We had three major assignments all in the last two weeks, which was a little frustrating just because we didn't really have any assignments for the entire first half of the course. I would've appreciated the assignments to be more spread out.",
                "The field trips were far and away the best part about this class. Being able to learn about coastal environments while visiting these ecosystems was such a great opportunity. The early morning starts were really difficult but definitely worth it. However, since all the field trips took place in the early fall, all the assignments for the semester were concentrated in the last few weeks of the class. Distributing this workload across the semester would have been much more appreciated. I think the mercury lab could be moved to be a mid-semester assignment rather than having it due during finals when we were also working on our research proposal.",
                "I loved the hands-on, outdoorsy nature of this class. Our field trip to Horse Island was one of my top highlights of the entire semester. Even though this class involved some early Friday mornings, it was so worth it to get to go on cool field trips all the time. Because of the active nature of this class, I got to know my classmates more than the typical Yale class, and I feel like I developed some new friendships and the whole class got fairly tight--very rewarding!   \r\n\r\nOne aspect of the class that was less ideal was how the workload was heavily stacked towards the very end of the semester. I kind of get why it ended up this way, as the semester culminated in the mercury lab and the final research project, but still... it could have been better distributed. I felt like the global temperatures problem set could have been moved earlier in the semester, or simply eliminated. It was also a bit weird how we went into the credit-d deadline with almost nothing graded.   \r\n\r\nThis class focused heavily on how research methods could be applied to a project like a senior thesis, which was a cool lens through which to study coastal ecosystems, but was a little weird given how a significant proportion of the class was seniors who were already in the middle of thesis and not thinking ahead towards future thesis topics. I felt like the thesis-prep theme would have been super helpful as an underclassman (and I wish I'd gotten the chance to take this  class earlier), but maybe if the class is senior-heavy in the future you could focus it on research projects more broadly, not specifically thesis projects.",
                "The course was very successful at combining field trips with the learned material. I felt like the time outdoors and in the classroom complimented each other. Most of the classwork was skewed towards the end of the semester which was a little difficult, especially when deciding whether to credit/D the course.",
                "I really enjoyed the field trips during this course. They were amazing experiences that I haven't been close to finding in other classes. The one challenge of this class was that the assignments that determine your grade are all very late in the semester so I did not feel confident in knowing how I was doing."

                "Yes I would highly recommend this course. It has been one of my favorites, and getting to go on field trips was always nice. Plus it's super interesting and you learn about a lot of current issues.",
                "Yes I definitely would! I feel like this class provides you with such creative ways to learn, and especially if you're worried about writing a proposal for you thesis, this class gives you a great background in proposal writing!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if you are interested in marine science or fieldwork. While it only meets once a week, and the hours can be a bit long especially early on in the semester when you are commuting to a field trip or going out onto the water, the time flies and it really doesn't feel like four or five hours of class in a row. If you have trouble getting up early though, this class is not for you. Start time is sometimes pushed earlier by one or two hours depending on the location of the field trip. I seriously loved this course, and the small number of people in the class really gave everyone a chance to get to know one another and learn from each other. I thought that the field and lab techniques that we learned through our field trips were so valuable and I am very grateful for the experience that I have gained through this class.",
                "Most definitely. It's a really refreshing class, especially when you've been sitting inside with masks on in lecture halls all week. You learn by doing and seeing rather than just reading and copying. Even though sometimes we had to be up at 7am on a friday, Professor Decker made up for it by letting us out early on days when we didn't have a field trip. You will definitely learn a lot about *doing* field work and coastal environments from taking this class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course for any student who wants to learn more about the land and waters around them. The field trips showed me just how amazing and beautiful the Connecticut coast could be! I would also recommend this course to anyone looking for an introduction to fieldwork - it was really interesting to see how coastal science is conducted.",
                "This is a phenomenal class--I would strongly recommend it to EVST students and beyond who are interested in marine systems, conservation issues, and climate. I feel grateful to have gotten the chance to explore so many coastal areas in this class. The field trips were awesome and helped me appreciate New Haven as a coastal city and feel more connected to our surrounding natural environment.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in human interaction with coastal environments. A preexisting interest is required, however, otherwise the course won't be very engaging.",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed the field trip experiences which created a great learning environment in contrast to my other in-classroom courses."
