    "Classes consisted mostly of reading the poems and talking about them; we never got super into each poem, mostly talking about impressions before moving on. The form (and homework) of the class is generally pretty free-flowing and loose; even the essays (for undergraduate students) were simply thinkpieces.\r\n\r\nI struggled primarily with the historical background of the course, because while we covered 500 years of Chinese poetry, we didnt necessarily talk about the historical context in detail."

    "Yes! Professor Chang is such an incredible person and if you're someone studying Chinese and interested in classical literature, she is definitely someone to take a course with. Her lectures are always interesting and filled with so many stories. The course really helped me learn to read poetry in its social and historical context, and that helped me get more layers of meaning from the texts we read. It's also a really fun way to learn Chinese history through reading poetry. The readings weren't too much of a heavy workload, as the Sanmin editions we use have baihua translations. It is helpful if you know bopomofo (zhuyin fuhao) so you don't have to check dictionaries for pronounciations, but it's quick to learn if not. If you're interested in Chinese literature or poetry at all, definitely shop this course!",
    "Readings are done completely in Chinese (save for the secondary sources), so be confident in your mastery of traditional Chinese characters, if not Literary\/Classical Chinese as well. \r\n\r\nThere's no other class quite like this at Yale, in its focus on Chinese poetry exclusively in the original language. I would recommend taking at least one of Prof. Kang-I's courses for anyone interested in EALL, and also if you're interested in the broad genre of Chinese poetry as well."
