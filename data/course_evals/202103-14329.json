                "I had never taken a philosophy course before this one, and this course gave me an incredible foundation. I am now very interested in philosophy and know how to tackle a philosophy paper (a complete mystery to me before!)",
                "I the first philosophy paper in my life in this class. Ive learned to reconstruct and evaluate philosophical arguments and offer my own analysis. Ive improved my skills to digest a huge amount of reading in a limited time. Ive came to know the classics of the Western Canon, how they influence each other, and how they still influence us today.",
                "Insights into trends and changes in ancient to medieval philosophical thought, along with skills in thinking about texts in their contexts and today.",
                "This course helped me develop skills relevant to philosophical analysis. I got better at identifying arguments, tracing them through various works, and exploring their implications, strengths, and weaknesses. This course also created a forum for discussion that felt simultaneously relaxed and enlightening, and I think this discussion format helped me communicate my thoughts more clearly and concisely than I was able to at the beginning of the semester.",
                "I learned about the foundational texts of western philosophy. I also picked up an important concept called \"charitable reading,\" which is the idea of cutting our readings some slack and trying to understand them within context (rather than from a purely modern perspective). This idea was important to me because Aristotle may seem silly nowadays, but it's still crucial to understand why he was so important back then. In some sense, DS philosophy is basically an intellectual history course. Still, this intellectual history is about as good as it gets. There's very little in the syllabus that feels extraneous.",
                "This course provided an excellent survey of Ancient Greek and Roman philosophy through seminar-style discussions.",
                "I learned to not always trust my first impressions of a reading and to be more open to other interpretations.",
                "I gained a deeper understanding of the philosophical conundrums of the ancient Mediterranean world, as expressed by some of its most brilliant minds. Beyond simply reviewing the tenets of each thinker's beliefs, we did a good job of investigating some of the underlying assumptions each made about the nature of key topics like the nature of knowledge, life and death, and goodness.",
                "During this course, I learned how to question the world around me and think about life and the best way to live it in new ways."

                "I loved this course and felt that it gave a great survey of \r\n\r\nI personally wished we had spent more time on the thinkers after Plato and Aristotle, especially the Roman thinkers. Perhaps it would have been best to cut down the amount of thinkers after Plato and Aristotle and instead focus intensely on a couple; though this could just be a personal preference.",
                "I think DS is the best Yale can offer for first-year students interested in the humanities. Although the pace of the program doesnt allow you to go too deep into the material, I found many lectures highly inspiring and most discussion sections extremely fruitful. Overall, DS provides a solid foundation for whatever you hope to pursue later. Sometimes DS sections have different pace so that the timing for lectures is not always perfect. I wish the program overall could coordinate this better.",
                "Strengths include the breadth of texts studied and the discussion style used in seminars, a weakness is final exams that dont seem well suited to the learning and assessment that is done throughout the semester.",
                "Group discussions were well-directed and helpful, and the professor was consistently engaged. \r\n\r\nOne improvement I would suggest would be clearer guidelines on the requirements of philosophical analysis in advance of the first paper. The description of philosophical analysis that was shared on the DS umbrella site was certainly helpful, but I think I would have benefited substantially from reading an actual example of the sort of writing\/analysis that was expected of me before embarking on it myself (e.g. a famous essay that followed the proper model\/formula, or an exemplary one from a prior DS student).",
                "Overall, a rather excellent course. Strengths: helps us to truly understand what's going on in Plato and Aristotle's texts, as well as the work of some later philosophers. Weaknesses: covers the post-antiquity period too quickly. For example, Augustine and Aquinas combined get less time than half of Aristotle. I think it would be worthwhile to replace things like Aristotle's Categories and Physics (as much as I enjoyed them) with more space for later philosophers.",
                "This course provides a good foundation of Western philosophy but falls into the trap of the Directed Studies reading load. There simply is not enough time to linger on topics of interest.",
                "I think this is a class where either more top down knowledge imparting or consultation of secondary sources should be considered, as often times students may end the class even more confused about the readings. \r\nAlso, the final should not be an in person written test. Its foolish to spend all semester teaching students the importance of consulting the text and drafting essaysonly to tear those away on the most important graded assignment.",
                "Like most ds courses, the strength of the philosophy track lies in its ability to provide a relatively comprehensive overview of ancient philosophy. Its weakness lies in its lack of opportunities for students to really respond to those works. We have three, at most four, written works to compose in response to over a millennium of thought.",
                "I enjoyed this course veryMuch. I liked the fact that we got to sample types of philosophy across a wide span of time. This being said, I felt that we spent so much time studying the works of Aristotle and Plato at the beginning of the semester that the works we read later on did not get the full time they deserved."

                "I definitely would! The philosophy track can seem daunting, but it is incredibly rewarding and the professors always lead you through the reading which ensures understanding.",
                "I would recommend DS wholeheartedly, but ONLY to students who are truly interested in the content itself. If you merely came for your strike of ego (for the admiring look you get from your non-DS peers when you say you are doing DS, and trust me, you do get it), you really dont have to do this to yourself. The workload is not insane. In fact, its pretty expectable and manageable. Still, it is A LOT. If I didnt enjoy the content, I wouldnt have made it through the semester. For Philosophy, some of the readings really made me want to drop (yes, Im talking about you, Aristotle!) but once you make it to the Epicureans and the Stoics, the reading gets lighter and more enjoyable. You can also see how they build upon earlier texts, so the toil and moil before was worth it! That being said, DS is definitely a highlight of my first semester. Ive enjoyed it so much both inside and outside the classroom. Ive made my best friends in the DS community. Im so glad I chose to take it.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would. I certainly learned a lot, and I genuinely enjoyed the discussions that my classmates and I were able to have in this course.",
                "Yes I would. The key reason is that you almost never feel like your time is spent unproductively in DS philosophy. Every new thing builds upon previous ideas and adds something important to the curriculum. If you want a course that has uniformly high-quality content, this is the one to take. Also, the small section discussions are great! The best time is when you're outside in early October, talking about metaphysics with the breeze on your face. Those moments stay with you for a long time.",
                "I would recommend this course to anybody looking for an introduction to Western philosophy, especially those who have no background in the topic.",
                "Yes. I think particularly the philosophy part of DS is a great exercise in broadening ones understanding of the worlds intellectual development and exposing someone to a wide range of thinkers.",
                "I definitely would. The ideas introduced are very useful in understanding the intellectual underpinnings from which modernity emerged, even if mostly as a reaction to those ideas.",
                "This class is perfect for anyone curious about life and wanting to learn about different schools of thought."
