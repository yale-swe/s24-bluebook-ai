                "An understanding of the science of climate change solutions, economic incentives that help or hinder these solutions, and how we need to marry these two.",
                "Overview of the science, policy, economics, and ethics of carbon containment.",
                "Learned about all the aspects of carbon capture science, policy, deployment, hurdles, etc. This course was different than any other I have taken at Yale because of the emphasis on the group project.  I appreciated this experience because it felt like I could finally apply my academic knowledge to the real world. Each project team was advised by a different instructor, and my team was wonderful to work with.  I also appreciated the chance to speak to several guest lecturers such as Fred Krupp, head of the Environmental Defense Fund. Overall great course and I am interested to see how it develops in the future.",

            "comments": [
                "Strength: you have 4 instructors for 16 students! topics are super interesting and relevant. I'm so glad Yale started offering this course and strongly believe they should keep offering it. It's also very low workload but you meet super cool people that are doing amazing things to combat climate change (both instructors and students). they did a great job at forming a very diverse class with people that had science, policy, business and other types of background. \r\npoints of improvement: the readings were kind of random, not very carefully chosen. they were very long and technical reports on a CCS technology but not very stimulating, and we never discussed them in class so it felt kind of random.",
                "The strength is the teaching team and speakers. I was always engaged even in a longer course period. The amount of knowledge the teaching team brings is almost overwhelming. A possible weakness is the lack of structure of the final project. It was hard to figure out what was in and out of scope of each topic. I would also love if every lecture had a science and social science component. Some lectures were much more science and others were much more social science, and I didn't feel like I was really marrying them until working on the project. Want to think about how they interact from the beginning.",
                "Strengths: wealth of instructor knowledge. Having 4 professors was incredible in that respect.\r\nWeaknesses: unrealistic final project expectations, though understandable for a first-time course.",
                "Strengths: I liked that this course was only 16 people and required an application because it made for a group of students that was highly engaged. Also appreciated the cross-listing between Yale College, SOM, and YSE. The instructors are great and so knowledgeable.  I liked the course format and topics covered, and I enjoyed working on the final project. It was great that the instructors traded off on teaching topics since it kept everyone engaged. (And so nice of them to bring snacks, of course.) \r\nWeaknesses: not many.  It was great that each team did a very different project, but I sometimes wished there was some more standard guidance as to what was expected from the research and reports.",
                "I greatly enjoyed the small lecture style of the class. The projects were interesting, but felt a little too ambition to be accomplished in a semester, more realistically a half semester since we didn't start on them until midway through. However, I appreciated the opportunity to do a deeper dive into one topic, though maybe there's a way to make the projects a bit more achievable for the given time frame.",
                "The amazing, enthusiastic teaching team made the group teaching model work. I learned more from this class than any other this semester -- the kind of material that I'll keep thinking about for years.",
                "The class was structured to facilitate gaining practical experience and skills which I appreciated. The scope of the final project made it difficult to satisfactorily complete and expectations were unclear\/confusing at times.",
                "I think the scheduling needs to be ironed out a little (some project components came out of nowhere with a week's notice) but a lot of this was due to it being the first year of the course, so I'm not worried about the organization in the future.\r\nWas really lovely to have the balance of expertise among the professors and bounce around so much between lectures! Very difficult to get bored in this class."
