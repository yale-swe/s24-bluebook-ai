We studied units of text (newspapers), sound & screen (radio, cinema, film, video and piracy), and digital networks (social media, mobile phones, music), while also having writing workshops throughout the semester.",

                "The main strength of the course is professor Keaney! He was very understandable and facilitated online learning in the best way. The structure of the assignments is very similar to English 114, but I think there is more freedom in choosing what you want to write about. All readings were very interesting and most of them were pretty easy to understand even without prior background in the history of Africa.",
                "Professor Keaney fostered an incredibly welcoming and open learning group environment. He was supportive and incredibly helpful and kind.",
                "Strengths: Professor Keaney was fantastic - I have never had a professor who leaves as much feedback on papers as he does (I had at least one comment per line of every essay I submitted), and its so clear that he wants his students to succeed. He always made class enjoyable, and was very receptive to changing the syllabus around or modifying it whenever we felt overwhelmed.",
                "I would be interested to learn about a few other media - e.g. music, television, dance, art house cinema. I also think the class could've benefitted from a few examples, i.e. watching a Nollywood film, reading a newspaper article, etc. \r\n\r\nBecause the class was not composed of Africanists, the brief historical explainers before discussion were helpful in facilitating dialogue. I'd maybe go a step further and offer them before students do the readings."

                "Definitely! I took this class for writing credit and it was my best decision. Professor Keaney helps students a lot and it makes the learning environment very nice and low-pressure. Even if you do not have a background in history of Africa, take the course if the topic sounds appealing to you.",

Professor Keaney is great, and I loved how many mediums we learned about throughout the course. This course was also a great writing credit (one 2-3 page paper, one 5-6 page paper, and one 7-8 page final paper), especially because Professor Keaney makes you submit rough drafts - in this way, you always receive copious and clear feedback, and feel like you are improving as a writer with each paper you submit.",
