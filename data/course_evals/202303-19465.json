In particular, he makes a concerted effort to make marginalized students in his class feel included by highlighting the successes of past marginalized students and using different pronouns in example problems. The one thing I wish is that there were slides to follow along in class - I could get a little lost between the lecture notes and writing on the chalk board.",

However, sometimes he is too smart and it will take multiple questions and explanations for the knowledge to catch on with his students.",

Professor Geanakoplos is an engaging lecturer (though his lecturing style takes some getting used to) and a really nice guy.
