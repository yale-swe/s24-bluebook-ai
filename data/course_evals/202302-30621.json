                "Learned more about Epi",
                "I learned about measures of association, the odds ratio, the rate ratio and the risk ratio, about the rare disease assumption, about the relationship between prevalence and incidence, about different types of bias (i.e., duration ratio bias), about confidence intervals, p-values, attributable risk, about direct and indirect standardization, about matching and when it removes confounding, how matching improves efficiency, about different types of sampling, about proportionate and disproportionate stratification, about cluster sampling and inverse probability weights, about survival time to event analysis, about right and left censoring, about Kaplan-Meier curves, about the hazard function, about median survival time and how to visually assess survival curves, about log rank and the wilcoxon test, about the cox proportional hazard model, about power and sampling, type I and type II errors, the relationship between power and alpha or the effect size, about modeling through linear and logistic regression, about the -2 Log likelihood test, about meta analysis, about fixed and random effects models, about publication bias and how to assess for it using funnel plots, etc.",
                "I learned way more in this class than in Epi I. From truly understanding differences in research studies, but moreso the interpretations, statistics and conclusions. I really appreciate this!",
                "Biostats. Although sometimes I was more confused",
                "This course was incredibly helpful in learning about epidemiologic methods and statistical calculations.  The course did an excellent job building off of prior knowledge (and spiraling content from prior courses, like Epi one and biostatistics) imparted a deeper understanding of essential measures of association and their interpretation, like the odds ratio, confidence interval, and attributable proportion of the population (a concept that I struggled with in Epi 1).  The course also did a deep dive into survival analysis, cox-proportional hazards, logistic regression, the Mantel-Haenszel procedure (for matched and unmatched data), meta-analysis methodology, and sample size\/power calculations.  I significantly increased my knowledge in all of these areas.",
                "More in-depth understanding of key epidemiology concepts\r\nMuch better ability to read and understand the strengths and weaknesses of published studies",
                "I have a fragile understanding of matching, bias, confounding, effect modification, and publication bias.",
                "Various epidemiological concepts, how to interpret findings from these concepts in epidemiologic literature, how to interpret outputs from SAS, how to conduct analysis for various data sets.",
                "I learnt about more advanced topics in epidemiology including survival analysis, meta-analysis, power, sample size etc. This was a good build up in my skills from Epidemiology I course."

                "Before I started the course, I dreaded performing calculations by hand - but then I realized it was nice to have a foundational grasp of biostats without having to learn a program code. \r\n\r\nThe homework did take up quite a bit of time, would recommend future students to save 3-4 hours for hw.",
                "-Watching the asynchronous  videos prior to lecture.  I made notes to compliment the slides provided, which also helped improve my learning.  Additionally, watching the videos more than once helped my learning.\r\n-Working with my classmates on the homework assignments.  It helped to talk things out with them and also helped to refine questions for Dr. Canavan.\r\n-Meeting with Dr. Canavan during office hours.  Dr. Canavan was able to explain concepts in different ways and helped me to understand the material on a deeper level during office hours.",
                "Completing all readings and homework assignments as well as attending lectures and office hours. Additional study groups with classmates were essential.",
                "I attended class, watched all lectures and took copious notes, and tried to complete as much of the reading as I could (though it was an extensive list of reading).",
                "Watch lectures, attend class, provide myself ample time to complete assignments and quizzes, review homework for quizzes and final exam.",
                "I went through all the asynchronous lectures and tried to attend most live sessions every week. I also tried to read some of the reading materials, and go through each week's homework.",
                "Scheduled individual office hours."
