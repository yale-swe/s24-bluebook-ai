While we covered a number of topics, my biggest take away was the relationship archaeology plays with my own work. It has helped set the course for the remainder of my time here at Yale.",

                "Understanding of how to conduct lab work, knowledge on ancient world",
                "I learned all about different civilizations from history and how different places developed differently over time, and for what reasons",
                "I learned a lot about archaeological sites and the thought process behind surveying them and studying them. The course made me understand why looking at ancient sites was so important and how minute details surrounding tombs, leaders, and a civilization can be so imperative to understanding why their society developed the way it did.",
                "Basic knowledge of civilizations and archaeology",
                "This class was an introduction to archaeology, archaeological methods, and interpreting the remains of the past. It really helped me understand what archaeology is about, as both a science and an art. Even though archaeological interpretations about what people did in the past is based on cold, hard evidence, there is also room for debate about what certain patterns of remains mean. It was also an introduction to the archaeology of different world areas like the Near East, Egypt, China, and the Americas.",
                "We learned about multiple ancient civilizations, how they organized their societies and shaped\/were shaped by the environments they settled in, and most importantly, how we can discover these things through archaeology.",

There was quite a bit of reading, sometimes more than I would be capable of considering my course load. That being said, for archaeology majors, I'm sure the reading load was perfectly manageable.",
                "Shorter readings",
                "The class is easy to do assignments and get a good\/decent grade, it just feels like going to class is barely helpful for the things we are graded on. The labs all could be done without any knowledge of the course and the papers were doable with just a little bit of research. I wish there was more feedback on how to write better for this class, because most of the points deducted for the work came down to writing style really.",
                "The course was really well taught. I think the information was well conveyed and the labs we had to do really made students engage in what they were learning about. I think the inability to look back at most lecture slides to re-affirm information in our mind was a disadvantage within the course.",
                "Good",
                "The main strength is that the course is very well-designed to give you a thorough introduction to archaeology, especially if you don't plan on becoming an archaeologist. Part of the course was lab assignments where we'd examine actual remains from sites like bones, tools, and pottery and try to interpret them as an archaeologist would. We also had two short essays where we applied our newly learned archaeological knowledge to everyday situations where archaeology might be relevant: evaluating a museum display of an archaeological object and a story about archaeology in the news. This helped me understand how I might see everyday things in a new light using my archaeological knowledge after taking this class. The main weakness I think is that the labs can tend towards busywork. Even though they were great for getting exposure to archaeological objects, the write-ups were often tedious and I had to repeat myself many times. For example, we had to analyze around 8 different spear points in one lab in pretty fine detail. I feel like doing half the number of specimens would impart the same knowledge without so much of the busywork. It made me less enthusiastic about labs over the course of the semester.",
                "The course was great super interesting material, the labs were fun, and Professor Underhill is a great professor. I think the end of the class discussion were helpful in summarizing what was taught in class that day.",
                "Personally, I thought this was a strong course with no glaring weaknesses!",
                "The strength of this class was the lab sections. They were fun and allowed us to use the practical skills we learned in class. \r\n\r\nThe style of lectures was a weakness. The professor moved through the content so quickly that I often felt I was just trying to copy down as much as I could  from the slides before she moved onto the next one. It made it difficult to process the information in class.",
                "I loved how my professor structured the class.",
                "I thought this was a good survey class in archeology and definitely inspired me to take more classes in the future. I thought the labs were good to inform our learning as well. I think one area of improvement is that some of the assignments had a long page requirement but the prompt itself was not very extensive, so making longer\/more complex prompts would make it so that I wasn't struggling to reach the requirement.",

I think archaeology plays a significant role in all of the humanities and social sciences and I am hard pressed to find a student who wouldn't benefit from stretching their timeline of understanding outside of their immediate area of focus. I would highly recommend this to any students working specifically in areas pertaining to the 20th century, as study of ancient societies can help break down preconceived notions of how society functions today.",

Professor Underhill was an amazing professor who truly cared about her students learning the material and engaging in the coursework. I wish other professors put the same amount of love and energy into teaching their courses.",
                "Yes, it's pretty fun.",
                "Yes I definitely would recommend this course to any student interested in archaeology, even if they aren't thinking about becoming an archaeologist. The course is thoughtfully designed to give you a comprehensive and useful introduction to archaeology that helps you see everyday situations like going to a museum, watching documentaries\/movies about archaeology, or reading news\/stories about archaeology in a new light. All of the assignments help you learn and there is little busywork besides the more tedious aspects of labs. The workload is reasonable, but it is a not a gut; you will do a good amount of work, but you will actually learn from it. It is a privilege to learn from Prof. Underhill who is an experienced archaeologist and one of the most understanding professors I've ever had.",
                "Yes. I would recommend if you want a interesting class without much workload. The material taught in class is interesting and the labs were very fun.",
                "Yes--the professor was knowledgeable, a great lecturer, and very kind. The course is well-organized and ensures that and there is no point in the semester where the workload feels overwhelming. The material was really engaging for me and I feel that I came away from this course having learned a lot. The labs were one of my favorite activities I've done in a course at Yale.",
                "If you enjoy archaeology or anthropology, take this class!\r\n\r\nIf these are not subjects you are already drawn too, I don't think you will enjoy this class.",
                "Yes. I loved how the class was structured and organized.",
                "If you are interested in archeology (or think you might be), then yes. It gives you a good background and lets you figure out which area of archeology you might want to study further. If you are not, this is probably not a great course for you.",
