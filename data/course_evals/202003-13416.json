                "Overall this is a great course! One potential weakness of the course is its general focus on the heteronormative \"family.\" I think the addition of a \"queering\" of many of the topics would be highly beneficial to the course. This could be as simple as attempting to avoid using gendered heteronormative language when describing families. More rigorously would be the addition of literature which specifically addresses the issues of poverty as they affect people outside of the heteronormative majority.",
                "The course material was interesting but the seminars were often too repetitive. It was hard to have a productive spirited conversation over zoom and it wasn't easy to stay focused when we were doing the same thing for the entire 2 hours. Ana de la O is a wonderful, sweet person and a good professor.",
                "Strength is the presentations and policy memo since its a great way to apply what we learned in class. A weakness is that the class is too quantative.",
                "The class revolves around readings that lay out genuinely interesting & unanswered debates in the field. Professor Ana De La O makes an effort to make the class interesting with different types of assignments and a semester-long group project."

I will say that this class does focus on econ more, so if you're not interested in this aspect of poverty, then this class might not be for you. However, we also focused on public policy and politics as well.",
