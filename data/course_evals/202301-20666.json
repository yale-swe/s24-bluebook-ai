This course teaches you styles of proof and patterns of thinking that are unlike anything in 255 or 302---like proving a statement about a sigma algebra by proving the statement for the algebra's generators, or proving a statement about a space of functions by proving it for a dense subset of that space.",

                "Strengths: Prof. Oh is an amazing lecturer who makes concepts easy-to-understand.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish Prof. Oh was more open to discussing course material more with students. She held office hours once a week and at a very inconvenient time.",
                "Great course. The exams were fair and I believe Hee Oh taught all the material well.",
                "Strengths: Although this might be a weakness for some, the course was fast-paced and ensured that lectures were never boring; the class was taught at the level where you need to give your full attention to Prof Oh for the entire 75 minutes. The lectures were very organized, and the homework was informative. For what is generally known to be a 'hard' math class, Prof Oh made this class very accessible, explaining concepts really well with intuition. Weaknesses: None really.",
                "Hee Oh is a very good lecturer",
                "Professor Oh did a good job giving us intuition for what was going on, even though lectures were often quite fast-paced and technical. Also, the ULAs were fantastic!",
                "Strengths: Professor Oh is a great lecturer; super clear, engaging (and fast!), sweet, and really cares about our enjoyment of the material and class. Even though the sets at times were extremely difficult and overwhelming, especially at the beginning of the course, they were really interesting and cool problems. Felt like every problem was teaching something different. She lightened the psets over time and as exams approached. The exams were also a lot less intimidating than most closed note math exams I've had at yale. The graders were fairly nice.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the class went a little too quickly, and every now and then it felt like we were proving more than we needed to. Also the homework was stressful.",
                "The course homework were quite relevant, though there were a couple of problems that were too long. I think though the course was overall quite strong.",
                "Strength of the course is Hee Oh's lectures, which are the most engaging lectures I've had of any course. On a very honest note, Hee Oh's lectures in Math 305 are the one class where I actually attended every single class, because of how good they were. Her exams were also very fair and tested on the important skills we developed in class. The ULAs were also very helpful with pset help. I guess the only weakness is sort of the grading; even though the grading was very fair, it would be useful if there was more reasoning for some of the points being marked off. Sometimes, there was a specific reason mentioned, but other times, the comments just said \"score modification\", which didn't really explain much.",
                "Strengths: very interesting material (and much better structure of content), Hee Oh is a very nice person, midterm was very reasonable and final was not nearly as bad as last year (based on what I heard); Weaknesses: I wish the lecture notes were posted, sometimes I give up on the psets and rely on ULA office hours because there are some non-trivial problems",
                "The biggest strength of this course is Prof. Oh, who is a fantastic lecturer. The only weakness I can think of is that some of the homework problems could have been chosen better (there was one, for instance, that to the best of my knowledge  required several intermediate theorems that we did not cover in class).",
                "I believe this is a core math class, so you learn helpful proof skills and techniques. Lectures in general were pretty good, though I spent the majority of them pretty confused because Professor Oh goes quite fast. One improvement would be if there were more office hours held by the professor, and specifically to ask questions about the psets. I could not attend the ones Professor Oh had because of a conflict with another class, and they happened before the next pset was released and after the previous pset was due.",
                "The course is excellently organized. The material is presented in a very digestible and thought-provoking manner. My only suggestion would be uploading the lecture notes on canvas to help relieve the concern of not having everything jotted down which decreases focus on the actual discussion.",
                "The lectures are absolutely perfect, and the problem sets complement the lectures nicely in that they require no new knowledge outside of what was taught in lecture, but are more challenging than the lecture proofs. I think the exams also had adequate difficulty, but it would be okay if they were a little more challenging.",
                "Professor Oh is a great lecturer, her lectures are very clear. It can be hard to get to know her outside of class, however, because her office hours are during the 4 hours a week that we don't have a pset. Holding office hours during a time when we have a pset would make me feel more comfortable coming to them, because I would know that the things I was confused about were important.",
                "This class was wonderful and opened my eyes to so much new math (and the brilliance of lebesgue integration), but it was HARD- prepare for this to dominate your semester. Pset nights were a religious but sleepless experience, you will go to office hours always. You will experience highs and lows you have never felt before. However, it is graded very generously, and effectively just on completion (at least for the midterm) as far as I can tell; wonderful for your GPA, not so great if you want to be a rigorous mathematician.",
                "This course has very interesting content and the lectures are very good, the homeworks are interesting but became so difficult on a few questions that office hours explanations felt basically required",
                "Fourier analysis is really fun. However, we didn't really get to it until the last 1/4 of the course, when it would've been nice to spend more time on it rather than spending time only on measure theory for the rest of the time. Professor Oh is a brilliant lecturer with a good sense of humor who helps you feel at home in the classroom, and it was very helpful when she summarized all the topics you'd need on exams the lecture before each exam. Quite a few weaknesses: There were no review sessions, practice problems, or other resources to help practice and prepare for exams outside of the problem sets. Professor Oh's office hours were during the one part of the week when there was no problem set assigned. The problem sets weren't uploaded to Canvas until the very end of the class, making them very inconvenient to access. Similarly, since questions weren't linked to pages on Gradescope, it was difficult to view feedback on problem sets.",

Sometimes in lectures Professor Oh would get confused and then the lecture would become borderline impossible to follow. I think perhaps if the lectures were better prepared/organized in advance it'd be a much better experience. Overall though, Hee Oh is great at explaining the material",

                "Without a doubt yes. I came into this class disliking analysis and liking algebra more, and I left loving analysis much more than algebra. Hee Oh is the best lecturer I have ever had and is very effective at explaining how something is proved and why it is important.",
                "Yes for math majors",
                "Yes, I think every math major should take this class! Even if you don't like analysis much (I don't), I think a basic understanding of measure theory is important, and the Fourier series stuff at the end is pretty cool. Also, Prof. Oh is one of the best lecturers in the department, so definitely take a class with her if you can!",

                "If you are a math major interested in analysis, absolutely. Honestly, I don't think you should be allowed to graduate as a math major without taking this course, because it builds a lot of mathematical maturity regardless of its subject matter.",
                "Yes, analysis is very fun and the course threaded the needle of being clear enough that I could understand the topics and do most of the homework on my own or with friends, but challenging enough that I had to put a lot of thought into it.",
                "Absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, analysis will become your queen.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in pure math this is an excellent choice.",
                "Yes, if only for the Fourier analysis part of the course (the last 1/4 or so of the course) and the pleasure of Professor Oh's lectures. Make sure you have friends taking the class with you to study and work with; the lack of resources or review sessions means you'll need a study group.",
