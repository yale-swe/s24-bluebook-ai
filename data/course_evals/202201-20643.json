                "I learned how to think about transnational activist networks and NGOs through multiple lenses, and I started to see patterns in transnational organization and activism across multiple cases.",
                "this class helped me understand international relations and global systems from a new perspective. It was very helpful in allowing me to expand my view of political science beyond governments.",
                "A great overview of the ways in which NGOs and networks form and effect world politics. The structure of the class is great, as the first half discusses theory and the second half focuses on empirical and applications, which I found to be very helpful in understanding and interacting with the content.",
                "I learned how different international actors can gain credibility, and how they interact with each other in different scenarios. The course was quite theoretical at the start, and then moved into more specific case studies and topics, which I appreciated, including terrorism, weapon control, the environment, etc.",
                "I learned about what nongovernmental organizations were, as well as what kinds of contributions they have in global\/domestic politics.",
                "A new insight into global non-governmental actors. The readings were key to this course and it was good to use the knowledge from them in the essay and exams. It was very interesting to link this course to my previous work in the political science department",

                "This was an excellent course. The readings were great introductions to the topics. The lectures could be more detailed, however. I felt that without the readings, the lectures felt a little too general.",
                "Professor Bush does a great job at curating a manageable and thoughtful reading list, which I greatly appreciated. Her lecturing style is great and the course was very engaging. Weaknesses are few, and overall this course was fantastic.",
                "The strengths of this course are that Professor Bush really cares about the subject and her students. The class has so much potential to be really engaging, but I think sometimes the emphasis and presentation of teaching materials missed the mark slightly. The content was actually really interesting, but it was often presented in quite a theoretical way, which made it hard to engage with, especially in class discussions. I think just slightly altering how the material is presented, maybe with more case studies that are discussed in class would be a good improvement",
                "There were a lot of reading and it was very hard to get them all done. This class had more readings than my two seminars.",
                "I think it is well organized (eg putting introductory lessons before more specific case studies) and the interesting leminar format makes student participation a little more accessible, but I do think a weakness could simply be the sheer amount of readings necessary to succeed and understand content, especially for students who are mostly unfamiliar with course content.",
                "Great flow through the lectures with many links back to key themes. Readings were all highly engaging although its sometimes hard to keep up with them all. I would have liked to have more paper due throughout the semester maybe in the form of reading responses",
                "Strengths: Prof. bush very kind, covered wide range of materials; not much work outside of class except reading. \r\nWeaknesses: sooo much reading. Wide range of topics was nice but not as much in depth learning about any one thing which I missed; felt ping pong-y. Didnt get any feedback on work because most of it came at the end. Strongly strongly disliked having major final paper and big final exam, all during finals period. It would have been SO much better to have the paper done during the semester so I could learn from comments and improve my work, as well as space out the work. During the semester, there was nothing except the midterm. Nice in some aspects but made the stretch after classes ended really so much."

Prof Bush is a really friendly instructor who is good at lecturing and responsive to student concerns. Highly recommended for Poli Sci majors and those interested in the subject!",
                "Absolutely. If you are interested in NGO work, this is the course for you. Developing a theoretical and applied understanding of NGOs is very useful and genuinely interesting. Would highly recommend.",
                "I would recommend it because Professor Bush was so wonderful, but the way it is currently taught I don't think it is the most engaging or interesting content. It has the potential to be fantastic, but just misses the mark slightly",
                "No. This class could be taught really well because its such an interesting topic, but I dont think it was taught well and the Marie risk became very theoretic",
                "I would recommend this to student who is interested in learning about NGOs or politics on a global scale, but otherwise, I would not, because the coursework can be difficult to manage.",
                "Absolutely- it was extremely interesting if you like learning about international politics and I really appreciated the links to current topics such as the Chinese Winter Olympics and the Ukraine",
                "Maybe; it was more poli sci than I think I expected as an EVST major. But interesting topics to know about as I move out of the Yale community. Good if you dont want a lot of work during the semester but prepare for a lot during finals period."
