                "This course is very information-dense, and it can be difficult to keep track of all relevant facts within a given lecture. However, the fact that lectures were recorded allowed for any missed details to be relearned at a later date, and Professor Wagner's willingness to respond to questions, and his ability to answer effectively, meant that critical information was never truly slipping through a student's fingers.",
                "nothing. the content is interesting, the assignments fair and fun. I loved the essay format, gives me time to think about things, do additional research and truly learn, instead of rote memorization. Sadly Prof. Wagner won't be teaching at Yale any more. The amount of research literature paper incorporated was awesome pretty cool.",
                "Strengths: Interesting lectures, lots of interdisciplinary connections pulled from other areas of study\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes disorganized, largely due to remote nature of course and teaching/learning across different time zones, lecture slides didn't always correspond to the slated lecture session (ie: sometimes we'd cover half the lecture slides in one class or two sets of lecture slides in one class, it made reviewing material for papers a little more confusing)",
                "Content is very interesting! Students can take content at their own pace. Essays are a great way to check for understanding while also letting the student decide what info is interesting/meaningful to them. I definitely got the most out of the lecture while also being enrolled in the lab.",
                "I think that a weakness of this course would be that the lecture style was slightly confusing. This made it harder for me to understand the concepts. Despite this though, I feel as though Gunter did his best in teaching this course.",
                "The material is really interesting, but is sometimes presented in a disorganized manner.",
                "I really appreciated the essay format of exams that allowed students to think through answers rather than memorize anything.",

                "The virtual lecture format served this course very well, as it allowed both for synchronous time to ask questions and asynchronous time to review recordings and grasp all details of the paper. The open book essay assessments also effectively allowed students to demonstrate their grasp of all the content in the class without fearing that a small detail slipping their minds could have catastrophic consequences. However, the structure of the Zoom lectures made the TFs feel unapproachable, and they seemed to have no role in the class at all.",
                "I like the concept of essays as a substitute for exams, but I wasn't a huge fan of the grading. If they are going to be graded on a relatively rigid rubric, I would've preferred to have the expectations made clearer in advance.",

                "I believe this course generally involves exams as assessments rather than essays. While the essay topics were interesting, I sometimes felt that exams would have been a more appropriate mode of assessment for the style of course.",
                "I appreciated that the lectures were recorded with transcripts because I wasnt always able to make it to the live lecture.",
                "I thought this class was very considerate to the difficulties of learning during the pandemic. I noticed that many people were choosing to watch the lectures asynchronously and the professor never expressed any doubt or frustration against the students for doing this. I really appreciated this, especially because it often is not a given that a professor will be generous, especially a professor in STEM.\r\n\r\nLearned a lot in a low stress environment, really really enjoyed this class. Breath of fresh air.",

I thought this was a great idea and definitely increased my level of engagement and understanding of the material. Rather than just memorizing facts/names of bones/muscles/etc, I felt I have a good understanding of the evolutionary progress and developmental processes that take place. I would strongly suggest that the professor next semester consider this method instead  i think it would be hugely beneficial to learning"

Students seeking one of these biological approaches without the presence of the others will likely find enough of what they desire in this course to enjoy it, but students who seek all three will find exactly what they are looking for.",

Professor Wagner is clearly very intelligent but not overbearingly so, he points out the most interesting aspects of each topic and gives a good background for the student to understand what evidence led to each of these scientific discoveries. He is also very funny in his own way. A good idea to take it with lab, which is more work but extremely fun!",
                "Yes!  It provided me with a new perspective of anatomy.  Instead of simply memorizing how different organ systems work, we learned about the evolution and development of the vertebrate body.  This gave me a greater overall understanding of anatomy, and a longer lasting knowledge that will serve me well in vet school.",
