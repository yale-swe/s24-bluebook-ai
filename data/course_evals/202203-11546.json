                "I learned how to write better, read faster and comprehend more. The in-class discussions challenged me to formulate my thoughts quickly and come up with sound, nuanced arguments backed with evidence. I learned to appreciate techniques used by different authors, as well as techniques I used in my own writings. I learned how to take advantage of the revision process to form satisfactory essays out of vague ideas and outlines. I was also exposed to different aspects of American culture that I had previously been unfamiliar with through reading different author who came from different socioeconomic backgrounds.",
                "I was able to develop skills in both critically reading to analyze writing techniques used. I also learned how to apply these writing techniques in a way that furthered instead of changed my own writing style."

                "The strengths of this course are that it's very well organized and we have plenty of readings to look at for examples of proper writing in each unit. I will say that there is a high quantity of papers we have to write, which is good in that we're always writing, but often it can be difficult to put your best foot forward on every paper because there's not as much time to revise. I would suggest only writing four papers per semester so that the quality of the papers can be higher.",
                "Major strengths include direct feedback from your peers and instructors and reading wildly interesting pieces. A weakness is that some of those same pieces, despite being interesting, do little to provide techniques that readers can apply to their own writing.",
                "As a very STEMy STEM major, I was quite surprised by how easily this course drew me in. I'm not sure how to improve the course. I can talk about its advantages though. The readings and reading-discussions are the soul of this course. Pam chose the readings masterfully and rarely did I feel bored with the assigned readings. The in-class discussions were interesting and thought-provoking. The comments and suggestions Pam offered for each draft and final draft helped tremendously when it came to improving my writing. These also inspired me to be a better writer. The workshops allowed me to see the works of other students and that was nice as well (to gain perspective on how everyone else's styles).",
                "Professor Newton's engagement in the course and passion for writing is definitely a strength of this course as it not only makes each student eager to write, but it was her own interest which made class discussions easy to stay involved in."

                "Absolutely, you will become  afar, far better writer.",
                "Would definitely recommend, even for a STEM major. If you like the readings of this class (i.e. New-Yorker-style essays) you will love this class. The class introduces you to a wide array of writing styles, opinions, and types of essays. Perhaps most importantly, the class arms you with the tools to become a better writer and reader, which will remain valuable when the class ends.",
                "Yes! I would 100% recommend this course. It was by far the most engaging class I took because we were encouraged to branch out and embrace our own personal writing style. You read amazing, funny, interesting essays and this exposure makes your own writing improve."
