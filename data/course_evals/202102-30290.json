Those inequlity events (such as the anti-racial discrimination movement, boundaries of Mexico, or the development of LA) make me think about the responsibility of cartographer. I also know about the basic method and creative ideas to make my own project and knowlage shared by professor and classmates.",
                "I developed different skills to be a cartographer. Moreover, I was given different methods to approach questions as a cartographer.",
                "The logic of traditional cartography and, furthermore, how to reappropriate and subvert these tactics. The class was heavily concerned with how new ways of looking at land use and ownership can be used as a tool to help people who experience inequity due to traditional map making.",
                "I learned about how maps and cartography are much more than simply representations of our world: they can engender ideologies, discriminate against groups of people, show us radical new ways of thinking, and so much more. I became better versed in using research methods I had used before to create original maps and a final visual essay, which was on a topic I very much enjoyed.",
                "This course really provided me with a variety of new information about maps.",
                "The basic methods of cartography, methodologies of urban studies, in-depth discussion on the social aspects of maps and geography",
                "I learned about the diversity of maps through history and how their different styles/forms influence the impression we get of places. I also was exposed to the different ways maps can highlight inequities in society and how maps can reflect hierarchies.\r\n\r\nI also developed my sketching skills and learned how to synthesize thoughts into a presentation.",
                "I foremost developed a stronger sense of self and the confidence to learn new skills. The greatest impact this course had on me was how I was encouraged through this class to change and challenge how I think about the dynamics between architecture, space, belonging, and responsibility. I throughly enjoyed the readings and saved some to keep in my bookmarks for long-term reference. I was so moved by the people we were reading and whose work we were studying that I kept a list in the back of my accordion journal of people who are shaping my relationships to architecture. I loved having students from different classes, schools, disciplines and backgrounds and found the discussions rich and too short! There was so much to gain from this course that three hours strangely was not enough.",

                "Whether mapping the grid of a city or organizations of Indigenous tribes a city was constructed over, all maps have an inherent bias. These map creators hold the power to pick and choose what sides of history certain communities choose to favor or oppose. Like all other consumable media, the way factual data is presented has the power to uplift or marginalize communities. No matter how stark or detailed, colorful or bland, or proportionate or not, these seemingly objective portrayals of space inherently characterize areas and skew perspectives of viewers. In this course, I realized that the mapmaker plays a vital role in history - ensuring that past injustices are rightfully represented in order to prevent them from being repeated."

                "It was mostly perfect, the only concern I have is the process of the course: because design (project) is a highly individual process, so actually the last half of time we fouced more on everyone's project. However, someone's presentation are highly repeated and that reduced the willingness of other students to participate. How can this problem solved?",
                "I think the lecture on Monday is a little bit unconcentrated (jumping from one topic to another separate topic). But in general, they are fantastic.",
                "The class had a great balance of student discussion and lectures. It was very helpful for the final project that Bimal offered plenty of diverse ideas of map-making.",
                "Strengths: super interesting subject material, a lot of super cool readings, very open final project\r\nWeakness: at times I felt like the course was a little too open, but that was sometimes helpful as well.",
                "Very diverse course structure; great discussions, lectures, and workshops.",
                "The strengths of this course is the final project and the sketchbook. I was blown away by my peers' work and found it a very satisfying process.\r\n\r\nThe readings were often fascinating and I really enjoyed our conversations about them, even though it wasn't always clear what the overall theme was. Lectures sometimes were helpful but perhaps if the professor asked questions periodically, rather than just at the end, it would be more engaging.\r\n\r\nI also feel like there was a lot of emphasis on the softer more intellectual side of maps but more could have been done to help students improve their drawing skills.",
                "The course was broken down perfectly and I liked having everything due on Wednesday. I would only change the Monday routine to incorporate more reading discussion. This class was structured exquisitely.",
                "The strengths of this course are well-selected readings and a diverse approach to the visual presentation via hand-drawing, storytelling, digital imaging, and etc.\r\n\r\nThe weakness is the missing part of the studio experience due to Covid-19.",
                "This course did a stellar job of highlighting how maps and their biases chronicle the disenfranchisement or reclamation of space of/by minority groups. Analyzing different types and styles of maps in a Harkness style conversation resulted in compelling questions about and solutions to issues of spacial inequity. I particularly loved how the objectivity of the presented content intersected with the class discussions about the opinion-based pieces we'd read for homework.\r\nPresentations about these different ways of defining space highlighted how differing styles often correspond to different motives during a time, specifically times of spacial inequity. The motives behind different ways of defining space, such as the Jeffersonian Grid, the layout of Manhattan, and a host of differing walls were well explained in presentations. I appreciate the breadth of discussion about space around the world - both in presentations and in my classmates' chosen topics, but not much comparing and contrasting was done in this course. For example, comparing the history and layout of NYC to a city like Manila would be fascinating! I believe that this, coupled with the unique historical connotations tied to specific spaces, could advance class discussions to determine not just how, but why distinct instances affect precise places."

The leeway of choosing your own topic and format for the final project was refreshing, albeit a bit nerve wracking (due to not having prior examples of the project to go off). But it could be argued that not having examples to reference led to a final project confidently driven by authentic expression."
