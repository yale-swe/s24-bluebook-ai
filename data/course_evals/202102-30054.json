                "i think it was a lot of time with the recorded lectures and then live class (since we were just reviewing info I don't think I necessarily learned any insight into the topic during our live lectures). Our TA's were great but it would have been preferable to have a grad student\/lecturer\/professor teaching the content since they have more experience teaching.",
                "Love the course! Though it can be really stressful in the summer, there are so much resources available and at the end of the day you get such a great confidence boost since you will survive the class and you know how cs works.",
                "I loved how all the resources were so easy to find. You are getting your moneys worth with the course material and the knowledge you can get from it. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: maybe because I was in the more comfortable class but it was not very beginner friendly. It was very fast paced and I didnt feel like I fully mastered the material that we had to move on to the next topic.",
                "This course is so difficult but so well designed. Every resource is there to help you succeed but you have to use them.",
                "I somewhat regret taking this course during the summer session--I feel like I could have retained a lot more if the semester had been longer. As CS50 is already such a fast-paced course, I felt like I was hurtling through everything without time to breathe. However, that is not the fault of the course itself. The great strength of this course was the ample office hours provided by the staff and personalized sections for students to refresh their lecture knowledge. The website is also extremely well-organized with numerous resources. A potential weakness is the length of the prerecorded lectures: towards the end of the semester, watching 3-hour videos twice a week along with attending 2-hour sections got very fatiguing.",
                "The lectures were engaging and a good overview of the language we were learning at the time.",
                "Strength: Structured logically, very hands-on and engaging! Instructors and TAs were all very present, helpful and encouraging. The breakout room format was also great - loved the collaborative atmosphere!\r\nWeakness: Pre-section quiz can be less conceptual and more hands-on, so to better retain syntax covered in lecture.",
                "CS50 runs very smoothly. Strengths are Davids lectures, TAs taking the time to understand your code in office hours, and the problem sets.",
                "Strengths: You learn an incredible deal in a short period of time (especially in the summer) - it's a very rewarding course.\r\nWeaknesses: Because of the course's fast-paced nature, the workload can seem intense.",
                "Very fast paced: you learn a lot very quickly. On the downside, it would sometimes lack clarity with this speed, especially for someone new to coding.",
                "Syllabus should be more accommodating",
                "Strengths: The instructors aid learning as best as they can. The support system for problem sets (office hours, super section, check50, style50) are very helpful for the beginner programmer.\r\nWeaknesses: Over the summer, the combination of lectures and sections amounts to about 15 hours of engagement without accounting for the problem sets. This means you are constantly engaging with the material but also means that there is no break from learning.",
                "this course is very difficult but enjoyable, strengths: the psets can be really fun, weaknesses: lectures were really long and more one on one help in section could have been useful",
                "Its a very tough course in terms of the workload, but the material is very interesting. And although the course has a heavy and challenging workload, it is definitely manageable and correlates with the amount I learned.",
                "Well structured.\r\nOrganized.\r\nKnowledgeable and patient instructors.\r\nHigh level, accelerated learning.\r\nGreat tools.\r\nThank you!",
                "I thought the course was almost perfectly designed because we both had the ability to learn at our own pace through the prerecorded lectures and the ability to practice what we learned in discussion section before we started the problem sets. The material was also organized very well and taught in an engaging and interesting way. Despite the lectures because almost 3 hours sometimes, they did not feel as long because of the efforts of the CS50 team in making it interesting.",
                "Freedom! Professor Murphey was always very nice, flexible, and available. I appreciated the office hours and class being conducted through discord. I thought the TAs all put in visible effort and clearly cared about what they were doing, and were always kind and good-spirited. The problem sets were generally interesting, and if they weren't at first, they could generally be solved a variety of different ways, so you could usually find an approach that, if unconventional, provided an opportunity to try something new.  It was ultimately more challenging than I expected, honestly, but I'm sure that's mostly my own fault for going out of my way to try new things\/do things unconventionally, when it was clear there was a naive approach that, while perhaps \"inelegant,\" was straightforward and would have saved lots of time and debugging. I also made an effort to never attach the \"CS50 training-wheels\" headers in my projects, and I definitely suffered for it, but I think in a good way - I definitely learned a lot more than I would have otherwise. Though it often felt like I could have benefited from guidance from someone with CS experience beyond the undergraduate level. There were some times I came to office hours where the undergraduate staff told me my code+question was beyond what they were comfortable with - which wasn't a big problem, and I appreciated the honesty. The expertise of the staff was pretty variable, which on the flipside meant that there was usually someone who was still within their depth."

                "Yes. It is a good intro to programming. As someone with very little programming experience I found the psets to be very doable as long as I did not procrastinate on them. As long as you start the psets early and break them into chunks then they were not too bad.",

                "Definitely. Even if you have a little coding experience, CS50 covers a variety of topics",
                "I would. Despite the workload involved with this course, CS50 does leave you with important and practical skills in a relatively short period of time. The problem sets are also designed to promote students' interest in computer science, so while they might take time to complete, solving them will still be a rewarding experience. CS50 should probably be taken when students have enough time to focus on the course.",
                "Yes: a very effective course. Definitely will teach you a lot. Just make sure you have room in your schedule for a lot of work.",
                "Yes, but don't take any other hard\/heavy workload courses at the same time.",

                "Yes. The course taught me what I wished to learn and more. It was challenging but offered plenty of supportive resources.",
                "Yes I would, it is interesting and I learned a lot but does require a significant time commitment.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend this course to any student regardless of major or background. The things you learn in this course are actually applicable to real life and can be applied to any field. Computers are so important in our lives that it is necessary for everyone to know at least the basics of how programs work. This course could easily make someone switch their major to comp sci due to how engaging and interesting each problem set is.",
                "Definitely. I would even say the majority of the workload for me tended to be at least in part self-inflicted, so the fact that I was willing to shoulder this each week, should speak to how much I valued the practical experience gained in CS50. Freedom on the final project! Check50s! Class discord and discord office hours! High-quality\/well-conceived psets! Have fun! Enjoy yourself, and be sure to reach out to the staff if you are confused. They are extremely nice and are here to help!",
                "I would recommend this course only to another student if they are taking it as their ONLY class during the summer or if they have a drastically reduced workload for their other classes during a regular semester. Although the class was interesting and teaches you a lot, I was incapable of keeping up with the immense workload and expectations of the course, and it caused my grades and learning to suffer. Definitely only take this class if you are absolutely certain you will have the ability to put in the time and work that it requires."
