                "It's easy to answer, \"I became a better writer,\" but I that's what my experience really boils down to. I became a more comfortable writer; I became a more thoughtful writer. I learned how to write for an audience; I learned how to make a point in my writing. I have a new love of writing for the sake of writing; I have a new love of writing for the sake of a greater purpose. And of course, I think I've made some great friends, met a great professor, and embraced the essay as a form. I found this to be one of those absolutely transformative courses you hear about from college tour guides but don't really believe exist.",

I knew how to write, but I didn't know how to write to \"surprise and delight people\" (as Ehrgood puts it). But the readings and the feedback I received from him and from workshops we would do in class was valuable. I grew as a writer and as a reader in this course. I learned how to choose my words, how to structure them, how to think of them, how to place them. My writing strengthened and my ability to read (and when I write \"read\" I mean read deeply and for pleasure) has improved. I recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve in their writing, confident or not.",

                "The most valuable takeaway from the course is this: I am far more deliberate in the construction of my essays now than I was at the start of the semester, and that applies to how I think as well. That is a sort of cheatsy way to capture all of the extraordinary benefits of taking the course in one sentence. In my first essay draft, I churned out this fussy, impersonal piece of lifeless trash - something you would produce for the College Board. Never again did I make that same mistake. I learned to let myself write to \"surprise and delight,\" to become a student of rhetoric and style. And that ultimately is what this course excels at: teaching one how to write for pleasure.",
                "Being particular with word choice, and writing under constraints of a prompt or challenge (such as lipogram). I learned how to craft an essay which takes sometimes from personal experience, other times from research, but always with the end goal of communicating a broader message."

                "Strengths: Ehrgood, Ehrgood, Ehrgood. He is, to paraphrase a friend of mine, an absolute gem. Our section had only four essays to write. The discussions we had, the workshops we conducted, and the readings we read were all a delight to participate in. Ehrgood holds you to a high standard, but he never lets you aim for that standard alone.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: What are those? I can honestly say this was the one class I never once dragged my (physical and virtual) feet to.",
                "No weaknesses at all. Professor Ehrgood was the ultimate strength to this course. I highly recommend taking this course with him if you can. He's witty and he provides a lot of valuable feedback on style. Even for the most confident writer, he has something to teach. You begin to think deeply. You might decide to write about your hometown or about TikTok. You can write about these thoughts and he will teach you how to express these thoughts in a way that will \"delight and surprise your readers.\" You may also surprise yourself once you see how your writing has strengthened by the end of the semester.",
                "Strengths: Professor Ehrgood was amazing and really cared for each one of his students. The course packet was also very engaging. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had access to the full syllabus at once instead of it coming in piece by piece.",
                "Strengths - Professor Ehrgood offers incredible feedback on essays. He's the best professor I've ever had, and he always gives us literary \"bonbons\" fun readings. The readings in this class are so, so good, I frequently made my friends who weren't in this class stop what they were doing and listen to me read them out loud. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - none",
                "The free-speaking environment that Professor Ehrgood always emphasized resulted in some of the most intellectually invigorating and fun conversations that I have had this semester.",
                "This course was extraordinary because it was taught by one passionate, patient, and insightful Mr. Ehrgood. His experience teaching this course is evident in how beautifully he can let the seminar ebb and flow naturally, motivating students to make comments on what was particularly delightful while not being afraid to make important observations himself. This leads to another tremendous strength of the course: the students. Maybe it was just a coincidence that so many brilliant minds took this specific seminar, but my fellow classmates were equally important to the experience as Professor Ehrgood. Their feedback from when we workshopped our own essays was invaluable, and I cannot count the times when someone found a nugget of excellence in one of the course packet essays that even Professor Ehrgood had not seen before. Finally, the seminar itself was lively and fascinating due to the strengths listed above. Put simply, the class was a blast and will probably be my favorite for quite some time.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness that stood out to me was this strange arrangement we had for the final two essays. We had to choose one of them to revise for a final grade while the other draft grade would be the final grade for that essay. That had to do with time, and I don't think it would happen again.",
                "Strengths: Professor Ehrgood was phenomenal. He made every possible accommodation he could for me to participate despite me being a remote-student, and his feedback was informative and helpful. He cares deeply about his students."

Ehrgood, as well as the students, were fantastic at fostering discussion and commentary from the virtual students in spite of the awkward technology barrier. We did have a bit of difficulty with setting up our whole system in LC, where the students would be projected on a giant screen. The trouble was with the audio and mic-ing the table so that we could hear them and they could hear us, but we dealt with it.",

                "100%! This was such a great experience to have, especially in my first year. Everybody in the class got to know each other really well, largely from reading each other's essays, and our Professor created a really fun and close-knit atmosphere. The class's focus on expression and non-academic essay writing class really helped reignite my love for writing.",
                "YES, 120%. I would absolutely recommend this course, specifically with Andrew Ehrgood. He's a great and funny professor who brings in amazing people. I still talk with all my classmates from this course and we share our essays with one another. It's been a long time since I've felt inspired to write and to read deeply. Even if you're a STEM major whose strengths lie with numbers, I would recommend taking this course to practice writing and reading works that will help you to write thoughtfully.",

                "Yes. ENGL 120 taught by Professor Ehrgood was honestly life-changing. I went into the course thinking that I was a sub-par writer and wanting to improve just for the sake of getting good grades on college essays, but I got much more out of it. Professor Ehrgood taught me that writing is full of intention, purpose, and most importantly, joy. Not only did my prose greatly improve, but I now am inspired to take more English courses to further grow in reading and writing.",
                "Please do yourself a favor and take this with Ehrgood. This is too brilliant of a learning experience to turn down. You will come out a better writer that appreciates the art of words and sentences.",
                "Yes. It gives new perspectives on writing and the writing you read is selected meticulously. The feedback Professor Ehrgood gives will make you a better writer."
