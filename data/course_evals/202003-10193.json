The freedom offered in some of the assignments also helped so that students could focus on topics\/areas that they were genuinely interest in using a format that can be creative.",
                "i liked how professor debs offered audio lectures as well so we could take a walk while listening to the lectures",
                "It was a great course that is able to cover a range of topics. One strength was that we were able to pick the topic that interested us to explore in our literature review.",
                "Strengths: recorded lectures and virtual section, receptivity to student feedback, flexibility with deadlines (much appreciated!), creative liberty on final project \r\nWeaknesses: I felt that a lot of the reading was unnecessary since it was succinctly and nicely summarized each time during lecture",
                "Amazing! I LOVED this course so much. It was structured so well and Dr. Debs is fantastic and very accessible. I loved the moment of calm and the focus on mental health throughout the semester. Also, the projects for this class were quite fun.",
                "The recorded lectures didn't differ from the reading material. A lot was lost in this class because it was asynchronous. Dr. Debs seems like a fantastic person, but course engagement across the board was very low.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- course structure\r\n- content\r\n- understanding TF\r\nHonestly no weaknesses. Reading load was big, but Dr. Debs adapted it and the fair assessments made up for it.",
                "The readings were very interesting to engage with, and I was happy I could connect a lot of the readings to my own personal experiences with the educational system. The course also created a space for students to share their own experiences, and the discussion sections, being student-run, allowed me to take a lot away from not only the teaching assistant but also from other students. The only weakness of this course is that there is A LOT of reading, and it sometimes feels overwhelming to read 6-8 long chapters (ranging from 10 to 40 pages each) before the discussion section. I understand the importance of each reading, but I think it would help make the course more manageable if the amount of readings each week was cut down.",
                "The readings tended to get heavy, but many were really insightful. I also think Dr. Debs did an incredible job of balancing the broadness of the course with including very relevant specific things by highlighting central themes.",
                "I personally would have really benefitted from an synchronous lecture component more than an asynchronous lecture component. I also found it ironic that the Education Studies class was the class that had the most restrictive extension policy out of all of my classes during a global pandemic.",
                "Strengths: the format of recorded lectures that could also be listened to was so great. I can't even think of any weaknesses, this class was truly phenomenal.",
                "Recorded lectures were amazing - organization, engagement, and information. The course is careful to include stories of BIPOC and gives voice to issues that have previously been ignored in standard curricula. Dr. Debs and my TA treat students like human beings and care about our well-being",
                "The texts were amazingsuper interesting, insightful, and engaging. Professor Debs is very friendly and has made every effort to recreate the course in a way that is flexible and forgiving with regard to covid. The assignments are interesting and very personally-relevant\/meaningful. Rachel (TA) fostered an incredibly engaging discussion section where each person felt the trust and respect to share personal information and beliefs. As for what can be improved, I would only suggest that lectures would be modified so that they do less restating of the texts and more synthesis\/bringing in different topics\/perspectives\/ideas.",
                "I think one of the few weaknesses of this course was also a strength: Each week, we learned about a different facet of education. Because of this, we didn't get to go into depth in any one topic; however, this also meant we got to learn about a wide range of topics, and through that I've been able to figure out which I'm most passionate about.",
                "The strengths were how interesting the material was and how passionate the teaching staff is, the weakness is how much reading there is.",
                "The strengths of this course were the selection of readings, the accessibility of the professor, and choice of assignments. The biggest weakness I think was that the lessons we were learning about the best and most equitable ways to do education didn't feel implemented in the actual class structure and teaching style.",
                "I think, while the recorded lectures were effective, it was hard to maintain accountability to watch them all. Often felt like I was choosing b\/t readings or lectures \r\n\r\nA strength of this course was section, which was extremely helpful in getting different ideas and growing my own, especially if I couldn't do lecture",
                "I felt that the course was remarkably thorough for a survey course, but often felt that the different weeks felt segmented  from each other- as such, I'd love to see more common threads traced through the multiple units.",
                "The strengths were a positive learning environment, interesting concepts, and fun\/engaging assignments. The weaknesses were I think mostly due to the virtual asynchronous style of the course; it was difficult to stay engaged at some points especially when there was a lot of reading for just two short lectures a week.",
                "The biggest strength of this course were the assigned readings and responses. The main weakness of this course was the recorded lecture format because it was difficult to remain engaged with the course overall and I found myself relying solely on discussion sections for engagement.",
                "Strengths: everything! The course is interesting and the classroom environment, despite it being online, produced engaging and thoughtful discussions about education. Weaknesses: the only weakness was that the recorded lectures made it more challenging to connect with the instructor, which just means you have to put more effort into doing that.",
                "The course is extremely well-organized, and the instructor hosting weekly small lunches really served well to foster a sense of community.",
                "Strengths: Recorded lectures were easy to follow and helped elucidate themes in the readings, live Q+A\/lunchtime sessions helped us connect with the professor outside of lecture time, assignment formats were interesting, Dr Debs was an engaging lecturer, readings were almost always fascinating and relevant\/important\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion posts got unwieldy as people posted much longer posts than suggested (stronger clarification and guidelines on these would have helped), discussion sections could be a bit chaotic, assignment feedback was limited\/not detailed",
                "I think the fact that this is a survey course is both a strength and a weakness. It allows the course to cover a range of different issues that appeal to different people's interests but in doing so, attempts to cover so much material in just one semester and makes it difficult to dive into any one topic in-depth. The literature review and creative project however did allow us to write about a topic of our interest. Discussion section also allowed us to talk more about which parts of lecture\/the readings interested us most. \r\n\r\nAnother strength of this course is the sheer amount of material and helpful readings and supplemental links. Professor Debs is clearly knowledgeable and cares a lot about the class and her students' learning. Another strength is the students in the class and the diverse personal experiences and perspectives that everyone brings to section each week. One of the best parts of this class was learning from one another and teaching each other through our own educational experiences and backgrounds. Another strength is the personal essay which allowed me to reflect on my own education and how I think about and define the purpose of education. \r\n\r\nA weakness of the course is that it covers a lot of material and sometimes feels like it rushes through certain topics or leaves certain things out. But that is the reality of a survey course. Some of the readings also felt long and dense.",
                "Strength is the way assignments were graded. I felt as if the grading style was structured in a way that facilitated growth rather than stress. In that way, I was able to learn a lot more content deeply than if priorities in grading were different.\r\n\r\nWeakness is that discussions were not always deepening my understanding of the content."

It would have helped if the Q&A sessions rotated so that people who had conflicts at that specific time could have gotten the chance to engage in more thoughtful discussions.",
                "The course was well adjusted for COVID-19. Professor Debs really made sure the class was easily translatable to an online format.",
                "the recorded lecture format promoted helpful flexibility and I also enjoyed  the in-person section. I also very much appreciated the flexibility with deadlines during the pandemic",
                "the asychronous lectures were amazing. I loved that Dr. Debs also provided a podcast version of the lecture. I feel like the structure of this class really showed how much Dr. Debs cared and understood the insaneness of this pandemic.",
                "Learning was great. The only downfall to the format was the lack of community among students since it was such a big class and my section had tons of people. However, the weekly lunches\/office hours were probably helpful -- I was never able to attend because I had a standing appointment then.",
                "Rather than attend an online lecture, the professor recorded the lectures ahead of time and gave students the option to watch or listen to them on their own time. The recorded lectures were very helpful and created a lot of flexibility for students who are already stressed out by other classes or by things outside of school. However, this made it a little more challenging to engage with the course since I often felt isolated from the professor. The professor does offer lunch time office hours, but this often interfered with my other courses, preventing me from ever attending them.",
                "The recorded lectures were super helpful, as they were very flexible. For the most part, there seemed to be consideration for the time we are in. I also appreciated the openness to student feedback and critique.",
                "I think the asynchronous component was really helpful when scheduling otherwise was hectic. I think everyone in the education studies community was very willing to create the kind of atmosphere where people could get to know each other in whatever capacity they are able to. However, I do think the restrictive extension policy was ironic and insensitive.",
                "The audio recordings and moments of calm were so appreciated. Dr. Debs made every effort to organize everything in modules and make learning easier. The best class by far this semester in terms of adapting to the online format.",
                "Structuring meditation time into the recorded lectures! Very organized powerpoints in the lectures! 50 minute discussion section instead of an obnoxiously long one!",
                "Lectures were pre-recorded and shorter, which was so so nice. Dr. Debs and the TAs were very understanding about giving extensions and provided lots of guidance on assignments. The camera optional policy in section was nice and I also liked the live office hours that Debs hosted, which enabled students to meet other students.",
                "Professor Debs did a great job of making this course accessible to students in all time zones while also hosting many forms of office hours for students who wanted to meet in real time. The discussion sections were very nice supplements to the pre-recorded lectures as well.",
                "It was really great that the prerecorded lectures were rarely over the original allotted amount of time for the class. It felt like Dr. Debs and the TFs were very respectful of our time and other commitments this semester.",
                "I thought the the moment of calms were really good and helped to humanize it. Something that I thought could be improved is maybe if we listened more to podcasts than read, as we were doing so much reading already.",
                "The COVID adaptations worked really well, including some of the deadline flexibility, recorded lectures, required section, and the option to show up for live office hours\/Q&A sessions",
                "The instructor was very understanding about deadlines, which was helpful. I though breakout rooms were used well in discussion section (I had Rachel), especially how they were used at the beginning of the class to get people's brains active. I felt neither here nor there about the lectures being asynchronous, but I did find them harder to engage with. I also really enjoyed the occasional live virtual events towards the end of the course.",
                "recorded lecture accompanied by short quizzes would have helped, for accountability",
                "The minute of calm was unexpectedly nice. I liked the lecture formats and the modules were well organized.",
                "I felt that the class was very flexible and offered a great mix of support and individual pacing, but sometimes I wished I had more opportunity to connect with peers who couldn't make it to the office hours\/lunches.",
                "All of them were very successfulDr. Debs cares deeply about the well-being of her students and does a lot to ensure we get the most out of the course in a way that doesn't overwhelm us. The short lectures were great and really easy to digest, almost like listening to story or podcast. The live session with Dr.Debs were wonderful opportunities to get to talk with her topics she knows so much about and have honest conversations about some difficult topics.",
                "It was challenging to stay engaged with the prerecorded lectures although I did appreciate the flexibility.",
                "The recorded lecture format was a point of difficulty for me, but it was helpful when the professor changed the view so that their face was a part of the screen. I thought that virtual discussion sections, especially the ones that were structured, went well and were helpful in understanding course material.",
                "Success: recorded lectures allowed people to view and review lectures at any time. Possible improvement: I think it would have been convenient for students to have access to a script of the recorded lectures (other courses have the transcript of the speech from the video on canvas and this allows students to search the videos for keywords, definitions, examples, etc.)",
                "The small lunches and moments of calm were terrific.",
                "Asynchronous lectures and live section plus the live Q&A and thursday lunches with the professor were a really great balance of everything. There were opportunities to get to know the professor outside of lecture, participate in discussion, but also the lectures were asynchronous so that we could watch or listen to lecture in our own time.",
                "This was the best organised Canvas class page I've had, all Professors should take a look at this page for inspiration. The readings, lectures, discussion section posts and more were organised by week so it was easy to locate everything each week. Dr Debs was also the most readily available professor I have had in an online class, providing many opportunities to talk with her and ask questions",
                "The recorded lectures were helpful because it allowed me to go back and rewatch parts of lectures to better understand the material. It required more self-motivation to stay on top of lectures and stay on track, though. Virtual discussion section seemed to work well. Our TF helped create a welcoming and supportive environment where people could speak up and participate. Having breakout rooms sometimes in section was also helpful because it allowed us to get to know each other better and talk in smaller group settings.\r\n\r\nProfessor Debs also hosted a weekly Q&A session that I think was helpful and allowed students to ask specific questions and explore topics more in-depth in smaller groups.",
                "A huge help for me was that Dr. Debs put up audio files of lectures in addition to slides & video recording. Not only did it give me a break from the abundance of screens we had this COVID semester, but it also allowed me to engage the kinesthetic learner in me, as Id move my body on walks while engaging with the information and retained the info more than the regular classroom."

                "If you are interested in learning anything about education systems, pedagogies, or simply want to understand your own educational path, I suggest this class.",
                "Absolutely! I would recommend it for anyone who slightly interested because the breadth of the topics covered allows for students to focus in on topics that closely relate to their interests without sacrificing the  wealth of topics covered. Dr. Debs is a great instructor as well and shares great advice and knowledge from her extensive expertise and field of research.",
                "yes, i think every student could relate to something that's taught in this course and learn something new",
                "If you are interested in education, I would!",
                "Yes!",
                "YES! take this course if you have any interest in education whatsoever. I learned so much from this class about education and I got to read so many amazing books and articles and really look at my education from a different perspective",
                "Yes. Every Yale student should take this class. In fact, every American should take this class. We learn very important concepts about the US education system, and Dr. Debs is a fabulous resource.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It's a class that makes you think critically about your educational experience and how education in general should be improved for the next generation of students.",
                "Yes! Even if you are not planning to go into education, I think the information is something that everyone should know.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in education, this is definitely a helpful class to begin processing the complexity of the education system and your experiences. It's incredibly relevant and applicable! I also think the assignments (i.e lit review, classroom observation) served as helpful exposure to what working in education could entail.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! If you are at all interested in understanding the education system in America, this course is an excellent place to start. The texts are all amazingsuper interesting and different. You get the opportunity to critically reflect on your educational experiences and what those experiences should be.",
                "Absolutely I would, but with some caveats: First, you must be willing to move from topic to topic quickly; second, you must be somewhat interested in education, because there are a lot of readings and you have to motivate yourself to do them; and third, you have to have an open mind and be a good listener--people in section always have great things to share, but you must be attentive to them.",
                "Yes, this is a great foundational course if you're interested in any aspect of Education",
                "Yes, I would! Definitely take this course if you are interested in education. It has really changed the way I see education and myself as a student.",
                "I would highly recommend this class to another student. The readings are really interesting, but not overwhelming, and you can understand the lectures even if you miss a few of the readings. Professor Debs is really understanding and seemed to be genuinely interested in engaging with students. My biggest complaint though was that we were learning about education, but the class didn't feel very different from my other courses. I don't know that the course was set up for much of the deeper or higher impact learning we were reading about. The classroom hierarchy was still very present and grading still took a prominent place in feedback, which was all a little disappointing.",
                "Yes this is a great intro to education.",
                "Yes! regardless of whether or not you're into education, I saw this information, as an econ major, widely applicable",
                "Yes! If youre interested in education, this is a great way to see what the different areas within education are.",
                "Yes! I think that the self reflection (and reflection in general ) that is developed throughout the class is imperative for students to understand their role in the educational sphere that they interact with on a daily basis.",
                "Yes! Professor Debs is super sweet and supportive of everyone's education related interests!",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in teaching or entering the field of education, especially if they are doing the EDST certificate or pathway. Even if they are not, it is a low stress course and Professor Debs is very relaxing and kind.",
                "The material learned from this course is very valuable and interesting, especially if you want to learn how education may affect other aspects of society. The professor was very kind and discussion was great. However, it can be hard to remain engaged with the course as it stands, so what you get out of the course is very dependent on what you put into it.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning more about education policy, teaching, or the education system as a whole. The course is informative and what you learn can be applied to your education experience no matter where you are from or what type of schooling you received.",
                "Yes. This course reveals much about how education has evolved in the U.S. and prepares participants to think more carefully about the kinds of education \"reform\" we want to support.",
                "Yes if you want to learn a broad overview of a lot of topics in education (like an introduction) and then see if you want to take more courses that are more specific education topics. I will say you get out of the course what you put in. And If you plan to be an education studies scholar, this course is required and crucial for the program.",
                "I would recommend this for any students interested in working in education whether as a teacher, policymaker or more. I would also recommend this to anyone who is frustrated with any aspect of education as it offers many insights into why this is the case or what can be done about it!!",
                "Yes! If you want an overview of education and how the system works and operates today and in history, then definitely take this course. If you're interested in education, teaching as a career, or just reflecting on your own education, this course is for you. Taking this as a senior especially allowed me to look back and think about the purpose and value of my education. Section depends on your TF, but lectures are informative and because they were recorded, in-person would probably be even more engaging.",
