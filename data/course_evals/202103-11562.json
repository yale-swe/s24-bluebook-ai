                "The strengths of the course are how helpful the professor has been. I enjoyed his teaching style and how he made sure we all understood the new content in class. Also, I think the syllabus made sense and was a logical process throughout the semester. Some weaknesses were the group projects which were sometimes tedious.",
                "The course is a lot of work  theres extensive daily homework and its easy to fall behind quickly. But all the work means that you are able to accomplish a lot in just a semester.",
                "There should be more in class lessons. Most of the lessons were from a video from the homework. It might be more helpful if the instructor teaches it or at least goes over the homework.",
                "The workload in this course is quite overwhelming, and at times, it felt like this course's homework was more about completion than about understanding. Additionally, there was a very noticeable gap of understanding and experience between students who had taken Spanish previously and students who were just being introduced to Spanish, and I feel like this should have been addressed instead of ignored; not everyone in the class was on the same level. This made it more difficult to give certain students the attention they need, and led to variation in how long it took students to complete tests, overall grades, the effort put in towards the class, etc. Despite the fact that some students worked harder than others, they had a harder time doing well than their peers who have already taken years of Spanish. I feel like this is something that should really be considered in the future. In terms of strengths, the professor was great and engaged with the students. Additionally, it was clear that a lot of thought and effort was put into developing the Spanish curriculum, and despite the fact that there is a lot of material to get through, it was delivered in an organized and straightforward fashion."

                "I would recommend this course because I definitely think that they would learn a lot of valuable information. As long as the student learns to set aside a certain amount of time per day towards this course and remains consistent with their studying habits, I think they would get a lot out of the class."
