                "There was a lot of content which was interesting but meant that the exams cover a lot; considering there was only 50 minutes for each exam and the structure was not exactly clear the first time, it was very difficult to figure out what to actually be prepared for/know in depth and what to move past.",
                "The material of this course was very interesting. In terms of the reading, it didn't make sense to have us read so many calculation formulas in the textbook that we would never apply or be tested on (with the exception of very few). Additionally, the Final Research Project for this course did not compliment what we were learning.",
                "A great weakness is the textbook. It expresses many racist (especially Orientalist), classist, and U.S.-centric positions. On the other hand, the class itself is not so much like that, and I appreciate how we were allowed to integrate our understanding of those problems into our discussions, but the textbook is really a poor choice that doesn't reflect the class environment.",
                "Discussion Section is very engaging and insightful. Lecture is interactive, which is conducive to learning",
                "This course sometimes felt a little slow but the topics themselves  particularly the assigned readings  were very interesting.",
                "A strength is the accessibility of Professor Zang and the TAs.",
                "Strengths: responsive TAs, interesting readings, engaging discussions\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of information about expectations for the course, sometimes disengaging lectures",
                "The textbook is incredibly outdated and overtly racist/prejudiced in many different ways. We didn't use it that much, and we didn't really talk about its biases in class. \r\nClass work was really fast-paced and we covered a lot of topics in demography without a high degree of specificity/elaboration. It just ended up being mostly memorization (esp. for the calculations).",
                "Strengths: Even though the class was a lecture, it felt more like a seminar. During lecture, Professor Zang asked questions and students answered, and Professor Zang always periodically paused to ask if anyone had questions. The workload wasn't bad and exams weren't graded harshly. Professor Zang is probably the course's biggest asset. She's super approachable and understanding, always has a great attitude, and is willing to accommodate students to make sure they succeed and truly understand the material.\r\nWeaknesses: Watch out for the 20 page final paper. Not that it's a necessarily difficult assignment, but 20 pages can be a real headache around finals time."
