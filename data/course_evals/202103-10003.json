            "comments": [
                "I liked the pace of the material, however it was challenging at times to keep up. \r\nI wished the format was reversed and the homework practice came AFTER the lecture - I felt so dumb trying to work my way through instructions we hadn't talked about yet.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Antle is great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: grade is tough to figure out, hard to know whether to take the optional final\/the odds that it will improve your grade",
                "The strengths of this course are that it is relatively relaxed and has a grading system that would be appealing to some people. The weaknesses are that just doing the homework is not enough to really learn the material and it is easy to fall behind as a result.",
                "Strengths: Rick outlines this course very well and makes learning and feedback fun and easy \r\nWeakness: The course felt very unorganized without a true syllabus outlining upcoming assignments and such. Got a sort of accurate syllabus about half-way though the semester",
                "The excel assignments that we received were very thorough. They were very useful in getting practice in Excel, and it provided a learning environment where we could get help at any moment on terms or concepts that were confusing. The overall course was well-designed. As long as you go to class and engage with the material, you learn a lot.",
                "From an engagement perspective, the course is actually really interesting. The professor manages to make the usually dry nature of accounting procedures interesting through engaging examples and stories, especially when illustrating what can go wrong and why in the scenarios discussed in the class. For students who have no prior engagement with the subject and will not be pursuing accounting as a career, it is an informative snapshot of the basic principles one should know.\r\n\r\nThe grading structure of the course was fairly unclear for a lot of the semester. I appreciate that the grading method for this course is unusual, and I am not suggesting changing the fundamental structure, but I would strongly suggest ensuring that homeworks are posted well in advance of their due dates, and ensuring that assignments posted to canvas are the ones that are required and for which it is possible to submit something. The emphasis in this course is on how well one has learned the material by the end of the semester, which is great, but it was frankly obscured by the syllabus\/canvas assignment structure, and timing of homework assignment.",
                "Rick provides a wealth of information on Canvas that really supports student learning. The assignments forced me to practice different skills until I felt comfortable with them, and I always felt like I could ask questions through the online message board or find the answers on Canvas or in recorded lectures. However, Rick gets a bit off topic in lectures and sometimes I got lost.",
                "Strengths: if you do the optional final, you end up really understanding the basics of accounting \r\nweaknesses: it would be easy to not engage fully with the material given the grading system of the course and the automatic feedback in the problem sets",
                "Sometimes it was hard to follow along, but the professor was always available to answer questions which was great",
                "Weekly homework was helpful and the excel format was very helpful to correct ourselves. Less verbal explanations and more in class solving of problems is needed.",
                "Needs to go more in depth with general accounting principles. Seems a little out of touch with practical accounting knowledge and too absorbed with the YALEIE.",
                "Dr. Antle is a great professor and does an incredible job of incorporating real-world examples into lectures so that it doesn't feel like useless information that we're being fed. We didn't get much heads up on when assignments were released, so it was at the student's behest that they completed assignments on time. However, all assignments had feedback embedded into them, so if you made a mistake you could work your way through it because it was highlighted, rather than doing an assignment completely wrong with no indication of doing so.",
                "Strengths:  Prof. Antle is awesome.  A great teacher and entertaining lecturer who made getting up early for class worth it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 8:45 AM lecture at the SOM made this class attractive to skip, especially with recorded lectures, though I was always happy when I attended.",
                "It was sometimes challenging to understand what the main learning points Professor Antle was stressing.",
                "8:45am at SOM is a huge negative. I'm surprised anyone went to class after the first couple of weeks. Rick Antle is also just the GOAT. He is really funny, but the class is really pretty slow at times. What is helpful though, is that the homework is a good tutor, you can learn a lot from just doing the homework",
                "The material is presented very logically, and in a good order. The homework problems are fairly easy, since most of the time there is a checkbox where you can see if your answer is correct or not. As a tool for helping to learn how the statements are filled out, I actually think this is a great idea. I feel like I learned a lot both from lectures and from doing the homework. I will say, however, that sometimes in the middle of the semester the classes devolved into going over the homework, and as I didn't have trouble with the homework they were mostly useless for me, but I still enjoyed them and came to them.",
                "strength - Prof. Antle is a great teacher. He is very friendly. The excel tool used for this class is fantastic. This tool gives clear feedback and makes learning easy.\r\n\r\nWeakness - Sometimes, the recorded lectures were not immediately posted on canvas. A few lectures were not posted until 3-4 days after the lecture.",
                "It's very early in the morning. Tough to get to class sometimes.",
                "The Professor is a strength of the course as he is very enthusiastic about the curriculum. A weakness of the class is the lack of feedback from weekly quizzes and assignments.",
                "Dr. Antle is an awesome guy, and he made accounting engaging. It wouldve been cool to have maybe a week or two of work on valuation, but as far as accounting goes the class was pretty solid as an intro.",
                "Professor Antle was friendly and a good lecturer but the assignments were a bit monotonous at times.",
                "This course was taught in a very well manner but the daily work was a bit much",
                "The strengths of the course were the excel worksheets \/ workbooks that helped prepare and teach a lot of the material. It was great to learn by trial and error. Weaknesses were that much of the technical jargon would be difficult to fully understand alone or without previous knowledge of what some terms might mean.",
                "Strengths - great professor (he's the best), relevant \/ hands on material \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - class is way too early considering it's in the SOM. Sort of mitigated by classes being posted online, but still would prefer later class time \/ closer to campus. You also have to really work to stay engaged in the class because of this -- really easy to start missing classes because it is so far away \/ early",
                "Teach the class properly.",
                "A course that I enjoyed, can't identify a weakness. Strength was how much the p sets on excel helped my understanding of the material.",
                "The biggest weakness of the course is that Yale constrains classes to fit into semesters. I had taken a eight (8) hour online accounting class through Coursera taught by a Wharton professor, and I got more out of it than this semester long class. That class cost $70. I was hoping to learn some new stuff given the length. I feel like college education is in peril, and the failures of this class are emblematic of the cause. One, I can access the best teachers (not necessarily professors) in the world online for much cheaper (e.g. MIT posts lectures for free and Yale has worse STEM so why even bother). Two, I can engage with smart people online. I don't need to physically be (or virtually) in the Yale community to engage with bright people. Three, the semester, two day a week class system is constrained so that teaching and syllabus must fit to it; the material cannot dictate how it needs to be taught.\r\n\r\nProfessor for ACCT 270 had some good anecdotes, but seemed to drag the class on for no reason other than to fill the semester. There was no feedback on assignments. For some reason the final was on material that had never been taught the entire semester -- sifting through 10Ks. I wouldn't construct a class that way.",
                "The course is really great, and the professor really engaging. The homework grading process is slightly unclear but overall it is a good course. Could be difficult to keep up with and stay on track with at times.",
                "Not having a syllabus until half way through the semester and never knowing quite when we had homework and when we didn't made it really challenging to stay on top of the work and understnad what was expected of me. This made it hard to meaningfully engage with the material."

                "Take this course if you want to learn how to use Excel or if you think that finance is an industry you want to enter -- it's great for learning how to construct cash flows and to assess financial statements. This course will not teach you anything about personal finances that you cannot learn through a 5 minute YouTube video.",

                "Yes if you've never exposed to accounting before.",
                "I would, accounting is a very important skill. Even being able to read and understand a 10-k is super important in any form of business. It's an easy grade, I really recommend taking it",
                "Sure. This is a pretty low commitment course that will introduce you to Excel shortcuts and teach you how to read financial statements\/balance sheets. This is one of the more applied classes available to Yale undergraduates, and Rick treats you like you're an MBA student. You feel like one too once the actual accounting part of the course begins, since you're reading real company statements and filling out accounting journals based on real company situations. Most of the class is plugging in numbers on Excel, and there isn't much of a discussion outlet or room for super creative problem-solving. Still, if you plan to go into finance and\/or want a better understanding of what all the jargon on financial statements mean, this class would be a good choice.",
                "If you're interested in this sort of work I would absolutely recommend. Also, if you are an econ major struggling to find passion in something, as I was, this class could also be for you! It convinced me to pursue accounting after graduation.",

                "I would! I think financial knowledge (especially accounting) is a great life skill for everyone. This works great as a fifth class to give you a real life skill. Additionally, one concern I had was I had already taken the class Financial Economics, and there was initially a lot of overlap. However, as the course dives deeper into income statements, the course material separates from the of Financial Economics (basically saying the first month overlaps, the rest of the course does not).",
