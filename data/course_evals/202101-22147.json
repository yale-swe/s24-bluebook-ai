This course provides you a lot of fascinating results, thoughts and methods of theoretical statistics, but how much you actually got depended on how much time contribution you would like to have for it.",

Professor Zhou uses simple examples to introduce and prove results, which make them much easier to understand than other textbooks/papers. His lectures are also paced well, and he pauses often to make sure everyone understands the material. The workload is also very reasonable (we had 6 homework assignments that were 1 question each and could be submitted up until the end of the semester). The homework helped us solidify our understanding from the lecture and gave us practice with certain calculations.",
                "As a student not as rehearsed in theoretical statistics I liked the forgiving pace of the lecture and how the professor stops and makes sure that every one of his students understands what is happening before moving forward."
