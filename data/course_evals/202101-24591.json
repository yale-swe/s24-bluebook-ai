Some of the classes get to be a bit long, and there are a decent amount of readings, but it is such a fascinating class. I couldn't say enough positive things about Professor Ford; he has so many amazing stories to tell that make the class really worthwhile and different from any other class that I have ever taken at Yale.",
                "Yes this is a great class",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student at Yale, especially if they are a Senior who has never taken a Residential College seminar. Not only does this course look thoroughly at the \"Trials of the Century\", but it is also a great opportunity to learn about basic legal proceedings in the courtroom. While there were pre-Law students who knew more about the justice system, Professor Ford did a wonderful job of explaining this legal jargon to those who were unfamiliar. This course exceeded all expectations I had going into my final semester. I would definitely recommend this course to any and all students to try and take before they graduate from Yale!",

                "10000000000% it is the best class I have taken at Yale. Professor Ford is so awesome, knowledgeable, and personable. If you are lucky enough to get a spot in this class absolutely take it"
