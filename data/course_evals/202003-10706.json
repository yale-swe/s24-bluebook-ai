                "Because the lectures were recorded and asynchronous it was easy to fall behind and also a bit difficult to get to know the professors. Either way, JDRS was funny and engaging so the class was good overall. I believe the class overall can be improved by having a synchronous component to the class to hold students accountable in some way.",

                "The course was structured really well. I have never taken a statistics course or even chapter before and I was able to understand and follow all the material really well due to the structure of the course",
                "This class did a good job explaining all of the necessary material. I was able to grasp everything and do the problem sets easily for the most part. In terms of how the class was run, there weren't really any weak points.",
                "Strengths: you learn through hands-on handling of datasets\r\nWeaknesses: if you want to learn more advanced stuff, you have to take intiative to do it since this class is an intro class. Not necessarily a weakness.",
                "I thought that the course was super informative and helpful for improving my statistics understanding. However, I thought there were times when the class moved a little quickly. There were times when material on tests were only briefly addressed in lecture. Moreover, there were many times when the amount of recorded lecture time exceeded the alotted class time. Sometimes these overtime lecture, combined with the density of class material, made it hard to keep up.",
                "Liked how you could complete it on your own time; very organized weekly modules",
                "The course was very well paced and allowed for much exploration through its p-sets.",
                "Strengths: JDRS and the overall organization. This was hands-down the cleanest Canvas page I've ever seen for a course. Truly impressive. All of the material was organized and easy to follow. The lectures were pretty engaging, too. I think the thing I appreciated the most was the emphasis on learning over the grade. No idea how I actually did in the course, but just overall the atmosphere seemed geared toward teaching the main concepts and not nit-picking which was very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Had a couple of homework problems that were graded incorrectly and I didn't catch them until it was too late to go back and ask for a regrade. Things like getting a negative number where the solutions said it should be a positive number, and the only reason for that was switching the order of the inputs. I know it's a minor detail, but it's a bit frustrating to have to re-check the TAs work to make sure that it's fair.",

Given the restrictions though, I do think that JDRS, Professor Khusainova, and all of the TAs made the most of a poor situation. I appreciate the effort that they put in, even if, at the end of the day, watching recorded lectures and going to Zoom office hours just can't replace engaging in person.",

Although I did learn the basic statistics concepts, the R component of the class was really short (two lectures to introduce R and two lectures to learn statistics in R). If your main objective is to learn R, I would recommend to look into other classes. Otherwise, this class is fun and engaging and a low workload with a good grading scheme.",

The expectations are clear, there are tons of office hours if you need help, JDRS is personable and teaches clearly, and the exams\/homework are intended to test the material that you learn. There really aren't any traps here. What you see is what you get. If you're looking for a better understanding of basic statistics or even just a bit more practice, then this course is for you. \r\n\r\nI will say that I struggled sometimes to find time to learn the material, but I think that had more to do with my lecture-watching habits and not being able to engage in person than with any deficiencies in the course or instruction. \r\n\r\nBasically, take it. You'll be fine.",
