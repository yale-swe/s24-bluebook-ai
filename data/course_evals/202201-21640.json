We learned a good deal about infinite products, the gamma and zeta functions (and related functions like the beta function and a couple other L-functions), harmonic functions, the schwarz reflection principal, conformal maps and Christoffel Schwarz, and elliptic curves.  We also talked about some other topics which were less directly related to complex analysis, like differential forms and Riemann surfaces.  Some math courses just teach you math, but others make you a better mathematician.  This course is among the latter.",

                "The course material is incredibly cool, and Goncharov clearly loves it.  He's never bored, even though to him of course what we're learning is elementary.  The psets are fair and reinforce the material, and the midterm is also fair.  This course gives a nice picture of complex analysis and how different problems and fields fit together.   There are very few psets (only 5); this isn't good or bad necessarily, but maybe it's worth taking into account if you feel strongly either way about that and are considering the course.",
                "The course has a very good structure. Professor Goncharov has notes that he seems to follow quite closely so that makes the lectures feel ordered. There are a lot of discussions that are spanned off of questions from students and professor Goncharov likes switching things up when they come up naturally in class. The lack of a textbook to reference is a bit difficult when you feel lost in the material but a few classic texts in complex analysis have good portions of what is covered in class.",
                "This was a great course!",
                "Great survey course on advanced concepts in complex analysis that emphasized (mostly) beautiful geometric and arithmetic concepts of complex analysis rather than mechanical calculation."

                "If you're a math major (or maybe even physics) you should take this class. The workload isn't as bad as people make it to be and the exams (while tricky) are manageable. This class will make you a better mathematician and you'll walk out having a better idea of what math as a whole looks like. Professor Goncharov is a great lecturer and you're missing out if you don't take a class with him during your time here. The material of the course is also very beautiful. Professor Goncharov gives great geometric insight to complex analysis which changed the way I viewed the subject between 310 and 315.",
                "Absolutely! It is a beautiful culmination of many fields of math. I do think it helps to take it later on though, since it brings in/touches on ideas from so many fields.",
