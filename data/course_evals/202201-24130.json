Some of the course is designated towards creating drinks for people, which allows you to analyze the drink so minutely to really dive into a person's character, feelings, mood, etc., all while making the process really enjoyable.",
                "I learned so much about seeing culture through food and drink. I evaluate every type of social space and setting I'm in now more critically to think about who designed the space (who is reflected in the space), why it was set up in that way, and what it was meant to convey. I also really appreciated learning more about how my peers connect to food and drink, and how to see American and Caribbean history through the lens of drinks.",

                "I love the two professor dynamic. They bring together the academic side along with the work experience side, all while complementing each other perfectly. Both professors are truly passionate about the subject and it shows through their ability to keep the class engaging and fun. The one weaker part of the course is that sometimes we fall behind/don't get to talk abut everything in detail but this is only because the professors have so much to fit in in such a little time. usually they fall behind because they have so many interesting things to say on the previous topic so its a decent trade off.",
                "Strengths: Super fun and interesting course material. Very clear expectations, solid feedback from the professors, good vibes in the classroom, and the final project and class assignments are so fun!!!! Really great way to end senior year. I also love the relationship that Jessica and John have, and it makes the class extra fun. Last thing is that I felt really seen as a student and person in the classroom and appreciated the welcoming and kind class environment.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Only thing I can think of is that it would be nice to have had a little more facilitated discussion in the class (just a little bit), and I would've been excited if we could've had one more guest speaker (in person) because all of the other guest speakers were sooo good and really brought the course material alive.",
                "I honestly thought it was a great class. There are lots of tangents, but always fun and interesting ones.",
                "This class provides a unique opportunity to receive feedback from two very different people (a philosophy professor and an accomplished bar owner) on a course-long project to plan a cocktail party or bar event around a theme of your choosing. The assignment was actually fun and nothing we did seemed like a waste of time.",
                "Jess and John are very approachable and caring as instructors, its a manageable workload. I do think sometimes the actual instructions for the assignments could be a little clearer, and I also think the profs should consider ways to deliver information outside of lecturing during seminar  it might be unavoidable but worth thinking about if theres a more creative or interactive way to deliver historical info.",
                "discussion topics and readings were great, but class discussions themselves often lacked structure and direction... often walked away from class not having a strong impression of what was discussed. still, it was refreshing to have perspectives from outside academia for a change, some of the guest speakers were engaging",
                "I really liked all of our conversations in this class - they were well mediated and about topics that are super interesting and relevant. John and Jessica have a great dynamic and I really like just hearing what they have to say about various things. The guest lectures were also great, as were a number of the readings. I think an area of improvement would be just facilitating large group discussions / responses earlier in the class time / semester. I think we got there by the end but would have liked that dynamic earlier.",
                "The strengths of this course are the guest speakers, assignments, and class setup.",
                "The content is obviously fascinating. I enjoyed the balance between Jessica providing more historical background while John brought a more practical approach. The course could be improved by having less lecture time and more time dedicated to discussion among the students. I felt like we were really excited to ask questions and give comments/reactions about the material, but had less opportunity to do so than I would have liked."

                "Absolutely, this class was one of my favorite at Yale. The professors are engaging, same goes for the material and the history we learn about. Above that, the course load is very approachable with assignments that are actually interesting and thought provoking. I've only ever had one other class be taught by two professors and that one has nothing on this one. If you can get in, you should take it ,especially if you enjoy drinking alcohol because while it is by no means asked of you to ever drink, it gives you an excuse to expand your palate and make/try new drinks.",
                "Definitely! Professors are quirky and interesting, and they have a fun back-and-forth dynamic. Really helpful feedback is provided on assignments, and they push you to do hard, good work. Fun mix of readings/films/short clips/podcasts and the assignments are very fun. I also appreciated how the professors facilitated a very positive learning environment and cared about us as students and people. Good class to take senior year especially (and with a friend)!",
                "Please take this course! It is one of those rare, fun classes where the professors make you learn in a fun way. They care about your time and apportion assignments throughout the semester such that all of you have to do is put all the pieces together at the end and submit it as your final. All you are doing is designing a hypothetical cocktail party. The professors also made the content relevant to life/social issues.",
                "Would recommend this class for seniors looking for a good fourth/fifth class and who are interested in the history and culture of cocktails. Be advised that this is not a mixology class though, and that classes are more discussion-driven.",
