In this environment, I was able to work on my communication skills through explaining my idea or offering feedback to everyone else. I also learned this through time since we were often limited by it.",

We analyzed films made by prominent filmmakers and tales with them during class in order to gain exposure to a bunch of different filmmaking styles and ways to incorporate archives into documentary and creative films."

                "I didn't see any weaknesses to the course. This course was a truly beacon of light to me - I learned to trust my inner voice, and that the process of making something is what matters - the skill will come along the way.",
                "The strength was that I learned a lot without being too stressed, which is very rare for a class. I was thoroughly engaged, as we mainly held discussions every class and watched many films. My classmates and I were able to open up about our personal lives and be vulnerable.\r\nThe weakness is that I was slightly disconcerted about the appropriateness of the class. There were some films and readings that were inappropriate to me, but that is compared to my own level of sensitivity.",
                "The only weakness I can think of is that the class was quite long considering virtual learning. We usually took 2 breaks which ranged from 5-10 minutes but  I was still usually very tired once we reached halfway, since I also had a seminar beforehand.",
                "The biggest strength was the constant feedback we received not only from our professor and teaching fellow, but also from classmates. Although all of our assignments were individual projects, the class felt very collaborative because of the amount of time we were given to brainstorm with each other during class."

                "It was successful to hold a film class, because screen sharing wasn't too bad and discussions were not greatly hindered. However, the amount of time was a challenge, as it was hard to stare at a screen for three hours. Overall, it was as good as it could be during the pandemic."

                "Yes. We truly undervalue lived experience in our storytelling and this course truly cultivates how one can tell their own story, but also how their story is informed by, and reflective of, greater cultural issues. Also it offers a magnificent shift from the white canon, by offering resources that I wouldn't be able to find, which we all truly need.",
                "Yes, I would. Even if you do not have any experience with filmmaking, that is totally fine. You will have to navigate a lot of the editing parts on your own if you are up to that, but the professor is more concerned about the effort you make to know more about yourself.",
                "Yes! I came in with no filmmaking experience and now am considering it as a new medium to explore. You don't need to know any technical skills. You learn along the way. I recommend it even more for people who don't have filmmaking experience, actually, but who are still interested in the subject matter. You skills will translate and it might open you up to a new passion!",
                "I would highly recommend this class. We watched a lot of amazing films and got to speak with the majority of the filmmakers throughout the course of the semester. I feel like I was given enough space to experiment and develop my filmmaking practice over the course of this semester. I had filmmaking experience before taking this course, but it was definitely not necessary! This class was the first time many of my classmates had ever worked with film, but because of the easygoing and supportive nature of the class (completely fostered by Professor Harris and our tf Lauren) everyone was able to produce three solid videos that we were all proud of by the end of the semester."
