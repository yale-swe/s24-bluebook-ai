                "Minsky is an amazing lecturer who is really passionate about the mathematics that he teaches. Everything about the class was excellent and I always enjoyed coming to class even though it was difficult to understand some days. I do think that sometimes he rushes through some of the material and leaves some of the proofs we do in classes as exercises, but with the level of difficulty of the PSETs I think that it would be helpful if he gave those proofs so I could really have my foundation built up and I could focus on the proofs. On that note, some weeks some of the PSETs were grueling and I could not do some of the problems without the help of the ULA or Minsky in office hours. Not saying he should tone down the difficulty of the questions, but sometimes the techniques we need to use for the PSET problems are not talked about at all in class and basically come out of nowhere, so maybe for some of these questions in class Minsky could give a sort of introduction to the idea of the problem, or a similar problem, and start us off with the solution to help us out. Maybe just in general we could do more examples in class instead of just sort of building up the foundation in class and then having to apply it out of class. But again, the foundation was incredible and we could all eventually get the PSET questions done. This feedback just comes from my frustration spending so much time trying to figure out answers I never would have gotten without some help.",
                "The first couple of problem sets were brutally long (very detail-oriented) and difficult to get right. Too much so in my opinion.\r\n\r\nAlthough the pace of the class generally seemed to follow the book's (Rudin's), there were points where the book didn't seem to help/correspond with class material which was confusing.\r\n\r\nThere were definitely fun problems and interesting approaches highlighted.\r\n\r\nThe midterm structure (reading a 6-page handout and having the midterm be based on filling details for proofs/extending results from that handout) was fun and well-done.",
                "I really enjoyed this course, I thought the material was super interesting and was presented in an engaging way. Given that this is, in many ways, an intro course, I think a bit more guidance on how I was supposed to write Pset proofs, like how much detail to go into, and more of an encouragement to go to office hours (like potentially mandating that we go at least once) might have helped me get my footing more easily.",
                "Strengths: Very intellectually challenging material. Psets very long, but they helped in really grasping the material\r\nWeaknesses: Psets are brutally long, and the take home final was one of the longest and hardest tests I've ever taken",
                "An amazing way of looking at mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe course was fast paced, yet still amazingly elegant and well explained. Yair is sick.\r\n\r\nSometimes some of the Psets are a little random, and more to do with going to office hours for super specific questions than real analysis.",
                "It was a lot of work, but it was rewarding.",
                "I thought this course was great  the material is difficult, but Professor Minsky was an excellent and understanding lecturer.",
                "Strengths: this course was really well taught, and the professor made the material highly engaging. After each lecture, we were given a new, more rigorous, and more insightful perspective on the topic we were learning. Also, the homeworks frequently had very interesting problems and were well written. Additionally, for the midterm, we were given are really cool reading which was then applied during the in class midterm. I thought this was a really fun way to do this because it felt like we were actually learning something new rather than just reciting the information we had learned. Overall, this was a really great course.",
                "Strengths: small class size, lots of office hours, clear and interesting lectures, good published lecture notes. Weaknesses: hugely time-consuming, office hours basically a must, some of the assignments were heartbreakingly difficult.",
                "Strengths: Minsky is such a phenomenal lecturer and creator of psets. The psets bring together a lot of cumulative concepts so the course feels very tied together.\r\nWeaknesses: this is a really hard course. You have to take the time to read Rudin outside of class and preview material to grasp whats going on. And I spent many many hours on homeworks throughout the semester"

                "Yes! It was tough but honestly I feel like if I looked at an basic analysis problem after this course I could solve it quickly because of the level of the difficulty. I do think that sometimes it is overly difficulty but still understanding the difficult problems is kind of cool after the fact that you suffer through them. But with that level of difficulty comes this mathematical maturity where now I can be able to prove some cool things about limits or sequences or derivative or integrals or read a developed mathematical proof including analysis topics and be able to get it quickly.",
                "Yes. Analysis lends itself well to particularly rigorous treatment, and as long as you keep up, you'll learn a ton.",
                "Yes, I thought this was a fascinating course. The material was very interesting and was presented in a very clear way.",
                "This class in this iteration might not be offered again anytime soon but the education in this class was top tier. I am so glad to have learned mathematics and calculus rigorously from two geniuses: Minsky and our ULA Richard Zhou. I realize this will not be relevant to future iterations of the class. The PSETs are weekly and rigorous, often taking between 10-20 hours each week. Some problems were so difficult you basically needed office hours to do again. The midterm and final are also very difficult and the class is full of math geniuses (it's a small class of ~25 kids). You go through calculus again and rigorously derive it. We covered in order: the construction of the real and complex numbers as fields, countability, basic topology, limits, sequences, series, continuity, differentiability (Taylor's theorem and all that fun stuff), the rigorous definition of Reimann-integrability and basic functional analysis. Overall, it was a very rewarding experience but lots of work.",
                "Yes.  The material is pretty interesting, and I learned a lot and improved a lot as a math student.  I found this course quite challenging at times, but it was ultimately a very rewarding experience.  Most importantly, Professor Minsky's lectures were incredibly engaging and clear.  Cannot recommend him as a professor enough.",
                "Definitely, if you're interested in pure math, and want a fast-paced introduction to a core subject",
                "Yes, Professor Minsky is an insanely good professor. I'm truly grateful I had an opportunity to take a class with him. This recommendation is more of Minsky than it is of the class, and it's too bad that he won't be teaching 256 again. Richard, the ULA, was also great",
                "Absolutely, essential for any math major and way more in depth than 255.",
                "I would recommend it to students who are prepared to do a lot of work.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Absolutely. Made me so much better at math and smarter in general.",
                "Absolutely, this course presents an introduction to analysis in a way that's highly engaging. Additionally, the course is challenging but such that it is manageable, I think, as long as you enjoy thinking about the material.",
                "If you love math and are willing to put a lot of time and effort in, take this course. It's rewarding to learn this material, but will take a lot of time.",
                "Yes, so long as theyre committed to putting in many hours of work and struggle. I feel like Ive gained a lot out of this course but at the cost of parts of my mental and physical health over the semester.",
                "It's very rigorous, make sure you know what you're getting into, but it is definitely airtight"
