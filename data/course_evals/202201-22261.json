I also learned how to use some common shop tools (metal and wood-based, including drills, saws of all types, welding, brazing, and angle grinding) as well as how to finish and polish pieces. Finally, I learned how to apply this knowledge to both the casting of organic materials and landscapes as well as the general history of metal casting and current social issues surrounding the craft."

                "Hopefully Covid will not necessitate a Zoom component ever again. this class is fundamentally dependent on in person interactions, community engagement and hands-on learning. Desmond is an invaluable resource and access to resources such as the shop should be more explicitly stated rather than implied. A large strength that you will learn how to think about molds, shop tools and ephemeral installations in novel ways.",
                "This class gave students a lot of freedom and felt like a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I think it was very engaging and allowed us to explore many of the spaces Yale has as well as dictate our own projects.",
                "The class was incredibly engaging and life-changing\r\nIt would be helpful to know a better schedule of the class events further in advance, but that was also understandable because it was a weird semester.",
                "class is very chill and self directed which also means it lacks structure and can be very disorganized",
                "The only weakness of the course is that the learning style (hands-on, lots of in-person exercises) is not compatible with everybody's schedule, and that the grading scheme\/schedule is a little unclear, in part due to how many things Professor Lewis is responsible for. Professor Lewis can also be a little intimidating at first glance. However, besides that, I have nothing but positive things to say about this course, and consider its many strengths to be remarkable. The course, as well as Professor Lewis is accessible to students of all skill levels, a boon rarely available to non-art majors. In addition, while the hands-on learning is not equally easy to all students, it is quite satisfying, and I have never enjoyed learning a skill in a Yale course as much as I have with this one. Overall, the strengths of this course include the uniqueness of the curriculum relative to the rest of Yale, as well as the unique bond students share with each other and the instructors, and I would highly recommend it to anybody."

                "Absolutely; it is the most unique class that you can take at yale. it will change your relationship with materials, objects, and community. the course is what you make of  it is largely dependent on hours spent outside of class time in the shop; if youre willing to put in the work, your perspective on the built world-and its visible and invisible components- will be changed forever.",
                "For sure! This class was amazing. All of the extra hours were so much fun and definitely worth it. I learned so much this semester, and my eyes were opened up to the world of metal casting.",
                "yes",
                "yes! Desmond is great.",
                "yes if you are actually interested! the class isnt \"\"hard\"\" but you will spend many many hours in the shop doing the laborious prep so if you arent genuinely interested and committed it will not be fun",
                "Do you want to learn how to build molds and cast molten metal? Are you self-motivated and don't need too much guidance? Then this class is for you. You will feel like a badass and also add a valuable new skill\/medium to your practice.",
                "I would like to first note that I rated the workload of the course as a \"3.\" However, it would be more accurate to say it is anywhere from 2-5, depending on how much time you spend making your own creations outside of the course. I personally made this course my top priority, and would encourage you to do the same, as you will get far more out of it when you actively seek out help and instruction.\r\n\r\nWith that out of the way, this is the best course I have ever taken in four years at Yale. Professor Lewis is a true supporter and advocate for his students, and has made so many parts of the sculpture shop his top priority that he literally only sleeps for three hours a night. The amount of personal, one-on-one feedback, I have received, both in and out of official class times, is second to none. In addition, as a non-art major, this course was certainly intimidating, and folks that have taken his metal sculpture class certainly had a leg up on me. However, I was able to devote my time to the course in order to catch up, and it is certainly possible to do the same.\r\n\r\nDesmond is incredibly talented in a wide array of fields, and his knowledge about the background of them is delightful and at times moving. Learning firsthand about how his craft intersects with the course material left me at times emotional, and he encouraged us to find similar threads of emotion in our works, from students linking metal roots to their heritage to others spending hours polishing pieces to the perfect finish. This class would not have the passion it did if not for him, and I truly believe there is nobody better for the job.\r\n\r\nThe students in the course likewise bonded, as the class's unique structure more or less confines all your homework to the same location, allowing socializing outside of class. This created a feeling of camaraderie that Yale sections wish they could pull off, and the friendship we made was necessary for coordination in events like the end of class iron pour. That's right, most of the class consists of pouring aluminum and iron. It's super rad.\r\n\r\nWhile I am not sure when this course will be offered again, I strongly encourage you, regardless of skill level, to take any class that Professor Lewis offers, with the caveat that you will enjoy the course the more you put in time for it. As such, it would work better in a four credit semester, although I encourage you to try to fit his courses in regardless. Each and every person, especially those who may feel unwelcome in Yale art's white-dominated space and casting's male-dominated space, should consider taking this course to find like-minded peers. In short Desmond is a remarkably influential individual on my life, and Hidden Truth is truly one of Yale's hidden gems."
