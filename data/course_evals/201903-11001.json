   "comments": [
    "Knowledge \/ Insights: The class is broken into three units -- agroecology, forest habitats, and urban ecology. In each one I was able to gain a basic understanding of the field, their methods, and important research questions, through the breadth of papers that we read. I really enjoyed the labs and learnt a lot about arthropod and tree identification through them.\r\nSkills: How to read and critique scientific research papers. How to conduct basic labs in the field and methods associated with them such as measuring and identifying trees, setting up sampling schemes, identifying potential causal identification issues.",
    "The course covers three main modules in Environmental Science: agroecology, forestry and urban ecology. Skills included basic field experiment methods (arthropod diversity, forest composition and camera trapping), some data analysis, writing of lab reports, and critical consideration of existing literature.",
    "I learned so much in this class!!! I learned how to read, critique, and discuss scientific papers, how to write good lab reports, how to perform field research, and so much about agriculture, forests, and urban ecology.",
    "Learned about challenges in agroecology, forest management, and urban ecology, basic arthropod and tree ID, got experience reading scientific literature of all kinds and discussing it, and writing lab reports.",
    "I can now confidently identify and name many northeastern tree species.",
    "Skills of doing field work",
    "We learned about the scientific process as a whole: including everything from data collection to analysis to publication. Through the lens of multiple units that give a great overall look of the natural environment itself."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: really enjoyed going into the field and the diversity of things we were able to learn about. the overnight field trip to yale myers was especially memorable and one of the highlights of my semester\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the readings felt like a lot (especially during the weeks in October when two of lab reports were due in successive weeks), this sometimes prevented me from reading them in detail to critique the method and statistical analyses.",
    "The field trips are great and definitely help to get a better understanding of the literature - and the challenges and limitations of field science. The class is a significant time commitment, so the discussion session could perhaps be reduced to fifty minutes to cut down a little on overall class time (this might be helpful for students needing to take heavier course loads in the same semester).",
    "I loved the Tuesday discussions because it added another layer to my understanding of the papers we read and the topics we covered. I think all of the assignments are good to help us learn, and the field trips are always good to contextualize what we talk about in class and just good to help us spend time outside, which we don't get the opportunity to do. also the snacks!!!",
    "This course was great! The only small complaint I have is that keeping up with the reading responses every week was difficult given the required length on weeks where lab reports were also due.",
    "Strengths: the labs are extremely immersive and a fun time off campus \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there is not much guidance\/support with the lab reports",
    "Honestly I loved this course. However, the readings were quite long.",
    "I loved the separation of the units and how we were able to dive deeply into many different topics that give a great overall view of the natural environment. I wish we couldve gotten more specific guidelines for the lab reports: maybe submitting a rough draft and a final would have been better."

    "Yes! A fantastic course that is very different from conventional science credits. the course single-handedly made me more aware of my surroundings. Strongly recommend!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, for EVST majors and non-majors alike. Each of the topics covered was equally fascinating (and relevant), and the combination of literature review and field trips allowed for both experiential learning and consideration of the broader implications. Prof. Freidenburg and Meredith are both extremely knowledgeable and very kind and helpful. You definitely do not need prior knowledge of any environmental science to take this course.",
    "yes 100%! this was such an awesome class and one where I could actually feel like I was learning new things week by week. there is work but it's all really interesting and super relevant to the class. just an awesome awesome class I would for sure recommend it!",
    "Take this class! The field trips are super fun, you learn how to identify trees, and you talk about incredibly relevant things like challenges in agriculture and urban ecology. The professor is great and brought us snacks all the time, and she's even changing some of the readings for next year to fit with what the class was interested in (more on indigenous land management practices, for one!). It's not hard: there are readings and reading responses every week and the lab reports will take a little while, but the work was definitely worth it for what I got out of the class.",
    "Absolutely. Having an environmental studies course as a seminar allowed for some awesome relationship building, which made the course very enjoyable. Also, our time on farms and in forests made the material very tangible.",
    "Definitely. I learned a lot and it was super fun going outside all the time.",
    "Yes. I learned immensely about the scientific process as well as the natural world: two things most students should have a baseline understanding of.",
    "Yes! I took this class because I needed a science credit, but I enjoyed it so so much. Rooting the things we were learning in field trips and labs made all the material much more interesting, and we learned how to effectively read scientific papers. And - unlike most science classes - you never need to memorize anything!"
