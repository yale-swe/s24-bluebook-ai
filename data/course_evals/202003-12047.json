Professor Girard's feedback on my essays actually helped me refine my writing, not only grammatically but stylistically. I struggle with writing in a very American style, and her feedback and willingness to go over her comments and suggestions helped me improve my skills when writing in a foreign language. I also learned a lot about the many famous authors we studied, from Marie de France, to Balzac and Hugo, from Baudelaire to Perec, to de Beauvoir and Houellebecq. It was truly a survey in every sense of the word; we started from the very beginnings and made it the modern day. I feel like I got a taste of so much of what there is to offer in (and outside) of the French literary canon."

                "The lessons were extremely informative and very well-structured. I always enjoyed the discussions that followed.",
                "The selection of literature was fantastic. We covered many of the heavy-hitters but also covered works and authors I wasn't expecting us to cover, which was refreshing. The reading questions and discussions were geared well to help me understand the texts. I also really liked the essay prompts and presentation assignments, which struck the right balance between open-endedness and limitation. The comments on our writing and the ability to turn in revisions of our work were also excellent, as well as the personal meetings on the second essay. Readings were sometimes quite long, and I noticed that the energy of some discussions suffered from our lacking time to focus on the passages in detail.",
                "Strengths: Professor Girard is brilliant, hands down. She knows so much about French, French literature, French art, and she so passionately imbues that into her students. Each and every class she had a PowerPoint which was accompanied by a brilliant lecture. She had so much to say that it would often bleed over after the designated conclusion of the class; while for some that would be a negative thing, it was just further evidence of how much she loved teaching the material. The assignments are incredibly manageable, and aside from a couple of lengthier readings (like Balzac's Le colonel Chabert) the reading load was never too hefty; she also made every reading electronically accessible via PDF, so no purchases were necessary whatsoever. Her feedback was incredible, too. I've never received so much feedback on an essay, and she was more than happy to sit and talk for hours at length about your writing and its various nuances, in addition to the content of the class. While this class had much less discussion that I had expected, it's a quirk of the class. You get to hear from the best of the best, and just listen and soak it all in. There are a few times where you can speak, and of course you can ask questions. But no pressure if you're a little shy when it comes to speaking. Classes were recorded, too, so if you had to miss class it was okay! She gave feedback on exposs, too -- not only on style but also on grammar. Maybe some will say she's a little blunt, but mistakes are mistakes. This is the \"langue de Molire\" after all, so we should be speaking and writing it properly.\r\nI'd never heard of some of the authors we read, and they were incredible. Alfred Jarry's Ubu Roi is a great addition\/complement to the Trump era of politics, and Le colonel Chabert is a great reading to just think about life, status. The philosophical texts chosen, like Micromgas, or Rousseau, were actually really interesting. Tartuffe was a really great play, and while it might not be Molire's best, it was a joy to read. The more modern work was equally as enjoyable to read, like Perec and Houellebecq. Maybe there should be a few more women included on the syllabus, and it would be nice to read more full-length novels or novellas, as most of the class is drawn upon excerpts (save for Balzac, Flaubert, Molire) and I'd have loved to have gotten to read longer works of the French canon, but this, again, was a fantastic survey.\r\nWeaknesses: Technology is certainly a hurdle from Professor Girard. I feel like I know her husband as much as I know her, because he came to class and helped her with tech issues. However, this isn't really that much of a weakness at all, because none of the tech issues really impeded the learning experience. I will say, however, that the lack of discussion provided little incentive for some members of the class to be particularly engaged in the class at all, either for lack of comprehension or some other reason, but there's no way for me to really tell. Lectures could go on and on, bleeding into the next class period for some, so if that's a concern, make sure you speak up and let her know the time. Sometimes we'd even go 25 minutes over (but it's worth it!) so just be cautious. The first two essays are prompt-driven, while the final essay is open-ended; I think I would've preferred a similar set of prompts rather than having to come up with something on my own. And the expos seems a little pointless, unless it's just intended for speaking practice; it was on any topic of your choosing related to French culture, so it didn't even need to be tangentially related to French literature, which was a little surprising to me."

                "Because we're online already, it's a little tiring to have a stream of lecture only from Professor Girard the entire class period. There really is little discussion in the class, it's far more professor-led than most other literature classes you'll take at Yale. But that's just her style. Every class was recorded, and attendance was not mandatory, but very much encouraged. I only ever had to miss class once, but she was incredibly flexible; on the syllabus it said she would work out a way for you get your participation in if you had to miss because of unforeseen circumstances. All materials were made easily accessible online and for free (!) so it alleviated the financial burden of purchasing any reading material. Even the movie we watched was free of charge, which was great, too. Office hours are always variable, but given the online situation, Professor Girard (as did we) had more flexibility, and I got to spend two hours chatting with her about my essay and the class itself, which is incredible, especially in the ~times of Zoom.~ Everything was really great, except for the constant stream of lecturing. But she really did a wonderful job, especially given that technology seemed to be a great challenge for her. I can't wait for the day that I get to meet her in person."

                "Definitely. You get a surprisingly deep sense of many aspects and centuries of French literature, without any bias or overemphasis on any one facet. This course will expand your abilities to read and write in French. Also, to be clear, \"French\" literature refers primarily to the literature of France (the curriculum doesn't delve far into the broader Francophone world).",
                "I would 100% recommend this class to another student, with the caveat that your French MUST BE UP TO PAR. Professor Girard is fantastic, and it's a privilege to take a class with her. Her knowledge is immense, so definitely take this class! I love French and French literature, so maybe I'm a little biased already, but this is an awesome class, with wonderfully thought-provoking readings and an equally caring professor.\r\nReading in French can be difficult, and I still have to look up words and sentences, especially in the denser stuff, especially with Flaubert. But if you can't understand the majority of the readings, or at least grasp the context or baseline details, then reevaluate your French proficiency. If you can't confidently answer a question as simply as \"did you like the reading\" without some level of comfort or grammatical accuracy, you might not be ready for this class. You must be able to write, read, and speak French at a relatively high level, and my class had a mix of levels, which left me questioning the requisite proficiency of my peers. It was to the detriment of the class experience that half of my 6 person class had people who had difficulty with some of the easier (subjectively) readings, and didn't provoke much engaging discussion, especially given the already limited discussion time in class itself. The writing assignments in this class aren't that tricky; it's two short essay of about 3-5 pages, and one longer essay for a final. Then you have spoken expos of about ten minutes, and then just do the readings and come to class. This class shouldn't be a burden, and if you really want a taste for a little of everything that French literature has to offer, this a wonderful class."
