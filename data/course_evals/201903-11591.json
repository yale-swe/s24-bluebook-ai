    "Not much",
    "I think that I have a better grasp of the American political party system after taking this course. I don't think I'm an expert by any means, but I learned more about politics in this class.",
    "I learned a lot about political parties in the American system.",
    "I learned about political parties and the system of parties in the US.",
    "I learned about the history of parties and strengths and weaknesses of parties. I also learned about gerrymandering and other political tactics",
    "Intro Polysci course focusing on the roles of political parties in American politics.",
    "A familiarity with political parties, and more generally, political theory. Worked with spatial models and median voter theorem. Nothing in the class is too mind-blowing.",
    "Learned some decently useful stuff about the American political system. Worth taking for anybody. Gives a solid foundation in civic understanding.",
    "I learned a lot about the foundations of the American political system.",
    "Developed skills for understanding party dynamics in the us political system - as well as how parties interact with american politics",
    "I learned much about the political institutions and party systems in American politics.",
    "I learned not only a lot about the American political system and its functioning and theories about it but also how to think and talk about it.",
    "I did learn more about the American Political System and how the two party system works."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "the TA grading was incredibly unfair, nit-picky, and frustrating.",
    "I think the main weakness of this course was the time limit for the exams. I think that they were too long and there was never enough time to complete them. A strength would be the sections because I felt like they were a good supplement to the lecture. The TAs did a good job in going over the lecture material and making sure we understood.",
    "Lectures were interesting but the amount of reading assigned felt impossible to keep up with.",
    "Very well taught. Good organization.",
    "Strengths: Interesting course material, manageable workload\r\nWeaknesses: Unnecessary readings, long exams with little time to complete them",
    "Strengths: section, exams, online lecture slides \r\nWeaknesses: none I enjoyed this course",
    "The readings were way too long and not particularly useful in learning the concepts. Much of the information taught felt fairly obvious and not particularly enlightening. This course would be better taught as a seminar at a higher level.",
    "For strengths, I liked how the exams were structured and thought Professor Henderson was approachable. To improve the course, Id make the course more challenging, or at least cover more nuanced material. For example, I found the latter half of the course (in polarization, party transformations and spatial modeling) to be more interesting than the relatively generic stuff covered for the first third of the class. For a class like this, more detail is what would make it more interesting. The expectations for reading are also unreasonable considering they are never brought up, tested, and barely discussed in section.",
    "Strengths: lectures are pretty engaging, not too much work\r\nWeaknesses: absurd\/unreasonable amount of reading, tough time crunch on exams",
    "The strengths are that if you go to class, the content is understandable. The TAs are also always available for help.",
    "Amazing course",
    "The course does a good job of explaining why parties function as they do and what motivates them to undertake certain decisions.",
    "The lectures and content were great but I wish Henderson would at least seem a little more enthusiastic and I wish there wouldve been more opportunities for feedback from him.",
    "I did not like the sections or the exams in this class. I did like the structure of the lectures."

    "NO.",

    "Yes, if you are interested in political science, especially in domestic politics.",
    "Yes, but only if you have the time and energy for it. You get out of this class what you put into it.",
    "Yes great class!",
    "Yes, its an easy social science credit and if youre in the political science major this class will be easy for you.",
    "Yes, but only as a fifth class unless the material is developed further. Some parts of this class for me felt like a little bit of a waste of time.",
    "Yeah. Not the greatest class youll ever take, but you learn some useful\/important stuff and arent swamped with work.",
    "Yes, I found the content very interesting and engaging. I enjoyed going to class every day.",
    "Yes. The course was very informative and well structured",
    "I would recommend this course as it gives both a historical and modern view of the challenges and advantages of the American political system.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to students looking for basic knowledge about the American political system.",
    "I would recommend it but I'd properly inform them about the exams."
