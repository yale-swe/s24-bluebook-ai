   "comments": [
    "I gained a basic overview of several different Indigenous lifeways and spatialities. The syllabus has some amazing Indigenous scholars (especially women), so I got the most out of the course by thoroughly reading.",
    "A more in-depth understanding of Indigenous Geographies and Indigenous interactions with place and community.",
    "I learned more about the theoretical conceptions of space. It was complicated, but it now informs much of my thinking.",
    "Indigenous geographies taught me how to think about space and how it is constructed through the processes of settler colonialism. I also learned how to connect personal experience into seminar discussions and me how to be honest about my positionality as a settler-scholar at Yale.",
    "This was my first course in Indigenous Studies, so in general I learned a lot about different Native tribes within the so-called US, and began to build a vocabulary around Indigeneity and the workings of settler colonialism. As opposed to other ER&M classes, this class teaches you to understand people, events, and structures of colonialism and resistance spatially. We talked about land ownership, placemaking through art, maps and mapmaking, and different world-views regarding space.",
    "None whatsoever.",
    "In the last few weeks of the class i appreciated how the building of intention throughout the course lead me to approach assignments differently. I think that this course could do more to acknowledge the racism that unfortunately occurs in Native studies and link it to black studies and latinx studies and global diaspora studies sooner because these geographies are interrelated; I think that it would be helpful to have that framework sooner. Ultimately it did touch on these themes. The flexibility of the final project really allowed me to be critically creative and understand what interventions that tackle erasure might look like."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class was problematic in a few ways. For one, it made \"Indigenous\" synonymous with \"personal healing,\" so our assignments and conversations started out with discussing very vulnerable, personal things instead of the readings. This created an uncomfortable situation where students may have been pressured to share aspects of their personal life that they might not have been comfortable with. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the workload was placed on students in a way that was confusing and unclear. There were 3 assignments due the day after Indigenous Peoples' Day, which was problematic because most of the class had been organizing for Indigenous Peoples' Day for weeks before that. Students had requested an extension, but this was denied. \r\n\r\nOne of the guest speakers in the class was extremely offensive and problematic to Native American and Indigenous students in the class. These students were left extremely uncomfortable in the environment. In a class like this, offensive rhetoric about Native peoples is not appropriate nor productive.",
    "HIRE NATIVE PEOPLE TO TEACH NATIVE STUDIES CLASSES",
    "A strength is definitely the subject matter, Indigenous Geographies are certainly important to think about a part of Indigenous studies going forward. I think a weakness is just how this course fits into conversations today around Ethnic studies with the assigned readings, and who exactly this course is giving a platform to within Indigenous Geographies. When it comes to Indigenous studies, there is a rising expectation among my generation that the scholarship will be by Native scholars and for Native people, and this course just does not meet that expectation. I think I found this course frustrating because of the amount of readings assigned versus what can feasibly be expected to be discussed in class as well.",
    "The course structure could have been better overall, engagement improved with student led discussions. Although I don't think responses are necessary, some structure for daily engagement would have been useful.",
    "one strength of course are that it bring in a diversity of texts from different disciplines that all work really well together, providing for a really rich discussion in seminar. One weakness of the class was that there was limited assignments, and not a lot to hold people accountable to reading the texts, so people came to the class unprepared. However, we were able to discuss and change the terms of the class, and landed on having weekly presentations so that we could engage with the readings more.",
    "If Yale is going to release a public land acknowledgement script, and if they really want to take action towards remedying their role in the settler colonial project, they need to invest more money in Indigenous Studies. They need to hire more actual Indigenous scholars and offer more classes. Once we have that security, I think classes taught by non-Native people and taken by non-Native people can be more open and productive for everyone. This is all to say that the content learned in this class is incredibly strong and important and interesting, but the class space was tense and often unproductive due to larger structural inequalities at the university.",
    "The course did not, at any rate, follow a central theme. Instead of focusing on Indigenous Geographies, we focused on completely unrelated issues. \r\n\r\nMany of the texts were written by non-Native and outdated anthropologists and scholars. \r\n\r\nThis course had no organization or objective. It was sloppily thrown together as the professors pet project.",
    "A lot of time was spent outlining community values, not all of which were consistently followed. Ultimately having more student guided discussion was helpful to compliment Dr. Barraclough's teaching style."

   "comments": [
    "I don't know. On one hand, I learned so much that I would not have learned had I not taken the class. On the other hand, the class was full of strife and the tense environment was a lot at times. It was hard to know who was \"supposed\" to be in the classroom and who wasn't. In the end, I can only conclude that my experience in this class exposed the amount of institutional damage Yale has enacted and continues to enact students of color and their right to learn. Yale as an administration and an institutional needs to do better.",
    "I would recommend students take native studies classes taught by actual native people. I would NOT recommend this class, if taught by Laura Barraclough, to anyone.",
    "No, Im sorry. From the beginning, I think the professor acted unprofessionally when there were some tense moments in the classroom, and that the professor became very reactionary to student criticism and subsequently took out their frustration on students, and that is just a learning environment I would willingly recommend to anyone.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if you are interested in learning the history and current conditions of Native dispossession and the inventive and incredible ways that Indigenous people to Turtle Island are creating their own futures by invoking tribal histories and uncovering Native space in a diversity of geographies.",
    "Well I think everyone should take an Indigenous Studies class.",
    "No. Never in a million years and not if it were the last class on earth. \r\n\r\nYou wont benefit from this class. In fact, you might even come out of it more confused than you were to begin with."
