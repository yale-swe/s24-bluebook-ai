                "I was introduced to the field of Caribbean literature, and read a wide range of modern novels as well as important diasporic theory!",
                "I gained the skills of reading, closely analyzing, and contextualizing fictional texts. We read a variety of novels reflecting historical trends &  themes from  the Caribbean Diaspora and analyzed it from a literary perspective as  well as a historical perspective."

            "comments": [
                "A major strength of this course is that there are no weekly reading responses which I truly appreciate. We read one book a week in this class and I have found when I do not have reading responses due a day or two before class, I am actually able to read more of the text. I feel like once a reading response is submitted students will just stop reading since their assignment is done, even if there is time between when that response is due and the next class. This is because we have to move on to the next assignment! But, when there are no reading responses we're allowed more time to read (especially at our own pace!) and we can then discuss together in class and learn from each other. Another major strength is that the class structure is simple, yet effective. We have a midterm paper of 5-7 pages, a final paper of 8-10 pages, a (co-)presentation on one of the texts (you sign up for one in the first or second week of class), and then a final class presentation that is actually really helpful in organizing your thoughts for your final paper. You just have these four assignments throughout the semester and the rest is reading!",
                "Strengths - love the reading list, thought the layout of the class was nice and that the assignments were perfect\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes I felt like Professor Habchi could step in to facilitate discussion more. I also think putting all the theory during the first four weeks was tough  it might have been nice to intersperse theory with novels, such as what we did with Zong.",
                "Strengths: Prof Habchi was incredible + encouraging + knowledgeable, the papers were interesting (we could choose our own topics & focus on whatever interested us), the books were almost all very enjoyable. Many of the books dealt with queerness/ gender in a way that was very refreshing & interesting\r\nWeaknesses: None"

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student regardless of their major. Everyone at Yale should take this course. If you are an Ethnicity, Race, & Migration; Women, Gender, & Sexuality Studies; Afro-American Studies; African Studies; American Studies; History; English; and/or Humanities major you MUST take this course. The Caribbean teaches us so much about the world and our livelihoods and I have truly learned so much in this class that I will apply to my scholarship.",
                "Yes - we have a great syllabus of readings that provided a good first entry into Caribbean diasporic theories for anyone who has not read them before. Our small class size allowed us to have great discussions and work through questions & curiosities together.",
                "Yes! It is a fairly pressure class (a good fifth class, I would say,) where you get to be introduced to a wonderful field and read some really great books. Professor Habchi is lovely as well.",
                "HIGHLY RECOMMEND. The readings were so enjoyable that I ended up rereading a couple of them after the class was over. Reading fiction is such an interesting and useful lens with which to study diaspora. You will come out with a deep appreciation for  the literature as well as a deeper understanding of the Caribbean diaspora, as well as how themes of immigration, motherhood, queerness, etc. can be dealt with in a fiction medium."
