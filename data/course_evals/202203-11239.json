Most importantly, you get a sense of how probability operates, so that you understand what proofs mean and can start to read some probability theory papers. Numbers seem exact while probability is random, so knowing what is actually happening under the surface is the key insight from this class. Theres also some application to Margingales near the end.",

            "comments": [
                "The course was a great followup to measure theory, and it covered a lot of interesting topics. However, the course felt extremely fast-paced due to having to review all of measure theory in the first few weeks, and it also could have used a lot more analogues and examples from regular discrete probability to help with intuition",
                "Material felt dry and problem sets were not interesting. Understandably it was fundamental measure theoretic probability that lays the foundation for more advanced and theoretical probability. Directions on final paper project felt unclear.",
                "I loved the class. Clear strengths were the lectures and associated notes, which were extremely intuitive, and final project/problem sets, and the professor. It is the best taught class Ive taken in the department. Sekhar is REALLY good at understanding what is intuitive in his way of presentation. If you study his lectures enough, you feel like you understand what is happening; his proofs dont skip steps and everything is motivated (albeit not always concretely, but much more than common in math). The chosen textbook by Pollard is similarly excellent, although the proofs skip a lot of steps that Sekhar fills in, motivates, and extends. Maybe a weakness is that he could give out treats at lectures to reinforce attendance cuz otherwise its hard to make the trek to science hill but thats a stretch.  The final project required more work than most finals but less grade stress and gave much more motivation if you found a good paper (find a good paper!). I thought it was much better exercise than making you memorize unmotivated details from the class to forget later. However, to be clear, this class is hard. Sure you could get an A tightly collaborating/not-quite-copying your psets and picking an easy final project paper, but the class is set up to help you actually learn and if you do that its a very high but not crazy high workload.",
                "By the nature of the course, there was a need to find a middle ground between those who have taken measure theory before this course and those that have not. Thus, some may find that the course is either too slow or too fast depending on whether one belongs to the former or latter. I personally found that the course was a bit slow in the beginning, but went a bit fast nearing the end of the semester (once we started conditioning).",
                "The course is taught well, and the problem sets really helped me process and master the material. I liked that there was a final project rather than an exam, as the project meaningfully improved my ability to deeply understand a probability paper. I can't think of any weaknesses, except that it would have been helpful to receive feedback on our problem sets a bit more in advance.",
                "Strengths: Sekhar is a brilliant professor who really cares about your learning process. Awesome TAs as well. Weakness: too large of a lecture hall -- made it so that Sekhar's voice was hard to hear and the chalkboard was far away, even from the first row.",
                "Already very good.",
                "Strengths: well-designed course with very knowledgeable instructor. Problem sets are made well and accompanying textbook is great. Weaknesses: None.",
                "Strengths: Sekhar is really nice, office hours are really helpful, psets are a fair assessment of content, no exams so focus is on learning rather than memorizing\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish he was clearer about theorems from the book not covered in class that we'd need to use. (He sometimes but not always mentioned them)",
                "The course tackles a lot and overall does a good job of handling it. By the end of the course however a lot of the proofs get very similar while the definitions get more and more abstract. I think lecture time would be better spent making sure students understand the objects in the proofs than understanding the technical details of the proofs themselves.",
                "The material was well presented and the problem sets were helpful for improving understanding. The final project was also a valuable way of learning.",
                "It's a very well-designed course. I appreciated the emphasis on weekly learning with homework, and the absence of midterms (and the associated stress). The final project was an excellent way to put techniques from class into practice.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Sekhar is a fantastic and engaging lecturer. He solicited class participation, answered our questions thoroughly, and made sure to frame the context of each topic and intuition behind each proof.\r\n\r\nMy one complaint: I wish there had been more structure provided around textbook readings. Sekhar told us that struggling with the textbook was the best way to learn the material -- and I agree -- but as the class dwelt on a single chapter for several weeks, it was hard to time these readings with the lectures. I'd have appreciated a more fine-grained reading schedule, with suggested sections to read highlighted with each lecture.",
                "Lectures were very interesting and engaging and problem sets felt like a good assessment of the class material that helped me develop my skills. I liked that there were no exams and found it useful to read a real paper for the final project. Very strong course."

                "Yes, but only if you've taken a measure theory course before. It should be a hard prereq, but I would have not been able to keep up without having taken 305. The psets can also be challenging, and are due every week.",

                "Yes, but make sure you have the textbook or are really good at reading his hand writing.",
                "Yes, I do recommend this course. I think it is very good for those that are vaguely familiar with measure theory, and it is very useful for anyone needing to read papers which use measure-theoretic proofs.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend the course if you have the time to put in: the course was very rewarding and the final project was a great experience, but p-sets were challenging and took a long time to complete. Lectures were good but moved very quickly. In short, take this course if you want a well-taught but high workload proof-based class in probability.",
                "Yes, if you have had some introduction to measure theory in the past and if you're genuinely interested in probability. I thought the most interesting parts of the course were the first few weeks (having had no exposure to measure theory in the past) and the last few weeks on martingales and stopping times. The prerequisites are a little misleading; this class is definitely a different style than most in the S&DS department.",
                "Yes for anyone who want to develop a solid mathematical basis into the academic world.",
                "Absolutely. This is an essential course for understanding probability rigorously.",
                "Yeah, go for it! The workload can be intense for a few days out of the semester but it's very chill overall. I really liked how the psets were focused on understanding the techniques from class and problem-solving as opposed to discovering new results outside of lectures. Measure theoretic probability is really confusing on the first go, and Sekhar does a good job not making it any harder than it already is. He's also very chill with accommodations and answers emails promptly, which is always appreciated. That being said, I'd recommend taking some measure theory (MATH 305) before this class. It's definitely more math than stats and it's hard to see the probability applications even by the course's end. Sekhar has an amazing dry humor in lectures and the paper report instead of an exam was a great choice given the complexity of the course content.",
                "I think the course has a very specific target audience. Students who need to understand the absolute foundations of measure theoretic probability out of interest or because it is their research area will enjoy the course. Sekhar will tell you himself in lecture 1 though that the field has no applications and will not be particularly useful to a further study of anything other than itself.",
                "Yes.",
                "Absolutely. The styles of probabilistic proof Sekhar teaches show up in surprisingly many areas.",
                "I would really recommend this course! Very interesting and engaging subject and I learned a lot. One of my favorite classes so far at Yale."
