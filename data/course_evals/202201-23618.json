I think not a lot of people showed up to this class as a result of this. The lectures didn't feel as rewarding to show up to in my opinion except for a few such as load balancing.",
                "Strengths: experimental, flexible and lab oriented. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some labs built on earlier labs so if you did badly in the first, the second suffered too.",
                "Labs were interesting and I learned a lot. Raft was so hard and unnecessary",
                "The year I took this course was the first time it was being offered by Professor Yang. The material is incredibly relevant to practical modern systems and covers some very interesting topics in the distributed systems field. The instructors (Yang, Scott, and Xiao) definitely focused on practical implementation and design details rather than distributed system theory (although there was definitely a taste of that). I view this is a great strength of the course, especially considering that it is named \"Building Distributed Systems\". Scott and Xiao are software engineers at Meta building distributed systems, and they were excellent teachers and mentors; they had deep expertise of the material and hands-on experience to share with students. Yang is a legend and has made significant contributions to the field of distributed systems, so regardless of who Yang finds to co-teach the course in future years, you will have incredibly knowledgeable instructors.\r\n\r\nSome specific feedback: The half-online, half-in-person nature of the course this semester did make it a little bit hard to engage with the material being covered in lecture. I preferred the in-person component much better, even when Scott and Xiao were taking the lead on teaching material.\r\n\r\nThe course surveyed many, many topics in distributed systems, and while I think that is important, it would have been helpful to me to restrict the scope by like 25-30% and also make the problem sets more directly related to the material being taught in lecture (although I think we should occasionally do high level overviews of advanced topics and systems that are simply too complex to implement in a college course). Reading the research papers was a real challenge, and I enjoyed doing so but felt that the number of papers to read per week in the middle of the course was too high, and would have preferred to have maybe 1 a week and to go through the material at a slower pace so I could digest what I was reading.",
                "Strengths - probably the best teaching roster you will come across at Yale. the course material is super well taught and the instructors are extremely knowledgeable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the course material is definitely hard. It's not like easy stuff to understand at a high or low level. I would say to definitely stay on top of the readings and talk to your teaching staff regularly!",
                "Strengths - psets teach you a ton, lots of great content, and you learn so much\r\nWeaknesses - lectures cover a ton of information and are super fast paced so it is easy to get lost. also lots of work so be ready for that.",
                "While the material in the class was interesting, the  primarily remote nature of the class as well as the speed with which stuff was covered made it hard to follow a lot of the times. A lot of my learning came from going over the slides after class, as well as from the problem sets (which were great btw).",
                "I enjoy the guest lectures as they brought about new infos from the industry. Only a few topics discussed in the class are put in the projects",
                "Weakness: lack of lecture recordings made concepts too difficult to review and there is no textbook, so good luck keeping up without prior knowledge\r\nStrengths: Professor Yang is highly experienced in the field",
                "Strengths: I like that it was taught in Go.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The readings were pretty useless.",
                "The homework in this class feels very practical and helpful in understanding distributed systems. The final project was also a great way to further our understanding. However, the weaknesses in this course were the normal lectures (guest lectures were great!). While the teaching staff was incredibly friendly and cared about the course, the lectures could have been more organized. Professor Yang is an extremely fast speaker and with slides, it's just hard to understand the concepts. This could just be a problem of this class being offered for the first time, but I also wish the chalkboard was used more so that the class was more engaging (like MIT's 6.824).",
                "Its a great course, I just wish they covered everything they had planned. More psets too would be nice for those that like to get their hands dirty,",
                "this was an awesome class",
                "The course was co-taught by two Facebook engineers so we got to get real industry insight into distributed systems. But make sure to check this year if they (Scott Pruett and Xiao Shi) will be teaching again. They were the best! The course is a high-level systems course so be prepared to move fast.",
                "Strength: solid lectures and projects.\r\nWeakness: lecture too overwhelming, not much connection between lectures and assignments.",

This class is a lot of work especially towards the middle of the semester where we have back to back homeworks. One of them is Raft, which took me quite a lot of frustration and time to build. If a student is up for the challenge, I think this class can provide a very practical learning experience for them.",
                "No. The workload is too large. The course covers too much topics in distributed system, but they are not adequately well-structured.",
                "Yes. The combination of industry insight, guidance from real world practitioners and theoretical insights is unmatched. There is no better way to learn this material and I learned more than in any class at Yale.",
                "Yeah but maybe not bc of Raft",
                "Yes. Take this course if you want to build relevant expertise in today's tech industry. If you have a serious interest in computer science, Yang is one of the professors you should 100% take a course with before you graduate with your degree. The workload was up and down throughout the semester; the hardest problem set by far is the Raft consensus algorithm implementation, which may be one of the most difficult problem sets I have ever had to work on, but most of the other problem sets were on par with some of the less demanding CS electives. I expect this to change and even out a little more, but be prepared to have space in your schedule to really grind out difficult problem sets.",
                "I would recommend this for any CS major that's finished the core curriculum. This class will bolster your understanding of concurrent programming and distributed systems, and the 1-1 time you get with the professor/teaching staff is invaluable.",
                "Yes! Professor Yang's classes are all amazing, he really cares about teaching his students and having them learn a lot.",
                "Yes, but only if the pace of the class is slowed down a little bit, and it focuses more on depth of material covered instead of breadth.",

                "No",
                "Yes. You can really learn things by doing all the labs by yourself. Especially in the Raft lab where you likely spend dozens of hours debugging and learning its subtle design.",
                "Yes. Understanding distributed systems is pretty core to computer science, and there's not many opportunities to learn about them. The class assignments were great, and while the lectures could be better, Professor Yang/Scott/Xiao are extremely smart and really want to help the students.",
                "Yes, this is one of the courses I think that should be required. Take it especially if you want to go into industry.",
                "yes, definitely. This is an extremely important topic for the industry. If you're interested in systems, take this course",
                "Yes if you want to learn how to design and build distributed systems. After taking this course I really want to be a software engineer working on distributed systems and performance optimization. The engineering challenges are so interesting, and the technology (both theory and practice) are advancing at a rapid pace, so the water is warm; jump right in!",
