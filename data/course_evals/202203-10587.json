                "I learned how to read texts in order to really understand what I think they are trying to say, as opposed to reading them to criticize them or to advance an argument against them. I think this has helped me become not only a better reader and writer but also a better person, because developing the ability to understand is essential for navigating so many different parts of life.",
                "Incredible experiences with incredible texts. After these readings, especially Kierkegaard, I have so many more thoughts in my head about learning, the unknown, god, paradoxes, and the locations of different metaphysical objects. What more can you ask?",
                "I cannot recommend this class enough. You get out of it what you put into it, but Professor Levene will be there to support and help you to the fullest extent. This is the class where I have learned (by far) the most about essay writing and reading difficult texts.",
                "This course was an introduction to some key questions in metaphysics, as explored through a few texts that try to have conversation with each other. They succeed in doing so -- there is an arc to the semester that makes you consider what this project of \"metaphysics\" really is in a new light. I think the main skill I developed further through this course was reading literature philosophically. Re-reading Hamlet may seem like a slog for those who already did that, perhaps multiple times, in high school. But this read was different and refreshing, and forever changed my perception of Shakespeare's work.",
                "I thought it would be nice to list the skills for clarity:\r\n1) Conscientious writing\r\n2) Reading texts in such a way as to balance interpretation with what the text is able to support. \r\n3) Learning how to draw upon texts to foreword interpretations. \r\n4) Learning how to deal with indefinite ideas and also just indefiniteness in general.",
                "How to analyze difficult and dense philosophical texts and how to connect ideas from different texts. The course explores ideas behind objects/concepts coming into existence, human reasoning and morality, and perception of the world around us. The course is really helpful for becoming a better writer as well."

                "This course could be improved by offering feedback on drafts of papers.",
                "Strengths: Professor Levene, both in class and in office hours. She pushes students to develop their own interpretation of the material, but makes sure they remain faithful to the text.        \r\n\r\nWeakness/Suggestion: I think it would be helpful to introduce slightly more structure in class discussions to make sure everyone's interests are taken into account. For example, students could be asked to put up questions and concepts they would like to discuss on the board before jumping into a free-flowing discussion. While the relatively unstructured nature of the seminar allowed for interesting and unexpected lines of inquiry, it also meant that some students tended to dominate the discussion.",
                "This course is unique. Prof Levene chose some fantastic texts, and these texts and the SHORT weekly readings are the key strength of the course. I would often spend 5+ hours on a 15 page Kierkegaard reading for a week. I cannot describe how intellectually satisfying reading his amazing work in such a slow, methodical manner was. That was the highlight. Discussion sections were, I thought, hit or miss. 40% of discussions were so thought-provoking, and thought-provoking about such grand topics with such enormous relevance to my life, that I would leave class emotional from the intellectual ecstasy I was experiencing. I would say 60% of the sections were kind of meh because they proceeded in the following form: 1) student raises question and points to a passage that might be useful in answering it 2) another student affirms that they have the same question, points to another passage that might answer it, and raises another question borne out of that passage. 3)  2 repeats several times. I found myself frustrated when a student would read a brilliant, rich passage and raise a profound question, and rather than spend the 20-30 minutes of discussion owed to that passage and question, we would move on the another passage and eventually another question before answering the first. Still 40% is a great rate when those 40% are as truly stellar as they were in our section. And not being able to answer such challenging questions is understandable; if wed waited to answer them before moving on we might have been stumped/silent for long periods. It may be that the discussions were as good as they could have been. So overall I consider the discussions a strength, along with the principle strength, the readings. Professor Levene is brilliant and caring and is another strength in the very strong course she has created. She is a tough grader and justifies it by arguing the inflated grading system at Yale may be dysfunctional. Interesting argument and I appreciate her pushing back against that system. Still, her class is a class in that system, and I often found myself confused about whether my paper was good like the comments said if my grade was 1-2 letter grades below what I would have received in another class at Yale for the same quality of work. The grading left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth as a fair evaluation system but those grades sure were an effective motivational tool! My writing became more precise over the course of the semester. What more can you ask?",
                "I really loved discussion in this course and the general concept of the course. However, the structure of the course is tough. I get the policy about no participation grades, but for a class where we are developing most of our ideas together and in class, it feels weird for that work to suddenly be negligible and have a single final essay is worth more than half of our grade. Although I didn't, more than half of the people I know in this course Credit/D/Fail-ed it, so although I liked the course a lot, I think there should be room to both take the course and feel okay about one's grade in it.",
                "I think the course's strength is its content and the passion brought by those teaching it -- Prof. Levene put a lot of work into fitting together this class, and it shows! I think if I had one piece of feedback, I would encourage a bit more of an explicit tackling of metaphysics \"in light of the supposition that it is at an end.\" I feel like the course was shrouded in this supposition, but I would have appreciated a bit more explicit discussion of what that idea means, and why this syllabus reflects that.",
                "I think its strength is in its format and in the texts which complement each other very well, it is not a weakness really but prospective students should know it is a fairly difficult course.",
                "The class of very engaging and the materials are very interesting. The texts explores various areas regarding existence, perception, and reasoning abilities. There is a lot of freedom in how to interpret the readings and the feedback of my writings are very helpful and clear.",
                "Strengths: Great selection of works to approach in new and interesting ways. Professor Levene is very good at guiding discussion in a productive direction. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Vague and unhelpful feedback on papers. A very unclear and harsh grading system. I would have no gripe with its harshness if there were clear standards upon which we were graded, which there were not."

                "I came into this course expecting a philosophy class. It may be co-listed in the philosophy department, but it is ultimately a religious studies class. What that means is that you interpret texts and you argue for what they say. You do not argue about the philosophical arguments posed or discussed in the texts. It's rewarding from that angle, and helps you develop that skill. Just know what you are in for.",
                "Yes! This is one of the few classes I have taken in college where the instructor gives students the freedom to grapple with the texts for themselves, and to bring their own questions and interests to the table. There is a bit of a learning curve to get used to Professor Levene's teaching style, but it is absolutely worth it.",
                "Yes. Prof Levene chose some fantastic texts, and these texts and the SHORT weekly readings are the key strength of the course. I would often spend 5+ hours on a 15 page Kierkegaard reading for a week. I cannot describe how intellectually satisfying reading his amazing work in such a slow, methodical manner was. That was the highlight. Discussions were overall good, sometimes great. The papers get you REALLY deep into the text in an enjoyable and extremely challenging way. I would often spend huge sums of time on a 3 page paper, which is a good thing. I absolutely loved that the papers were aimed at understanding the authors work rather than critiquing it. Prof Levene is absolutely correct that philosophy often spends too little time attempting to understand before proceeding to object. However, if you struggle with open-ended prompts as I do, papers may be tough. But tough is good in the end.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes I think everyone interested in reading and writing more deeply should take this course!",
                "I would! This course was a really enriching conversation between a multitude of texts that read well with each other. I am grateful for having taken the course. Just note -- a lot of the grappling with the \"end\" of metaphysics is implicit rather than explicit. We spent about 10 minutes of the course specifically answering the question (is metaphysics dead?)... but you can feel it slowly begin to be answered throughout the class.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone I think, the texts and ideas are such that they will be interesting to anyone- it draws you in.",
                "Yes! This the discussions in class is really interesting and helped me improve my abilities to read dense texts. It is a great class is you are interested in exploring the boundary and capability of human reasoning abilities and thinking about the connection between faith and other concepts (freedom, morality, etc). As someone who's not done much academic writing and English is my second language, it also helped me to become a much better writer",
                "If you want to take the course and actually enjoy it, plan to Credit/D/Fail it. The class itself is interesting, but the grading is a mess."
