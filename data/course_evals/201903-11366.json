   "comments": [
    "This course is a great way to meet the lab requirement. Professor Nelson is incredibly enthusiastic, kind, and helpful as a professor. I learned a lot and also became much more confident about working in a lab setting",
    "Dr. Nelson is a very nice and engaging professor, the final presentation rather than a final paper for this half of the course was appreciated",
    "Strengths: The professor is great and he makes the class enjoyable. Professor Nelson is so dedicated and ensures that our experiments are redone successfully to allow us to move forward.\r\nWeakness: sometimes it felt like we didn't have to do much work because the professor and TA(s) did a lot for us",
    "I actually loved that this lab met twice a week! It made me feel really engaged with the project! Dr. Nelson was incredible and very supportive. My peers in this class also showed a lot of enthusiasm and passion for research. The only negative aspect was the lack of feedback and transparency about grading. All the feedback we got was from p-sets which were graded harshly.",
    "We were able to learn techniques which were very useful in research",
    "Major strength was how the class is designed so we are working on real projects from real Yale labs. This makes the experience especially useful if you haven't done lab research before. This class would prepare you so well.",
    "Great class",
    "Strengths: we were able to try out a lot of different techniques (miniprep, DNA isolation, RNA synthesis, etc.) Dr. Nelson came to our rescue whenever we were unable to successfully complete a lab procedure or if there were other problems.\r\nWeaknesses: the PS grading was a little harsh and since they were worth 35% of the grade, it would have been helpful to have more points total.",
    "It's well ran, the only thing to maybe look into would be trying to aim for a more consistent time range of being in the lab, some days are longer than others, perhaps that can be evened out a bit."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, this is a great course and a relaxed but still engaging way to meet the biology lab requirement. Meeting for lab two times a week is a big time commitment so make sure to plan accordingly.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, it's an enjoyable bio lab class & it's a full credit.",
    "Yes! It was a super fun lab class and it was nice to get the biology lab out of the way in one semester!",
    "Yes, very good way to fulfill MCDB lab requirement.",
    "Highly recommend as an MCDB lab course. Yes, it's 6 hours per week, but you learn a lot about what day to day lab research looks like. There's also very little (pretty much none, because we'd do PSETS during downtime during class) work outside of class. There's a final research paper after part I and a journal club style presentation after part II, but that was really all that is needed outside of class if you were keeping up with your lab notebook throughout the semester.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Yes! Such a fun course, and Dr. Nelson is incredible. He helps you with everything in the lab and is super supportive.",
    "Yes, its a fantastic class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student! It is not too stressful, compared to some of the other lab courses I've taken. The skills I learned in this lab are very relevant in my own genetics lab.",
    "Yes, it's an engaging but enjoyable bio lab, that both satisfies major and pre med requirements without creating a stressful environment."
