            "comments": [
                "It was rather fast-paced but I thought that each unit really got to the crux of each software that we were working with. Each lesson felt very intentional and that was helpful.",
                "Project-based and Prof. P always makes time to help his students.",
                "One way to improve this class, I think, would be to have an example archive of older students' work (perhaps omitting some parts, so they don't give too much away) -- much of my learning was from imitating in-class or online examples anyway, and online help resources on Waveform and SuperCollider were often either sparse or inaccessible (I can't understand that sort of terminology without experience). I learned a lot from reading about my classmates' projects and wish I had seen them earlier.",
                "Strengths were that it was very hands-on. No abstract theory, any work was done by you in the field, and live lectures showing these techniques helped. Weaknesses were mostly unavoidable due to the remote nature of the course, for instance, no live in-person debugging, and the electronics module was somewhat difficult over a screen, but professor's setup helped mitigate this.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Petersen obviously truly cares about his students and tries his very best to make the learning environment both effective and interesting. Midway through the semester (this is probably unique to this Covid year), he made the grading system A-or-fail, which personally allowed me to focus simply on learning rather than going for a grade. This class is also a wonderful combination of science and art; you spend time learning the technical aspects of music/a programming language, but this knowledge is applied in whatever creative direction you want.\r\nWeaknesses: Though this wasnt a fault of Dr. Petersens, some of the material/lectures could be a little dry, which made it hard to focus throughout the entire 1hr15min. Also, as someone with no programming experience, learning the SuperCollider language was EXTREMELY difficult and confusing. Prior coding experience was definitely necessary to make meaningful use out of the SuperCollider unit, since I felt like I was always trying to get even the basics down. This seemed to be a general consensus with students with little CS background.",
                "This course can have some very boring moments. You have to learn the basics of music physics to understand music production, but I feel like they could be taught simultaneously and make more sense. You learn a lot of physics behind sounds without knowing where or how they will be applicable until later. Thus, you feel very lost in the first few weeks.",
                "A big strength is coverage of material to an extent that will let you understand where to further your own studies if you wish to continue."
