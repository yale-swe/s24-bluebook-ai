   "comments": [
    "This course allowed me to really develop reading skills and an amazing work ethic. There are a lot of readings that require dedication and commitment. In addition, I got to learn a lot about why crime is committed and how they manifest into larger crimes.",
    "I learned a lot about mainstream criminology theories and their appropriateness in evaluating societal issues an policy choices",
    "I learned what the state of scholarship is on crime in sociology, something I didn't know at all beforehand. I've had few experiences with social science studies in classes, so I feel like I got better over time at approaching key elements in sociological scholarship. Or even just learning questions to be thinking about in regards to methodology.",
    "Criminology theories .\r\n\r\nDifferent perspective of thinking through discussion.",
    "With no previous knowledge of sociology, I have obtained a surprising firm grasp on many foundational theories of government-civilian interactions in this class. The readings and assignments offered great opportunities to expound and expand on these foundational texts and their application towards modern society. This has given me a new and far more comprehensive outlook towards what constitutes deviance.",
    "I learned about the foundations of sociology of crime and deviance and how some policy makers have tried to explain and reform it.",
    "I learned about multiple theories on crime and gained insights on how different people approach solutions to social problems.  I also learned how to make fact sheets and what a policy brief would entail.",
    "Learned how to draft a policy proposal, how to think about crime and criminalization in relation to varying theories, and how to critically address canonical works by thinking about the contemporary context",
    "I learned so much about how systems affect incarceration, and different methods to explain, control, and prevent crime.",
    "How to view crime from a different perspective, while engaging in a facilitated disscussion",
    "Definitely my critical thinking and writing skills! Also since I am a high school student, then being around by a lot of college students taught a lot.  And more importantly, taking Yale summer school inspired me and allowed me to firmly believe in my dream of applying to Yale this fall. This experience is definitely super precious, and I am so grateful to join these talented people and enjoy my wonderful one-month summer school!",
    "I enjoyed this course it gave me in depth knowledge about crime and the reason of crime alongside deviance which I found it interesting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course were certainly the professor's commitment and the topic in general. Professor Cheng was a really amazing professor where he organized all the readings into succinct lecture slides and really helped propose questions for discussion. He was also very helpful in responding to emails almost immediately when I had questions. The course itself was taken remotely so it was hard to be as engaged as in a in-person setting but nevertheless, I think Professor Cheng really made this course enjoyable for me.",
    "The material was very interesting and interdisciplinary because we talked many times about history, economics, and politics in the same discussion. A potential weakness of the class was the lectures; I think they could have taken up less time to allow more time for discussion.",
    "I thought this course did a good job of showing us past theories but not dwelling on them, and discussing broad historical trends as well as current events. Sometimes lectures felt redundant to the reading but most of the time Cheng really did present the content of the reading in a way that made me think about it in a fuller or more unified way, or even a different way, so for that reason I'd say the lecturing was very good. I always enjoyed when we would take a break to learn about a news story or larger trend in US politics as well.",
    "Need to improve:\r\nMore breakout room and more discussion session so that people can engage. Three hour on zoom with few discussion is is very hard to concentrate.\r\n\r\nStrength:\r\nThe way of posting discussion question before class.\r\nThe short videos",
    "The structure and and overall layout of Mr. Cheng's course was a key strength; I mean this not only in the sense of access to key materials given throughout the class, but also in the sequential topics which culminated in a wholistic approach to studying crime. \r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course was the amount of material\/ the pace in which we covered said material. I found we weren't provided with enough time to fully explore theories with which we engaged, but this is most likely the result of a condensed timeframe of a 5 week course.",
    "I believe the course would be stronger in person, rather than over zoom.",
    "Strengths were discussion posts that allowed us to have effective conversations in class. Weakness would just be the load of readings, but I understand the time constraint of summer sessions, so in context it makes sense.",
    "The course didn't do break out rooms as much as I would have liked but the content of the course more than compensated for it as it was very engaging.",
    "At the beginning, it seemed as though there were a lot of readings assigned, however throughout the course they were lessened. The strengths include engaging material with no background knowledge nessecary.",
    "If this course can be taught in person, that'll be even better! Overall the class is awesome except for the materials that we need to read before class is a little bit dense and hard to finish. But Prof Cheng helped us to narrow the material down a lot, which I really appreciate that!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student especially because this course covers a lot of interesting topics in criminology. There were so many interesting readings that helped me gain a new perspective on the dangers around me.",
    "I definitely would recommend the course to someone genuinely interested in an interdisciplinary study of criminology. You will need to want to engage with the theories though as there is more to the class than just promoting social justice",
    "Yes I would, because I was able to glean a lot from it even as a Film major. You get exposed to a wide array of opinions and schools of thought which sharpens your critical thinking in the area of crime and deviance.",
    "Yes, because this class cover a great amount of knowledge in criminology.",
    "I would. I find the topic to be extremely stimulating, particularly given the current public discourse regarding police reform. This class does an excellent job preparing a student to engage in this discussion.",
    "I would. It gives well rounded knowledge of crime and its foundations, and how and why past sociologists explain it.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in the social issues behind crime because it gives background insight into why criminals do what they do.",
    "Yes",
    "I absolutely would. The summer session classes are pretty long since they're 3 hours and 15 minutes, and I still really enjoyed it so I imagine that during the semester it's probably even more engaging since it's not as condensed.",
    "Yes i would. This course creates an environment where students can learn about judicial action and what theories can be applied to types of crime.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course especially to high school students. This course is challenging and help me get a brief acknowledgment of what actual Yale class look like!",
    "Yes its joyful and you learn a lot"
