                "This course was a great introduction to the history and culture of Israel, and the relationship between Israel and Jewish culture and the Holocaust.",
                "I learned quite a bit about the history and culture of Israel\/Palestine through various engaging sources, including books, short stories, film, television, dance, children's literature, and more.",
                "I think I learn that even when a small number of people take about a specific topic, the number of opinions about it can be extremely large.",
                "Some information about the Israeli-Palestinian dynamic, formation of the Israeli state, and tidbits about life there.",
                "As someone who was largely unfamiliar with Israel-Palestine and the conflict before I took this course, this class taught me so much about the region, its history, and its culture. Even as this content made me a more conscious student, Professor Goren's teaching style and class structure taught me how to be a better reader, writer, and consumer. She assigned us an article outlining her teaching goals at the beginning of the semester in order to frame everything that we learned, and her unique assignments--which ranged from news reports, to discussion posts, to formal essays--developed my skills in so many different directions. This course, in short, taught me how to be a more thoughtful student, and I hope to apply this insight to the rest of my Yale career and beyond."

                "Strengths: incredibly organized, good level of work (medium workload), interesting and diverse assignments, clear feedback on every assignment\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "This was a well-taught and well-organized course. The material and class discussions were always interesting, and the reading\/viewing load was nontrivial but definitely manageable. My only recommendation would be to split up the reading a bit more for A Tale of Love and Darkness-- the amount of reading for that was a bit overwhelming, especially early in the semester.",
                "Overall, I think the course was fantastic. I often found the weekly news reports quite interesting and would have loved it if the class had a chance to discuss those issues for a few minutes. I also loved class discussions and would have liked for there to have been even more back and forth amongst the students.",
                "I think the course's strength is the open discussion and the variety of reading and movies.\r\nI think the weakness is that the course goal is a bit too vague and should be addressed more specifically",
                "Its too light throughout the semester, even for a humanities major. Thats a major pro for the class, but during the paper writing season, the class sucks up your life. Not because Shiri does not have one of the best, creative and engaging midterm and final paper prompts, but because the class is so deceptively light throughout the semester except in those peak seasons. Just start early since professor posts it all early. Also, I think peer feedback is nice, but it fails to offer what my other writing-heavy humanities class offer: the prof.s feedback on the actual details of your paper. Fair, prof has OHs to guide you with high level thinking for papers, but its up to your peers to determine if it is appropriate to keep a paragraph that prof would later take a good deal of points from. The class overall is not too hard though, if you work early and smartly.",
                "The strengths of this course were its content, its organization, and Professor Goren's teaching. I greatly enjoyed each of our assignments and, in particular, was excited by how different they were from one another. Even as we engaged with so many different types of media throughout the semester, Professor Goren kept us focused on the overarching arc of the semester by posing larger questions and even previewing each week's content at the previous class session. I also loved how many opportunities we had to interact with the material outside of class through recommended events and department-wide speaker sessions and movie screenings. The weakness of this course was that, sometimes, the class was quiet during our discussion sessions, making creating a dialogue more difficult. The writing assignments were extremely helpful for expressing our opinions, but I sometimes wished that the class would more openly discuss the material with one another. However, the course itself frequently encourages discussion both online and in-person, and I wish my class had taken more advantage of it."

                "Absolutely. This class is super well designed for student learning, and is doable for students of all ages (first years to seniors). The topic is interesting and so are the assignments.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone with an interest in gaining an understanding of the history\/culture of Israel\/Palestine that goes much deeper than the surface level at which the media typically discuss these issues.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Shiri is a wonderful professor who makes every class unique and very engaging.",
                "I think I will recommend this course only to students that have a connection to Israel or generally to the middle east.",
                "Its an easy credit, not too many hours a week. Midterm and final paper are serious but not long. Put your thoughts into them. Do the bonus weekly responses, it could help! Professor Shiri Goren is kind and caring. She genuinely wants you to succeed, so youre in good hands.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Goren is one of the best, most organized, and most passionate professors I have had at Yale. She scheduled individual meetings with each of us during the first week of the semester to learn about our interests and learning styles in the classroom and our extracurriculars, and she consistently checked in with us and encouraged us to dig further in our work throughout the term. Furthermore, she took the time to preview what we were learning each class session the week beforehand in order to keep us focused on the arc of the semester; she also provided numerous opportunities for us to engage with the material outside of class. Beyond its organization and Professor Goren's teaching, the class content was fascinating. I greatly enjoyed the books we read and films we watched, and I now hope to further study the themes and histories we discussed during my career at Yale and beyond. You should definitely take this course!"
