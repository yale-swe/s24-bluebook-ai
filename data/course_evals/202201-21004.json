                "The strength of composition seminar lies in the incredible freedom given to students to work on their own projects in any style and manner they prefer.\r\nHowever, sometimes the guest presentation can be a hit or miss.",
                "Strengths: it is a wonderful opportunity to work on music you like and get credit for, lessons are wonderful, the labs have a ton of helpful software and things, visiting composer lectures were usually very interesting  \r\nWeaknesses: none especially, the structure of the class is quite unique but probably optimized for what it is",
                "Strengths: Good Support Systems, One-on-One Lessons\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Wish that the classes focused more of actually technical considerations when composing, I had almost no experience going in and wish I had more explicit guidance on how to write sheet music.",
                "Weakness: not too much actual learning about composition during class",
                "Strengths:\r\n- detailed feedback from lesson instructors and the ability to get ideas and inspiration from lessons\r\n- guest lecturers who are working in the industry, especially Jay Wadley\r\n- student presentations and feedback from profs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- the music school guest speakers felt a bit random and incohesive with the rest of the course, and therefor were less engaging",
                "Strengths: With Konrad, composition seminar is very laid back and relatively forgiving. If youre busy with other classes it doesnt take a lot to do well in this course. Additionally, this class is really accommodating to a wide variety of different styles of music, so if you compose jazz, classical, pop, or something completely different, you should be able to complete this class without difficulty!\r\nWeaknesses: At times, feedback and guidelines for projects can be unclear/minimal. Additionally, though presentations are interesting, the amount we learned pertaining to composition skills was quite variable I enjoyed being in the class but I dont know what skills I necessarily learned this semester. Lastly, the group projects can be rather tedious or outright painful we had a project for prepared piano which we were required to perform, which was quite the challenge!"

It is very much self paced and directed and it is difficult to \"learn\" how to compose - the expectation seems to be that you will roughly have some ideas about what you want to do (which is probably for the best). So for anyone who wants to compose something, absolutely!",

You definitely get as much out as you put in - I decided to put in a lot this semester, and I feel like I learned/grew a lot as well.",

                "YES! If you want to compose but need deadlines to get anything done, you should absolutely take this course. I tried using a ton of techniques that were new to me, and I feel really proud of my work in this course. The profs are super supportive and the lessons are so helpful!",
                "If you like composition, and are very self-guided and self-motivated in your studies, then yes I would recommend this course. If youre looking for an easy class then this might be for you. But I wouldnt recommend this course for those who want clear cut assignments, rubrics, and grading."
