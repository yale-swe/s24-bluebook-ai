                "Strengths: readings were always very refreshing and enjoyable (mostly selections from The New Yorker or The NYT, essays that you'd want to read in your own time anyway), feedback was helpful and clear, and Pam was a great resource and super knowledgeable. I would also say that this class translated the best to Zoom. This semester, I've also taken math classes and lecture courses and this class has been the most engaging out of all of them. \r\nI would say one weakness was the timing of the essays; we had four essays over the course of the semester and sometimes the first draft of the next essay would be due a week after you just submitted the final draft of another essay. I wouldn't fault anyone in particular for this, as the timing of the semester was challenging for everyone, but it was definitely tough to manage as a first-year.",
                "Strengths: the reading material was well-selected and quite engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: discussions were often quite dull, static, and uninteresting. Perhaps this was due to the online format.",
                "Strengths: I really loved everything that we read, and I was able to apply the skills from the readings and our discussions to my own writing. I vastly improved as a writer over the course of the semester. Professor Newton is also really engaging, and I always enjoyed seminars. \r\nWeaknesses: Other than workshops, we didn't really talk about our own essays in class, so it was sometimes difficult to get started on an essay, both choosing a topic and writing a draft.",
                "Strengths: The readings was always super interesting, to the point where they never really felt like homework. The essays were also fun to write because they were personal and about topics that I genuinely cared about. Also, submitting a draft before the final essay was something I appreciated, because it gave the opportunity for feedback and improvement. Weaknesses: Honestly not many, but I would say that sometimes class felt a little repetitive because you essentially do the same thing every day, although every class was still interesting and engaging."
