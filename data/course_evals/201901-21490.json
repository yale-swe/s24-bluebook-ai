    "If you're self-motivated, do an independent thesis!",

    "The one-term, independently written senior essay is a great way to deepen your knowledge in a field that interests you, that might not be covered in a seminar in the semester you're writing. For me, my senior essay felt like a culmination of all of the classes I had ever taken and cared about in the political science department. Done well, the essay requires many hours of reading, researching, and writing, so find an advisor you get along with and who knows you. They don't necessarily have to specialize exactly in whatever question you're trying to answer. Overall, it's a really rewarding process, and I'm happy I have this essay that I am proud of to show for my work in the major.",
    "Yes! It gives you the opportunity to do some free thinking, finally",
    "Yes, I recommend doing the one-semester thesis if you have good relations with your advisor and know exactly what research is needed to produce a one-semester's worth of writing.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend the stand-alone thesis under my circumstances (a hazy sense for the field, but no clear sense for the research question)--an in-class paper with more structure would probably have worked better"
