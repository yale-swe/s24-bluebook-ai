                "I enjoyed the format of this class for the most part. I thought sometimes the worksheets bordered on busy-work, as the questions on them were not always interesting and seemed like they were designed to just fill up class-time. However, I thought the emphasis on implicit learning through speaking was actually very helpful as time went on. Previously, I have learned Spanish through grammar worksheets, but I actually thought I picked up the grammar better by focusing less on it and more on speaking and writing, though the learning curve was steeper.",
                "Strengths- great professor, loved all the different materials we looked over, they were very interesting \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- They need grammar lessons. I get what they are trying to do by having us use new grammar in class without explicitly going over it. But we are not native speakers, we are not immersed. To be able to effectively learn grammar that way, we need way more exposure which a 50 minute class is not going to do. Just take one class period to go over this stuff, please.",
