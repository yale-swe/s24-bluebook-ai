                "a little more organization",
                "Organization was brutal -- first time taught so to be expected but hopefully the profs work hard to respond to student feedback",
                "This class was a very cool, unique application of law and CS to each other. You see the inherent similarities between the two and how you can use modern technologies to improve our society. Being the first time the course ran, I think it was a bit disorganized, but now that all the assignments have been created and worked out, I don't force this being an issue in the future.",
                "Both professors are extremely knowledgeable in their respective fields. One weakness is that I think the course could use a bit more organization and structure. Projects were very interesting, but sometimes things felt chaotic and disorganized",
                "The course was the first time it was being taught, so it could definitely be improved in terms of organization. The main strengths were the quality of teaching and the level of the material. More specifically, Prof. Ruzica and Prof. Shapiro are fantastic at relaying information, and the material was demanding and interesting.",
                "Very interesting topic, organization could have been better.",
                "The law and logic sections of the course seemed mostly disconnected. Also, it was fairly disorganized in terms of deadlines, following the syllabus, etc.",
                "Strengths: Instructors were fantastic. This was the first semester this course was taught, and there were a few bumps in the road, as I expected there would be when I signed up for a new course. However, Ruzica and Scott teach with great empathy and humor, and they made the ride enjoyable. This is also a very niche subject that is just cool to learn about and stretches your mind in new ways, specifically with respect to synthesizing the two fields. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think there was a mismatch in the stated prerequisites and the actual required knowledge to excel in the course. I think a person without a pretty extensive formal logic background, honestly through 365, may have struggled. I think Ruzica's teaching style is to offer a lot of worked examples of each kind of problem, but that didn't really offer the intuition needed to figure out new problems. Additionally, just \"basic programming experience\" was listed as a prerequisite, but the group projects definitely required serious programming skills. So if you didn't have those skills, you had to hope you buddied up with someone who had them. Now for me, I had taken 365 and had a more substantial programming background, so I had a great time, but for students who don't, I think this would have been a real struggle. Either refactoring the material or raising the prereq bar makes a lot of sense to me.",
                "Strengths: Really passionate professors.\r\nWeaknesses: You need to be interested in the material. Abstract.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Ruzica is amazing. She's very kind and incredibly knowledgeable. She does a great job of explaining the formal tools of logic. Her assignments are also very interesting. This class is overall great and very enjoyable, and even the weaknesses I mention are all minor, especially considering it is the first time the course was offered. \r\nWeaknesses: Wish there were more office hour slots. The TAs were helpful for the CS related homeworks but the TF who corrected the reaction papers practically gave everyone the same one-line of feedback. Grading was generous but definitely not clear enough especially for the reaction papers.",
                "strengths: the teaching team! Professor Piskac is possibly the most approachable prof in the cs department -- she's genuinely kind and invested in students' success. She is also a leader in her field and her energy and enthusiasm are infectious. Professor Shapiro is also brilliant and incredible to hear from. The TAs are also very kind and supportive as well. The class is also super flexible and feels a lot more low-stakes than typical CS electives. weaknesses: lectures can be a bit hard to follow, especially later ones on automated reasoning. the assignments also feel a bit detached from the material (we had to write actual 5-page papers based on different readings), but the workload is really low",
                "I think the main strength of this course is that is a cool interdisciplinary topic. The main weakness is that it was very disorganized.",
                "Good Course.",
                "This was the first iteration of the course so it felt as though the instructors improvised a lot of the course structure / assignments as the semester progressed. Strengths wise, the professors were engaging and also genuinely invested in the material, which made for a good class environment. The workload was also not heavy, and the professors are very accessible if you need help understanding any of the concepts. In terms of weaknesses, I wish TA office hours were better advertised / displayed on the canvas page and that we received paper feedback besides just our grades. I also think the course would be improved if the outline of content and projects had been more finalized from the outset, and if the legal theory material could be presented more cohesively alongside the formal logic / automated reasoning material.",
                "Weakness: The course was organized really poorly. We constantly received assignment descriptions at the last moment and ended up doing different things than those listed on the syllabus. I would say this is something you should expect with a new course, but I've had Ruzica before (for 323, which had a well-established schedule/psets/etc.) and it was similarly disorganized. I don't know how much more organized it'll be if it's offered again. I don't \r\nStrength: Scott's lectures were really interesting.",
                "The biggest strength of the course was that the material is fascinating and not really taught in any other class. To the extent possible, this course could be improved by having first-order logic or perhaps mathematical logic as a pre-requisite, which would allow for a quicker and more in-depth introduction to automated reasoning systems. Alternatively, the first few weeks of the course could have taken a more fast-paced approach to getting students up to speed on this; some classes that use MatLab, for instance, will hold workshops for students to learn MatLab in the first 2-3 weeks of the semester. Another possible improvement might be to integrate the law material into the class more directly earlier in the semester.",
                "The course has fairly interesting material at its core, especially as it pertains to security. HOWEVER the growing pains and excessive disorganization absolutely killed any interest I personally had in this class."

                "Yes. Scott Shapiro is awesome, I love Ruzica, but recognize that the class is imperfect. They are still figuring out how to teach it. I enjoyed parts of it but found other parts frustrating. Overall i enjoyed the journey",
                "Yes! If you are interested in law and CS/logic, I highly recommend this class. Professor Shapiro is a brilliant man and is able to see and describe the law in a unique way. An equally compelling lecturer, Professor Piskac brings the mathematical world of logic and software verification techniques to the class. This can then be applied to laws formalized into logically equations in order to formally check whether there are loop holes in the tax code or whether a client is guilty of breaking a certain law. This area is still in its infancy but has serious potential to redefine the way the US legal system works. If you plan to pursue a career in law or CS, this class would in no doubt benefit you b because you will gain a special understanding of the law and software both separately and together.",
                "I would definitely recommend the course to another student looking into the fields of law and computer science. It was a good amalgamation of the two, and it would definitely prepare for a career in software engineering involving software analysis, law, etc.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, at the heart of things, this course has two really great instructors. I think in general, it's good advice to take courses by good instructors and trust that the content will work itself out. As long as you have a firm grasp of formal logic, I'd honestly say go for it. They are very understanding of people's different levels of preparation, and they have great attitudes that makes class go by quickly. If you like to write and to do math/programming, this one has cool assignments in both.",
                "Really great course. Not the most organized first time round, but hope they improve.",
                "Yes!! 100% recommend. It is a more relaxed, interdisciplinary CS credit that still introduces you to a cool number of topics. Grading is pretty nice, the assignments are very varied and fun and keep you on your toes, super enjoyable class overall!",
                "yes, for a fifth credit or easier cs elective. I think the topics are super interesting but I would've liked more interdisciplinary lectures about how everything is connected, as well as more in-depth slides and explanations",
                "Probably not",
                "Yes, despite being only taught for the first time, the topics were well structured and sincerely engaging. If you're interesting in cutting edge computer science and its applications, it's a good course.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in law + CS topics and / or are looking for low workload CS credit.",
                "Not really, unless you're a CS student that wants a humanities credit and you aren't feeling adventurous.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who has interest in either computer science or the law, and especially if they are interested in both. It is a great introduction to really young area of research, and the professors are both great.",
                "Do not take this course unless the professors explicitly say they have done lots of work to reorganize the assignments and objectives. Assignments would change, expectations would be set and then moved, deadlines would be unclear, requirements would be posted the day before an assignment was due. This class suffered immensely from a total lack of organization. Absolutely do not take this class unless the professors set out an ironclad schedule of assignments and topics from day one, because otherwise it will be a total roll of the dice."
