This course used a range of resources and exercises (movies, podcasts, books, and articles) to help me learn about themes of migration, indigenous culture, and the role of women in the Spanish-speaking world.",
                "Taught me new grammatical skills that are important in Spanish",
                "I think my Spanish speaking and listening abilities improved substantially. I also gained knowledge of some new verb tenses and nouns. Additionally, I learned something about some important topics in the Spanish-speaking world, including immigration, the situations of native peoples, and representations of/by women in art.",

                "This course is very conversational. I far prefer this style as opposed to grammar activities. The nightly homework was a perfect amount. It was not overwhelming, but it improved my engagement with the class and improved my language skills. No weaknesses come to mind.",
                "I really enjoyed the class. I felt that the homework made sense and was related to the material we learned in class, which was awesome. In some past Spanish classes, the work we did out of class felt disconnected from the work we did in class. That was not the case here. In class, we often had very interesting class discussions. This was an aspect I really enjoyed.",
                "Strengths: Learning grammar and expanding vocabulary indirectly through materials focused on subjects, rather than a direct study of language rules. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Seminars benefit from the commitment and activate participation of all members of the class. Without this engagement, the class felt slow, awkward, and boring at times.",
                "The structure of the course was poor. In real life if you make mistakes when speaking or writing you correct yourself and move on. However in this class you were punished for mistakes in grammar or speaking by points being taken off. This is to no fault of my professor, it is the fault of the department. The way that Spanish is taught here does not foster an environment of learning what so ever.",
                "Strengths: very engaging classes, good preparatory activities, interesting assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none really",
                "Strengths: small group discussions\r\nWeaknesses: some of the topics can be hard to discuss with limited Spanish vocab knowledge",
                "SPAN 140 (and Profe Russell) was especially great for growing my speaking abilities \r\n\r\nI wish there was more of a repetitive focus on learning verb tenses, as we were introduced to various new verb tenses this semester but I never memorized any of them or felt comfortable using them."

                "Yes. I appreciate how L4 Spanish departs from conventional grammar and spelling instruction. Instead, this class requires a level of critical thinking and engagement that I would rewarding.",
