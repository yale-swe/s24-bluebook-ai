                "I learned a lot about the oil industry around the world and its intersections with capitalism, democracy, colonialism, and culture. I also learned to think in critiques of the \"oil curse\" model, though I came into the semester engaged by it.",
                "Absolutely incredible engagement with anthropological research approaches and what makes oil different than any natural resource or phenomenon in the world's history. Most of our classes were spent critically analyzing and discussing narratives about how oil is used, perceived, and exploited around the world, in addition to how it is taken for granted and what sort of impact that may have on our future.",
                "This class really changed the way in which I think about myself and the world around me. ANTH 438 helped me develop a completely new framework for thinking about complex systems which has helped me inside and outside of the classroom. It was also the first time I'd never been exposed to some of anthropology's critiques of the social sciences. Easily one of my favorite courses that I've taken at Yale!",
                "I learned how to think about oil beyond a political science/economics framework. We read ethnographies that concretized what oil does, where it gets extracted, how profits get disembedded from place, and how it becomes consumed. I think oil often gets talked about within the context of the economy or geopolitical tension or national security. We definitely do talk about oil in these contexts, but with a critical eye attuned towards history, materiality, and people, to understand why and how oil becomes linked to these concepts.",
                "Anthropological thinking, highly conceptual and abstract modes of thinking",
                "I learned a ton about the history of oil and the cultures which surround oil production and consumption. I also learned about ethnographic practices and theories. I learned a lot about capitalism and marxism and how oil fits into these two ideologies and systems."

                "The course's strengths are an incredible set of books and articles, and a great professor. I will think about the books I read in this class for a long time. They were all fascinating critiques of the world.",
                "The reading list for this course is incredible  a huge, diverse arrangement of texts that is sure to include something for everyone. Rogers is also a great conversation facilitator. I appreciate how he brought together such an academically diverse group of students to learn from throughout the semester, in addition to how he left students to lead the direction of each week's conversations. While there is a lot of reading, it is one of the first classes where I really enjoyed every reading we did, and felt motivated doing them.",
                "Strengths: class was chill, we didn't have weekly reading responses and just needed to show up ready to discuss which I prefer, readings were structured well thematically.  Weaknesses: readings could get quite dense and I sometimes felt like there was much more to unpack in class than I was able to contribute toward",
                "Great course, perhaps discussions could be structured slightly more with guiding questions/themes to think about from the readings.",
                "This class was really amazing, in large part I think because there were only seven of us and everyone was super engaged. Despite the large amount of reading, everyone seemed to come to class having read everything and really to discuss. The readings were all amazing and I thought the weekly structure was well-designed. The more overarching information and theories at the beginning of the semester really furthered my understanding of the case studies we looked at after spring break. \r\n\r\nThe assignments were also well designed. I loved the structure of the midterm essay: we had about a week to write a 10-page essay from a set of sources. And I liked the final as well, and appreciated the chance to explore an area of my own interest.\r\n\r\nOverall I loved this class so much. Definitely take it if you have the chance."

                "I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone willing to learn to think about the world in ways they have not before. The course requires new kinds of critical thinking and approaches, but is very rewarding when following them through.",
                "100% yes! If you are interested in oil or natural resources in any way, this is a fascinating way to approach some of the most vexing questions our world faces. This class was also a fantastic introduction to anthropological methods, which peaked my interest and engagement with the class, in addition to re-thinking the way that I see the world. Professor Rogers is also a great facilitator of conversation while having such a wealth of knowledge around the topic  his passion truly shows through in how he plans and conducts the class.",
                "Absolutely!  As someone with little previous experience in anthropology courses, I found this class to be both accessible and fascinating. I think any student interested in developing a more critical understanding of the histories of global capitalism and oil extraction would greatly benefit from this class. The course is also perfect for anyone who has felt frustrated with the limitations of learning about oil strictly using political science or economics as an explanatory model.",
                "Yes! Professor rogers said that enrollment in the class fluctuates with oil prices - an interesting observation. Take the class even if oil prices are low!! It's a great example of how anthropology can disrupt dominant narratives of the way the world works (we completely demolish the resource curse for example)",
                "Absolutely, loved it!",
                "Yes! This class was so amazing. The readings were fascinating and I looked forward to class every week. It's definitely a lot (about a book a week) so make sure you have time to devote. But besides the readings, the other assignments were pretty manageable. The final paper is long but Professor Rogers helped us to start research early so I wasn't completely overwhelmed during finals week.\r\n\r\nOil plays such a massive role in our lives and this class did a great job of illuminating that from nuanced and manageable perspectives. Even as junior environmental studies major, so much of what I learned and read in this class was totally new and completely shifted my perspective on environmental issues and how to undo the power of oil. \r\n\r\nSo yes! Please take this class."
