   "comments": [
    "An ability to read economic history papers and interpret them both within a methodological framework and a historical one.",
    "I learned how to comprehend sometimes dense economic research papers and how to write comparative essays about them.",
    "I learned about how cliometricians and economic historians use econometrics to evaluate American Economic History.",
    "I learned about how Econ research is performed and read different studies about how Econ research is performed to reach data substantiated conclusions about existing historical questions.",
    "Each week, I learned about different themes in American economic history with topics ranging from institutions to migration to natural disasters. This class helped me connect several concepts to each other over time to understand the way the United States developed and how people reacted during certain times.",
    "Looked at a number of cases concerning economic development and its eventual effects.",
    "I learned about how economic historians think and make use of past events as a way to understand economic ideas put in practice.",
    "American Economics History knowledge",
    "History of American economics, divided into many topics like institution, slavery, migration, education, health, etc. Mostly from early 1800s.",
    "I learned how to derive the meaning and implications of econometric analyses applied to historical data, and how the results and conclusions of these studies can serve to inform public policy in modern day. Learning how to conceptualize a combined econometric and historical approach to answering questions and drawing conclusions was also extremely interesting and will likely prove useful to my future endeavors in conducting research.",
    "I feel like this class meant to teach me about different methods of econometrics, but having sat through every lecture and attended every discussion section, I can say without hyperbole that this class taught me nothing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very good assigned readings, insightful discussion in section. Papers were relatively interesting but topics could have been different for the 3 papers to make it more interesting. Lecture was highly methodologically focused, and a little more balance would have been nice.",
    "The lecturer this year was not very good. She was very timid and had problems commanding the classroom. Class was extremely dry, and this showed in lecture attendance.",
    "The issue with this course (as it is currently taught) is that it is not a course about American Economic History: its main focus is on the quantitative METHODOLOGY that cliometricians use to evaluate various claims about economic history. I think that econometrics should definitely be a pre-requisite for this course. In addition, the lectures were not particularly engaging. The strength of this course was the TA (David). In addition, for the first essay (which essentially boils down to a glorified compare and contrast assignment), it is not that clear what they are looking for.",
    "The strength of the course was that it was a very manageable workload.",
    "I like that the course covers a variety of concepts and tries to connect overarching themes. I think that the course has several weaknesses though. There is a low level of engagement with lectures and completing the readings each week. Lectures consisted of watching your lecturer read off the lecture slides and occasionally get carried away with deriving equations on the board. I think the class should consist more on the themes and time periods rather than specific papers. Also, the readings each week are fairly advanced and can at times go over your head. I don't know how useful these articles are and they're difficult to keep track of throughout the semester when the time comes to start preparing for exams and papers.",
    "Lecture was really boring but section was solod.",
    "I find it dissatisfying that the grades students get in the class would highly depend on who the TA is. From essay grading, exam grading, to class participation, everything depends on the TA rather than the lecturer herself. I am not sure how fair of a system this is, since grading can be very subjective. I would have hoped that the lecturer could, for instance, be the one who grades exams. It would also be possible for students' works to be graded randomly by other TAs.",
    "Lectures can be more interesting.",
    "Topics are interesting. Lectures could be more engaging.",
    "I really appreciated when the course would apply economic history to current politics, and I believe that it could be approved if this was done more frequently.",
    "A major strength of this course was the experience of the Teaching Fellows. My TF was extremely helpful in explaining the crossover between history and economics, as well as expanding upon the papers we read and discussed in class. A major weakness was its focus on essay writing -- I think a slightly more varied testing format would have better suited a wider variety of students and their learning and testing styles.",
    "The one good thing I can say about this course was that lecture notes were posted online. Lecture was always a waste of time as everything said in lecture could have been learned from the readings, which were overwhelmingly dry and boring.",
    "The readings correlated nicely with the course material."

   "comments": [
    "A great class if you are interested in America's economic past or methodological questions in economics.",
    "I would recommend it to a student if and only if they were able to ensure they got a good section leader (teaching fellow). I had a great TF and this really made the class for me. He provided me with detailed feedback and led engaging sections. Lecture, on the other hand, is not that appealing.",
    "No, unless you need a relatively easy writing credit.",
    "This class is taught by a different instructor every year so everybodys experience vastly differs. This year I would not have recommended it because I wanted to take more of a history class, and this class basically consisted of reading research papers and then studying the data driven approach the researchers took to answer historical questions. However it was not an overview of what had actually occurred, or the role of banking in American History etc.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they enjoy reading and writing. I think that the course is very do-able and one can receive a pretty good grade if they put in the work. A student must be willing to read and comprehend approximately two thirty-page papers each week and be prepared to discuss them during section. Later, the student must be able to compare any two papers on a deeper level whether based on their ideas or structures or methodologies. I found that a lot of students weren't enjoying the course but just trying to get their credit for completing the course.",
    "I'm not sure that I would. If you're an Econ major it's an efficient writing credit, but as someone who took this class because of an underlying interest in American History, it sort of fell short. Too dry not enough interesting information.",
    "Yes, I found it really fun especially looking at the course as a STEM major. The subject of study really involves many disciplines and can be thought-provoking for everyone.",
    "The content is interesting but the lectures are not.",
    "Yes!",
    "meh",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in learning more regarding the applicability of econometric analyses and approaches to historical data. History-inclined students who would like to learn more about the health of the economy and relationship between the economy and health, globalization, and other factors in the context of American history would also find this class interesting and useful. The assignments are fair, and I honed my ability to write comparative analyses over the course of this semester.",
    "No. Do not take this class. So many of my friends warned me not to take this class and I ignores them, and it was one of my biggest regrets at Yale. I cannot overstate how boring this class was.",
    "Yes.  If you do the readings, it is very interesting and easy to follow."
