Also, the huge of amount of exposure that we had to media, our professor, and recommended outside content was really nice for developing a instinctual idea of how the language structure works, how it sounds, and mannerisms that might be different from English.

                "They cut the in-person instruction down from five days to three, but still tried to fit in the same amount of material. I don't think I could ever learn Spanish just on my own. They should go back to five days a week of instruction, or reduce the amount of stuff we're supposed to learn by 40%.",
                "I think it's really hard to teach language over Zoom. I think having discussion in breakout rooms frequently was useful, but it's hard to simulate the level of engagement we get from in person learning. I found the class to be relatively well organized, although at times it seemed to move a bit fast. It was frustrating having the exams so focused on writing, rather than grammar and vocabulary directly. They felt a bit redundant with the compositions.",
                "The strengths of the course this year was the information on grammar. Some weaknesses are not having group discussions out of breakout groups. It could have been improved by maybe talking together as a class.",
                "Strengths: The class was taught completely in Spanish so you were immersed in thinking and communicating using the language. That also means you figure out how to have casual conversations, do a bit of analysis, and sort out confusions or questions using the language, which was a good skill to work on. Because the class met or had assignments so often, you really start to get an instinct for how to speak and write in the language. The every-other-day structure for synchronous and asynchronous classes worked really well for maintaining a sense of engagement in the class while having time to do work and reflect on new content. All the students in the class were also super easy to work with, and we were given plenty of opportunities to work together in breakout rooms and get to know everyone else in the class. Most of the semester we had daily homework and we were provided an excess amount of resources for any given unit or lesson, so there was always work to do, but it was always manageable. \r\nWeaknesses: If you don't prepare a little bit, the transition into the class in the first few weeks can be a bit difficult. Having to communicate the source of misunderstandings or things that were unclear can be a bit difficult. My experience with the professor in these first few weeks was a bit up and down because of this obstacles and some lack of transparency.",
                "Strengths - Consistent practice of the Spanish language in order to learn quickly and effectively. Some enjoyable readings and movies scattered throughout the class. Great professors!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Homework can be time-consuming and monotonous as there are assigned homework every night. Grading can be tough. Large time commitment.",
                "The strength was definitely the consistent schedule and how there was work almost everyday. This made the course's pace very smooth and I felt like I was learning a bit every day. My professor (Diaz) was also so kind and always available to talk or answer questions.",
                "This course had many strengths, including its variety of course material that always kept the students engaged and focused. It could be improved by doing more group activity in which students had to speak in front of everyone to test their oral skills.",
                "Strengths: Class was usually enjoyable as the professor used a lot of breakout rooms to make the work collaborative. If you put in the work you will improve a lot. I got a lot of helpful feedback on compositions that I wrote.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The asynchronous activities were sometimes unhelpful. A lot of times powerpoints and worksheets were posted for you to click through or do, and this wasn't very engaging. Additionally, a lot of material was posted on these days, which felt overwhelming. \r\n\r\nImprovements: I think posting less files on the asynchronous days would help. I also thinking making most of the asynchronous activities centered around reading stories, watching short films, or other Spanish media would be the best use of that time.",

                "I feel like we rarely got the right balance of breakout rooms. We either never went to breakout rooms, which I thought was just a wasted class when it came to trying to learn a language, or we spent the whole class in a breakout room with another student, which got stale after a bit and I felt like I wasn't getting enough instruction. So we could have struck a better balance.",

                "Zoom lessons and activities actually felt really smooth and natural in this class. Breakout rooms worked really well for pair or group work, screen sharing worked fine for teaching concepts, and the professor did a good job of engaging the class. Of course, screen-sharing didn't really work well for showing videos to the class, but there wasn't much need for that anyway so it wasn't a big issue.",
                "asynchronous activities were helpful as they could be done whenever. Meeting 3 days a week made the class more managable.",
                "Having live lectures only three times a week was very helpful and having all tests at the same time made it easy for scheduling. Breakout rooms were utilized very well and I got to talk to each one of my classmates through Zoom.",
                "The asynchronous days were a success, because everyone was held accountable for completing the work that was clearly laid out for us on the syllabus and in class because the material would be the focus of the next synchronous day. The synchronous lectures were always lively and fun to attend. Although, the format of each synchronous lesson only fluctuated between 2 different ways of learning: being lectured in the big Zoom or being able to talk with a partner in a breakout room. This is just an overall characteristic of online learning that I'm not sure could have been altered either way.",
                "I think using breakout rooms in class a lot really functioned well and made the class more enjoyable and productive. I think the asynchronous activities were usually not engaging.

                "Yes, overall the class was pretty well-organized and I felt like I grew a lot. First of all, I was pretty nervous coming into the class because I didn't really know what to expect and worried it would be really intense or I'd get lost, and that simply wasn't the case - by the end of the semester, I felt like I had a good grasp of expectations, understood the professor's style of teaching, and really enjoyed the class environment. At the same, I had some difficulty with the professor and understanding the assignments at the start of the semester. Getting in touch with other students was super helpful, and any real issues I had worked themselves out over time, so, to reiterate, yes I would recommend the class because it was really good for improving at the language and the class itself was fun, but that also comes with relatively daily work and a potentially challenging introduction to the format of the class.",
