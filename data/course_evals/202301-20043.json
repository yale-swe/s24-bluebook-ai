                "The professors are all very nice and want to engage with you and answer your questions, but the course itself is structured very poorly. It is so much work and I don't feel that I actually learned that much because of how it was set up. It is actually absurd that this class is just 0.5 credit and not even a writing credit. The lab reports were 5,000-6,000 words each single spaced 11 point font, 0.5 margins and we had to do 2 of those plus 4 other mini modules. Most of the modules it is really hard to actually learn, especially the last one. Although the professor tried to include all of us, it was really hard to have that many people learning when only one person could be working on matlab at once. I really think to make it easier on the students there should be like lab reports due every week for completion and then for the last one you have to compile all of them and turn it into the full lab report. Junior year spring BME classes are so hard and it is very easy to fall behind. Doing this would help the students stay on top of their work",
                "The modules were all very interesting and each covered a unique and interesting aspect of biomedical engineering. The professors and TFs were very nice and helpful during experiments. However, the structure of lab reports for the 1st and 3rd module are ridiculous. I wrote 7000 words for the first report and 8000 words for the second. The course is only a half credit and not a writing credit. Writing a formal lab report added little to no value to my understanding of the material. The short form lab report in module two was helpful for understanding and had much less busy work.",
                "The lab report format was extremely difficult, with many students writing over 30 pages and 10,000 words per report. The extremely time-intensive structure of the report was not ideal for student workload, especially around exam times. Or, this should be a full credit class.",
                "this is a great course to teach the fundamentals (wet-lab, image processing, NMR analysis) that you would often see in in BME labs.",
                "I would much prefer having lab report assignments be organized by the week that they were due, rather than having a single module consisting of three\/four weeks' worth of information compiled into a single report.",
                "I liked the portion that was hands on",
                "Strengths: I loved the first two modules because they were so hands-on. It was great to have a procedure to follow but in a low-stakes environment where we were not graded on the success of our experiment - rather, we wrote lab reports that showed our conceptual understanding of the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lab reports were sometimes quite tedious and unnecessarily long. Also, the third module was not hands-on at all - rather, it was more lecture\/demonstration style. It was quite a large time commitment to go all the way to the med school just to see a demonstration and lecture - perhaps this module would benefit from having video lectures that students can view on their own time.",
                "I think that the hands-on portion of the lab was way more valuable compared to the MATLAB portion of the lab or the NMR module. There is a lack of engagement with the other modules as the students are merely observing and following a tutorial from the instructions. Perhaps some of the other modules can incorporate more hands-on tools such as using a LIDAR scanner to scan a femur and use MATLAB to reconstruct the object.",
                "The structure of this course allows for in depth learning in three separate areas, which was a strength. Also, lab reports are due at the end of each module which gives students the freedom to plan out and pace their work."

                "Overall, this course was pretty organized, engaging, and insightful. It was different from 355 in that there are 3 four-week modules instead of a new lab every week. I liked this structure, however it did mean that the lab reports were quite long and thorough. You really have to pace yourself and make sure you have several days (ideally a week) to complete it. 356 is a significant step up in workload from the other 0.5 lab requirements for BME, so it was unfortunate that we couldn't get a writing credit, or at least 1.0 credit, for the class.",
