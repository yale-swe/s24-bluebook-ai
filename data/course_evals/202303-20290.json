We covered a wide variety of topics that kept the lectures interesting and the professor and TAs were all very helpful in class and in office hours explaining difficult topics and working with us on the psets.",
                "Not much. The class was very poorly taught and we had to teach ourselves all of the content out of the textbook. I wish I had learned more because quantum is a really interesting and honestly not super challenging subject to understand if taught correctly.",
                "This class, while it did teach me the basics of quantum mechanics (though not rigorously) was not thorough or coherent enough for me to feel like I learned anything. There was an extreme disconnect between what we were learning in class and what was on our PSets, and there was clearly a strong lack of communication between Prof Schoelkopf and our TAs. Schoelkopf himself is clearly much more interested in his research and his startup, and it shows in the quality of this course. His lecture notes were absolutely illegible, so I was better off learning the course on my own through the textbook and from notes from previous years. He also cancelled 3 of our classes (and had to get a substitute for another 2) -- considering our class size and the cost of tuition, he owes us all a combined $600,000 in tuition money. Maybe administrators should consider this loss of teaching time in addition to the grant money that he brings in. The physics curriculum deserves better.",

                "The course was very poorly organized. The TAs are tasked with making our psets but our professor did not communicate with them making very difficult and time consuming. This also made studying for exams very stressful since we didn't know which content to prioritize and were told conflicting information about what would be on it.",
                "Mostly weaknesses. Prof Schoelkopf cancelled 4 of our 26 lectures and didn't make up that content, and also had a substitute teacher for another 2 classes. The TAs had to write the problem sets but didn't know what we'd been taught in class because the professor didn't communicate with them, so the content covered on the psets was completely different than the lecture content - it was like taking 2 different classes at once. The professor was very busy, had very limited office hours, and didn't seem to care about teaching us. He's a very nice guy but I didn't understand his lectures, and I had to essentially teach myself the entire course using the textbook at the end of the semester leading up to the final. I think I would have been better off skipping lecture and just reading the textbook throughout the semester. The professor posted lecture notes, but his handwriting is barely legible so they weren't much help. Luckily, the content itself is not impossible compared to some other physics classes, so teaching it to yourself is doable. The midterm was entirely unreasonable, but at least it was curved very hard.",
                "This course was exceptionally poorly organized: the TA's wrote our PSets, but they didn't take the class with us and had to guess what should be on the PSets. This led to us learning wildly different material on the homeworks compared to in lecture. I cannot emphasize how confused we all were in this class. Prof Schoelkopf offered us a scan of handwritten lecture notes from 2011 which NONE OF US COULD READ, meaning the lectures were the first and only time we could ever see or learn the content of this class (outside of the textbook). \r\n\r\nTo improve this course, I would suggest the following:\r\n1. Please try to attend every course if you can; you are being paid to do so and we expect to be taught consistently. \r\n2. Please write the psets tailored to the course material (i.e. instead of having the TAs guess). \r\n3. Please offer better course notes that we can use to study later.\r\n\r\nThis course has a ton of potential to be great -- quantum mechanics is amazing! In its current form, though, I cannot recommend this course.",
                "Strengths: Schoelkopf is kind and clearly enjoys teaching introductory quantum; Griffiths is a great textbook, the TAs cared about helping us learn. Weaknesses: one of the most disorganized classes I've ever taken, unclear expectations on the exams, some kind of disconnect between the professor and the TAs that led to brutal problem sets that were sometimes disconnected from the lectures.",
                "Strengths: the material is extremely interesting and professor Schoelkopf is a great lecturer. The TAs were incredible.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class was very disorganized at times and there seemed to be a discrepancy between what we learned in class and what was covered on the psets. That said, there was a lot of support to guide us through the psets.",

                "No, not if it's taught by Prof Schoelkopf. He's a very nice and smart person but he just doesn't care about teaching. We would have been better off just reading the textbook and skipping lecture. The TAs were the ones writing the problem sets, but they didn't know what we were being taught in class and the professor didn't communicate with them so the problem sets weren't related to what we were doing in class. The lecture notes the prof posted weren't legible. He also cancelled and didn't make up 4 of the 26 lectures and had a substitute prof for another 2 lectures.",
                "No. This course is not well organized enough to be worth taking in its current form.",
                "Unfortunately, this class just felt unmanageable. There seemed to be disconnect between the TAs, who seemed to expect much more from us, and Prof. Shoelkopf, who seemed to expect our horrific midterm distribution. The problem sets were FAR too long. Instead of learning what was happening in the problem sets, every week was a push to have the answers. You cant learn quantum without doing painstaking calculations, but it was every part of every problem and I completely lost sight of the bigger picture every week. There were not enough office hours to compensate for this. Lectures were well-thought-out but occasionally incomprehensible; Schoelkopf would go through wildly complex derivations without pausing to make sure anyone understood. His lecture notes were unhelpful and posted sporadically; the bright side was that Griffiths is a great textbook to learn from. Preparing for exams was problematic. Lectures and problem sets were occasionally cancelled on short notice with no real backup plan, so it sometimes felt we did not cover or practice important concepts before exams. For the final, it was incredibly unclear what we would be responsible for knowing; each of the teaching staff had different answers and many of the topics were removed over time, making the practice problems we actually were provided irrelevant. With all of that said, grading (at least on the midterm) was very fair given the class distribution. The TAs were great and definitely trying their best to help us. I'm not sure I would take this class again over 440 if I knew how disorganized it would end up being.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Quantum mechanics is absolutely a hard class regardless of where you take it so definitely be prepared to spend a lot of time reviewing the textbook and working on the psets. That said youll walk away from the semester with a completely new understanding of physics and a solid foundational skill set.",
