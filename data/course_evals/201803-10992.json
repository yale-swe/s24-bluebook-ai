    "creativity, clear communication, interest in reading and writing fine prose",
    "It's hard to express how much this class meant to me. Which is ironic because I feel so much more comfortable as a writer after taking Verlyn's class.\r\n\r\nI know this sounds incredibly corny, but the class for me was as much about life as it is about writing. I'm coming away both more confident and more calm with the fact that I want writing to be a major component in my life. But in the Yale writing workshop gauntlet, writing can feel like a direct reflection of your self-worth. Verlyn broke that down for me in the best way possible. He has a particular worldview, which I'm sure he doesn't think is remarkable, but is what makes his workshop so pleasant and downright powerful.\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt one of the three best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "I became a much clearer writer, a more capable editor, and a better thinker overall. I cannot thank Prof K enough for the time and energy that he invested into spreading his philosophy of writing to us.",
    "I learned how to write. Seriously. There's so much I could say here, but that's the core of it. Verlyn taught me how to REALLY write -- how to make clear, uncomplicated prose. It's a skill I've found to be missing from other writing courses I've taken at Yale, and quite frankly, from academic writing as a whole. To practice achieving complexity through lucid sentences: that's the priority (and the gift!) of this course. I gained a lot of confidence in myself as a writer because Verlyn really encouraged us to trust ourselves and our observations. By extension, I developed a sharper personal intuition for the quality of my writing; I'm no longer dependent upon grades as a singular assessment. The two-page guideline also helped me develop a better sense of scope. I learned to quit thinking in terms of beginnings or endings and just focus on the immediate clarity of my sentences\/ideas. Absolutely the most valuable writing course at Yale.",
    "I learned how to craft clear and streamlined sentences, and improved my prose.",
    "I learned how to write better sentences. In particular, I now have a much better sense for what makes a sentence NOT work. Most people can hear that a sentence is awkward if they read it aloud, but they can't pinpoint the problem and therefore can't correct it. Verlyn teaches his students how to identify the poorly chosen word, overblown metaphor, or convoluted grammatical construction that makes a sentence awkward. I've also learned how to be more spontaneous in my own writing and to let my pieces evolve naturally.",
    "I learned how to write clear sentences.",
    "Everybody knows writing is hard, and this course makes it harder. Not because you have to memorize convoluted sentence structures or write ten, ten-page papers, but because writing good prose in two pages is excruciatingly difficult. And you learn that quickly. Verlyn teaches you how to teach yourself how to write better. The impetus behind the learning in this course is your own effort, guided by the extremely relevant, pointed comments Verlyn provides you each week on your piece. Everyone learns something different in this course. I think I've become better at judging my own writing, writing when I need to, and reading other peoples' writing. If those things are important to you, take this course. If they aren't, take this course anyway and learn something else.",
    "I greatly improved my writing, and learned Verlyns philosophy on what it means to write well. I became more precise and straightforward in my prose, and more creative in the structure of the pieces."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There are no weaknesses. My procrastinatory tendencies are the only reason this class caused me anything other than joy. You write 2 pages of prose each week, read your peers' pieces, the assigned reading, and talk it all over in class.\r\n\r\nThe time and care that Verlyn puts into editing everyone's pieces is clear. Or maybe he doesn't need to spend much time on them, he's just that good at what he does. Regardless, his feedback is consistently incisive andmore importantlyproductive. He helps you grow week-to-week.",
    "Strengths: Professor K's personal interest in each of us as individual writers and how to make us grow and progress along our own paths.\r\nWeaknesses: For those of us who essentially wrote the same format of paper many weeks in a row (me with a streak of like 5 personal essays) I would have loved encouragement to do something different earlier on in the course.",
    "Strengths: everything, honestly. Verlyn is an incredible professor.  He knows how to honestly challenge his students, and he does so in a way that strips away all the artificial anxiety\/overthinking we've been taught to ascribe to the writing process. There was no focus on comparing students in the class, assigning grades to pieces, or even creating a linearity of development week-to-week. Verlyn supports YOU as a writer and thinker and noticer of the world. The seminar environment is at once relaxed and invigorating, especially when workshopping each others' pieces. Office hours are also incredible -- go to them!!!!! The opportunity to sit down with Verlyn outside of class was a huge strength of the course. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "Stengths: Excellent readings, great feedback, peer workshop",
    "The \"some sentences\" component of each course was exceedingly useful. The readings were all interesting, and Verlyn did a good job leading class discussions. I wish that there had been more discussion of the revision process and that we had ended the semester by revising some of our earlier pieces. Not revising any of them was a wasted opportunity. I'm also very ambivalent about having the instructor read student pieces. Reading your own work helps you grow as a writer; it develops your ear and can help you develop self-confidence. I don't think we learned nearly as much from having Verlyn read our pieces for us as we would have from reading them ourselves.",
    "The seminar setting is very enjoyable. It allowed us to learn in a low pressure environment.",
    "The strengths are definitely Verlyn's abilities to teach and provide helpful criticism on almost any kind of writing. Your peers are also a huge plus in this class, and you learn something new from their writing every week. One point of weakness may be that many of the lessons learned in this class are vague (but elegant, like a Buddhist koan). They require extra thinking time to really understand.",
    "Our assignment each week was to write two pages about anything. This simple structure tailors the course effectively to each student. Verlyn edited our pieces each week, and in class we read excerpts from great writers, edited our worst sentences, and workshopped student pieces. No weaknesses to speak of."

    "yes absolutely !",
    "Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes\r\n\r\nIf you like writing, try to learn writing from Verlyn. I'm coming away a happier person, as well as an immeasurably better writer.",
    "Yes yes yes absolutely!",
    "MUST-TAKE. If you get in, ABSOLUTELY take it. Don't be afraid to apply in the first place -- Verlyn selects a great mix of people, and there's no pressure to have extreme writing experience. (If anything, you'll unlearn all the harmful habits that other writing experiences have given you!!)  This is not a chance to pass up. Verlyn is a dedicated and inspiring person to learn from, and he'll make you a better writer. He's blunt in his feedback but in the most supportive, stress-free way possible. This course is such a gift and by far my favorite at Yale. Highly, highly recommend.",
    "Absolutely- For anyone either looking to improve their writing or to achieve a better understanding of language. This course teaches you to improve your writing in ways that no other class has for me.",
    "Absolutely. If you care about sentence-level writing -- i.e., if you're the sort of person who will happily spend ten to twenty minutes trying to perfect ten to twenty words -- then you'll get a lot out of ENGL 474. Verlyn is remarkably insightful, caring, and good at leading class discussions. You won't write any long pieces, which felt strange to me in a creative writing course, but you will write every week (and get line-by-line feedback every week). At some points, 474 felt almost like a course in poetry: Verlyn pays that much attention to words and rhythm in prose, and he expects his students to do the same. You also have a great deal of freedom to write about different subjects and in different styles.",
    "Yes ! It's a great writing seminar.",
    "Take this class if you can! You're guaranteed to learn several things about what makes you a better writer. If you ever wanted to experiment weekly with your writing, this is the perfect place to do it. I realize I'll have very few chances in my life again to have someone like Verlyn critique my writing. He is super helpful, and will always guide you on the write path.",
    "I absolutely recommend Genre. The class was a fun and supportive learning environment, while also providing critical feedback so that everyone improved. We were encouraged to challenge ourselves. It was so fun to read everyone elses pieces each week, and Verlyn was a pleasure to learn from. I would scribble down his comments word-for-word because they were so well-stated. One of my favorite classes in four years at Yale."
