You learn both how to solve these equations as well as some of the theoretical aspects."

                "The professor is amazing and a great plus for taking the course. The course does a really good job of furthering the ideas from ODE and engaging the students further. I would say that some parts of the course are a lot more theoretical/proof base than other parts, which can be off-putting and disengaging.",

                "The strengths are that it is interesting material  perhaps a slight weakness is that some of it (Greens functions) can be a bit conceptually challenging. I enjoyed the class.",
                "Strengths\r\nA Math class that actually delves into real world applications\r\nThose real world applications provide for better visualizations and make it easier to engage with the material\r\nGood pacing, I never really felt like the class was going too fast, which is nice since often times Yale math classes can feel like your being waterboarded by info and you have to commit to not really understanding things so as to pass the course.\r\nWeaknesses\r\nWhen there is no visualization, the content is generally extremely difficult to grasp.\r\nConcepts that were introduced under the assumption that we wouldn't understand them. If we won't be focusing on something like Bessel's equations maybe it'd be better to focus more on other difficult topics in the course instead of diverting time to such things"

                "Absolutely!  A fun math elective for applied math or pure math majors, especially if you prefer computational math rather than proof-based.",
                "I would recommend this class to any stem major looking to further develop their skills with differential equations.",
                "Yes, simply because Professor Hiltunen is such a great professor and the material is really valuable.",
                "I would recommend this course if (1) ordinary diff eqs were relatively easy and (2) enjoyable. This course is definitely harder conceptually so if 246 was a struggle it might not be the right fit. But it is enjoyable and the small class size is nice as well.",
                "The course material is often presented in terms of practical applications: things like the motion of waves and the diffusion of heat; This makes it easier to engage with the material. Professor Hiltunen in particular was a great professor; his chalkboard notes were superb and his passion for the field brightened the classroom. Psets took generally took around 6-8 hours, but there was often 1 problem per Pset that seemed incomprehensible and that you'd need office hours to complete satisfactorily, so keep that in mind. The material fluctuates in difficulty; some portions were as simple as plug and chug; other's were barely understandable even after going to office hours and rereading the textbook 3 times (Green's Theorem is weird). But even so Professor Hiltunen was acutely aware of the relative difficulty of each portion of the course and invested class time and adjusted expectation accordingly, so even the hard portions weren't too bad. Because many parts of the course have physics correspondences it's easier to have that moment where you think \"oh I get it now.\" Overall, taking this course with Professor Hiltunen has definitely been the most engaged I've been with an upper-level math class at Yale and I would definitely recommend taking it."
