    "This course taught me, true to its name, Elementary MSA at an L2 level. Though we only learn MSA, it's a critical step on the path to fluency in Arabic. Learning this language at Yale also does such a good job of demythicizing the Middle East: as Americans, we are taught a specific narrative, and learning about the culture of Middle Eastern countries through the language does a great job of debunking these myths."

    "Strength: Ustadha Al Ani. She is easily one of the best teachers I've had at Yale, incredibly nice, super smart, and just a wonderful human being.\r\nStrength: This class teaches you Arabic at an L2 level really quickly. \r\nStrength: Because it's summer session, there are not a lot of students. We had a two person class, which is wonderful for a language because a) our participation was by necessity high, and b) our teacher gave us a lot of personalized feedback.\r\nStrength: a lot of contact hours of Arabic\r\nWeaknesses: Because summer session is only 5 weeks, it's definitely crammed. That said, I still would take this course again."

    "Yes, most definitely. L2 with Professor Al Ani was wonderful, and also because of the nature of summer session we had a 2-person class, which helped with participation and hands-on learning as well as teacher feedback. Also, I had so much fun in class, I felt like I got a lot better at Arabic, and I'm prepared for L3! \r\n\r\nI would caution the student that this course is a lot of work, and not for the faint of heart. After our 3 hour class I'd typically have about 3 hours of homework, and the homework (because of it's for a language) is not easy."
