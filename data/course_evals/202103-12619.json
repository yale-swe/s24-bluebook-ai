                "I learned the cultural impact of Renaissance Italian art (not only paintings but also architecture and objects) at the time it was created as well as today. I developed the ability to close \"read\" and analyze works of art and interpret their potential meaning based on trends and historical themes of the time.",
                "This course taught me how to analyze art both in terms of its composition as well as in terms of its place in history. I learned multiple types of works and trends that became popular during the Italian Renaissance.",
                "Before this class, I (a senior majoring in a very unrelated field) knew next to nothing about Italian Renaissance Art except for names like Leonardo and Michelangelo, and now I feel like I've learned so much more about different mediums (sculpture, painting, engravings). The culture surrounding Renaissance Art like patronage, competition, and innovation were super interesting. I've enjoyed art history a lot, and for my last semester here I'm going to try to take two more art history courses.",

                "Strength: weekly tour to YUAG, detailed instructions from Professor and TF, interesting arrangements and comprehensive introduction to art and history\r\nWeakness: too many Italian words to memorize",

                "strength: the professor is really passionate about the subject\r\nweakness: No discussion on the readings in discussion section",
                "Strengths: the syllabus. The lecture-section format. Professor Ng. TF was fantastic (Keto). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures not recorded unless you have accommodations.",
                "The strengths of this course include Professor Ng. He was an amazing lecturer and his lectures were always well-composed and interesting. I appreciated how he always included other perspectives and challenged the ideas of what Italy is and what Italian Renaissance art is. Additionally, being able to go to YUAG during sections was an additional strength. The weaknesses \/ areas of improvement for the course is first that we were required to memorize ~75 pieces of art for the final, which I found to be a lot and would have appreciated a little less.",
                "Strengths: The lectures are clear, well-organized, and fascinating! Even without any art history background, I could easily follow the lectures and learn so much about Italian Renaissance Art thanks to Professor Ng. He does an excellent job introducing art history terminology and at the same time explaining how the Renaissance artwork embodies them. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is a lot to memorize for the midterm and final exams. I ended up memorizing them at the very last minute, so it might be helpful to have some quizzes along the way to make midterm and final season a bit less stressful.",
                "The course was highly interesting, engaging, and the trips to the YUAG were fascinating. I learned so much about the Renaissance but also art in general. The instructor and teaching assistants were knowledgeable and always willing to help and clarify assignments.",
                "Strengths: Very detailed analysis of the Renaissance and the big trends that took part during this part of history\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes the nonlinear parts of the course structure could be slightly confusing",
                "Strengths: Professor Ng was great. I find it really hard to listen to live lectures, but I was engrossed in his lectures! I looked forward to class. My TA, Stephanie, was really amazing as well. Great teachers for sure. The sections were sometimes conducted in the art gallery, and I appreciated that we could directly see the art (nice change of pace from my other classes). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: ugh the IDs on the exams were really annoying, especially memorizing the exact years. I understand how IDs are sort of a necessary evil, because as I was reviewing my flashcards, I was able to connect what I've learned and such. But yeah, the rote memorization kind of sucks because for example, out of ~80 works for the final, only 5 were ID questions. This is probably an unpopular opinion, but I feel like there needed to be more IDs to be worth the time I spent memorizing everything.",
                "Great lectures! Sometimes sections were a little bland but otherwise no weaknesses.",
                "the exams were all over the place, and very hard to prepare for. there was an unwieldy amount of information to know, and lectures were always jam-packed with info, and lectures always went over class time. there was not an in-person review session held for the final, only office hours, and that was very challenging and disappointing",
                "Professor Ng is very charismatic and engaging. His lecturing style is the exact opposite of reading off the slides, which makes lectures more enjoyable, though at the cost of the increased difficulty of studying for exams if your notes aren't extremely detailed. The textbook helps a lot for remembering information about starred artworks (which can be subject to slide identification and have to be referenced in essay questions on the exams), but it can be less useful for understanding the broader themes of the course (or at least the sections assigned in the syllabus aren't too helpful for revising). The TAs are all very knowledgeable about Renaissance art, and you can learn many interesting stories and interpretations beyond the scope of the lectures from them. Sections in the art gallery give students a chance to practice analyzing and discussing art in a way that the papers and exams require.",
                "Great lectures and sections in gallery",
                "Lecture was disorganized \r\nSection was engaging",
                "The course is too much information thrown at you. I think slowing down and focusing on less objects would be more efficient. The course also has you memorize too many pieces to the point you will forget the next day.",
                "strengths: interesting content\r\nweaknesses: teaching through straight memorization was not conducive to long-term learning and retention",
                "Really enjoyed having section in the YUAG and the projects of the course. I liked being able to pick my own works to write about, and I felt personally connected. The exams felt comprehensive and appropriate."

                "Yes, if you would like an introduction to Italian art.",
                "Yes. It is a wonderful opportunity to learn about a very important period of art history. Professor Ngs outlook on the Renaissance is one I had not explored before; he acknowledges the politics of the period and the ways in which the Renaissance excludes groups from the narrative, like POC. This was so important.",
                "This is a great course to get an introduction to the Italian Renaissance and art in general.  The lectures, paired with the sections in the YUAG, make for a very enjoyable learning experience.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course! Although I had never taken a history of art class before, I found this class super interesting and accessible. It was great to learn about canonical works of art as well as how to conduct visual analysis. Professor Ng is amazing; his lectures were very well-composed and interesting.",
                "YES! Even though it is listed as a 200 level class, the class is super welcoming towards students without any background in art history. You learn a lot without having to struggle too much compared to other classes.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, please take this course, especially if you are a STEM major! While the writing assignments may seem daunting, they were so fun and allowed me to engage more fully with the material. This is one of my favorite classes I took at Yale, and I am so happy I took it before graduating.",
                "Yes! This course was very interesting and taught me much more than I could have imagined about the Renaissance. This course is an excellent intro to art history course that is engaging and understandable.",
                "Yes! Not too time consuming (there was essentially no work in between the exams and papers), and I really enjoyed writing the essays, actually (I usually hate writing haha). The comparison between past and present was one of my favorite essays to write, and I almost wished the length requirement was longer. I guess it's a bit annoying to have both a final paper and final exam, but it's spaced out enough (Dec 6 for the essay, Dec 17 for the exam) that it's very tolerable. Definitely go to the lectures, though! They were super great, and I learned a lot each time. \r\n\r\nAlso, as a senior, I can say that this was one of my favorite classes at Yale :)",
                "Yes! I would recommend this to all majors.",
                "I would watch out for the exams. as an art history major, I know how to study well for them and do well on them, but this class was a challenge because material that was not part of the big ideas of the course was always on the exam. so watch out for the exams in this course, they will put the most random and obscure artworks up, rather than the ones that contribute to the major part of course, and ones that you do not have a lot of notes on from lecture will appear",
                "Yes, to students interested in the historical development of visual art in Europe or the history\/culture of the Renaissance more broadly. Though it's not explicitly set up as an \"introduction to art history\" class, it is definitely appropriate for people who have not taken art history classes before. This class serves as an introduction to the Italian Renaissance, so it covers similar ground to what a general-purpose art history intro course would for this period, rather than focus on the more \"obscure\" content like that in the early chapters of the textbook. However, it goes into greater depth and includes more coverage of sculpture and architecture, in addition to offering some fresh perspectives on the art of southern Italy, connections to the Islamic world, and artistic inspirations from the conquest of the Americas.",
                "Yes",
                "No, I thought the lectures were poorly organized.",
                "I would not. The course doesnt encourage well rounded learning. Its just tons of information thrown at you and you have to memorize ransoms things. I dont think it makes you a better art historian.",
                "yes, because the content is interesting but no because the tests with straight memorization was not a great way of learning",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed it and it helped me balance out my classes. I think it covered just enough of history to be in depth but still not too niche. The lectures were always interesting!",
                "I would recommend this course--the level of interest and engagement outweighed the work, and the teaching itself was excellent."
