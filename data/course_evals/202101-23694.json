                "This class taught me to investigate the many narratives surrounding Africa and question who is producing them, who stands to benefit from them, and who they are harming. We look at many different arenas (political, historic, development, migration, etc) and look at a wide variety of narratives.",
                "Gained vast knowledge on the african continent - particulary knowledge not distorted by western perspectives. I learnt so much and grew so much in my engagement with a misunderstood continent",
                "I learned about the historical contexts for how the West perceives Africa and knowledge production around the continent that contributes to its underdevelopment to this day. This class was incredibly insightful and helpful in understanding the underpinnings of Africa's place in the world and the impact colonialism and imperialism have had on it.",
                "I gained a better understanding of African thought, history, philosophies, and movements, in addition to developing analytical and critical thinking skills.",
                "Africa in the World is a thought-provoking course that made me reflect upon the lenses from which I viewed Africa. We studied the continent from a variety of different perspectives, which I found quite refreshing. This class taught me how to read academic papers and pick out the main ideas to discuss in class.",
                "This course was absolutely wonderful! I learned a lot about how to distance myself from an American centric narrative when thinking about and talking through issues, movements, and phenomenons on the continent and through that process learned so much more about Africa than I would of in another course. Taking this course has really helped me appreciate that there is scholarship in every discipline explicitly written by and made for Africans",
                "I think the class really challenged by previous understandings of possibilities of institutional reform with respect to larger-scale multilateral organizations involved in development work. Our discussions of development and global capital represented many of the themes we talked about the first few weeks of the course, involving the wider discourse on power and narratives that confer the erasure of African agency and/or narratives of labor and livelihoods that pigeonhole action into limited understandings or tropes. This class really encouraged me to ask questions and think more critically about the sources of existing understandings of race, class, and nationality."

                "I loved the break-out rooms and student-led discussions! I also enjoyed the different types of materials used to teach the course (videos, articles, academic papers, and more).  I do not have suggestions for how it could be improved -- it was great!",
                "Strengths: Collaborative assignments were so easy to do but were extremely helpful to our learning; most of the materials and texts were written by Africans themselves (this is not always a given in an African Studies class); Each week was carefully planned out and all the texts came together nicely under a single theme so seamlessly; \r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The readings and the annotations allowed for lots of great in-class discussions. In the smaller settings of the breakout rooms or the small groups on in-person days, we were able to think critically and talk more in-depth. Honestly, I think this was a very strong course across the board and there weren't any weaknesses that I can think of."

If youre interested in looking at the narratives surrounding Africa as a continent as well as Africa in the eyes of the world, this course is for you. Leslie does a wonderful job of making these questions accessible while covering a wide range of topics. This is in one of the courses that totally changed my outlook, and I absolutely think everyone should take it!",
                "Yes, amazing class what reconstructs historical misconceptions about Africa, and Africans. Would obviously recommend to those already connected to Africa (you will be forever engaged), but also to students not connected to Africa who will benefit greatly from this different perspective and perhaps be shocked by the deconstruction of the lies they were fed in history class about why Africa is.",
                "I would recommend this to someone else, even if they have no background in African Studies. The material and class are set up in a way where you learn so much and it isn't scary to ask clarifying questions.",
                "Absolutely! If you have the chance, take this class!! No matter your major, this class will help you gain a better understanding of global dynamics and the role of Africa throughout history and today. This class will expand your knowledge of Africa as well as your critical thinking and analysis skills.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in learning about Africa in a very academic context, I would recommend this class to you. We learned about different theories and philosophies that helped me to form my own opinions. I plan to double major in African Studies, so I think this is a course that every African Studies major should take!",
                "Leslie was an incredible instructor. She crafted a really great syllabus - the readings exposed us to the major intellectual debates surrounding \"development\" and decolonization on the African continent and beyond. She encouraged us to engage with the material in a meaningful way - to rely on each other's interpretations/understanding/experiences and to ask critical questions. Expectations from students were also appropriately adjusted given the pandemic - which was not true for several of my other courses. All around this was a wonderful experience and I would wholeheartedly encourage other students to take a course like this in the future.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Gross-Wyrtzen is delightful and this class genuinely taught me a lot about Africa even as an African myself.",
                "I would 100% recommend this class to anyone interested in political theory and ethnic studies because it fundamentally challenged and posed new questions about many of the narratives of Africa in contemporary academia."
