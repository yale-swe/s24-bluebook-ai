    "Writing, speaking, and understanding German .",
    "I gained a good understanding of intermediate German.",
    "German grammar, vocabulary, speaking, and cultural skills.",
    "I improved my German considerably",
    "A more robust understanding of the German language and culture.",
    "In my mind, this course was well-structured to drill and solidify concepts we were introduced to in GMAN-110 and 120, although some new material was introduced. In particular, I increased my knowledge of German idioms and stylistic enhancements. I felt like I made the most progress in my speaking ability.",
    "I don't think my speaking itself got much better, but I definitely improved at just getting words out. I learned a lot of tenses and moods and all that fun grammar stuff.",
    "I learned at lot about German (of course), significantly improving my comprehension, vocabulary, writing, and speaking. The course also exposed the students to several facets of German culture, as well as the specific local cultures of several prominent German cities.",
    "I improved my German by leaps and bounds. The constant immersion in every aspect of the German language really helped in allowing me to speak, read, write, and listen to the language more fluently."

   "comments": [
    "I think it was very interactive and well structured. There was a lot of material covered in different formats and it included a lot of speaking. All of which are great qualities for a class.",
    "Frau Schenker is a great professor. She explains concepts very clearly. The workload is high though so make sure you dedicate time to this course.",
    "Strengths \r\n-organization\r\n-comprehensive learning of German (Eg. speaking, writing, reading,...)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses \r\n- time commitment",
    "I loved how we used the breakout rooms over zoom. The five-minute break at the midpoint of class was also very helpful.",
    "In general, this course is structured well. One minor way that the course could be improved is if the vocabulary could be offered in a Quizlet by the instructor. I am always in favor of bringing in more primary source readings e.g. from German culture, even if only excerpts, and I would have benefitted from a more intricate explanation of how various structures can function in the language (for instance, an in-depth examination of the uses of subjunctive-2).",
    "The course had so much work. The talk abroads, while not fun per se, definitely helped my speaking since we couldn't be in Germany. Theresa is a great strength and is a wonderful instructor. That said, the class had so much work. On the asynchronous days we'd have easily over four hours of work. Theresa also started the class saying homework would be graded on completion but it wasn't, it was graded on correctness.",
    "It is very immersive and it took a significant time commitment. While this assists (to an extent) with the learning process, it can also cause burnout or stunted learning by making the brain try to focus too constantly on one activity. It was difficult to gauge how well one was doing in the course (compared to other students; grades were kept quite up-to-date on canvas, which was helpful)."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is great to improve German speaking skills as well as develop vocabulary and cultural understanding of Germany.",
    "Yes, great course.",
    "Yes, if you want to improve your German skills.",
    "Yes. If you are interested in learning more about German this course is great.",
    "I reccomend the class, but if at all possible take in person. Also try not to take other classes at the same time, as this course takes up most of your time.",
    "I would; Theresa is great, and the course was challenging but forgiving. I might recommend that it be taken during a regular semester, as it was difficult to absorb the language so quickly, but it was also replacing the study-abroad program, so the intensity may be desired by some people.",
    "Yes, but if they could I would definitely recommend they study in Germany. This was impossible for us due to covid, so this course was the second best thing I could do. Still though, amazing course, well organized, would assuredly recommend to anyone in a similar position as me."
