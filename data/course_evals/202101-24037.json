I sometimes tried counting how many sentences of Spanish she would use in her monologues, and rarely went past ten in one class.

                "I cannot think of a single strength of this class, but there are a million weaknesses that come to mind. The presentations throughout the semester were ridiculous in their emphasis on memorization over comprehension. And, many of the themes that students proposed for their presentations were rejected. So, we were doing research and presenting about content that didn't actually intrigue us at all. This class was miserable and I dreaded it every single day. It honestly always left me shaking and feeling so uncomfortable about the concept of having to return every Mon\/Wed\/Fri.",
                "One weakness is that it is a lot of work, and since it was online I did not speak in Spanish as much. However, one strength was that the class was pretty collaborative.",
                "I think it could be really stressful, especially with memorizing the presentations and frequent testing. It felt like there was always at least one high-pressure assessment per week, which was very stressful to have.",
                "Our professor could've actually prepared lesson slides and reinforced the material instead of solely asking us to do independent work.",
                "Strengths: breakout rooms helped with getting to know classmates and improving my Spanish speaking. Weakness: the online format made it difficult to learn a language",
                "SPAN 120 with Prof. Santos has been the worst class I've taken at Yale. It is best described as chaotic zoom meetings three times a week, in which the professor babbles about mid-century modernism, and then puts students in breakout rooms without a clear agenda. Outside of class, we'd sometimes be greeted by passive-agressive emails such as one with the subject line \"Not a good idea to miss class today... ;-)\" and no content. Conversely, in class Prof. Santos would also pull us out of our breakout rooms one by one for what could have been an email.\r\n\r\nThe professor would often snap at students for trivial matters, such as a student being a second late to class (on that occasion, she spent minutes lecturing us how every *nanosecond* of class time is precious...) \r\n\r\nClass time was either incredibly chill or incredibly stressful with no middle ground. Some times we would all be in one big breakout room \"dancing\" to cha-cha and studying for actual classes. Other times, the professor would somehow delete our slides during class presentations, and then call us out for not having them in the shared google doc. Other times, she would call us out on not turning in an assignment due days later just because \"her other section has already done it.\""
