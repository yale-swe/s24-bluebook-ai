                "I can't give enough reviews about this amazing class. It's life changing. I had a passion for medical oncology prior to taking TCB. However, following this course, I wish I could be practicing right now. The molecular aspects of cancer formation are so intricate, like a beautifully-choreographed yet insidious dance. I was amazed at how each lecture Dean Chang gave taught a separate aspect of cancer, but they were all woven together beautifully throughout the course. As for Dean Chang, WOW. I was shy before entering this class. Through the encouraging way he ran class, I was never afraid of giving a wrong answer or being judged in any way, shape, or form. I am leaving this class as a confident, introspective individual who feels ready to tackle the world. Thank you, Yale, for allowing this class to be offered. Thank you, Dean Chang, for your amazing reassurance in my abilities and personality.",

Everyone was constantly encouraged to express themselves through textbook-intellectual, artistic, and musical means. He has the vibrant personality of the ideal professor. If you test the waters of speaking in class, I guarantee you will only be rewarded through the encouragement you will receive. There is no wrong answer in Dean Chang's class!",

                "This course is extremely organized and the material discussed is extremely interesting. The professors also assigns us very unique assignments that cannot be taught in other courses. I knew well ahead of time the tasks that were asked of me.",
                "This course is really well-designed. Some of my highlights include reading the Emperor of All Maladies, Dean Chang's lectures, working on the psets, and listening to student presentations on their research. I really appreciated that Dean Chang put us all into groups, which ensured we could easily make friends and have a good support system in the class despite the Zoom format. Honestly, can't think of any weaknesses. Incredible class."

It has exposed me to material I would not have known before hand, and has taught me unique skills that I would not have learnt in other courses. The small, intimate class setting is the perfect opportunity to learn from the professor and from other students. Unlike other introductory STEM classes, this course is extremely engaging. I loved this class and highly encourage others to enroll.",
