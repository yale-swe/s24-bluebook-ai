                "I learned elementary Italian.",
                "In this course, I learned Italian terminology for food, weather, family and other common attributes of life. Through learning grammar conventions of the language, I've developed the skills to converse, very limitedly, in Italian. I also explored the culture of Italy such as holidays, art, music and differences across regions in Italy.",

            "comments": [
                "The content covered was very useful, introducing vocabulary grouped by theme and basic grammar topics in a logical order. The book exercises and readings were helpful, introducing the topic before it was taught in class. The compositions offered an excellent way to practice writing in Italian. Tests were an appropriate level of difficulty, though the grading was at times overly harsh. More opportunities to speak conversational Italian would have beneficial in class, for example answering \"what did you do this weekend\" and replying to questions on our final projects was very helpful.",
                "I struggled with the grammar immensely. I think instructors should provide more exercises that are similar to the tests in order to help students prepare more for the exams. I feel like I was not as prepared as I could have been for exams.",
                "It was hard to stay focused and sometimes hard to follow, and sometimes hard to understand why you made mistakes with grammar. Feedback was good mainly because my instructor took the time to do outreach.",
                "Very fast-paced course, with a lot of practice for grammar, reading, and writing. I wish we spent more time practicing how to have/sustain a conversation in Italian.",
                "I think one strength of the course is that it is taught completely in Italian. The first few weeks were hard because no one had any experience with speaking Italian, but it definitely helped my brain to understand the language since I was immersed in it every week day. One thing that could possibly help the course is if it were not as focused on translating between English and Italian. I'm not sure if this is how languages must be taught, but the Sentieri textbook emphasizes translation and I find the Fotoromanzo section helpful to understanding the language rather than needing to translate the language to English first to understand it. Maybe more video use could help students process the language faster. Also, I think it would be nice if culture was emphasized more in class. At the beginning of the semester, we would listen to Italian music and point out vocabulary that we recognized. I think more activities like this could be beneficial.",

                "Definitely. It provided a solid introduction to the Italian language and a good foundation for further learning.",
                "Yes but be careful. Its interesting to learn this language but you have to dedicate several hours",
                "No, because I think this language isn't worth the engagement if you are just taking it to get your language requirement over with. If you are interested in Italy and its culture, definitely go for it.",
                "Yes--you gain a decent grasp of Italian in just a single semester.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is curious, whether about Italy in particular or something they've never learned before. I am having so much fun learning Italian because I have never studied a spoken language before. Learning a language allows a person to be open to so many possibilities with people, culture, food, location. Therefore, I would definitely recommend this course."
