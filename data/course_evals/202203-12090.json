This class changed how I think about the geological world around me, that is to say, the world, in the most literal sense. Dynamic Earth lab allowed me to take the concepts I learned in the lecture course and apply them to real-world examples, particularly during field trips, which provided an invaluable chance to cement the concepts in my brain and allowed for a corporeal understanding that will stick with me, I think, for as long as I live."

                "The major strength is the fall break trip! It was so much fun and I really feel like I learned things about geology I couldn't have learned from New Haven. Other field trips and hands-on activities were great, and Professor Evans is incredible. I think a little more instruction in the actual lab would have been helpful, especially with respect to things like identifying rock types.",
                "This course was fun, and the field trips were interesting and not too cumbersome.",
                "Strengths: I really loved the structure of this class, with every-other-Friday labs and awesome field trips. The teaching team is very knowledgeable and I found I learned the most by asking questions (or listening to the answers to other students' questions!). \r\nWeaknesses: For new topics introduced in lab, it would be very helpful to be given information as a guide and then be asked to apply this knowledge in order to build a strong foundation. For example, I think it would be more effective to be told about mineral properties and then asked to identify minerals rather than to fill in a chart of mineral properties with information we found from the internet which may not have been complete. Similarly, I think it would be more effective to be taught about the rock formations we saw on field trips and then asked to apply this knowledge rather than to guess based on little background information. I thought some labs (e.g., the cemetery hunt) were better at this than others (e.g., mineral identification around campus). Hope this makes sense!",
                "Pretty great. Plz make sure both cabins are heated next year on the trip though. We in the little cabin had no idea that the big one had heat.",
                "Strengths were that lessons were engaging and often required hands-on or out of the classroom exploratory work that was interesting and furthered learning. Weaknesses were that some exercises were difficult and confusing for beginners and required more prior knowledge than what was covered in the course material.",
                "Field trips are great",
                "strengths: field trips and labs were fun and low workload, oct break field trip was very fun",
                "Strengths: the passion of the professor and the TA, the field trips, being able to handle rock specimen of all different kinds\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the October field trip does indeed take your time away from studying if you need to do so ( I didnt but this may be a concern for others), I felt the explanation of the science behind some things we saw on the field were a bit complicated and hard to digest for people new to geology",
                "Hands down, the greatest strength of this class is in the fieldwork. There is simply no substitute for hands-on learning in real geologic environments. The field trips are well thought out and very cogently illustrate pertinent geological concepts. Not to mention, they are really fun (especially the Fall Break trip)! I truly don't know if I can think of any real weaknesses in this course."

                "If you are interested in geology, take this lab! I will say that there is a wide range in student experience and skill levels. Students who are EPS majors and seem to be able to identify every mineral first try are mixed in with those who have never taken a geology course before and are just looking to learn, which can make the course challenging for the latter group. That being said, if you come in with an open mind and ask a lot of questions, you will have fun either way!",

                "Absolutely. You get to build a relationship with the prof and TA through these field trips. Being able to look at stuff of the earth we rely on and learn about how everything came to be is truly fascinating",
                "I would absolutely recommend this lab to anyone interested in learning more about geology. Dynamic Earth Lab has beautifully shaped my understanding of geology and geological processes. After this course (in concert with the lecture course), I walk outside and am confronted by a wealth of astounding geological truths that I had never before noticed or cared about. I truly see the world in a novel way now, and I will be continuing my exploration of geology in part due to the seed of curiosity and fascination that this course has sowed in me. If this sounds like something you want to experience, take the course! Engage with it! And, afterward, using the knowledge you gain, continue to wander, wonder, and reason about the beautiful world we find ourselves a part of!",
                "I would recommend this to anyone who wants an even more in-depth understanding of the material taught in EPS 110. The field trips make the class more enriching and fun!"
