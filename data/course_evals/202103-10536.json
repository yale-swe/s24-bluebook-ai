There was always a loud fan noise in the classroom and she had a very soft voice, plus the mask, leading to some discussions where we couldn't hear her.",
                "I enjoyed the course a lot! The workload was super manageable and I enjoyed our weekly discussion, especially on the more modern films. The only weakness I can think of is especially at the beginning of the semester, it was sometimes hard to actually hear the Professor, but this got better over the course of the class.",
                "The seminars were interesting. I thought that some more student-led discourse could benefit the class, but overall it was great.",
                "The reading load is not overbearing\r\nThe movies are fantastic\r\nThe discussion based seminar is engaging and exciting \r\n\r\nHowever with wearing a mask during COVId it was almost impossible to hear the professor",
                "In general this course was very strong! The readings were great and not overwhelming and the weekly film screenings fantastic!"

                "Yes! I had a fun time taking it. The second half of the class is much better than the first, in my opinion. (Just as the films were more relevant to modern day events). There are only two assignments, so keep that in mind if you're someone that obsesses over grades.",
