                "I came into this course hoping to tighten up my style and skills a little bit, and I think I've gotten closer to getting there! Through the projects we've had, I've learned a lot on how to create coherent systems, what my design style is, and how you can make effective designs with even a few small changes. I always thought that more was better, but I see that's not always the case. The projects have also helped to redefine rules and boundaries in graphic design that I was afraid to overstep or break before, but the joy of design is that there aren't any limits.",
                "learned a lot about design history and practices that were specific to certain eras and why that was so. got to learn about the style of different graphic designers.",
                "Typographic rules, how to adjust the same brand/style across different formats, exercises about how to rearrange/reformat predetermined content, got briefly exposed to different styles of graphic design like Modernism, Post-Modernism, and Tatami Grid, but most importantly got exposed to diverse examples of graphic design in Yale libraries e.g. Yale's visual identity, Mexican Olympics's identity manuals, children's books to learn about various formats graphic design gets used on and sequence and pacing of content."

                "This could be a strength or weakness depending on the person, but the sheer amount of projects that we had were a lot to juggle at times (Alice's class helped to train us to multi task). However, I think it was really nice to see all that we had worked on over the semester during our Final critique. It was really rewarding to see our progressions and improvements we made after in class feedback. There were some days when we just didn't have enough time for everything that was planned or to get through everyone, but I think that is a flaw for every art course.",
                "biggest weakness is that it was on a friday from 1-5pm. had it been any other day i would have been so much more engaged",
                "Strengths: course format and class discussions structured well for learning systems/issues in design, great open crits and participation, fun and interesting exercises and work. Weaknesses: none that I can think of atm",
                "Trips to the Beinecke and Haas libraries were really helpful for getting inspiration from famous past examples of graphic design. We got individualized feedback from the professor because each student has a critique one by one. Projects' instructions are up on Canvas as soon as they're assigned. It can be hard to stay engaged and productive for four hours, so a student or two may not have time to get a critique. But the professor is patient, responsive, and willing to stay after class if she can and email her feedback to anyone who missed their critique."
