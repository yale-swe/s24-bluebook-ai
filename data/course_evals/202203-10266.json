                "This class has set me up greatly for the rest of my Yale career. The content learned in this class is relevant in ALL fields and comes up in my other classes. This course is so foundational for a greater understanding of history, ethnic studies, STEM, and politics. ERM 200 made me interrogate the knowledge I've previously held before and gave me directions for the creation of new ones.",
                "Empathy, a greater appreciation for the complexity of the world's problems, a deeper appreciation for telling the lesser-told parts of history, and an understanding of how I might want to make the world a better place.",
                "I learned key practices in ethnic studies and how this discipline takes shape.",
                "I learned so much about different histories and narratives that have been left out of the American education system. I also learned different ways of finding connections or novel findings by putting these narratives into conversation with each other",
                "racial formation, study",
                "This course really challenged not only what I think but also how I think. It provided important historical and theoretical context for defining forces such as race and nationality and helped me understand these realities from a systemic\/institutional perspective. It also helped me understand histories of current movements of resistance and liberation.",
                "There are a few topics that I will definitely carry with me: eugenics, racecraft, racialization, queer of color critique, orientalism, and abolition.",
                "Overarching themes of ethnic studies and the importance of activism",
                "Big takeaway: pulling from different sites of knowledge makes us \"fit for struggle.\" IYKYK.",
                "I feel I have gained a massive analytical framework for thinking about issues related to ethnicity rights and migration. I also really appreciated the critical fashion in which this class pushed us to reconsider how we have come to contend with our own identities and regard social progress.",
                "The selection of readings in this class were excellent and all-encompassing, and Prof. Hosang was super helpful in deconstructing some of the more complicated texts. I learned a lot of new topics I never covered in high school, such as racial formation, Queer of Color Critique, and Scholar Activism.",

                "The insights and knowledge learned from this class really can't be summarized in this evaluation but I learned so much about the history of race, gender, sexuality and so much more in the U.S. and abroad. But that is really a simplification of the complex histories and realities we discussed and learned about. We learned about systems and structures and the ways in which liberalism and democratic reforms can be more hurtful than helpful or reinforce systems of oppression rather than tear them down.",
                "I gained foundational knowledge about the study of ethnicity, race, and migration.",
                "This course was so amazing at teaching core ER&M concepts and theory. Beyond critical foundational theories, this class opened my eyes to the deep intersectional ties between all forms of oppression. In addition, this class shed light on the work current activists and academics are doing that turn these concepts we learned about in class into action.",
                "Skills: Better writing skills, finding ways to apply ethnic studies beyond the, great introduction to concepts",
                "I learned how to think critical about the knowledge that Ive received, especially that taught during my time in the K-12 school system. I learned to make connections between people, ideas, and events that appear separate. I feel like Im leaving with the drive to always know more.",
                "By taking this course I was able to improve my critical thinking skills. This is a place where I had a chance to talk about the problems surrounding our communities and work with text from scholars to understand this issues at heart. I am know knowledgeable about concepts and topics such as the work of Toni Morrison, what is Neoliberalism and its consequences, whom our governmental structures were made for, and the politics of play.",
                "This course provided a fundamental introduction to a variety of terminology and concepts used in ethnic studies as well as insights into actual applications of these academic theories to real-life advocacy work.",
                "I definitely learned to view the world through a different lens in this course.",
                "I learned a lot about the evolution of the meaning of words (keywords), gained perspective from various guest speakers, and learned new concepts and idea from various authors. I developed a deeper understanding of how race functions in our society. I also learned about the dangers of championing liberalism. I gained new tools for understanding and analyzing our society.",
                "I learned the basics of ethnic studies; the study of difference. Terminology, history, etc.",
                "The class broke down a lot of important social concepts, making concepts like liberalism, sovereignty, and racialization easy to understand. Lectures were very engaging, and I learned a lot about activism from guest speakers.",
                "how to engage with ethnic studies concepts",
                "During ER&M 200 I learned how to think critically about the current conjuncture, and the way that different factors influence the racial dynamics of our world today. We learned about topics from the production of knowledge and archives, to borders and national identity, to applying the knowledge we gained in the classroom to our outside lives. This class made me think differently about the world",
                "I definitely learned a lot about ethnic studies and the terminologies that go along with this field.",
                "In ER&M 200 I learned a unique way of analyzing the world around me.  This course not only teaches you to unlearn certain ways of thinking but to adopt new perspectives.",
                "I gained knowledge about racialization, race formation, migration issues, community building, alternative possible futures, and coalitional work by learning about various concepts and events.",
                "Words cannot describe the amount of insight, revelation, and knowledge I have gained from ER&M 200. I am by no way exaggerating when I say that this was the most intellectually engaging class I have taken, because it not only taught me new, important knowledge about race but also taught me a new way of thinking and researching - something I had never thought of before.",
                "This course altered my daily thought process significantly. I feel like my awareness of the world changed in the sense that I could grasp connections between concepts more effectively. I saw the ways in which different perspectives throughout time and place interacted with each other, I began to understand the value of collaboration and study outside of the classroom, and from dozens of case studies I learned information that was both interesting and important to understand in relation to politics and society. I also learned how to analyze texts on a deeper level; the weekly writing assignments forced me to actually understand what the author\/speaker was conveying and apply it to other concepts. I found myself revisiting concepts outside of class and putting in the extra time to understand the concepts because it wasnt just information you could regurgitate."

I would have appreciated more emphasis on political activism\/policy\/education and more time spent on the Asian American experience rather than just Orientalism. I really liked Weeks 1-4 and the last week, which felt like we were talking about very key big ideas and concepts.",
                "Strengths: Dr. HoSang's ungrading framework made me pursue knowledge in this course and made me excited to learn. Lectures were very engaging and involved participation from the crowd. Participation from students in the lecture made assigned readings very understandable. Course content was very interesting, engaging, and foundational.\r\nWeakness: None",
                "This course was structured excellently, with extremely engaging and accessible readings, assignments that ensured I understood each week's content, as well as discussion sections that allowed deep, meaningful conversations to be had each week. I feel like I learned far more in this class, without a midterm or final, than I did in most of my other classes. I can think of no way to improve this course.",
                "Strengths: guest speakers, discussion sections and TFs, materials, workload and flexibility\r\nWeaknesses: Confusion with ungrading policy, skimmed over some topics",
                "Strengths: Amazing lectures, clear-cut, low-stress assignments, thought-provoking material, great guest speakers, opportunities to get more involved with the material, the ability to skip some assignments\r\n\r\nThe one weakness I might add is that at times, the amount of reading was overwhelming especially if I had exams that week and there were readings and a one hour podcast for this class. I think each reading should include page numbers for the reading that is especially pertinent to that week's material when there are those weeks that the reading is too daunting for me to complete before lecture.",
                "i liked the paper handouts and the assignment formats\r\n\r\ncould use more creative assignment opportunities",
                "I like how the assignments for this course were structured. Having weekly assignments provided the opportunity for me to reflect on and spend my own time with what I learned that week, which helped me internalize it, and led to more profound learning.",
                "At times, this was one of the best classes I have ever been in. I loved learning about the material, talked about the class with my friends, and was energized by the lectures. However, there were also weeks where I found myself falling asleep in lecture for my first time ever as a student. I will try and be more specific with a highly opinionated review of the course which you should almost certainly disregard:\r\n\r\nWeek 1 introduced ethnic studies and had us reflect on why we might want to learn about ethnic studies. The readings were interesting, and I was hooked. The joy continued into week 2 when we had a chance to read Lorde and learn about liberalism. I did not gain anything from the Hall and Massey reading, which talked about some strange time in England that I did not understand or care about and did not help me understand the concept of a conjuncture. Week 3 on the University was fascinating and I loved all the readings. Week 4 on racial formation was very confusing and moved too quickly for me, and the amount of reading jumped quite a bit from previous weeks. Section did not help to clarify concepts that I had lingering confusion about. Week 5 on queer critique\/identity was very interesting. I loved the Moraga, somerville, and kaplan readings, while the Ferguson and Cohen pieces were too confusing and I did not take anything away from them. Week six focused on indigenous studies. I do not like podcasts, but I enjoyed the estes and simpson readings. Kauanui and Warrior readings were quite nice. Week seven was on orientalism. I thought the Prashad orientalism keywords essay was great, but the assigned reading from Said was a drag and I can't say I remember anything from it. I felt very disengaged during this week. I wish we learned more about contemporary asian american ethnic studies, rather than spending a whole week belaboring orientalism. Week 8 on Nation, Identity and Diaspora was also lost on me. It was also a week with far more readings than previous weeks, and I do not feel like the readings contributed much to my understanding. I did not feel particularly engaged. Week 9 on sound and play was my least favorite week, and I do not really see how it tied into course concepts. Week ten on scholar activism was quite interesting, and I think Prof. Hidalgo was a fun guest speaker. Chakrabarti was very memorable. Week 11 on borders and national identity was not too engaging as I was not particularly interested in learning about afro-german hip hop (was anyone?). We were also showed a rather disturbing music video in class with someone getting beat, and I wish Prof. HoSang did not show it in class or at least gave some kind of heads up\/warning. Week 12 had some interesting guest speakers, and I liked them all. Week 13 on abolition was by far my favorite week. The readings were excellent, and our guest speakers Stevie Wilson and Dr. Black were amazing. They made me laugh and think deeply about abolition. The study group assignment this week was one of my favorite experiences in the class. \r\n\r\nThe weekly assignments sometimes felt like a chore, but the assignment policy in the class was quite generous. Sometimes I found the prompts to be quite limiting, and I wish I could write about\/explore something in the readings that I found to be more interesting instead. I like how the final essay was done. \r\n\r\nIn the end, I must commend Prof. HoSang and the TFs for the effort and care they put into the class. I think it can only get better in the future.",
                "Strengths - valuable information, emphasizes applicable learning rather than just studying \r\n\r\nWeakness - none",
                "HoSang gave fascinating lectures and I very much appreciated how clearly he traced out and connected varying analytical pathways and ideas. I also found most of the reading very helpful and appreciated the constant TF feedback and weekly assessment based assignments. I think the course could be improved by assigning less reading and having more in depth discussion of each--I often felt I was craving more in depth engagement with the readings in discussion section.",
                "I enjoyed the breadth of reading we covered; I felt that I was able to spend time with the text and make connections between them that I would not have been able to if there were significantly more assigned readings. Doing these readings in conjunction with the lectures, discussion sections, and speaker events were a delight. I particularly enjoyed the speaker events; seeing the ER&M concepts we were learning being applied outside of class, especially within a career context, was inspiring. I personally would have liked for the speaker events to be more spaced out throughout the semester, rather than clustered at the endjust to add a bit more overall feeling of balance. However, that said, I still enjoyed the current format and dont have a lot to add.",
                "I think the topics of the course were very interesting and topics that left me with wanting to explore a lot more. However, at times I felt myself disengaged with the lectures and found them a bit repetitive.",
                "The pedagogy of the course was designed to center student learning instead of busy work and punitive grading. The structure of assignments was so useful and really helpful to student engagement.",
                "Interesting topics, great guest speakers, and great prof\/teaching staff",
                "Daniel HoSang was the biggest strength of this class. He was so successful in synthesizing difficult concepts from the readings with the lectures and I felt at the end of every lecture I was gifted with a deep understanding of what he taught. The readings for class itself were also perfectly selected. I was always excited to read for this class and they were always tailored so perfectly to lectures. The lectures were also awesome and an hour and 15 min was a perfect amount of time. The layout of the class was great because the order of topics throughout the semester was expertly organized by professor HoSangI couldn't imagine being able to learn any other way. Beyond the thoughtfulness of the assignments themselves, I was greatly appreciative of the ungrading framework that Professor HoSang employed for this class. I always felt extra engaged because of it and it worked to actually employ concepts of the class within the execution of the class itself. Finally, I was floored by the number of amazing guest speakers that Professor HoSang allowed us to listen to. This class was perfect and Daniel HoSang is the reason for thatplease keep him here forever.",
                "I loved the ungrading system! I do feel that the amount of info we learn could be more focused",
                "I loved the grading style of the course. I always face in my best work knowing that I\r\nwould get useful feedback. I also liked how we could skip assignments therefore lighten my course load one week if necessary.",
                "Honestly, this was the most amazing course I have ever taken.",
                "Strengths: HoSang is a wonderful and attentive professor and the teaching team also brings a lot to the course as well. They tailor the second half of the course with guest speakers and concepts based on the larger class' interest which is wonderful. The grading and assignments seem to focus on learning as opposed to competing which is nice as well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some concepts can feel a bit repetitive if you have already been exposed to other ERM courses which can leave the class a bit redundant. The class also lacks some commentary on class, which I think would help add more context to some of the issues we discuss in the course.",
                "Good participation during lecture. Good job connecting themes between lectures but the course gets incredibly repetitive at times. I like how each section starts with music.",
                "A large strength of this course was the guest speakers during the last month. It was cool because we learned about various concepts during the first part of the semester, and then these guest speakers displayed how this learning can materialize in various professions and work. Another strength was the ungraded framework because it placed less stress on students, yet we still engaged with the material and learned a lot because of the weekly assignments.  I think this was very clever. Another strength is that we could redo assignments if we didn't do as well as we wanted. This was helpful because we got to make sure that we truly understood the content from the week. I don't think there were many weaknesses. The only thing was that sometimes students were cold called in this lecture class. I think it was powerful and cool to have students participate in lecture, but when there were no volunteers, I think it would have been better to just continue class rather than cold call on students.",
                "Strengths: grading system facilitated a focus on learning\r\nWeaknesses: Felt all over the place in terms of structure. No cohesive curriculum.",
                "not very organized or structured. I would've benefited from more speakers throughout the year.",
                "The course broke complex concepts down nicely. Professor HoSang made sure to review important concepts several times. There were also multiple ways to interact with the course material as well. In terms of weaknesses, the readings could sometimes be a bit dense. Incorporating the study group assignment throughout the semester could have helped with some of the readings.",
                "This course was really thoughtfully organized which made it easy to just focus on the subject matter. I also loved the speakers we had. My only wish would be that we were able to hear from speakers more throughout the year. I loved the assignment schedule because I had to work very constantly for this class.",
                "This class was incredible. It was engaging, exciting, and challenging in the best way. The writing assignments were very helpful for my understanding of the themes of the course. There were very few weaknesses to this course. My only suggestion might be to have more opportunities for students to bring their own researched examples to class for some week's themes.",
                "This class was a very good introduction to the topics of ethnicity, race, and migration, but I would have liked to see more conversation on these topics between fellow peers.",
                "Strengths: Prof HoSang. The guest speakers brought in were a pleasure to learn from. It was interesting to relate class concepts to what the speakers had to say. I loved how the teaching fellows got to really be involved in the instruction of the lecture. It was amazing to learn from their experiences and academic projects. The photos and pieces from Yale archives and other archives made lectures really engaging. Im thankful that we had to go to an outside event for the final paper because it was really insightful to see class concepts from a different perspective.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: this class is really lenient with students like letting us skip three assignments and the readings are so so interesting",
                "Strengths: lectures were engaging and interesting, guest speakers had great conversations and connected to course topics\r\nWeaknesses: slides were uploaded very late, but it would help to upload them online right after the lecture or even before to help retain information that students weren't able to note",
                "The course was incredibly well organized, as each unit focused on a significant tenant in ethnic studies and explored it through a series of papers, films, and of course, Professor HoSangs lectures. The end of the course featured a series of guest speakers who spoke about issues we had learned about prior but on a much deeper and active level.",
                "The course was highly engaging, structured well to allow time for readings, and the guest speakers were diverse and perfectly curated in a way that felt relevant while pushing ideas to the next level. The pacing was great too, and I loved how there was always an opportunity for questions. Honestly cant think of any weaknesses."

                "Yes! I learned so many new and interesting things from this class. Prof. HoSang was awesome and was really engaging in all the lectures.",
                "It's required for the ER&M major, but also a great survey course for students interested in the topics.",
                "YES PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE!!! ERM 200 is so foundational to everything. The knowledge I gained from this class makes me very confident in my other classes. The structuring of the class emphasizes learning and the pursuit of knowledge. Dr. HoSang and the TF's (including mine, Amanda) were very knowledgeable and created a learning inducing environment.",
                "I would recommend every student take this course. This course will teach you how to think differently of the world around you, how you interact with people, and will give you a greater appreciation for both the work that needs to be done in the world as well as those who devoted their lives to getting us where we are today.",
                "Yes if you're interested in ethnic studies",
                "Absolutely! It was such an amazing class and truly a class that every student should take before they graduate. It will make you a better critical thinker which is applicable to any field you end up working in as well as a better person.",
                "yes",
                "Absolutely. This class was the most meaningful academic experience I've had so far at Yale. Every time I walked out of lecture or my discussion section, I thought \"this is why I'm here.\" This class feels like what learning should be. Everything I engaged with through this class feels immensely important in the \"real world.\" I think everyone should take this class, regardless of their major or their interests.",
                "Maybe not. The first and last few weeks were incredible, but some of the weeks in the middle of the semester were very hard for me to engage with.",
                "Absolutely, extremely valuable information and the learning can be applied to a wide range of topics and helpful for life beyond university",
                "Yes. I think it's a great introductory course into the field of ethnicity, race, and migration. It's great for students who are interested in the field but feel overwhelmed by its vastness. It reminded me that the field is extremely interconnected, which made it a lot less intimidating and more of an exploration of experience within power structures.",
                "Absolutely! I have recommended it too many already.",
                "Yes, even if you only have a small interest in ER&M, the subject matter is very interdisciplinary and engaging.",
                "100% - especially if Hosang teaches the course or it is structured as he structured it. I highly recommend that you take this course as it is so manageable in terms of work and yet you learn so much.",
                "Sure! It's a fine course. Sometimes it felt like breadth>depth though.",
                "I would recommend this class to everyone. The concepts in this class are necessary to being a well informed individual. I can't imagine moving through the world without the knowledge this class provides. Beyond the critical need for this course, it's fascinating to learn about.",
                "100% especially with Professor Hosang! This course was highly enjoyable with readings and videos from many different political thinkers and organizers, a great panel of speakers, and Professor Hosang's pedagogical skills. Professor Hosang is both an expert in his field, but a great lecturer who would always make class interesting.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it presents different perspectives from the white htronormative patriarchal one that weve been fed our entire lives. It is also really easy to balance this class along with other classes. It feels like .75 credits.",
                "Absolutely. Everyone needs to take this course because it opens the door to problems we have never discussed in the past, in addition it gives us a greater understanding of what it means to be a citizen of the world, of what it means to be a minority and a majority in our society.",
                "Yes, especially if they are interested in learning more about hot-button words like neo-liberalism or critical race theory, but do not have any prior exposure. This is an INTRO class in a very helpful way.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I think the content is very important to understand and learn. Race and ethnicity are important to learn about as students and citizens, but also as future doctors, lawyers, consultants, etc. I learned so much in this class. I also think the ungraded framework was very cool to experience. It was interesting to learn in this new format.",
                "Sure, if you're interested in the subject matter.",
                "I would. I feel like it really introduces students to important social concepts and helps break these concepts down.",
                "Yes and I have. this was a really strong course in every area and I loved having hosang as a teacher. the tfs were interesting and engaging.",
                "I have already recommended this class to many friends because the content was so incredibly interesting. The way it was presented made it even more exciting to learn. I frequently found myself discussing class topics outside of class because the class was so excellent.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is especially passionate and very interested in ethnic studies.",
                "I would recommend this course to everyone especially if HoSang is teaching. These concepts can be applied to so many parts of life and even other courses (both humanities and STEM).",
                "If Hosang is teaching then yes",
                "Of course! This course is very interactive, which allows for an awesome learning environment. The concepts covered in this course are not widely taught across different majors, so I think this would be a perfect way to probe your mind.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course is like no other I have taken thus far. The professor genuinely wants students to learn, and enforces an \"ungrading\" policy to ensure that students are taking this class to leave with more knowledge than they came with, rather than worrying about getting an A in the course. The topics were very interesting and the guest speakers were great and super informative.",
                "Yes, Professor HoSang is a great professor, and I would highly recommend taking this course if he is teaching it. The progression of the course is perfect for student learning about various topics in ERM and how to view them from different perspectives. This class is extremely geared to facilitate student learning and collaboration rather than focusing on assignments and grades. I really enjoyed taking this class because of how engaging the topics, activities, and speakers were.",
                "Absolutely yes. Understanding race, ethnicity, and migration is intricate to understanding the foundation of our modern society, and I think everyone should take this class to deepen their awareness and sharpen their critical analysis skills.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student regardless of major or study of interest. I have not taken another class where I felt like I learned more content, and thats particularly impressive with this course because it wasnt irrelevant, repetitive, or predictable. I felt like the information was valuable to every student in the class whether they wanted to work in medicine, politics, the advocacy field, or just apply what they learned to the ways they navigate the world on a daily basis. The course was also very low stakes because it was structured in a way that put the strongest emphasis on learning, comprehension, and engagement over grading. 10\/10."
