                "The most important weakness was homework workload. The amount of homework was very big, and almost impossible to complete within a week. The problem sets were very long and tedious, very hard to grasp even after attending lectures. The worse aspect of this class were undoubtedly the very hard, tedious, time-consuming and impossible to complete problems sets. Ironically, the worst component of my grade were the problem sets. The exercises there were the hardest, they were very hard and tedious and they did not even appear in worksheets we did in class, in exams, or in the lectures. And the worst part of it all: they didnt even provide us with solutions to the problems sets, they just gave vague feedback on our mistakes! Also, the Ximeras were way too many as well!"
