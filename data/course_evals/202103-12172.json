In my previous experience learning Chinese, tones and pronunciation were not heavily focused on so this course was very useful in that aspect.",

                "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The program is very well structured, and the materials provided by the instructors very much facilitated the learning process. Having a website with all the materials for the class (audios, activities, presentations) and the weekly schedule was extremely helpful. Everyday I would go to the website and find everything I needed to study by myself and I always knew how to prepare for the next day. In the classroom, we would practice our skills everyday with different kinds of activities. Mostly we would focus on speaking and listening, which, for me, are the abilities most difficult to develop, so this is another point in favor of this class. And, of course, Bian laoshi is a wonderful instructor and a major strength of this course! She made learning Chinese a very smooth and fun experience!",
                "Overall, I really enjoyed this course. I thought the small class size was conducive to learning Chinese, and I appreciated the course website. I would have appreciated if our partners for the oral dialogue presentations were given to us more than 1-2 days in advance.",
                "My strengths would be writing characters as well as reading comprehension, but my two biggest weakness would be the pronunciation of the tones as well as listening comprehension. Some of the listening comprehension goes by very quickly, so it may be helpful to slowly progress the speed of the listening comprehension recordings.",
                "This course requires to you to attend class every day. I like the small class structure because it forces you to be engaged and helped me learn a lot better. Weaknesses are that there is too much homework and some weeks we would have an oral presentation, oral exam, and regular exam in the same week on top of homework and studying for daily dictation and it was overwhelming.",
                "I think the course was very well done I just got overwhelmed by the workload at times. My only suggestion would be to allow students to see their grades because that wasnt readily available to us on canvas or any other site."

Of course, devoting time everyday to study is crucial for effectively learn the language, but the course is very well organized and the teachers are amazing, so you rapidly notice everyone's improvement. The time and effort this class requires are definitely worth it!",
                "yes - great intro to Chinese and taught thoroughly and in a way that truly teaches you the mechanics of the language",

                "I would recommend this course for a student who would like to learn Chinese.",
                "Definitely. If you are interested in learning Chinese, I recommend this course. You learn a lot in a short period of time, but having class every day really allows you to improve your Chinese skills.",
                "Yes, I really like this professor and the course was challenging but you learn so much so fast its easy to see results in language skills."
