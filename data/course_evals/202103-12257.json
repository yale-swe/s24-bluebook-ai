                "The material is very interesting, it's great that most classes are student led with research presentations, all assignments are meaningful and nearly everything in the class is research based. The biggest weakness of the class was the fact that we often ran out of time in class to get through all the student presentations; however this is probably due to this being the first time this class has been taught so the timing and organization of everything will just get better with time.",
                "The strengths are that you get an in-depth understanding of the the areas covered. The biggest weakness is that it was basically fully centered on pyramids and the reading about the pyramids were from general overview books and did not provide much information beyond a brief summary. While this was marketed as an upper level class, there was no engagement on the material beyond a purely factual level.",
                "The strengths of the course are that the topics are very interesting and the professor is understanding and supportive. It was also great to hear from the grad students, who often had years of hands-on experience in the field. The professor also gave great feedback throughout the course which was very helpful and informative. The weaknesses of the course are that we were often rushed for time and that most content was taught by students rather than the professor, making for some inconsistency as some students were not as prepared as others (the group ranged from first-year undergrads to PHD students). I believe this was the first time the course was taught, so I assume some of these issues will be fixed as the course goes on."

                "I would! It never gets to be too much work, and you are always learning something without even knowing it. I was so surprised with how much of ancient Egypt I knew at the end of the semester. And you really get to fall in love with the topics you chose to research.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is remotely interested in archeology, is majoring in archeology, or simply wants to get a humanities credit by taking an interesting class. This course is actually very fun especially if you enjoy doing research. Overall, the class is quite manageable, intellectually stimulating, and definitely worth your time.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning about pyramids/royal tombs and the surrounding mortuary environments.",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this to students interested in archaeology and/or Egyptology. My only recommendation would be to take at least one other course in the field prior, maybe a basic archaeological survey or something similar to help you prepare for the ownership you will have over topics in this course."
