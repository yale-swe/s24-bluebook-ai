Got much better at proof writing through the p-sets which are challenging but not unreasonable.",
                "This course covered so many interesting topics in number theory. Professor Pohoata did a great job finding a balance between the number of topics and the depth we went into each one. I know I'll be thinking about some of the lectures long after the course is over.",
                "I understood so much more about the structure of number theory. We saw all sorts of perspectives: analytic, algebraic, even geometric! Cosmin tied it all together in a beautiful way. We started off by learning some basic number theory: mods, orders, Chinese Remainder and the like. We very quickly moved on to fascinating topics such as generating functions, Unique Factorization, quadratic reciprocity, Sums of Squares, Geometry of Numbers, Combinatorial Nullstellensatz, and finite fields. Everything went just deep enough to show us a beautiful result or two and maybe a related open problem of research interest, but not deep enough to get lost. This was the most exhilarating view of number theory I've had."

He did a great job finding a balance between the number of topics and the depth we went into each one. He was also just incredibly kind and understanding about the difficult circumstances of the semester.",

I never felt lost. Topics were self-contained, but were also in constant dialogue. Results from one part of the course made surprise appearances elsewhere, such as the interplay between quadratic residues and finite fields, or the geometry of numbers and diophantine equations, or finite fields and nullstellensatz, or... it goes on\r\nif i had to give criticism, I think we could have maybe had a little bit more homework."

                "Yes! This course is amazing, especially with Cosmin. Lectures are spent proving really cool theorems in-depth, and a wide variety of approaches to the subject are covered: we even spent some classes proving a single theorem (quadratic reciprocity) through a bunch of different methods. You'll get to see lots of approaches to number theory and it's super fun!",

                "Yes! This is mostly geared towards math majors: there's that Gauss quote about number theory being the queen of mathematics, which I find mostly true. There is a sense of amazement in how all these things are pieced together. It's also a very good review for many notions seen in 350 and 370. It's also relatively low-workload, though there are lots of concepts to study if you want to get maximal value out of this course."
