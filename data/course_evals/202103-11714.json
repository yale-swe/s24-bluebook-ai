                "Wonderful introduction to the sustainability canon. I'm glad we went a mile wide and an inch deep. This class was a springboard for independent study.",
                "I learned a lot about climate change and why it is an issue, possible solutions, and why it is so difficult to handle globally.",
                "I learned a lot about environmental policy and ways in which individuals and governments can go about tackling environmental problems.",
                "Insight to the politics of the issues of sustainability",
                "I learned about the theory, policy, technology, science, and socioeconomics of sustainable development. Also, how to write brief policy memos.",
                "I gained too many skills to mention in this class! I absolutely loved this class because I didn't have any experience in the policy side of environmental studies going into it, and this was a crash course in environmental policy. The policy memos were incredibly informative in terms of learning how to write a new type of paper (that is much more useful in the real world than more traditional academic papers) and the negotiation simulation gave us a taste of what information politicians needed going into a global climate negotiation and how those negotiations played out. I also feel like I now have a comprehensive understanding of the concept of sustainability. I was a little scared going into this course because of my lack of policy experience, but Professor Esty did a great job meeting people where they were and my TF was incredibly supportive throughout the term. I loved this class so much that I now want to major in EVST!",
                "This was a very broad course in terms of subject. It covers everything from Transcendentalism and Environmental Philosophy to Tax Incentives and Subsidies. That being said, there are no deep dives into any one subject (unless you are writing a policy memo about it). We learned mostly about broader systems that dictate environmental trends, and broad systems approaches to solve environmental issues. I believe this is a great course for a prospective EVST major and provides good insight into a lot of world systems.",

                "I understood how the sustainability efforts of many entities are very complex",
                "None, honestly. Other than the phrases \"internalize externalities\", \"green lights> red lights\", \"provide incentives for business\" the course didn't provide much knowledge for someone with a background in EVST\/sustainability issues. It is really just an unfocused overview of sustainability that jumps around different topics due to Esty's relatively unguided teaching style.",
                "I learned how to write policy memos, prepare for discussions on climate change, and was a part of a simulation on COP26. I learned a lot about how the economy, businesses, and government influence the trajectory of sustainability. Also, I learned from experts in the field such as Professor Esty and two guest lecturers.",
                "I learned a lot about policy writing, and how detailed the writing needs to be to be passed. I learned a little bit about sustainability, but if you are aware about the basics then you pretty much knew about most things in the course.",
                "I learned a great deal about the current state of climate change and the political and economic drivers that are preventing nations from acting decisively on the matter. I learned about the history of environmental legislation and how negotiations such as the annual Conference of the Parties are run. I also learned how to write a policy memo.",
                "No uninternalized externalities! Pay for the harm you cause!",
                "From this class I received an overview on a vast set of topics related to sustainability from green finance to water conservation. Coming from an engineering background, this class exposed me to a more holistic sustainability overview that introduced me to political and economical solutions to our current climate solutions.",
                "A broader understanding of an issue I had only approached from a scientific standpoint before taking this class",

                "Before enrolling into this course I had very little to almost no knowledge of sustainability. I come from a background in Texas where this topic is never addressed. It was extremely eye opening to me. I am excited to take the knowledge Professor Esty has instilled in me and apply it to my current surrounding society and community.",
                "I learned a ton of general information about the sustainability movement, and especially about the workings of diplomatic mechanisms like international climate talks.",
                "I learned about the scientific basis of climate change, economic and policy approaches to mitigate climate change, International Climate negotiations, and ways in which businesses can promote-- rather than hamper-- sustainability efforts. I feel that I now have a better understanding of what can be done to reduce the effects of climate change.",
                "I learnt a lot about the general principle of sustainability and especially the ways in which we can strive towards it on a global scale. Completing policy memos and a climate negotiation also gave me an insight into how ideas are shaped in the real-world.",
                "how to look at situations and policies in a new light, regarding the environment and future prospects for sustainability.",

                "I learned about the history of sustainability and different topics to analyze the question of achieving sustainability in the 21st century. This course also pushed me to use daily news sources to stay updated on current events. I also learned a lot about climate negotiations and different UN committees.",
                "I learned about how sustainability can be achieved through government and economics.",
                "A general survey of sustainability from a well-respected scholar in the field.",

                "I came out of this course being decently familiar with key environmental concepts such as ocean conservation, the history of the environmental movement in the U.S., international organizations' role in fighting climate change, clean energy finance, and more. The highlight of the course, in my opinion, was the syllabus. Barring some authors, the readings contained in the syllabus were very interesting and good places to start with regards to deeper inquiry.",
                "This course helped me develop my policy-writing skills and gave me a thorough run-through of domestic and international environmental policy. I think it was particularly helpful for learning more about market approaches to environmental policy; the class places a lot of emphasis on 'green-light' policies or policies that incentivize firms to be more sustainable. The Model COP26 was also very useful and helped me develop insights on how international conferences on climate work and how difficult it is to come to an agreement.",

            "comments": [
                "This course provided me with a great breadth of knowledge it was particularly useful in approaching some of the greatest environmental challenges we face today from a policy standpoint.",
                "Strengths: a great intro to basic environmental topics that everyone should be aware of, Professor Esty is awesome Weaknesses: we didn't cover much of the actual climate science, Esty can get a bit repetitive, and no slides or visuals",
                "Strengths - versatility\r\nWeakness - repetitiveness. Some lectures really need to be streamlined. Desperately in need of PowerPoints. Would help the Professor not repeat himself and keep the audience engaged.",
                "Strengths: interesting and relevant topic and Professor Etsy is very well versed in all of it. Weakness: There are no slides and very limited structure for every lecture, Prof Etsy just talks, sometimes it feels like with little logical flow from topic to topic that makes it hard to understand what is relevant and how things connect with each other. Also, it could be repetitive at times because Etsy has his biases on the situation and solutions and would repeat those a lot and I feel like this would take away from differing viewpoints. Also the climate negotiation was a cool exercise but it did not need to go on for almost five hours.",
                "I will say that I learned a lot from this course about environmental policy and solutions. However, my two biggest gripes with this class were its lack of clear direction and the lack of slides. Professor Esty is fundamentally opposed to the use of slides and although he is a very engaging speaker, it was very difficult to follow lecture because we would have no idea what we needed to write down or what was important. The second gripe was the lack of direction. We were not given very clear instructions on how to write the Policy Memos or how to study for the final so it was really every man for themselves in the class.",
                "The strength of this course lied in its relatively light course load and Professor Esty's lecture style. Section also wasn't terribly difficult. I would change the policies around mandatory lecture attendance, since there 150+ students and we don't really talk in lecture anyway. The policies surrounding that were ambiguous, especially given that lectures are recorded. Policies and curves in general could be more transparent.",
                "I loved the policy memos and climate negotiation. I think the course does a great job of preparing you for both: in the first case, the TFs provide sample policy memos and are available to look over your papers. Additionally, we worked on the negotiation every other week in section, were provided with an research guide to shape our research, and were given time in class to start forming alliances and understanding how the negotiation works. I also love all the real world examples that Professor Esty gave in class and that he recorded all of his lectures. And the guest lecture with Sue Biniaz was also very cool!",
                "Strengths - Professor Esty is incredibly well spoken and his lectures are engaging. The course load is very manageable, but not in a blowoff way. This class, based on my experience, will engage you without taking up too much of your time. You decided (mostly) the subject of your policy memos, which allows for a lot of different routes in this class. It is a good class to take for everyone, not just those interested in environmental studies or global affairs.",
                "Professor Esty was the strength of this course. He truly cared about the subject and tried to engage students as much as possible given the class size. Professor Esty's lectures without slides which many students had issue with, but I actually preferred it and found it much easier to focus on what was being said rather than writing down slides in my notes. Even if you know that this doesn't work for your learning style, I would encourage you to still take the class as you aren't tested intensively on the details of the lectures so it is still entirely manageable.",
                "Strengths: good feedback on policy memo assignments\r\nWeaknesses: random readings (with a LOT of pages), strangely difficult grading, vague lectures that had repetitive themes, no real lecture outline (and no slides)",
                "The greatest strength of the class was the mandatory international negotiation simulation (COP). Nevertheless, the lectures were uber-repetitive, especially in the first half, and policy memos were graded much too closely for comfort or learning purposes. Powerpoints definitely should have been used in lecture as well for professor-student organization and communication.",
                "More structure in the teaching style would improve the course. Professor Esty, while knowledgeable, did not have a teaching style conducive to learning. The lectures, which had no slides, were just him rambling and were largely unfocused, which impeded my learning. If anything, providing more structure in the teaching would have been helpful.",
                "It is pretty well organized and encompasses skills such as writing, critical thinking, and public speaking. Overall, it was a very well rounded class. On the other hand, some assignments were not explained well and led to a lot of doubt. For example, the final exam prompt brought a lot of questions and the Q&A doc was not given enough attention by the teaching fellows.",
                "The class could have had a little more definition around the topics of the day. Often it felt like the class was just one long ramble rather than pieces of the bigger picture. I often had to read the syllabus to understand what big ideas I was suppose to take away. Having a slideshow with key terms or topics would have been helpful. I think the biggest weakness was that Professor Esty didn't use slides at all. Often this left students guessing about how to spell authors\/politicians names or what they were suppose to focus on from lecture. Another weakness was the lengths of the readings. There were so. many. readings. Sometimes they would be 200+ pages...Those were just the required readings too, not to mention suggested readings or the \"library of materials\". Even so,  the readings were interesting and the class was very cool.",
                "Strength: great professor, engaging lectures, and overall interesting class.\r\n\r\nWeakness: no slides",
                "It was a super interesting and well-organized class",
                "I enjoyed the COP simulation however it felt that too much time was devoted to this simulation than anything else in class. We had a midterm right before and instead of reviewing relevant information in section that could be useful for the exam we continued to focus on the simulation. The simulation could have simply taken place over multiple sections instead of 4 hours on a given day.",
                "I believe that the use of powerpoint slides would help improve this class.",
                "Without having any prior knowledge to this course it made it difficult for me to enjoy this class while learning. I spent almost all of my time researching and digging deeper into the material of this class to catch up to my surrounding peers. It was very difficult for an individual such as myself to understand what is being discussed and taught during the lectures because of this issue of not having knowledge before taking this course.",
                "I felt like there were way too many readings on the syllabus, and the lectures were at times unfocused and repetitive.",
                "Strengths: course was relatively well organized; lectures were engaging; topics covered were interesting and timely; Participating in the mock climate negotiation was both an educational and fun experience; The fact that lecture recordings were posted was both helpful and reassuring\r\n\r\nweaknesses\/ potential improvements: Not all vocabulary terms mentioned on the syllabus seem to be covered in the required readings or lecture, which made studying a little complicated; Instructor seemed insistent on not using PowerPoints, but I think it would be easier to learn the course material if powerpoints were used; Volume of assigned readings sometimes seemed a bit excessive; grading scheme is somewhat unclear; I think it could've been helpful to dedicate a class to walking through different types of jobs in sustainability and discussing how to promote sustainability even if you don't pursue an environment related career.",
                "One of the main weaknesses was the lack of clarity around exactly what was wanted\/expected from both the mid-term and final examination, for me at least I was not that sure on how to structure my responses, and so I feel that it was not just my knowledge of the course that was being tested. Also, as the class is only curved at the end of the year, I was always left unsure of my grade position. Lastly, because almost everyone was given top marks for the climate negotiation and participation, and the class is curved, there ended up being a lot higher weight to the policy memos and mid-term\/final than I had anticipated.",
                "I think sometimes a little more structure would help, maybe a few slides. I loved the guest lectures!",
                "A strength of the course is Professor Esty's open lectures, but a weakness is most of the grades of the course are assignments that we don't get much guidance on.",
                "It was good",
                "Strength - excellent professor, very engaging \r\nWeakness - no slides during class, harsh grading",
                "This course was extremely interesting and applicable to real-life occurrences. Though every lecture was jam-packed with information, I believe the course could be improved if a few lectures also included sharing media such as informative images or videos.",
                "The style of lecturing  just the professor speaking, with no visual material such as slides, etc.; was not good. It seemed like I was being taught the professor's opinion more than anything else, with no visual material or followable sources cited alongside the lecture to support the statements being made or provide accountability. The course was also heavily biased toward a green-capitalism perspective, failing to address alternate approaches and areas of environmentalism adequately.",
                "The strength is the set up of how it is lecture than a discussion section. I also think the material is really interesting.",
                "Strengths: Interesting lectures. Prof. doesn't use slides he just lectures which I enjoy but some people may find difficult\r\nWeakness: The grading system didn't make much sense so I never knew where I was in the course.",
                "Interesting material but not having lecture slides made it very difficult to review the information and stay organized",
                "I think the course can be improved by having much clearer lesson plans for the first half of the semester. I remember feeling frustrated around classes 3-8 where a lot of the lecture would devolve into a very ambiguous and unproductive Q&A with Professor Esty for long periods of time (> 7 minutes, which is a lot for a lecture in my opinion). I remember that a lot of these lectures started off with \"recaps\" of past lectures which recapped past lectures which recapped past lectures, and so on and so forth. Thus, for a good chunk of the semester, the beginning of lecture (around 20 minutes) was very repetitive and I had nothing new to take notes about. I think this was a product of Professor Esty speaking somewhat off the cuff, but I must be fair and also note that after mid-semester feedback, where students raised some of these concerns, the course became more structured and I could identify big topics, subtopics, and appropriate examples whereas before it felt much more like a stream of consciousness. \r\n\r\nThe syllabus is good overall, but I think that it could be improved by removing a lot of Professor Esty's material. Esty knows his stuff and is worthy of his expert status. However, I believe that it is the responsibility of Yale professors not to promote their material and ideas repeatedly over the semester and that they should instead bring in as many different perspectives as possible. I absolutely value learning about my professor's opinions; in fact, as I grow closer with professors throughout the semester, I make it a point to learn and ask about where they stand. But for the purposes of an introduction, I believe this opinion should be saved towards the end and done sparingly. Going through the syllabus (.docx) for Fall 2021, I found that out of the 104 \"required readings\", 12 of them were by Esty. Thus, 11.5% of the readings were authored by the lecturing professor. For comparison, an introductory course in Political Science I took had only 1 reading by the lecturing Professor. It was optional and prefaced with an acknowledgment of bias. Certainly, Professor Esty can give a good introduction to many different topics, but so can other experts. Furthermore, a lot of the works that he assigned for the class can be summarized with \"sustainability imperative\", \"red lights to green lights\" and \"internalize externalities.\" His works were frankly repetitive and did not contribute much to the syllabus.\r\n\r\nI write this because I had really high hopes for this course and even with my criticisms, think it is worth taking. I hope that future students can benefit from an even richer syllabus and better lectures in the first half of the semester.",
                "Strengths -- very interesting content & readings; great TFs; the assignments help you learn and you receive thorough feedback on them; the model COP26 was really informative and rewarding to work through.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- the lectures can be hard to follow since there is no powerpoint; readings can be on the longer side but honestly you can probably get away with skipping some of them.",
                "Overall great course and information. Possibly a greater focus on specific details and facts that are important today and less greater ideas that can be implemented. Maybe case study type info?",
                "The readings were a little long; but the professor was extremely clear and straightforward during the lecture. The topics were EXTREMELY relevant. The examples that he used during class was amazing."

                "Eh not really. While the content we went over was interesting, the lack of direction of the class coupled with the curved grading system made things very unenjoyable. Nobody had any idea what grade they had in this class because everything was curved. This made things like the COP26 simulation we did worthless for our grade because everyone got a 100% on it.",
                "Yes, I think everyone should be familiar with the issues presented in this course",
                "I would recommend this course to a student in Poli Sci or another department who wants to think about the environment. Not sure about EVST majors, since they have so many other options. I definitely wouldn't dissuade anyone from taking it. It wasn't super difficult. I will warn that, if you think critically, there is a clear bias toward industry-focused solutions in lecture, but section allows you to challenge those ideas.",
                "Absolutely. This course does a great job of meeting you where you are: the structure of the course and TFs are there to help you whether you've loved policy all of your life or have never thought about it once. The policy memos are a fantastic skill to have for the real world, and the negotiation, though it may seem stressful, is an incredibly fun activity.",
                "I took this course only because I needed another class and couldn't get into the others I wanted to get into. I attended the first class and knew I had to complete the course. Professor Esty is incredibly intelligent and cares deeply about the subjects of the course. This course actually convinced me to double major into Environmental Studies. Even for someone not considering the major, the course covers so many topics that I think most people could find some sections of the course extremely interesting.",
                "Would you want to take a sustainability course with a professor that uses a single-use water bottle every class? The class also has a strict 20-20-20-20-20 curve. The course also lacks specifics and lectures are highly repetitive. In other words, no.",
                "I would not recommend the course because I believe the professor is much too politically and economically conservative or neutral for the good of climate change adaptation\/mitigation, environmental justice, and structural reformation. I would rename the course \"White Sustainability\" for it does not incorporate indigenous histories\/modern successes in the world of sustainability nearly enough. This is especially needed considering the destructive history and habits of European peoples, perpetuated by neo-imperialism and globalization. Readings from  more diverse philosophies (of history) were sometimes included in readings but would go unmentioned\/undiscussed in class, in favor of romanticization of capitalist \"innovation.\"",
                "Not particularly. If you are an EVST major or someone with a background in climate change or sustainability, do not take this course. You likely will already know the material. It is an introductory course for those who do not know much about sustainability. If you are looking for a relative gut and looking for a broad introduction to sustainability, I would consider taking the course.",
                "Yes, this course is a very good introduction into topics such as environmental science, law, and sustainability.",
                "For someone who is not familiar with the challenges that climate change brings to the world then yes, but if you have already taken a course on environmental  studies then i don't think one should take it.",
                "Yes, I thought this class was very interesting and helped me shape my views on climate change and environmental policy. It made me surprised at the current lack of action around these matters. If anyone is at all interested in the fight against climate change, or even interested in living a more sustainable life, this class is a must-take.",
                "Yes, 100% for all students.",
                "Definitely",
                "No. TA's graded too harshly.",
                "Yes, it is a great class that will introduce you to a range of different environmental issues and their solutions.",
                "Yes, especially to students who know nothing about this information. Very eye opening.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in sustainability, who is willing to do the readings (which are really balanced) and grapple a bit with the professor's opinion, which he presents pretty strongly in class.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is looking to get a broad overview in sustainability topics and\/or has at least a partial interest in majoring in environmental studies, political science, or a related field. The topics are interesting and the workload is pretty manageable as long as you stay on top of the material throughout the course. One thing that I will say is that the grading system still seems a bit unclear, so perhaps reconsider taking this course if that matters to you.",
                "yes, its just a really intellectual and useful class that can be applied to any majors. We touched on history, politics and economics...",
                "I think the course is good to get an overall view and gain a good basic understanding of the need for global sustainability. This would be a good course for someone interested in environmental studies.",
                "Yes it gives a good general overview of climate issues.",
                "Yes, very good class. Took it as a premed and found it very engaging, not terribly hard.",
                "I would recommend every student to take this course. The course contains so much broad knowledge about sustainability that could apply to anyone's interests. It is also a great class to learn about policy memos and climate negotiations.",
                "No I would not.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes. It is a good course to understand how certain issues work in the real world.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone -- especially EVST or PLSC majors -- who want an introduction to environmental sustainable policy, policy memo writing, and international climate collaboration. The team of TFs is very good and I think you will come out learning a lot, especially if it is your first environmental policy course. Lectures can be a bit repetitive sometime.",
                "Yes. The main focus of the course is climate change. Possibly the greatest problem of our generation and important for all.",
                "Yes! It is very foundational and relevant to the climate emergency today. It teaches you things about building towards a more sustainable future."
