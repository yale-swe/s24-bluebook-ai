                "I think I learned quite a lot from this class; this is probably by far, the most engaging online seminar I have. Wang Laoshi is great at engaging all the students in class and encouraging all to participate and contribute to our discussion. One thing to be improved is probably organization (we had a calendar of assignments\/homeworks, but sometimes homework was unclear--an email often resolved the issue, though). and timing. I feel like we often have a lot of material to cover, but sometimes we just don't have time to finish everything. Overall this was a great course--I wish I had interacted with Wang Laoshi more throughout the semester.",
                "I think with language classes, the transition to online classes is especially rough. For one, we dont need to know how to hand write characters anymore, which makes exams much easier, but at the same time its harder to memorize and differentiate characters that look similar. Overall, I think there were few opportunities to speak and practice the material. I think maybe a tutorial session to supplement the class would be an amazing addition.",

She usually prepares quite a bit of interactive and experimental activities in previous years like going to the YUAG and actually practicing Chinese calligraphy, which would've been fun. You also learn a broad range of topics in this class, which definitely boosts your Chinese vocabulary.",
