                "A big strength is how many regions of the world the class focuses on. I do wish that we had spent a bit more time on Africa and North America (these are the two units that felt shorter), but that is difficult to change given the length of the semester. I also liked the variety of assignments (essays\/op-eds\/creative assignments).",
                "One strength was the global aspect of the course. One of my biggest takeaways is just all that I learned about indigenous cultures and movements in so many diverse regions of the world. Another strength of the course was the assignments. I loved the freedom that was given to students to pursue their own interests with each assignment! The professor is also passionate and knowledgable about the course and cares about student learning. While I really appreciated how the modules of the course were organized by continent, I do think that this structure may have contributed to less engaged discussions in class. Because the materials for each week covered a wide range of topics (with the unifying factor being their pertinence to a geographical region), it was hard to build any sort of theoretical or thematic basis upon which to build discussions.",
                "Strengths: Professor Onco-Ingyadet is obviously very passionate about these topics, and brought that energy to the class each week. The facilitation was excellent.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I expected this course to center a transnational lens of analysis throughout the semester in order to trace together different groups processes of resisting colonial violence and creating space for community solidarity, but it often felt like we were kind of randomly jumping from region to region, reading an amalgam of texts that did not necessarily relate to one another or previous materials. In addition to the at-times surface level amount of engagement this course allowed space for due to the speed with which we shuffled between regions, I found the assignment structure kind of arbitrary: the Note-Taking Matrices felt to me like busy work that did not help me engage more with the class texts. To be clear, I enjoyed this course, but I think it could benefit from some tweaking of the syllabus in order to make the learning experience as seamless as possible for students.",
                "I think the course should be two times per week rather than one.",
                "Strengths: Rich and diverse in course material, variety of in class activities, personal\/honest\/patient instructor\r\nWeaknesses: Ambiguity in rubrics (e.g. if a direct mention of course material was required in assignments, more clarity could have been provided)"

                "I definitely would! It is valuable as provides insight into the variety of indigenous experiences around the world. I think we typically only learn about Indigenous communities in the US, so this was a very important\/insightful class. Also, the readings were all very interesting and the seminar was engaging.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are genuinely interested in learning about diverse aspects of indigenous life in diverse regions of the globe, or are looking for a class that is genuinely interesting but pretty lowkey.",
                "Its pretty low-commitment relative to other courses Ive taken, and Professor Onco-Ingyadet is a gem. That said, I would read the syllabus and see how actually interested you are in the specific course materials. If you are only going to take one ER&M class at Yale, I dont know if I would suggest this one: other seminars Ive taken have been more educational and thought-provoking. However, if this courses themes speak to you, I think its a great space to engage with them with a facilitator who so clearly cares about the work shes doing."
