I learned the major philosophical schools in ancient Greece, as well as important figures in this domain, including Parmenides, Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Epictetus, Epicurus, Lucretius, and Sextus Empiricus. I learned how to compose a philosophy paper that first reconstructs an argument and then points out something about it that is interesting. I walked away from this class ready to apply these learnings, particularly those core concepts and reasonings used by the schools of philosophy we've covered, to my daily lives which has proven to make thinking about things easier in general.",

                "No weaknesses. I enjoyed this class so much!",
                "The ideas themselves were very interesting to learn about, but the arguments were difficult to understand sometimes. There are a lot of readings, and you need to understand them pretty well to write a good paper. The pacing sometimes seemed very fast. The sections really helped you understand the content.",
                "Strengths: I felt it was a very fair course in terms of workload. I also feel I have learned a lot about philosophy as someone who's never taken a class in philosophy before. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I often felt during the first paper that I had no idea how to write a paper in a philosophy class. I think more instruction and examples might be helpful in this regard.",
                "Strengths: the texts being taught are excellent and well worth reading. \r\nWeaknesses: Pretty much everything else: boring lectures, section was largely a waste of time, unnecessarily harsh grading. Also, we didn't read as much material as we probably should've  it would've been good to read some Seneca, or more of Aristotle's metaphysics, etc.",
                "Strength was discussing ideas and offering objections in the paper. Weakness was reading the material.",
                "Strengths of the course are the material and discussion sections.",
                "A strength of the course is the informative lectures since I feel that I learned a lot through attending lectures and reading through the handouts. A weakness is the lack of support in terms of paper writing. This being my first college course, I struggled on my first paper simply because I didn't know what to expect, and very little support was given for writing the paper.",
                "Lectures can get a bit boring and can do with more student engagement. The sections should cover materials relevant to class that week.",
                "Some strengths were that Professor Harte's lectures were very engaging and that discussion sections were very effective in making ideas clearer. I felt that a weakness was that sometimes the handouts were not too clear.",
                "good",
                "Loved this class. The strength of this class for me is the interesting selection of materials. I found every reading fascinating and it was always fun to follow someone else's logic to see how they got to their conclusions, and it was almost always insightful. The weakness of this class I would say is the lectures. While they are very interesting, I rarely walked away from a lecture thinking to myself: wow I understood everything. And this generates an unnecessary amount of stress as I worry if I had misunderstood parts of the lecture that could be crucial to the overall understanding of the concepts.",
                "The standards were extremely high, especially for a first year student, but I rose to the challenge and improved tremendously. One problem I had with this course was it took an unreasonably long time to receive feedback for essays.",
                "This course was not graded as an introductory course. Rather, despite the syllabus stating otherwise, the essays and other coursework were graded as though this was an intermediate-level class. To that end, I wish there was a greater emphasis within this course on philosophical writing as it is quite different from other forms of writing. Furthermore, despite incorporating instructor feedback from previous essays, and being recognized for doing so, in every essay the bar was continually raised without new knowledge of philosophical writing being imparted or discussed in class. Rather, we only broached new philosophical topics.",
                "Strengths\r\nThe TAs, at least in my experience, were fantastic.\r\nThe course material was very interesting and readings were assigned in an order that made a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\nI felt that the professor was a little harsh on writing standards to the point where papers were sometimes graded lower than I think other professors would have graded them. That said, I must admit that this did help me to grow as a writer.\r\nI wish the course covered Aristotle's metaphysics in addition to the Nicomachean Ethics, because it really serves as a backdrop to later scholastic thought.",
                "The professor and team are a definite strength.",
                "The course had wonderful readings whereby important extracts were focused on but we were still given the liberty to read the text more. The prompts were also favorable and allowed one to think about what they have read. One thing I enjoyed was the instruction at the beginning of the course to also apply what we read in our everyday life, of course being careful with what we choose to embody from the readings. A weakness was the style of the lectures. I found the handouts to be quite clear and helpful with pointers and general ideas, but the actual lectures felt like we were reading the handouts and there wasn't much fleshing out of the points put forward. This was rather annoying as attending the lectures felt meaningless. More activities like the debate should have been organized as these were a great way to get different understandings of the texts from peers. Additionally, a compare-contrast approach could have been taken on major themes for better understanding and synthesis.",
                "Lectures sometimes became unengaging. Discussion sections weren't always discussions but rather review.",
                "Strengths: Lecture notes were comprehensive and discussion sections provided for an interesting way to engage with the material\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were not the most engaging and often felt as if they didn't offer much insight into the readings",
                "Strengths: good set of texts and reasonable amounts of homework, Prof. Harte is also a good lecturer and clearly very knowledgable\r\nWeaknesses: very little feedback in the first few months and so very hard to assess one's standing in the class"

Unfortunately, the class itself isn't great; the lectures are pretty dull and attendance is compulsory, which sucks. Also the grading is pretty harsh, for no real reason. But still take the class to read the texts  though if you have the time to read them outside of class, you'll get just as much out of them to be hoenst.",

                "I would recommend it. Analyzing the specific steps/reasoning that the philosophers' arguments follow is challenging, but it really helped me think more critically about what I was reading and writing. Also, the papers are a bit difficult to do well on and the final is fairly manageable.",

                "I would HIGHLY recommend this class to anyone even remotely interested in philosophy. I'm a CS major who took this class as a writing credit. Seriously, it's a life changing class (or rather it can be). If you take your time with the readings, you can readily see how the concepts apply to your everyday life and it makes a nice, cohesive foundation for your inquiries and thoughts to operate on top of. The things that you learn about how arguments are constructed and verified are also extraordinarily useful in the day to day.",
                "I would recommend this class if you have studied philosophy previously. It's a bit extreme for a first venture into philosophy. This said, I loved the class and would take it again.",
                "Yes, if not for any other reason, the content studied is super illuminating. I am a strong believer that every Yale student should have some knowledge of the western canon.",

                "I would recommend it to someone looking to understand ancient Greek philosophy better, especially the particular philosophers focused on. I do not see it as necessary for someone with a general interest in philosophy and looking for their first class.",
                "Yes, it definitely teaches what it sets out to.",
                "Not necessarily for non-majors; I think there are other, more engaging philosophy classes offered at Yale. If you're very into ancient philosophy, though, the texts themselves are interesting and the workload is light so it might be worth taking.",
                "Yes -- you learn a lot of ancient philosophy (some pre-Socratics, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Stoics and Epicureans). Definitely recommend this class for anyone interested in philosophy or classics or even anyone who just wants to think about some interesting ideas like \"what makes for a happy life.\""
