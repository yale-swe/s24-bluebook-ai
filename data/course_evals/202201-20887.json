                "I enjoyed the independence students got during experimental work, which allowed us to develop our laboratory skills and let students experience a little bit of what independent research may be like.\r\n\r\nThe only thing in terms of course improvement is if the specifications for writing assignments could be written out in an announcement\/ file instead of just in said class. This way students can make sure they are meeting all of the requirements of an assignment.",

                "Yes! This should be the advanced lab that chemistry majors take. The lab assume students to be more mature in their lab experience and give them freedom to make choices in an experimental setting. Additionally, the course focuses on how to write a research paper with a focus on clarity and conciseness. I feel that my writing has definitely improved after the course.",
                "Yeah, I highly recommend it as your advanced lab.",
