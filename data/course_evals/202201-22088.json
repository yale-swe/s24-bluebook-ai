PLEASE don't make next year have their thesis due, thesis presentation due, and thesis poster symposium all within the same week. That was horrible to have on top of all other classes.",
                "Strengths: independent work, ability to interact with mentor/PI and learn in a rigorous research setting\r\nWeaknesses: lack of structure in the course; it might be nice to have a mid-semester check-in with other students taking the course, so that we can share our research progress and get feedback from our peers.",
                "Strength: the autonomy is great \r\nWeakness: communication surrounding the expectations for each portion of the project (paper, poster, presentation) was disorganized and sent late.",
                "it really just depends on how your lab functions. In regards to this course, improvement could be made in actually providing support for students in their labs. For one thing, requiring that students have a printed poster of sorts for the final presentation, but no funding from the department is kinda laughable. Additionally, the deadines for some of the assignments were so unclear and not communicated throughout the semester, only during the last week.",
                "Might be nice to have a bit more communications between the faculty and students just to make sure students are on-track, but overall the course was really great!",
                "I thought it was a great senior research course - I can see the overall evaluation depending on your lab environment, mentor, and PI.",
                "couldve had food at the presentations",
                "This course was a wonderful opportunity to get experience in research, and I learned so much.",
                "Lots of stuff is backloaded, was a bit stressful near the end. Also MCDB has no funding for posters. It is actually quite classist that they require us to come up with a poster but yet provide no funding--many labs do not fund a poster, and so then the cost is on the student. It is possible to just print sheets of paper but those do not look nearly as nice, and your poster looks 2nd rate for something that's not your fault. If MCDB is not providing funding, they should not require the poster session, ESPECIALLY since there is already an oral presentation the same week.",
                "Would be nice to have more detailed instructions regarding the thesis components. Deadlines and details about final paper, presentation, and poster were lacking.",
                "I liked how it was independent and you could choose what type of research you wanted to do",
                "More flexibility for unexpected circumstances would be nice! My lab members were great but I sometimes felt unsupported by the professors running this class",
                "I wish that we had received more feedback throughout the semester and had clearer communication regarding expectations and deadlines",
                "Poor consistency from PI to PI.",
                "The main weakness would be the number of assignments: a written report AND oral presentation AND a poster? I think two of those three would have been more appropriate",
                "A weakness of this course was the layout of the final week. I think that the oral presentations should have occurred in early April, like they were supposed to, so that the workload was more spread out. Because it wasn't spread out, my lab had me doing benchwork until the Friday before the final week of classes, leaving me very little time to prepare my presentation, poster, and paper. Additionally, requiring the paper to be turned  in at 4 pm when you ran the poster session from 2-4 pm the same day was the worst idea you could've possibly had. The syllabus does stated the the paper would be due at 5 pm so having it be due not only earlier, but right at the end of the poster session was inconsiderate. Make them due on separate days, or at the very least, separate times.",
                "The assignments being back loaded was hard, so maybe changing things around a little",
                "More communication from course coordinators about upcoming deadlines/dates and dont make the paper and poster due on the same day (especially not the last day of classes, the week before the last day would be better.)",
                "Your enjoyment of the course does depend on your PI and the lab you choose, so you should choose wisely. Also, there is very little guidance and checkpoints outside of your lab (ie. from the course administrators or the MCDB registrar) so it is up to you, your mentor, and your PI to ensure you are on track. You need to communicate with your peers and manage your time wisely, or you will be a bit screwed. I do sometimes wish there were more enforceable checkpoints to make sure you were making good progress, but it is difficult to enforce given the nature of the senior thesis.",
                "Strengths include the oral presentation and opportunity to complete year-long research. Reports were also a helpful way of consolidating research. It could be good if funding was provided for poster printing."

Also, make sure to communicate with your lab if you do decided to pursue the research route. I honestly should have taken the BS intensive version as i ended up spending close to 20-25+ hours a week in the lab (so just make sure to communicate your goals and intentions as well as boundaries to research mentors when deciding which MCDB class you want to take for the degree requirement)",
