Mesoamerica is a region that has been clouded by over half a millennium of historical bias so an integral part of the course was rebuilding the foundations for our knowledge of Mesoamerica. Many aspects of Mesoamerican culture and history do not fit into the Eurocentric molds of viewing history and anthropology. The insight I picked up in this course regarding processing cultures and histories is knowledge that I will continue to use throughout my educational and professional career."

                "The course did an excellent job painting a picture of the anthropological region of Mesoamerica, from the first human settlements to the Spanish conquest. We discussed not only the history of the region, but the history of the modern archeological and anthropological efforts in the region and how they developed. We also compared historical, pre-Columbian practices to practices of modern indigenous people in the region today. Overall, the course not only presented the history of Mesoamerica, but put it into context through the discussions of how the modern study came to be along with how pre-Colombian culture is still prominent and significant today in many parts of Mesoamerica."
