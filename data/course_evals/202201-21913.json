            "comments": [
                "Strengths: \r\n- The TAs really brought a lot of warmth, energy, and support to this course\r\n- I appreciated the research proposal assignments, since they helped us gain a deeper understanding and think about a potential experiment beyond what we saw in lab \r\n- The range of specimens that we had the privilege to see/dissect\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Getting feedback on our prelab prompts would be helpful. Similarly, on the research proposals it was often unclear why points had been taken off in areas / how many points were lost for a given error, so that would be helpful information to have given back to us. \r\n- Since there were so few major assignments, one bad grade could really eliminate your chances of doing well in the course. I wish there had been more things to help balance our grades (lab notebooks, diagram labeling, etc). \r\n- It felt really difficult to prepare for lab practicals, especially for the second practical that involved so many dissections. Since the diagrams often didn't match what we saw in real life, studying was tough. Also, since it was really unclear what terms we would be responsible for on the second practical (since we had seen so few of the muscles in our specimens) it was nearly impossible to know what terms were fair game. Providing us with a practice practical or a study guide of potential terms would really ease the stress and aid in our preparation.  \r\n- the dissections themselves were often really difficult to understand, in part because there often weren't detailed instructions on how to do the dissection. For someone who hasn't done any dissections, more guidance would have been really helpful so we didn't cut through so many important structures.",
                "I really enjoyed the format of this course, and I appreciated the diversity of specimens we were exposed to. I think that it could be beneficial to have a little more guidance on how we were supposed to take notes for the dissections, but overall we figured it out well by just taking pictures and labeling.",
                "This course was a great way to enter the field of anatomy.  The dissections were definitely a lot more helpful than the interactive fossil and skeleton stations but I think the mix of both made it interesting",
                "This class is the definition of hands-on, which is a major strength. It made topics from lecture seem even more tangible and taught me useful dissection and identification skills. I think it would have helped to have more guidance, especially in the beginning of the class-- for someone with no dissection background, it was a little off-putting to receive no instructions other than, like, \"cut.\" It was frustrating that often no one could give straight answers to our questions (the TFs didn't all have experience with the structures we were supposed to identify, and Dr. Moyer refused to confirm anything conclusively). Because of this, I sometimes questioned whether the dissections were worth the lives of the animals as opposed to studying from diagrams, where we actually had some external information. The class felt very much like a free-for-all and I'm lucky to have had an enthusiastic lab partner and hardworking TFs. I think adding some structure (maybe asking us to draw diagrams or answer questions during lab) and some concrete information would go a long way.",
                "There was a lot of room to be curious in lab and ask questions and explore different ideas. Sometimes there wasn't as much structure as I would've liked and it was hard to know when you'd identified enough structures on the specimens or hard to figure out exactly how to carry out the dissection. I wish there had been more available reference specimens dissected by the TFs so that you didn't wonder after the fact whether you'd seen the right things/correctly identified what was what.",
                "It can be interesting to open up animals and explore around. Sometimes it was hard to know what we should be focusing on in the dissections. And the non-dissection labs felt like a waste of time.  So did the research proposals.",
                "I like that the course was very hands on with allowing us to do our own dissections, as I thought that it made it easier to visualize what we saw on diagrams and remember structures better. I wish that there had been more comprehensive information as to which structures we were being tested on, as for some species no structures were particularly circled yet there was countless amounts of structures labeled on the diagrams. This made it a little hard to narrow down what specifically to study for during the exams."
