                "Strength: The class was very homework oriented and helped with reviewing the content we learned for that specific day.\r\nWeakness: The module for our semester assignment was outdated and confusing, causing it to be difficult to locate homework. I would recommend creating a weekly newsletter on canvas for assignments.",
                "Strengths: intensive; quick and noticeable improvement as long as you kept up with the lessons; choi ssn was always diligent with giving feedback on your work and was quick to grade assignments and tests\r\nWeaknesses: the class schedule was a bit difficult to follow; due dates for assignments and quiz dates were unclear sometimes",
                "It is fine at the beginning but it is so disorganized that it feels weird and as if what we are learning isnt cohesive",
                "Strengths: improved Korean skills, particularly writing; provides many opportunities for practice in order to solidify understanding; taught in Korean and often engage in conversation in Korean with other heritage speaker; Seiyoung Kim is an amazing, supportive TA!!\r\nWeakness: a bit disorganized, sometimes unclear which assignments are due and when",
                "Strengths: Group projects",
                "Strengths include learning a lot of vocabulary and quickly becoming more familiar with Korean, and weaknesses include unorganized homework and project deadlines, as well as not knowing sometimes what tests were going to occur.",
                "Strengths: having the opportunity to practice speaking in conversation every day, constant feedback\r\nWeaknesses: the course was a bit disorganized in that assignments and instructions were sometimes unclear",
                "Typically, work is assigned daily which makes it difficult to keep up with the courseload at some points in the semester. However, since this class occurs every day, it is easy to see personal growth in learning.",
                "strengths is that she starts from the basics, but weaknesses is that there is a wide range of abilities all in one class. there really needs to be an L1 and L2 heritage korean class. I often felt behind other students and the large class size made me not want to ask questions or speak up. this class sort of assumes you are fluent in listening and speaking and focuses more on reading and writing. I was neither. also, the class was not well organized. i was often confused about deadlines and assignments."

                "Yes! Although the class can be a bit difficult or disorganized at times, I greatly improved my Korean skills and met amazing classmates. This class fits heritage speakers who can speak and understand Korean decently but wish to learn formal grammar rules and vocabulary.",
