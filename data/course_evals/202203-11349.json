I would recommend creating a weekly newsletter on canvas for assignments.",
                "Strengths: intensive; quick and noticeable improvement as long as you kept up with the lessons; choi ssn was always diligent with giving feedback on your work and was quick to grade assignments and tests\r\nWeaknesses: the class schedule was a bit difficult to follow; due dates for assignments and quiz dates were unclear sometimes",
                "It is fine at the beginning but it is so disorganized that it feels weird and as if what we are learning isnt cohesive",

                "Strengths: Group projects",

I often felt behind other students and the large class size made me not want to ask questions or speak up. this class sort of assumes you are fluent in listening and speaking and focuses more on reading and writing. I was neither. also, the class was not well organized. i was often confused about deadlines and assignments."
