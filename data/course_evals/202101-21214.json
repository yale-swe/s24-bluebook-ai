I learned much more about how to develop a character arc in personal and writing-about-other-person essays, how to created a unified impression about a place, create satire effects, and also analyze what devices or styles other writers use to make their arguments convincing.",
                "My writing skills developed immensely while taking this course. Through the discussion of many examples, students developed an understanding of various writing strategies. We then employed them in our own writing at the end of the unit. Not only did my writing skills improve, but my ability as a reader improved, as well. I learned how to read thoughtfully and comprehensively.",

I gained valuable writing skills, including structuring an essay, writing with clear sentences, and using thematic repetition to portray a unified impression of the essay topic. I grew the most as a writer from the cultural critique unit. I developed udnerstanding of the nuance of a cultural critique as opposed to an opinion piece. I value the ability of the alientated perspective of a cultural critique to illuminate the significance of cultural practices.",

                "Strengths: AMAZING Professor, you can really tell that the Professor is super passionate about teaching and really there to help, she fosters a super encouraging and supportive atmosphere for students and encourages everyone to not be afraid to speak their mind. Also, easy to talk to and approach and meet with to discuss essays. The workshops were also great bonding experience for students to learn how to analyze others' writings and still offer constructive feedback. On a similar note, I loved how we analyzed so many different types of essays with different structures and topics to really give us ideas for good examples to learn. \r\n\r\nWeakness: (Literally the ONLY one) just that some of the reading and analyzing different essays across the whole semester just got a little redundant towards the end, but I think that's only because it's online. If it were in person, it might feel different. However, I still enjoyed all of it!",
                "This course is a great intro-to-personal-essay writing course. I think its strengths are, in part, also its weaknesses--there are a ton of readings, which are great for demonstrating a wide range of writing styles but less great in how overwhelming the workload sometimes feels. I loved workshops, but I also didn't think we did enough in-class writing or editing.",
                "This course was very strong in that it provided a comfortable and lively environment for student discussion and learning. The workshop process, which included peer feedback, was a process that was intimidating at first, but ultimately became fun and constructive. The material we read was always interesting and allowed for students to rethink the ways in which they read and write.",
                "This course is super engaging and I appreciated the time and effort Prof. Shirkhani put in to giving us essay feedback. If you like writing, its definitely the course for you. I liked that the readings werent too long so that we could focus on writing, although I do think that sometimes the readings for one unit didnt line up with when the essay for that unit started. Some rearranging of the dates we read certain essays might be helpful, but overall there arent any big weaknesses about the course.",
                "The workshops are great! The readings were really fun, even though we didnt always get to discuss all of them.",
                "Having some guidance via email and having an outline of what all we were going to discuss was very helpful in having an organized and thorough conversation. In the beginning, things were a bit too freeform, but when we added some structure, we had a more productive conversation. We weren't given the answers and techniques immediately but talked together to discover them, even with adding guiding questions.",
                "The strength of this course was the in-depth perpsective on the goals of short-form essays and the techniques the authors use to achieve those goals. The engagement of students in the class in high, and everyone is able to share opinions about the selected readings. The environment was friendly and conducive to growing from peer critiques. The one area in which the class lacked was tangible examples of specific grammar techniques and sentence structures. I would like to see more specific examples of sentence-level structure, so that I can study and replicate them.",

Beyond the occasional technical difficulties and Zoom fatigue, there were no glaring issues with the virtual format.",

I feel like if I were ever given an assignment to write an article for an organization or just post something of my own, I would have a much better foundation for what why how and where to start.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys writing creative (nonfiction) prose. I really enjoyed the writing prompts, and the readings were very interesting. The workload is pretty significant, though, so you have to enjoy reading and writing to enjoy the course.",
                "yes!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the course provided me with a new understanding of reading and writing, something that will surely benefit me going forward. The course pushed me to write in a way that was oftentimes vulnerable, and students were encouraged to expand their creative boundaries as writers.",
                "Yes!!!! Especially with Professor Shirkhani. This is a great writing course if you like to write, but you dont necessarily have to know how to write or be good at it to do well. I really improved my writing over time with Professor Shirkhanis help. And you get the time to read some great essays!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. It is a Yale staple and for good reason. I have never received more detailed feedback from a professor on my essays. There were well over 100 line-edits (many of which were positive constructive comments or remarks on nice sentences) on some of my drafts. Professor Shirkhani wrote an often extensive piece at the bottom of the draft with very useful suggestions for the final draft, which I did my best to incorporate. They were insightful and articulated feelings I had about the essay that I couldn't myself put into words. And Professor Shirkhani fosters a very warm and uplifting environment in her class, something that was evident even in the zoom format. The readings were great and enjoyable and not overly time-consuming. Overall, a delightful class that one would be remiss not to take.",
                "Yes! Its a great baseline course no matter your major. If you like reading the New Yorker (judging by the number of tote bags on campus, you do) or the Atlantic type things, this is a great class. Readings arent dense at all! The individual feedback on essays is really great as well.",
                "The readings are so interesting, and the discussions are very fun. Everyone in class was kind, respectful, and funny. Workshop feedback was always so helpful, and my professor was just awesome.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who would like to become a better writer. The level of intensity was low. The feedback that I recieved on my essays was incredibly detailed and extremely helpful. After applying the edits Dr. Shirkhani suggested, I was left thinking, \"Wow, I didn't know I could write like this!\"",
                "I 100% would. Especially for non-English majors, it is incredibly important to develop your writing skills and this class will do it. I came out of it recognizing everywhere I go the rhetorical strategies that I learned and discussed in class. This class really pushes you, but in the best way (through positive encouragement and support, well-defined expectations, and incredibly talented classmates that push you to do your best)."
