                "Provides a great overview of security fundamentals and web application security. Provides an intro to systems programming security, but does not spend much time there. I had a previous background and found it helpful to fill in gaps in my own understanding.",
                "I learned about some of the history behind modern security, security foundations, web security, and software security. The syllabus is pretty accurate. I think the biggest takeaway from this class for me is thinking about the way that I integrate secure design principles into applications in the future and having a greater understanding of the adversarial mindset. Also, I got to experience hacking a few websites and applications in the CTF challenges in this course which at times were difficult but also very practical.",
                "Basic understanding of computer system security. I think I learned the most in the Web security unit, learning about vulnerabilities and defenses of web apps.",
                "Lots and lots and lots of security principles and network security stuff, and only buffer overflow for system security. We learned how to hack stuff in a CTF environment as well as existing defense measures. Honestly a fun class with lots of topics.",
                "computer security, web security",
                "I learned principles of computer security, and a lot about web security, and some systems security too, as well as how to employ and defend against various types of attacks in each category.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Instructor made all materials available, homework was interactive CTFs compared to theoretical assignments\r\nWeakness: Most exploit techniques had to be learned on your own, with maybe a demo in class.",
                "Strengths: I loved the in class examples, especially when they were relevant to the homework. I thought the CTF challenges were interesting and really helped me understand how a specific attack worked. The real life examples of when a certain exploit was used or when a certain company was compromised were fantastic and made the knowledge we were learning more practical. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is a lot of material in this course and I think Computer Security at Yale could benefit by splitting into two separate courses. One proposal is having an intro and advanced course. I also think that the first half of the course could benefit with some case studies because some of the topics felt a bit abstract.",
                "Strength: the homework assignments are mostly CTFs, which are very fun and rewarding.\r\nWeakness: the lectures could get a bit hard to follow, since there are lots of new concepts introduced here and there.",
                "There are lots of materials to cover so you get to learn and explore a variety of topics, and the active in-class discussion sometimes makes it a really enjoyable experience. But since it has way too many materials, sometimes you can feel overwhelmed, and the pacing does feel a bit off (i.e. barely any systems). I think a better balance between the contents would be helpful. Also loved the real world examples and current events mentioned!",
                "The assignments -- capture-the-flags, exercises, and writing about popular security research -- were SO fun, and I learned so much from them. They were the real strengths of the course. The lectures were great, if dense -- but there was so much content, and the exams were closed note, which made them pretty difficult.",

Even if you're not interested in becoming a leet hacker, you should probably still think about how to design secure applications and understand that there are many many ways to exploit software.",
                "Yes, I think it's a fun course that covers an aspect of CS that is not often mentioned. While it is not central to software development, knowing some system security stuff is definitely helpful when working in the industry.",
                "Yes! If you're at all interested in how the web works, regardless of the security aspect, you learn a lot. If you want to go into creating web applications or software, you're exposed to a lot of beneficial information about making good security choices.",
                "YESSSS! This is a really fun course. The thrill of cracking a hacking level is unmatched. You get to learn so much fun topics and have so much fun, and you'll become less paranoid of people claiming to \"hunt you down\" online. It's like an enjoyable course full of breadth. But do be warned: CPSC323 prereq is highly highly highly recommended for the systems portion, though there is a helpful walkthrough that the professor does.",
                "I would recommend this to any student interested in computer security! It was great, and the PSETs were fun, and we covered a super wide breadth of technologies and strategies. The class wasn't big, so it ended up being a lot of fun.",
