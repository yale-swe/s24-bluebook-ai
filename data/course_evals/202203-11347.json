                "I think the biggest strength is that you, simply put, learn Korean. The everyday nature of the class means that you're constantly speaking the language and therefore can keep up the language quite easily. There's also a sheer ton of vocabulary that you are forced to learn and use, which helps in expanding the conversational topics available. Also, the TA system is great; I really enjoyed getting to know my TA and have weekly sessions to practice Korean in a non-stressful environment. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are a few weaknesses. Namely, there were often times the assignment schedule did not match up with what was going on in class. Many times, the times when we took a quiz would switch around based on really nothing, so I would study for a quiz and then not have it be done and vice versa. The same would be true with assignmentsmany were lacking directions. I also wish the course syllabus focused less on things related to job interviews/workplace and more on topics that actually would arise when speaking at this level of Korean. Given none of us are fluent enough to hold a job in Korean, it seemed a bit silly to practice job interview questions in Korean. Also, I would like for there to be less English spoken in class; I was hoping that at this level, the class would be conducted entirely in Korean, but I found myself not able to push myself to the extent I wished given that I could fall back on English as a crutch."

                "I think if you're taking this, you don't really have a choice so this is probably moot. It's a good class, but it's a lot of work (some necessary, some just tedious). I don't think I would take it at 9:25 again, but a 10:30 L3 Korean class I would recommend. It's a stepping stone for fluency, and I think this is a decent option."
