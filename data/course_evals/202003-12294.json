The second half of the semester covered statistical mechanics, where I learned about the partition functions in the canonical and grand canonical ensemble and how you use them to derive meaningful thermodynamic statements about a collection of particles. We consider systems classically and quantum mechanically and culminate with the analysis of Fermi and Bose gases (quantum treatment of gases of identical particles).",

                "This class is very thorough and gives a complete rigorous foundation for thermodynamics. I have a good understanding of many of the concepts and calculations we did. However, I found it poorly structured, since I constantly had trouble figuring out where the current lesson fit into the larger scope of thermodynamics and how to use the results we derived. Additionally, I do not feel like this class gave me a good intuition for thermodynamics. The problem sets were generally very good with interesting problems to help with practice on the calculations, though.",
                "The lectures were very nicely delivered and homework was the right length and covered the relevant topics that we needed to know. Straight to the point and definitely doable. However, the midterm and final did not seem to match the psets and the lectures too well. The TA for this course was incredibly helpful with the weekly study sessions.",
                "Strength: Amazing TA who was so available and Professor Meng was a good professor too.",
                "Strengths: Rewarding problem sets, straight-forward exams, clear content, great TA office hours.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some problem sets were unclear\/modified midweek, some problem sets were far more difficult than others (and far beyond the scope of the course in my opinion).",
                "Strength: Psets were appropriate in difficulty and aligned with the course content very well. Review sheet before the Final Exam was also very helpful. \r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "This was the most horrifically poorly organized course I have ever taken. I learned nothing, understood even less, and I could not have gotten through this course without the TA holding my hand (Abhi was really great though). There was too much content that we moved through way too quickly and we were never made to understand the purpose of what we were covering in lecture. It was frustrating and traumatizing.",
                "The strengths of this course include the notes, textbooks, take-home open-note exams, and excellent TA. The course could be improved by having a study guide\/list of equations we need to know for each exam, as there were many.",
                "It was taught very well for the range of difficulty of the course.",
                "The course is well-organized and the lectures are very clear. The pset\/exam questions were quite interesting. Sometimes it takes time to make the connection between concepts taught in class and the pset questions, but it's definitely worth the time, as you get a good understanding of how the concepts are applied to different systems at the end of the day.",
                "Any sort of structure or organization to the material we were taught would have been helpful. Outlines of topics that we expect to cover are much more helpful than hearing \"Okay, today we're talking about [topic]\" out of the blue at the start of every class."

While I dont feel like I have a strong understanding of all of the concepts, I am beginning to have familiarity with some entirely new ideas. I will say, though, that statistical mechanics is extraordinarily important and powerful in its ability to connect microscopic systems with macroscopic observables.
