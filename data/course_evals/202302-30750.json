I believe the skills I've gained will help me craft more elegant essays, during my college application, when I'll write essays as a student, and at any other point in the future.\r\nI also really enjoyed extracting information and the outline from a passage written by someone else. I believe this is an essential skill to have, so I am very grateful to have honed it from this course."
