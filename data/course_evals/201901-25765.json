    "The strengths are the syllabus, the professor's interesting thoughts and experiences, and the class discussion",
    "The readings were so good!! I could not tell how they related to each other at all at the start of the course, but they definitely tied together at the end.",
    "This course is excellent. The readings are all well-chosen and are extremely diverse in terms of style and time period. Sometimes discussions meandered a little bit, but every class was an engaging experience.",
    "The strengths of the course are its reading list and its professor. The weaknesses are the sheer amount of reading, which is at times unrealistic. This makes it hard to engage fully with the class."

    "Yes -- this was an excellent class. The syllabus seemed very varied at first, but everything fit together really well.",
    "yes!",
    "YES! The concept of the class is fascinating and the amount of reading\/writing really ensures that you are internalizing the material.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to everyone. I grew as a writer and as a thinker through working with Professor Thompson. The demanding syllabus may have made it difficult to actually do all of the required reading, but nonetheless I felt as though I was able to learn quite a bit."
