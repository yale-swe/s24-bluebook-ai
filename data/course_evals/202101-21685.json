                "Covers far too much topic and details that are most often nowhere necessary for the exams, thus costing unnecessary stress and concern over the study materials for students. Unclear study objectives, what topics are important and how detailed we should understand certain processes, in addition to very low overall points on the exam that cost nearly 10% or more per question.",
                "The lectures were by far the most difficult portion of this class. They were much longer than the time that is cut out for the lectures and often needed a great amount of supplementary material to clarify the complex topics that were brought up. The time given for exams was quite unfair even when many did not finish the midterm in the time allotted, the number of questions was increased on the final. If the course was truly about learning biology they would make showing how much biology knowledge you have not dependent on how long it takes to recall that knowledge.",
                "Very poor instruction and limited engagement with students.",
                "Due to the nature of the course, it was easy to get distracted and fall off course.",
                "The recorded lecture format is brutal. Just hard to keep motivated and engage with material.",
                "Lectures and expectations were sometimes confusing. The info/skills taught were useful and interesting.",
                "I think the course jammed in a lot of information in a short amount of time. The lectures were sometimes really hard and contained a lot of complex content that I feel could have been more spaced out so that we could understand the concepts better. I feel as though problem sets or homework assignments following the format of the final and midterm could be given in order to help prepare.",
                "The recorded lectures were quite boring and unengaging",
                "Strengths - the PSETs were very interesting and engaging \r\nWeakness - the way the course material was presented, lack of practice quizzes prior to exam",
                "There was a lot of information and it was hard to know what to focus on. The exams were hard to finish on time. A strength is that the topics were very interesting. However, I think the course tried to fit too much in, especially since the homework did not directly reinforce lecture.",
                "Professor Zhong clearly knows the concepts that he would like to convey to the class, however it is often buried in examples that make it easy to lose track of the actual relationship to the material to be understood. I think live lectures where we could ask questions to better understand these examples would have greatly improved my experience in the class.",
                "Strengths were that professor went in depth and gave a lot of supporting examples to help clarify points; peer tutors were also very helpful in understanding course material.\r\nWeaknesses were that professor sometimes used advanced terminology so lectures were difficult to follow.",
                "Amazing course with amazing professors.",
                "The course was SO hard online. There was just sooooo much information per lecture, and the exams were horrible. I don't think we should have been tested in a final exam that required us to design ten experiments in fourty five questions in only 75 minutes. It was such a stressful experience. Everyone hated it. The midterm wasn't as bad - the final should have been more like it. The strengths of this course are enrichment and Professor Hartman and the peer tutors. And that we learned some interesting things about stem cells, cancer, and development.",
                "Content was interesting, the recorded lectures were helpful, the PowerPoint slides were informative. It is very structured and it's clear what needs to be done each week. Certain topics weren't explained particularly well and appeared on exams, and the review for the final was not particularly representative of what we ended up seeing.",
                "Strengths: Writing a proposal was a very interesting and effective way to apply what we learned\r\nWeaknesses: I miss the mentoring that we had in the BIOL 101 project. I wish we had one-on-one meetings built in for this project as well. Also, the lecture organization could use a lot of improvement. Slides were often confusing and I had to ask for clarification from TA's and Professor Hartman.",
                "Strengths: the lack of synchronous lectures was nice.\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion section was not particularly helpful and the lectures did not prepare us for the exam questions.",
                "I think a strength was that the examples given in the course were followed through between different lectures so it made it easier to follow. A weakness was that there were no real problem sets so you could not really practice the material that much before you see it on exams, making it hard to judge if you truly understand what is going on.",
                "I find the pre-recorded lectures sometimes difficult to follow and would maybe benefit from a live option (some of my other classes offer live Zoom lectures, which are also recorded and available to watch asynchronously). I really appreciate all that the teaching team does to make resources (like office hours and extra help) available, however.",
                "It was difficult to determine what information was important and what wasn't in this course. The information was not delivered in a very coherent or orderly way and was sometimes confusing. Furthermore, the homework was not really relevant to any of the exam material.",
                "Tests felt exceptionally difficult",
                "I would do well on the PSETs and in the discussions as well as Enrichments but that was never truly reflected on the Midterm nor Final.",
                "Weakness: Professor Zhongs teaching style and the lecture sides. Slides were very dense, very disorganized, not designed for maximizing student learning. \r\nI also wish that we had been more regularly tested on the material, like with P sets. Our psets focused on the final project instead.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Professor Hartman! You can tell that she cares about student success. I also really liked discussion section and I like that the final project was divided into the P sets.",
                "The recorded lectures were very long and often disorganized in structure in a way that made it difficult to associate the relationship between the different conceptual topics. The course summarizes were not particularly helpful either. I recommend an update to the course lecture notes.",
                "Strengths: The concepts were interesting, and it really pushed more complex problem solving. \r\nWeakness: For an application based course, I was extremely disappointed that there were no practice problems. We had \"practice tests\" before the midterm and the final, but they were very short. On the final \"practice test\", half of the topics covered were explicitly stated to not be in the scope of this course. Needless to say, I have no idea how we can be expected to apply the coursework if we do not practice doing so. I could know the actual material inside and out, but application is a completely different thing.",
                "The course formatting made it easy to fall behind. The lectures tended to be longer than the other ones in previous sequences, (the longest one was nearly two hours long, and there was still an additional hour of lecture aside from it). Though this is typical of the Biology sequence, it's more inconvenient/harder to view the lectures when they're not broken up into smaller chunks.",
                "strengths: lectures were reasonably well made, PSETs built upon each other and were relatively interesting, peer tutoring was really helpful\r\n\r\nweakness: Midterm & Final were perhaps overly challenging and fast-paced; also, one thing I NEVER understood is why discussion section slides and peer tutoring midterm & final review slides could not be shared, that seemed very contrary to the philosophies of collaboration and flexibility that this course seems to try to embody and honestly did not make much logical sense to me at all. I would definitely recommend revisiting this policy especially for the midterm & final reviews because not everyone will be able to make time in their schedule to attend the midterm & final review sessions.",
                "Weaknessess- the lectures were at times weirdly laid out so that the ideas did not correlate with the ones before or after\r\n\r\nStrengths: the writing project helped me be more comfortable in scientific writing as a whole",
                "I would have liked to have problem sets that prepared us for the questions on the exams.",
                "Professor Zhong structures his classes in the weirdest and most unhelpful way possible -- he packs the lectures with examples and then skims over the ideas needed to explain them at the end (or in later lectures), as if we are all already experts in the field. I just don't understand why this course is taught this way. Professor Hartman was a gem though, and the one lecture she taught was extremely clear and well-structured. There is also an abnormally high amount of content that is given very little attention except for a brief mention here and there which just feels rushed and unfinished. The exams were mostly well written (if not extremely time pressured), but I probably would have only been able to engage with them had the teaching in lecture been useful. I was pleasantly surprised by the PSETS, in which we were essentially asked to prepare a research proposal over five weeks and dive to investigate a developmental disease--it actually felt like this was developing a useful skill for the future. It's no surprise that this homework had no real connection to the content in lectures (except some general ideas).",
                "A strength of the course was how useful and interesting the concepts were. Another strength was the emphasis on understanding research papers through both discussion section and the research proposal. I also really liked Ed discussion, where common questions could be anonymously asked by students and publicly answered by the professor. A weakness of the course was the lecture format, which made it difficult to know what information was actually important for exams. The key concepts sections were helpful in this regard but unexpected details were on exams. It would be helpful to know what specific concepts are important when studying.",
                "The instructor was not ideal at lecturing; he didn't organize topics in a logical way. The problem sets also have nothing to do with the content of the course.",
                "Final writing assignment too lengthy",
                "The pace is really fast so it is hard to keep up.",
                "Strength: The content is very interesting, engaging and well organized. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish the lectures were live so that we can ask questions during the lectures.",
                "strengths  boxed important concepts on slides\r\nweaknesses  lectures felt long-winded, test questions were sometimes oddly specific/confusing to interpret",
                "The strengths of this course is definitely the teaching staff, as they are very dedicated to the success of every one of their students. One of the weaknesses was how dense the lectures were. This made it very hard to decipher the main points and I ended up spending hours on each lecture trying to decipher the material because there was so much.",
                "I think a major weakness of the course was that there was no way for us to practice the concepts we went over in lecture and make sure we actually understood them aside from 2 practice exams and the actual exams (which are not when you should be figuring out if you understand a concept). Lectures, in my opinion, were very poorly taught, and I spent so much of my time re-watching lectures in order to grasp what was being taught. I don't think it's reasonable to expect students to have to re-watch lectures (which often exceeded the allotted class time anyways) multiple times just to get a basic understanding what was being said. Part of the problem was that we would regularly go over complex examples without being clearly told what they were examples of (often until the very end of the example), terminology would be thrown around that we were just supposed to know, and then have no way to reinforce what they may or may not have just learned.",
                "The research proposal is practical but the exams are not. They need to be structured to allow for more time, remember this course is to learn biology not be the fastest test taker.",
                "I think that the major strength of this course was how in-depth we went in terms of learning about genetics and development. Although the examples were sometimes too much, I feel as if they were helpful in contextualizing the information. I feel as if students are required to remember too much information for the assessments and at times too much detail. Especially for the fact that we're living through a world-wide pandemic I feel as if there could have been more adjustments to the course.",
                "Strengths: I learned a great deal from the research proposal project and this skill will apply to future labs and jobs. Enrichment and Ed were also very helpful. Weaknesses: I had a hard time staying focused throughout all of the lengthy lectures each week and since the weekly assignments were for somewhat unrelated topics (our research proposals), I found myself catching up on the material the week before the exams.",
                "strengths: enrichment was very helpful, grade drop policy for homeworks took some stress off\r\nweaknesses: exams were a bit long for a closed-note exam under the circumstances of this semester"

Would appreciate a more engaging teaching style if it is going to be pre-recorded. \r\n\r\nThe exams were a little bit difficult and did not  really accommodate or compensate for the fact that they were on canvas online. I think online exam should be a little shorter. I appreciate the amount of time that they gave us though they originally were only going to give us 30 minutes for the midterm but they extended it",
                "Virtual lectures did not suit this course well.",
                "The class featured discussion sections via Zoom which worked well. These discussion sections typically featured breakout rooms which helped work in smaller groups outside of the teaching staff's eyes so it was a little easier making comments about the material/that week's paper without the fear of being wrong in front of an instructor. Again, the lecture length could've been improved. Additionally, the course featured a discussion board to which students could post questions and interact with the professors. This worked quite well as they responded in a timely manner and the questions could be viewed by the entire class which helped others who could potentially have the same questions.",
                "succeeded: peer tutoring; again, recorded lectures were reasonably well done; Ed Discussion",

                "Some units of recorded lectures would be an expected length (i.e. around 2 hrs total, mimicking a usual week of in-person lectures), but some weeks would include upwards of three hours of lecture. That is demanding far more work and effort than the students taking this class are signing up for, especially since a lot of the content itself feels fragmented and disconnected. The sections were very reasonable and far more enjoyable (and were also relevant for the problem sets). Other than that this was your standard online pre-recorded lecture course.",
                "Most practices succeeded. While my engagement was not as high as it would have been in a normal setting, the structure was solid and there were plenty of resources to get help with the material.",
                "Lots of support was offered in the form of peer tutoring, office hours, Enrichment, etc.",

                "The continuous support provided by Professor Hartman and peer tutors was absolutely essential in my opinion. I also loved the research project!",
                "weekend review sessions should've been scheduled during the week during published class time so more students could access them, since the course was asynchronously delivered and thus left published times open",
                "I think if the lectures were shorter that would be really helpful in terms of screen time and attention span. I think  a strength was how many ways they had for us to get help, such as peer tutoring, review sessions, enrichment etc.",
                "It was fine",
                "I feel as if at times the recorded lectures were too long to be engaging and would have preferred more smaller lectures or just less lectures overall. I also feel as if the assessments should have been longer and open note as there was too much information for a student to realisticaly remember.",
                "Ed and enrichment was incredibly helpful since it helped you engage with the course outside of watching the recorded lectures.",
                "good number of office hours/enrichment resources, long/unnecessarily difficult exams, Ed discussion helpful, lectures sometimes ran a bit long in the online format, helpful grade drop policy for lowest homework grade"

                "I thought the coursework was very interesting, but--in short--no. The course was taught in a way in which we were designed to fail. Both the midterm and final (which accounted for the vast majority of our grade) consisted of complex application questions, and we were not given nearly enough practice problems to even develop application skills. The problem sets were a cumulative research proposal, which--while very helpful in some regards--was not designed to prepare us for exams either.",
                "Only if you're planning on majoring in biology. There's easier sciences to take and the grade weighting is quite disproportionate. Despite spending a good amount of time on the proposals, they didn't carry as much weight as the midterm and final, which were poorly structured through time constraints. This class is a challenge which you must get through if required to but should be avoided if this is not essential to your major. There's a lot of stress that comes with it, and if the teaching style is similar in the following years, with larger admitted classes and it being an intro class, it's only bound to get even more difficult.",

Be prepared to put in the extra work and even approach the material differently than you have in a class before, as changing your study habits might be needed for success in this course.",
                "Most students who are taking BIOL103 do not have a choice but to take it, but I would highly recommend taking it with a different instructor. This was by far the most poorly taught unit of the intro BIOL sequence. Lectures regularly went over the allotted class time (in the final week we had 3 full hours of lecture) and the lectures themselves were confusing and difficult to follow. I'd regularly have to google stuff or ask older students to re-explain things to me, which at that point why am I even taking this class? The exams for this class felt super rushed, and I found myself barely finishing in time. The homework did nothing to reinforce the concepts we \"learned\" in class. I just felt like this unit with Prof. Zhong was agonizing and painful. That isn't to say that the material isn't interesting, but I just felt like it was taught in a way that made it impossible to enjoy. I think adding onto the poor instruction was the fact that it felt like the people running this course did not respect our time. There's no reason asynchronous lectures need to go way over the allotted class time, and for them to be unhelpful on top of that adds insult to injury. We were basically told that if we weren't learning from the way Prof. Zhong was teaching, it's on us and we need to figure out how to deal with it (rather than Prof. Zhong changing his teaching style). There was also a week where the due date for our assignment (which would have been due on a break day) was moved forward \"to give us time to study for our exam (on the break day)\". I have nothing but negative feelings about this course! I got a good grade too, but I hated every moment of it. Overall, this is not a course to take for fun and I would take it off-sequence if you can.",

                "I would only recommend this course to someone who was very interested in biology.
