                "This course has fundamentally transformed my knowledge of Spanish language and cultures. It has given me a strong and versatile basis in Spanish language skills as well as setting me up for at least the most minimal Spanish interactions.",
                "This class was a great introduction to Spanish. I felt like I learned a variety of vocabulary and basic Spanish writing skills. We learned common Spanish phrases and how to speak them as well as the culture in Spanish-speaking countries and communities and how that influences the language.",
                "That learning a new language requires daily practice and discipline. This is the only way one can achieve any level of fluency",
                "I developed an introductory understanding of speaking the Spanish language, as well as insight into the cultures and current events of Spanish-speaking countries.",

                "WAY WAY WAY TOO MUCH BUSY WORK, especially considering you attend this class 4 days a week. Difficult to manage if you are taking a heavy course load. Doesn't foster an environment where you have time to truly learn, more so an environment where you feel rushed to complete 3+ assignments a night in addition to attending class nearly every day.",
                "I think that the course does a good job of providing students with a strong foundation of a language in a short amount of time. I thought that the weaknesses were that the homework and assignments did not always feel like they prioritized studying in a productive way, and I would have preferred slightly less homework to leave time for more individual studying. I also think it would be helpful to have more frequent in-class quizzes and compositions in order to motivate students to study throughout the semester rather than just for exams.",
                "enjoyed the course",
                "There arent any immediate weaknesses. A part that may be seen as annoying is the fact that there is nightly homework, however that is what drives a lot of the skill acquirement in a short period of time.",
                "Strengths: guiding and clear structure, interaction with other students, engaging professor\r\nWeaknesses: some of the content and activities felt a bit redundant or unnecessary",
                "This course's small section size and emphasis on student engagement through participation and conversation facilitate learning a language well. The flipped classroom (learn material on your own, practice the material in class) is not something I'm usually fond of, but it does work well for this class.",
                "Strengths: You pick up the language fast. By the end of Spanish 1, I was able to carry a conversation with a native speaker and give directions. Small class size is great. Good individual feedback from the professor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of homework every day. Supersite can get tiresome."

                "I would recommend this course to other students! It was a great introduction to Spanish with a guiding structure and engaging professor. I think that compared to what I've heard about other languages, the workload is comprable and the class presents the same rewards of learning a new language.",
                "Yes, it moves very quickly and requires a significant amount of self teaching",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to learn a new language that is useful, applicable, and interesting.",
                "Great opportunity to learn a new language. Spanish is very useful and you will use it pretty much constantly in the US so I recommend the class. It is 1.5 credits so the workload is heavier--- not harder work, just more busy work and practice on this online website called Supersite. I'd say 1.5-2 hours a night. Professor Vazquez is amazing."
