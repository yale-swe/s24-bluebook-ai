                "There is really no professor interaction in this course. You are doing research in your lab completely on your own time and with your mentor's help. I've talked to some friends who have taken the MB&B version of this class, and they have meetings with the professor/meetings as a class every once in a while throughout the semester. It would be really nice to have a similar thing to this class, just to make sure that I'm on the right track and am able to ask questions if need be. I had a lot of issues with getting in contact with the professors of this class (I emailed multiple times, got no response), so having meetings like this would help with those issues. Finally, please please please please please stop including references in the page count for the two assignments. Writing my final report and my grant proposal was extremely difficult not because of content, but because of page limits, and having to include references in that count just made it unnecessarily annoying. Please remove references from the page count.",
                "A strength would be learning how to do all those basic research skills. A weakness of this class is that it is an independent course: all you have is yourself, the syllabus, and whatever help you have in your lab environment (which will vary greatly person to person)",
                "Very independent if thats what youre looking for. Some syllabus instructions seemed to be off through.",
                "The strength of this course was the incredible one-on-one guidance and mentorship I received from my PI and the post-doc that I was working with. I am very looking forward to continuing to work with them in future semesters."
