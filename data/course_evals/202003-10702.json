                "Strengths:\r\n-Includes study of datasets in R, which is a big help for biology majors\r\n-The professor highlights several projects he has led, and it is always fun to see real examples of the material in a prof's research\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Expectations for HW assignments were not always clear; several HW questions were not clearly worded\r\n-The format of the final exam was not released until right before the exam.",

                "Strengths: the course is very well organized and operates super effectively online, the test are very fair and the TAs and course instructors are great. There's plenty of office hours in the first half since they are so many TA's for this course. Once you get to the individual section there are less TA's but I didn't find an issue with scheduling. For my individual section, I was initially apprehensive about learning R since I have never coded before, but it is not a steep learning curve at all. They provide scripts which make the process a lot easier. \r\nWeakness: Sometime in the second half (Life Science section) I found the material a little repetitive but this wasn't a big deal for me at all as I really ended up understanding the concept.",
                "Strength is how many office hours are offered. Weakness is I dont like stats but I think that is personal issue of not liking math.",
                "I appreciate all the effort instructors and TAs put into the course this semester (with all of this year's complications and obstacles especially!). The main difficulties I experienced were related to the online format (which I understand was necessitated by the pandemic), so I don't really have any suggestions for improvement.",
                "The homework assignments were helpful in revealing what I did and didn't understand. The lectures were generally well organized and there were plenty of office hours.",
                "strengths - homework closely modeled lectures, allowing you to explore tests on your own but also have a safety net to rely on if you're lost\r\nuse of other media for learning, e.g DataCamp exercises in R\r\nhomework sets had more points as the course went on and your understanding of the concepts developed\r\n\r\nweaknesses - homework assignments (2) with a DataCamp component were disproportionately long and did not reflect the point value of the assignment as much\r\nlecture slides with R codes and responses were sometimes hard to read (text too small)\r\nno real opportunity to work with fellow students",
                "I loved the first half of the semester with Jonathan. His sense of humor made the recorded lectures engaging. The vast amount of office hour available was amazing. Jonathan himself is great with explaining and patiently re-explaining concepts during his live office hours during class time, and there are also so many tutor hours anyone who wish to seek help definitely should have been able to have a time that works for them. The second half of the semester (splitting into our respective sections) was good. The professor and TF understood that many students hadn't had previous exposure to R before and explains everything really nicely. I never felt stressed entering into the 2nd half not knowing anything about R, because the support was there and things explained during lecture. The class doesn't assume previous knowledge.",
                "In terms of content and teaching I believe that this course was effective. I do wish that the teacher went a little slower in terms of giving out information, but it is made up for by the recorded sessions. However, I felt more inclined to view recordings than attend lectures live because of this.",

The content is approachable for students with no prior background in statistics. There is an array of resources available to provide assistance, and the course is structured in a logical and understandable way that gradually builds up to complicated material."

                "The huge amount of office hours (I'm not sure if during pre-COVID times if there are also this many hours available) was definitely a godsend for this class. I don't feel like learning remotely negatively impacted my learning for this class, since there are plenty of opportunities to engage live with a tutor\/the professors, even if time zones are bad for you. Having such a big support system really helped. I honestly don't know if this class would be better taught in person than remotely like this semester.",

                "Yes totally. It's pretty low stress and the amount of workload is completely fair. The first half was very well organized and structured-- the Professor is one of the best lecturers I've ever seen and makes stats actually interesting. For the Life Sciences section, everything was really explained and I left actually absorbing the information despite mostly watching the lecture videos. And if the R scares you, it's not a big deal and I found it super approachable as someone whose never touched coding before.",

                "Yes, this is a good intro to stats class, worthwhile to take even if you have taken stats in high school before, I think. There are definitely plenty of topics that I encountered for the first time in this class, even though I did take stats in high school. Maybe this class would be too easy for stats\/math majors looking for something more advanced, but as a non-math major, I felt like this course was paced fairly and the workload wasn't too much. You have to put in a certain amount of work, but it wasn't stressful, and there's a strong support system. 101 was also fair and a good class to gain experience with R. I had never worked with R or other coding languages before (which was why I selected 101), and I prepared myself for a learning curve in the beginning of the second half, but it was actually completely painless. 101 didn't assumed prior R knowledge, and everything was explained, so I had a good time.",
                "I would recommend this course highly to students with no prior statistics background. This course makes statistics seem much less daunting and provides a small army of tutors and assistants to help you master the material. I did not expect to enjoy this course as much as I did, and even got me interested in taking more stats classes because it showed me the capabilities and strength of programs like R for answering complicated questions."
