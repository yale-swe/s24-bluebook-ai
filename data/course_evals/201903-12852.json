    "Marcia is awesome and her syllabus is amazing. She puts a lot of thought into making it and leading the discussions.",
    "Great opportunity to read important ethnographies and have a groundwork understanding of med anthro",
    "I developed an understanding of medical anthropology as a growing field and the theoretical work that is being performed within it through studying a collection of some of the most famous works in that field. Additionally, I gained the knowledge and skills necessary to understand and lead discussions about the philosophical and moral implications of work performed in the fields of medicine, of anthropology, and of medical anthropology alike.",
    "I developed knowledge of major works in medical anthropology and the ability to write book reviews.",
    "I developed a better understanding of key concepts in medical anthropology - biological citizenship, structural violence, reproductive exile-hood, etc. \r\nThis course offered a 360 view of medical anthropology which I really appreciated. We touched on reproductive anthropology, science and tech studies, poverty, and mental and neurological illnesses.",
    "I learned different methodologies in medical ethnography, how the field is defined and what seminal works constitute it. I also thought critically about representation and how to engage with communities particularly when straddling multiple professional and personal roles. Through the authors we read, I learned about respect, autonomy, biopolitics, biocitizenship, social abandonment, and much more.",
    "How to write a book review, how to engage in critical thinking, how to write a comparative book review",
    "This was my first course in medical anthropology, one of the intersecting fields that interests me the most in anthropology. We read an ethnography a week, so we were exposed to a lot of work done both internationally and in the United States ranging from Paul Farmer in Haiti to Rayna Rapp in New York City. This allowed us to cover a lot of different topics in medical anthropology as well. Because of the schedule of an ethnography a week, I think I improved in my general academic reading ability.",
    "Basic understanding of the field of medical anthropology, including some amazing authors in the field we read and discussed. As well, how to efficiently and thoughtfully read an ethnography and lead a seminar. How to write a professional book review and comparative essay."

   "comments": [
    "I loved that this class was organized as a book club, essentially. Never before have I engaged so much with any course material. I feel like I learned more from this class than any lecture I've taken so far, and I think that quality of discussion was better in this class than the seminars I've been in too. The one book per week reading load was a little intimidating and definitely challenging at times, but it made for such rigorous and powerful conversation. I also appreciated the organization of weekly seminar leaders (the questions definitely gave structure\/direction to the discussion in a way that free-flow discussion would not have). I also enjoyed doing the three book reviews: I felt like I was able to take a lot away from consolidating my thoughts about 4 different books. I also loved the selection of books that we read, and appreciated also having the opportunity to have class with Arthur Kleinman and also watch Bending the Arc together at the end.\r\n\r\nI only wish that we had more opportunity to get feedback about how we were doing in the class, particularly as a majority of our grade is determined from assignments we turn in near the end of the course, it was hard to gauge directions for improvement at times.",
    "Strength: Marcia is a wonderful instructor, the class is very engaged and conversations always flow well. Everyone does the readings. \r\nWeakness: a lot of emphasis on the prestige of the authors and anthropologists, which felt a little odd",
    "I think it was a great course! I think more conversation of modern day application and political movement would have been good",
    "The conversations that this course facilitated were intellectually stimulating and academically enriching. Overall, the course is well run, with clear, straightforward instructions and feedback.",
    "Strengths: well-roundedness, depth\r\nWeaknesses: (this isn't really a weakness, but the workload for this course is very high: one book every week was quite a heavy workload to manage); 50% of the course's grading came from book review assignments, though I felt this form of assessment did not really assess our grasp of the concepts as well as regular essays might have.",
    "The method of rotating discussion leadership among the students was quite successful at engaging everyone. I (and I think others) felt an obligation to my fellow students to have read the book each week. Also, the book reviews, discussion guides and response questions all helped synthesize the main themes in the book. One thing that might help is to have the response question be a discussion format so that we can respond to other students thoughts and engage in dialogue beyond the classroom. Also having a more continuous medical ethnography book club (I would love to help lead that effort)!",
    "strength; great list of readings, great class mates and great professor \r\nweakness: heavy reading load, short class to discuss the material.",
    "The course is developed to give a lot of voice to the students and is very organized. Marcia had each of us lead a weekly seminar and was in no way a dominating voice in our conversations but was very clear as to what she expected of us every week. In addition, a lot of the books we read were fantastic, especially towards the beginning of the semester. That being said, there were some ethnographies that simply couldn't compare to the others. I know Marcia made the syllabus as a cannon of medical anthropology, but some of the more theoretical and less field-work heavy books were much harder to both read and discuss. Also, trying to work through an entire ethnography a week is quite a lot, and honestly impossible. Our discussions were focused around question sets created by student leaders, leaving many things not discussed. \r\n\r\nOne key thing to keep in mind with this course is that, because students have such a loud voice, the seminar is very heavily shaped by the students in the seminar. This semester, although there were a few non-undergraduates, it felt that a lot of the folks in the class had similar backgrounds, and a lot of folks were headed toward or working in medicine. This meant that, at least for me, the discussions were rarely riveting or challenging, but rather just echoed a lot of my personal thoughts. I definitely think this course could have benefited from some more diversity in background, experience, and understandings of medical anthropology.",
    "I loved this course. It functions as a sort of book club, and was highly engaging each week, especially since all the students read thoroughly and cared deeply about the material. I truly hope it is offered again."

   "comments": [
    "I absolutely would recommend this course to another student, with the caveat that the more that you put in, the more you get out. Don't take this class unless you have room in your schedule to read a book a week and properly engage. If you are able to do that, you will get a tremendous amount out of this course: from the books themselves, and also from the insights offered by classmates during discussion. However, if you don't have time for such a heavy reading load, then the class might become a little unmanageable.",
    "Take it! Especially if youre new to med anthro.",
    "Yes if you have the time to read a book a week!",
    "I would recommend this course to a student that is interested in developing an understanding of what medical anthropology is, as a field of study and in practice, as well as have meaningful conversations about written works in this field.",
    "Absolutely! Marcia is amazing and this is one of the best classes I have taken at yale! Highly recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone intrested in medical anthropology! The course is rich and deep, but at the same time it is also manageable for someone new to anthropology. This was my first ever anthropology course at all, but I found the approach that this course took (intensive reading) to really aid my understanding of concepts which I was new to. Prof Inhorn is also very approachable and clarified key concepts with me during office hours when I wanted extra guidance!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in medicine, public health, or social justice.",
    "yes! Marcia is an amazing professor, she engages and facilitates student learning in a way that other professors seldom do. This is hands down one of the best medical anthro classes, highly recommend!",
    "I think this course was a wonderful introduction to medical anthropology, but it simply wasn't as inspiring and thought-provoking as I had hoped for. Marcia does a really good job in being very clear of her expectations and shaping a certain structure in her seminar, but the students play an equally large role, and so I really think this seminar hangs upon who is in it. If you find that the folks shopping the seminar could contribute to some fascinating discussions, I think this course has incredible potential. If, however, you find yourself coming from a similar background and experiences as others in the class, just recognize that the discussions might not be as riveting as you had imagined.",
    "Yes. I feel that this course improved my reading and writing skills, and made me a more empathetic human being in the process."
