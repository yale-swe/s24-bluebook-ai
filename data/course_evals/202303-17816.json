We frequently had to change protocols/plans on the fly, and most of the class felt confused and unsure what was happening. There was poor communication about what we were doing, when assignments were due, etc. It was difficult to stay engaged as a result.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Professor Nelson is very kind and understanding. He frequently had to repeat our experiments for us for the sake of time. The TA was also really helpful and knowledgable. The different procedures were also helpful to learn, especially if you are pursuing research in the future."

If we were getting results and didn't have to repeat the same experiments multiple times, the class would've been more enjoyable. It is also highly dependent on your TA's grading. Overall, I would recommend it, since it really is dependent on your class's project. We just happened to be a bit unlucky this semester.",
