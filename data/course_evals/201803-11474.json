   "comments": [
    "You learn a little bit about a lot of different psych topics.",
    "Since this course is such a broad range of topics, I learned how to connect different topics myself and figure out patterns. The reading responses required me to find ways in which what we learned connected to the real world, which was an interesting skill to work on. The course basically only tested one's ability to memorize and regurgitate information, so developing methods for memorization played a key role.\r\nBut I also learned a huge amount about humans and the way we behave, feel, and think, which is a crucial part to understanding the world. Overall it was a great course and I would recommend taking it.",
    "I learned a very good overview of a wide variety of topics in psychology. I thought it was a very suitable introductory course, as it gave enough about each topic such that I could decide what further psychology classes I wanted to take",
    "I developed a comprehensive, themes-based understanding of different disciplines within psychology, and now know how to think about them in an interconnected rather than discrete way. Professor Holmes finds a way to talk about macro as well as micro and biological mechanisms for certain behaviors and cognitive processes, and trains us to think about things through connections.",
    "general overview of psychology, how to analyze validity of experiments, how to read a textbook in depth instead of just for basic info",
    "I really enjoyed this class as an introduction to some of the main areas of psychological study.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of psychology and about various psychological concepts. I also learned a lot of applications to these concepts.",
    "I learned about psych basics. I was a senior taking it so honestly a lot of it was pretty basic for me but I learned how psych studies are conducted which is cool.",
    "I learned a lot of super cool stuff about how we (humans) think, act, and see the world around us. Very interesting class, a really good intro to some cool concepts!",
    "The course helped to foster basic understanding of psychology concepts and taught me to make broad connections between different areas of psychology and between the knowledge learned in class and my day-to-day life.",
    "Learned basics of psychology.",
    "It's intro to psychology, so you get a general overview of some of the areas of study in Psychology. Definitely take the class - this is one of those things that I feel anyone and everyone would enjoy taking. You begin to look at human interactions so differently (at least while you talk about the relevant topics in class), and it's also just a good class. Regardless of who's teaching it, just take the class!",
    "I learned more about the general field of psychology",
    "I was exposed to a all different areas of psychology. Each lecture was on a different field of study in pscyhology. I learned that pschology is a good mixture of history and science, which I enjoyed.",
    "Very interesting material and not too difficult of a course. That being said, not getting our exams back and the minimal feedback on any of our work including out final book report is a bit strange",
    "I learned a lot about the topic at a very basic level, and it made me excited to take other psych classes to learn about certain topics we covered in more depth.",
    "How to write a good reading response and make connections between lessons and the rest of the world.",
    "A sampling of many different exciting fields in psychology. Learned a lot about how the brain works and mental disorders, information that I hope will be helpful in creating characters for theater\/etc.",
    "The fundamentals of psychology",
    "I gained a great deal of knowledge on how the human mind operates and the way in which we perceive the world.",
    "I developed my knowledge of the brain and humans greatly, and the course was very interesting",
    "We learned about the basics of psychology. It definitely felt like an introductory course.",
    "I learned a great deal about the subject of psychology and just how relevant it is in nearly every aspect of our lives. I learned how to condense a lot of information and focus on the big picture.",
    "In this class, I think about the basics of all the major fields in psychology. It gave me insight into what fields I might be interested in psychology.",
    "I developed the fundamentals of psychological thinking and learned many theories in the field of psychology",
    "You learn the major points of several parts of psychology, such as social, abnormal, moral, and developmental psychology. You also study some the history of psychology and the philosophies that got us to the position we are in today. \r\n\r\nThrough the lab requirements, you gain cursory understanding of the laboratory research process.",
    "Just memorization. Would not recommend.",
    "Good overview of psychology",
    "I gained a basic understanding of Psychology - what it is, how it is studied, etc.",
    "A basic overview of concepts of psychology.",
    "I gained a broad understanding of how many facets of the human brain function, as well as individual and group behavior",
    "I developed a great deal of knowledge on all of the numerous different branches that exist within psychology.",
    "Good intro to basic psych topics",
    "I think I gained a strong foundation in psychology that has well prepared me to take more psych classes in the future.",
    "Basic intro, pretty straightforward on the syllabus",
    "Basic psych!",
    "By taking this course, I developed a basic understand of the different fields and theories in psychology.",
    "I learned a broad understanding of the different fields of psychology.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Overall the class was well designed to facilitate student learning. One thing I would like to see improve in the future is having more text on slides. In lecture, it is difficult to copy everything Prof. Holmes is saying in my notes, but when I go back to the lectures, there is often just a picture and I can't quite remember the point being made.",
    "This course was strong because it was interesting and relatable. Its weaknesses would include a few of the lectures (such as the methods lecture and the guest lecture) and the fact that it doesn't dive into any topic for more than one lecture. The memorization aspect of the course was challenging.",
    "Strengths: Lots of different topics discussed, tests and assignments were very reasonable and the class prepared you well for them, not too much work, engaging material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Topics were not covered super in depth (as is to be expected from an introductory course that covers so many topics)",
    "The course was relatively small for what is usually a super big lecture, making it much more approachable to talk with Professor Holmes after class. Unfortunately, even despite the smaller class size, there weren't any opportunities to ask questions during lecture (which Holmes himself admitted on the first day of class), but his willingness to answer questions outside of lecture itself makes up for that. There are enough pop culture references interspersed with class content to make the lectures engaging, and the class itself is a good mix of midterm exams and reading responses, but the final book report paper felt extraneous in that it didn't help me learn more about psychology.",
    "kind of an easy course, which I liked bc it made me more focused on learning material than on my grade....but, I also felt like I was memorizing more than critically thinking when I was studying for the exam",
    "Very well organized. Lectures could maybe be a little more engaging.",
    "The book review assignment was utterly meaningless and pedagogically lazy. It consisted of picking one of three pop psychology books to summarize and find real-life applications for. I was unaware that high school-level assignments were appropriate for college-level courses. It seemed like the book review was a purely filler assignment included in the syllabus only to add some \"heft\" and perhaps a certain level of legitimacy to the course. I am extremely disappointed with whoever suggested, approved, or finalized the inclusion of this inane book review assignment in the course; they would obviously benefit from a refresher in basic pedagogy. Ultimately, the book review was nothing more than an exercise in futility, successful only in wasting students' time and effort. I strongly recommend against taking this course until this assignment is purged from the syllabus.",
    "I think the strengths of this course lie in the material which is inherently interesting and widely applicable. However, I believe that the assignments are terrible, and did not help increase understanding of the material at all.",
    "If there's going to be so much emphasis on the lecture, please make the lecture slides comprehensible. The professor assumes that we have the ability to write down every relevant idea that he explains. Missing anything he talks about is very problematic, because going back to the lecture slides in the future assuredly won't help you. Also, please get rid of the five credit experiment participation requirement; I really don't feel like my knowledge of psychology increased because of them. The experiments are burdens, not learning experiences. Lastly, in the exams, there is way too much emphasis on trivial details of psychology.",
    "Presents engaging information in a fun way. The powerpoints are really vague though so it can be hard to know what you need to memorize",
    "The lectures were awesome and the tests were fair. No complaints.",
    "The biggest strength of the course is its organization. The lectures, homework, and assessments are all very predictable and easy to follow. \r\nThe biggest weakness would be the disconnect between the readings and the lectures. Readings were very rarely alluded to in lecture, and they would emerge again for exams. This made studying a difficult, disjointed process as I tried to determine what information from the readings and textbook would be lumped in with the bulk of knowledge from the lectures. \r\nThe class has little room for improvement; overall a good intro class.",
    "Less reading off the slides, less monotone\r\nMaybe not using the textbook to teach, but instead making readings be some interesting papers and articles from the field (like the other psych professors do)",
    "Reading responses are fun to do; assigned readings are mostly good, but the textbook often doesn't totally line up with lecture and the textbook is a bit boring. Lecture is interesting overall.",
    "Course is great - lectures were fun and informative, reading responses were good as well. I appreciated how we got personalised feedback on the reading responses. The exams are not cumulative, which allows you to give your full attention to whatever topic you are discussing at a go.",
    "No book review, its hard to ask a first year psychology student to make an argument against a well renowned psychologist who has in the field for decades",
    "My strengths were the reading responses and my weaknesses were the tests.",
    "A lot of information to memorize all at once, but it is nice how each exam only covers the material learned after the previous unit\/exam. Would have been nice if more than one review session was held for each exam, as I was not able to attend some of them due to other conflicts.",
    "Lectures were super interesting and enjoyable to attend. I could have used much more test prep materials\/support from the teacher and TAs, such as practice questions",
    "The lecture slides could have more words on them in case you missed lecture for some reason.",
    "The lectures were quite engaging, the work was not overwhelming, and the test were fair in in the sense that good study habits often resulted in a good grade.",
    "The content was very interesting, though perhaps the exams could have more application of the content",
    "The biggest strength was that the course definitely at least touched on pretty much any aspect of psychology that you'd expect from an intro course, but the structure of the course could be improved. Oftentimes, lectures were very unrelated to one another.",
    "It provided me with a lot of information that was interesting to learn about. However, it did move very fast through all the lectures and I was dissatisfied with the review sessions as they were not as helpful as I had hoped. It was more haphazard.",
    "Instead of reading responses I would prefer discussion sections.",
    "The lecture slides were too minimalistic to be very helpful when returning to them as study materials. I understand that this may be intentional to discourage students from not attending lecture, but during the final review session I attended the slides were so sparse that even the TAs had difficulty determining what the relevant content was.",
    "The mandatory lab that takes up at least 5 hours of the students time should be counted for some type of grade, very unfair that it doesn't show up at all as apart of the grade. Also the students grade shouldn't be determined entirely on the tests.",
    "The course did a good job in introducing the various fields of psychology, which Im assuming is the purpose of the class. I wish that we didnt jump around so much however, but I understand why it occurs.",
    "Strengths: Lectures are fairly interesting \r\nImprovement: The lecture slides are not usable to study from and it is vague what we should study for the exams, the grading for the reading responses fluctuates a lot",
    "Topics covered are pretty representative of psychology as a whole and give a good overview.",
    "Strengths: Professor holmes is great, clear, and engaging. The class touches a myriad of topics and thus if you don't like a subject, you seldom deal with it for more than a week. The TFs hold review sessions which allows you that extra opportunity to review and confront people who know before an exam. The textbook very closely corresponds to the course and thus if you cannot make it to class, can provide a good substitute (don't be fooled that you can't just study from the book) \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It is your quintessential big lecture course, and with the absence of the exams, you aren't really tested on what you understand. Its hard to figure out what you don't know until right before. The exams are generally pretty straightforwards, but you need to know small details. The lab requirement feels kinda tacked on and I feel the class doesn't spend enough time making you examine the breakdown of how studies work and experimental control.",
    "Very boring and not interesting.",
    "Honestly  could've been a little more rigorous; not sure how much I learnt as opposed to memorized. It would probably be better as a flipped classroom to be honest.",
    "The course is alright - I would have loved MORE opportunities (like optional section) to learn about the material, simple lecture was not enough to make me feel like I was really learning. I did, however, enjoy the Book Review assignment, which asked us to analyze contemporary Psychological work. However, my least favorite part of the course was certainly the mandatory study hours. Although there were (seemingly difficult) ways around these hours, they made me feel like a Lab Rat rather than a college student.",
    "The class was well-organized, and the format of non-cumulative midterms was perfect. I feel like I have a good understanding of these concepts because I was able to be more specific when studying each topic.",
    "I was very satisfied with this course. If I could change anything, Professor Holmes mentioned that we never had a lecture on aging and I think that would be an interesting addition.",
    "Strengths: Professor Holmes taught this class exceptionally well. The tests were a very accurate representation of the material that was taught in the class, so if you studied a lot, you were more than capable of doing very well in the class. Assignments were graded very fairly. \r\nWeaknesses: I honestly can't think of any",
    "The material covered was interesting and covered a breadth of topics, but the lectures were often somewhat dry and boring.",
    "I like the lecture style of this class as I felt that the information conveyed was important. The lectures were worth my time and interesting to attend",
    "Lecture is pretty good, but it is definitely necessary to read the textbook to really understand the concepts. Would be cool to have a section with greater student discussion.  The psychology study requirement is absolutely pointless and only to help those majoring in psychology fulfill their research requirements, despite the fact that the results are essentially meaningless beyond the scope of Yale students taking introductory psychology.",
    "Good lectures and lecturer.",
    "This course was well-organized, following a pre-established schedule and using clearly defined materials for learning. I do not think this course had any discernible weaknesses.",
    "Discussion sections would be really appreciated - I think that would facilitate more interaction with the material",
    "The lectures could be more engaging. I like the wide array of topics we learned about but I wish some topics we spent more time on.",
    "The strengths of this course are the lectures as they provide all of the information needed to succeed.  The professor tries to make the lectures engaging, and the material is intriguing, but the lecturer sometimes falls short of being exciting."

   "comments": [
    "Intro Psych is a good survey course to learn a little about a lot of topics.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student because I think it teaches some valuable lessons just about humanity and about how and why we act as a whole. Unfortunately the grades for this class are almost exclusively based on memorization, so if you put in the time and effort you can do well but it does not test any other ability besides memorization.",
    "Yes I would. It is a good class if you are not looking for a very work intensive class, but are looking to learn things. You definitely get more out of the class if you put more into it (as with any class), but I thought this class was very well organized and learned a lot without it being overly stressful",
    "The course is a good horizontal introduction of the different slices of psychology, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has a free slot. The material is not especially difficult, but remains quite interesting regardless, and can connect with many fields of study (philosophy, biology, history, political science, chemistry, and even engineering and physics if you show up to Holmes's class in the middle of the semester). If you're premed, note that Holmes doesn't tend to cover vocab words that appear on the MCAT; he emphasizes themes and ideas instead, which I think are more important in the long run. But if you're looking to use PSYC 110 as a MCAT crash course, you might be disappointed. If you're interested in learning for learning, this is the class for you.",
    "yup! it was an interesting, low-stress course",
    "Yes.",
    "The book review assignment was utterly meaningless and pedagogically lazy. It consisted of picking one of three pop psychology books to summarize and find real-life applications for.

    "Not really",
    "Sure! Not the best not the worst, interesting if you like the topic. Medium workload.",

Regardless of who's teaching it, just take the class!\r\nWorkload is not bad at all. However, I would encourage you to start working on the book review as soon as you can. Reading the book will take longer than actually writing the paper, so get reading early.",
    "Yes, its good to get to know all the areas of psychology",
    "Yes!  It is a really cool topic and it covers a wide variety of information, so throughout the semester you are sure to find something very interesting.",
    "Yes I think it is a great intro to the field of psychology and was very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who has any degree of interest in psychology. It can be a great way to discover which fields excite you and which field-specific courses you may want to take in the future.",
    "Yes -- good overview of psychology and interesting even if you're not planning on taking other psych courses",
    "Yes. This course is a requirement but I do think everyone should take it, even if its just to see if they're interested in psychology.",

    "Yes, I found the course very interesting and the book review especially was very engaging",
    "No or at least I would take it with a different professor.",
    "I would because it provides a great introduction to a very interesting topic. It gave me a better sense of the field and guided me to a greater appreciation for it.",
    "Yes. It is a good base of knowledge for future psych classes.",
    "I took this as a credit\/d\/fail class and it was a good introduction to a field I am not majoring in.",
    "Yes, it is a good class for those wanting an overview of psychology.",
    "Yes. It's a great intro course and opens up a lot of other psych options",
    "If the student was looking to take an intro level psych course, I would recommend it.",
    "Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a survey of psychology. If you have taken AP psych, the material is pretty much identical.",
    "Yes. Its a good introduction to a subject which can often be difficult to self-study. It certainly taught me to think about myself and my society in a different way. If you are a non-premed STEM major, or if seminars aren't your thing, this is a very good STEM-like course (because it technically is, but that's debatable) to get a Social Science Credit.",
    "No, complete waste of time.",
    "It's a good overview of Psychology. I took it because I'm taking the MCAT, and it does cover a lot of what you need to know for that, so if that's your motivation, then go for it!",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who has a preexisting interest in Psychology, but not to anyone else. For me, who wasn't really interested in psychology going in, it didn't posses a legitimate level of intellectual stimulation; it felt like a class in High School.",
    "Yes, if you are even remotely interested in anything psych related, this is a great course to take. Lectures and readings are very engaging\/interesting.",
    "I think this course was a very good survey of many of the fields of psychology. The workload was very manageable and I think it would appeal to a broad audience given the wide range of topics.",
    "I have been recommending this course to a lot of my friends for the simple fact that it is taught extremely well and is a great Intro course to have on your transcript.",
    "Yes, its cool stuff to know!",
    "Yes, I would recommend. Professor Holmes prepared lectures that were engaging and beneficial to learning.",
    "Sure if you have any interest in psychology and want a manageable workload.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because it does a good job in introducing psychology as a whole in spite that it is such a large field.",
    "Yes. If interested in psych, I think it is a great place to start.",
