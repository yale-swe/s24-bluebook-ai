    "I learned the basic formalism of quantum mechanics.",
    "I learned basic quantum mechanics.",
    "I learned about the wavefunction of quantum particles, expectation values, momentum and position of quantum particles, evolution of particles' wave functions over time, and how to apply these general principles to specific cases, such as quantum harmonic oscillators or a particle in a box.",
    "basic quantum mechanics, starting in 1 dimension, moving to 3, spin 1\/2, matrix representations of operators, perturbation theory (among many other things)",
    "Quantum mechanics",
    "Learned about basic quantum mechanics and how to solve problems concerning super positions, harmonic oscillators and other quantum systems",
    "This course provided a pretty general overview of introductory quantum mechanics. Most of the semester was building a foundation; we didn't even get to perturbation theory or solving anything close to real-world situations until the last couple of weeks, but I feel like the foundation we established is pretty solid. Leaving the class, I feel like I have a good conceptual grasp of quantum theory (as good a grasp as one can get with quantum, that is), and the path to developing my knowledge further is pretty clear to me.",
    "A very basic overview of some fundamental quantum mechanics",
    "I learned the key basic topics in quantum mechanics (harmonic oscillators, spin, notation)",
    "Understanding of what quantum mechanics tries to calculate and the foundational approaches to calculation. Overview of various really interesting quantum mechanics concepts. Enough of an intro to keep up \/ be able to look into current research.",
    "a solid understanding of all the anomalies and interesting problems commonly encountered in quantum mechanics.",
    "This course was an introductory overview of quantum. We started with spins, operators, and bases, and then moved on to the Schrodinger equation and 1-D problems, and then we did some perturbation theory and two-particle systems toward the end.",
    "The course is a chance for students to practice being disciplined in doing the textbook readings, attending lectures, and setting aside time to really cement understanding through problem sets. As for insights: the universe isn't deterministic. That's a pretty big one."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was good overall.",
    "The class was hurt this semester because the instructor was in and out of town so there were certainly gaps in our knowledge and understanding.",
    "This is perhaps more a problem with quantum than with this class in particular, but the beginning of the semester had an incredibly steep learning curve, as we were learning new concepts and entirely new notation simultaneously. In retrospect, it was great that we started with spin systems and braket notation, but at the beginning it was so confusing, as I didn't understand how the notation\/math worked or what it was trying to represent. Perhaps slowing down and explaining braket notation more clearly in class could have helped. Professor Schoelkopf was a great teacher who was able to simplify concepts and make topics understandable, but the course was rather fragmented because of his extended absences, with left us with a series of substitute lecturers and a lack of continuity. Weekly study halls to help with problem sets were a definite strength, and most of the problem sets really complimented the material, but some of them had such complicated math that I wasted hours and hours of time doing algebra instead of learning the topics of the course.",
    "I think the layout and progression of the course was excellent. However, sometimes we could get a bit bogged down in math that no one understood and that ultimately didn't need to be understood or used later. I understand that seeing derivations for equations is sometimes helpful, but for the most part in this course I found that that wasn't the case.",
    "griffiths is an amazing textbook",
    "Good class! Would have loved to have a clearer syllabus when it came to studying for the midterm and final",
    "Good amount of information presented and problem sets werent overly complicated.",
    "I loved this course!! It is a relatively broad intro and it doesnt go very deep, but it was really enjoyable and I feel like I got a good understanding of the basics of quantum.",
    "Strengths:\r\nVery approachable alternative to Shankar's class, which I found intimidating and unnecessarily difficult for the half-semester I was in it before I dropped.\r\nRob is both knowledgeable and accessible, willing to engage with questions in class and help explain places where we got hung up instead of just leaving us to figure it out alone. \r\nThe problem sets felt like they gave a good example of what midterm questions would be like.\r\nDifficult, sure, but far from impossible if you're willing to put the work in.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe material is just tricky, which is kinda just the nature of things. Oh well.\r\nIt sometimes felt like there was a disjunct between the things we discussed in class and the things we had to do on problem sets, which often made the psets harder and more time consuming than they needed to be.\r\nIt felt pretty disorganized all semester long, which just makes keeping up that much more difficult.",
    "The course is only sort of well organized. It felt like we covered only a few things in only a little depth. This was largely because Professor Schoelkopf is so busy and we had substitutes so often.",
    "Strengths were the problem set sessions with our TA, weaknesses were the unclear expectations for what we should know for the midterm\/final -  we weren't sure what we should skip over or study on a week to week basis (even with problem sets) since we jumped around in the book",
    "Sometimes the lectures were messy \/ didnt know where derivations were leading to. Strength is the TA, clarity of psets, and extra help provided.",
    "Professor Schoelkopf is very knowledgeable, and the strengths are his lectures and the TA Stijn. They were both accessible and able to answer any question I had during the semester. I just wish Schoelkopf had neater handwriting!",
    "I found that I had to teach most of the material in this course to myself through the book, as Rob's teaching style was very difficult to follow. During class he would mostly just copy his lecture notes out onto the board, often in a way that made it difficult to follow his algebra, and without really describing where we were or what was important about whatever we were doing. I wish Rob had spent more time situating the material, doing out examples, and answering questions. I also found the first textbook we used (Townsend) very very opaque and unhelpful. The psets were pretty reasonable and the exams were hard, but mostly fair.",
    "Great textbook, professor, guest professors, and TA. The classroom that we moved to was perfect as well. Towards the beginning of the course I had a ton of questions about notations and a mathematical framework that I was seeing for the first time. I had to do a lot of work on my own to digest these concepts."

    "I would recommend this course to any student who needs an intro to quantum course.",
    "I actually think that quantum mechanics has been my favorite physics subject so far. It's an incredibly interesting topic, and the math is so satisfying because it actually works, unlike with classical mechanics where things break down. Overall the course was structured well, and didn't cover too much material. However, the actual class was at times frustrating, largely due to Professor Schoelkopf's absences. He did a lot of traveling for work this semester, leaving us with temporary lecturers who didn't teach consistently. And every time a new sub or Prof. Schoelkopf would come back, they would spend half the time reviewing since they weren't sure what had already been covered. In the second half of the semester, when he didn't miss classes, things got a lot better. A lot of time was spent on conceptual understanding of the material, and Professor Schoelkopf brought in a pendulum and neon lights to demonstrate concepts, which was really helpful and also fun! The problem sets were typically difficult but not too difficult, and the midterm was very fair. The final, however, was perhaps the worst test I've ever taken. It was incredibly difficult, questions didn't make sense, and it covered topics that we didn't cover in class (maybe Schoelkopf thought that one of the substitutes covered the finite square well?). Other than the frustrating end to the semester, though, I do feel like I learned a lot, and am very glad I took this instead of 440\/441.",
    "Sure! I feel like I got a good introduction to quantum mechanics in a way that wasn't easy, but wasn't overwhelmingly difficult. Homework takes around 3 hours max to complete, there are help sessions and office hours available, and overall things are comprehensible if you read the textbook and attend class.",
    "If youre a non intensive major, take it",
    "Yes, if youre a physics major or stem major looking for an elective",
    "Yes!!",
    "If you need a quantum credit to graduate but you're not too interested in pursuing it further, definitely take this class. Honestly, even if you do want to keep studying quantum, this alternative to Shankar is a good starting place if you don't have much (or any) background. Sure, it's not as in-depth as a 2-semester course, but the ground you cover is covered well enough that you could go back and get more depth in pretty much any area on your own. Also, the Griffiths textbook actually legible, unlike the Shankar textbook. It can still be a trudge to get through and understand, but once you figure out the tricky parts, it really does a good job of helping you put them together.",
    "It depends who is teaching it. Rob was awesome as a person and lecturer but it was clear that he was too busy to teach this class and I think the experience reflected that.",
    "If you have to take it for a major, getting it done in one semester is ideal. The problem sets are manageable week to week and if you reach out to the TA for help and go to the study sessions, you'll do fine on the problem sets. The midterm was too long and lots of us didn't finish and the final was ridiculously hard",
    "Yes Rob is cool.",
    "Yes - obv take it if it's for a major requirement, etc. But for me it wasn't, and I'm still glad I took it (though be warned that \"basic\" quantum mechanics is almost entirely similar to 440 and goes very in depth into the book). I think quantum mechanics is a subject that you will probably only get the chance to study seriously in college, and is also very useful for chemistry, applied physics, quantum computing, etc. Plus you get a deeper understanding of how the world works!",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you are required to take it. If you are, it's not too much work and you'll learn some cool things so don't stress, but as an overview of quantum mechanics it was not super helpful.",
    "Yes. This course is super interesting in addition to being a great application of the tools of probability theory, differential equations, and linear algebra."
