                "Really developed new knowledge about Russia.",
                "I learned a lot about human rights lawyering and the ecosystem of NGOs in Russia, especially regarding their interaction with the Russian government.",
                "This class did an excellent job at teaching me to question preconceived notions I had on not only Russian politics and legality, but also broad political topics as well. There were many times this course where I was amazed with how I had never considered another perspective on specific political issues.",
                "Through this course, I learned about politicization, human rights, and protest in Russia. It was particularly insightful to look into how Russia's Soviet history contributed to the situation in contemporary Russia. Moreover, I enjoyed learning about how these concepts apply to a variety of topics, such as women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights issues, and NGOs. Finally, I learned how to better construct a academic research papers of longer lengths, which is a skill I am sure I will find valuable in the future.",
                "I learned SO much in this class I LOVED it!!! Learned about how human rights intersect with the legal structures in contemporary Russia. Such an insightful course, truly. I learned how the legal system works in Russia, how it has evolved since the Soviet era, and how it serves to uphold and (more often) trample on human rights. Really enjoyed learning about telephone justice, the foreign agent laws, and delving into case studies."

                "The reading list was fantastically curated and offered great insights and arguments. The class discussions were always lively and productive, and Professor Mustafina is incredible at facilitating intellectual discourse. Everything about this course was great!",
                "Strength: depth of knowledge of the professor\r\nWeakness: communication of expectations for students",
                "I really appreciated the detailed case studies used in class -- they helped me contextualize the arguments presented in our readings! I also enjoyed class discussions and the thoughtful engagement of my classmates.",
                "Interesting course material, very manageable workload means that doing the readings in a timely manner is both rewarding and doable.",
                "Professor Mustafina serves as a great guiding force for this class with high engagement that helped this seminar foster extremely productive conversations.",
                "The topics covered in this course are incredibly engaging, as they are pulled from a variety of source material and cover a wide variety of topics, including the Russian judicial system, protest, publicity, human rights, and minority rights. The readings are also of manageable length, such that they can be effectively summarized in each week's required discussion post. I also greatly enjoyed how each class session did not only consist of lecturing or discussions, but rather a combination of the two (with occasional presentations by my classmates). This made the class more engaging, as it split up the two hour time block into more manageable sections.\r\nOn the other hand, I wish we were given more discussion prompts to guide our reading each week. While we knew the general topics that were going to be covered, I would have appreciated having a few guiding questions to keep in mind as I read, in order to be able to better connect what I read to what would be covered in class the following week. In this manner, I believe I could have done my readings more effectively, as I could begin them already knowing my professor's expectations, as well as the main takeaways I should get from each reading.",
                "Strengths: engaging, insightful, considered multiple perspectives, challenged my preconceptions of Russia, gave me some historical background on Russia, and allowed me to engage in conversations about contemporary Russia more critically, confidently, and intellectually. GREAT class discussions. loved the case study presentations and the discussion leader system. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I never knew how I was doing in the class grade-wise because the only grade we received was the final paper grade."

                "Absolutely. If you are interested in law and society or Russian culture I would recommend this course. For me, the Russian comparative perspective was invaluable and I really enjoyed all the perspectives explored in this course.",
                "Yes, especially people interested in law or Russia.",
                "Yes! It's a great class to take if you're interested in getting a more nuanced view on how Russia handles human rights issues and organizations advocating for them.",
                "Yes, but only if you have a general interest in politics and Russian culture in general. The information is super interesting and Professor Mustafina is so knowledgeable, but if you dont have any basic interest in polisci, this course will not be for you.",
                "YES! The readings were pretty challenging sometimes but very interesting and thought-provoking!",
                "Yes! I absolutely recommend this course to anyone seeking a more nuanced understanding of Russian politics.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student wishing to better understand the inner workings of politics in Russia. This course takes an ethnographic standpoint, allowing students to look into all the elements of the Russian judicial system through a \"micro\" lens and understand the challenges that may exist within this system. Moreover, this course gives a good overview of a variety of topics, so it is possible to come away from the semester feeling like you have covered all different aspects of life in Russia. Finally, the professor is clearly passionate about the topics she teaches and even shares some of her research, making the course further engaging.",
                "YES!! Prof. Mustafina is the best!! this class is so awesome. I looked forward to it every week. I loved every reading, every class discussion, and every discussion post I had to write. Cannot recommend this class enough. Take it especially if you have an interest in law/legal frameworks/comparative law, etc."
