It was mostly just listening to Professor Gitlin lecture, and oftentimes just talk about his college days at Yale. There was also not a lot of feedback or guidance for assignments, so grading is pretty subjective.",

                "Interesting class and Gitlin is interesting and tells a lot of stories, but sometimes the seminars drag on and it is clear that a lot of people aren't doing the reading. He's a super sweet guy, but the class can feel long.",
                "It was sort of enjoyable but not a necessary class to take before graduating.",
                "Of course! This class is so fun for any senior or history major looking to learn more about Yale before graduation. I can honestly say I view campus differently because of this class. Also, Prof. G LOVES Yale and its students so he will make sure you have a good time.",
                "Look, this course often times gets rave reviews from people that I think mostly are there to have a good time with friends more than anything else. I love this class, and I think it is extremely (and unfortunately) unique amongst Yale's course selection. But I definitely wouldn't recommend it to everyone. I think too many people join this class because they think it's easy and not because they are just genuinely interested in learning the material. It's too bad because I think sometimes people were distracted in class which made the experience less pleasant for everyone else. That being said, if you do actually care about the subject and what to learn more, take this class. It is so much fun and such a rarity amongst other Yale classes.",
                "Absolutely. This class was amazing!!",
                "yes! it's fun but not super intense.",
                "Yes, absolutely take this course. The workload is light but you stay engaged and interested so long as you keep up with readings. The final paper is very open to what you want to write about so it can be made to be very fun."
