Also gained some limited information about current strides in astronomy through problem sets and lectures, while applying scientific reasoning and knowledge with homeworks.",
                "I learned about basic astronomy, the solar system, and the evolution of stars",
                "I learned a lot of cool stuff about our universe, and it really put into perspective the vastness of it all through math-based problem sets",
                "I learned about the basics of astronomy, celestial coordinate systems, stellar evolution, the solar system, basic physics of light and matter, methods of detecting exoplanets, basics of black holes, neutron stars, supernovae, special and general relativity and some basic astronomy history.",
                "A great survey course in the basics of astronomy as well as the evolution of stars",
                "I learned not only about the various stages a star goes through during its lifetime but I was also exposed to various concepts of relativity which expanded my knowledge on black holes and gravity.",

Thus, a student becomes better when they take this course.",
                "This course taught me so much about the evolution of stars, from protostars to the stellar remnants they leave behind after their deaths. This course also taught how to understand astrophysical concepts from a mathematical point of view, and set the stage for further investigation of astrophysical phenomenon and processes in future astronomy classes."

            "comments": [
                "I really liked the way the course presented a general overview of space. I felt like the depth of material was good, as a non-astro major who's been interested in space for a while we covered a lot of things I had heard about/been curious about and I feel like I now have the background to be able to understand better what people are talking about when the talk about astro-related things. I felt like the explanations of things were quite clear, there were a lot of things I had heard about but not understood before which I now understand. Also, the trip to the observatory was super fun.\r\n\r\n I think if there had been a bit more detail on the lecture slides it might have been helpful; because sometimes there were just diagrams or pictures of nebulae and it was hard to find the part of my notes they went with/sometimes I wasn't able to figure out which information was most important in time to get everything down. It would also have been helpful to have all of the ellipse formulas on the equations sheet before, as this was the first time I had formally learned about ellipses.",
                "The course was well organized and I learned a lot. It would have been nice to have a practice test for the quizzes and the final. Overall though there's not much that could be improved.",
                "Strengths: broad exposure to a range of relevant topics in astronomy (outside of just the course's title); very manageable content and workload; easy access to help on problem sets with discussion sections, along with relatively low-stakes quizzes and generous grading.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: would have enjoyed more learning opportunities outside of just the same old lecture format (i.e., supplementary materials and non-textbook readings, videos, articles, etc.).",
                "Instead of midterms this class had quizzes, which are 40 minutes in class with lectures after. I never felt like I had enough time to finish them and it was an unnecessarily stressful part of an otherwise fine course. Generally the quizzes never really seemed to line up with the problem sets which was frustrating, and I found it really hard to anticipate what was going to be on the test. Professor Zinn also isn't the most engaging lecturer. His \"review sessions\" are just asking people for any questions and then answering them very in depth, whether immediately relevant or not. Zinn is passionate about the material and teaching, though, which is nice.",
                "I did learn a lot about the stars, planets, astronomical standards, etc., but it was a bit difficult for the professor to hold the attention of the class, and the psets were unnecessarily long- basically the same questions with slight differences",
                "The material was broad but easily accessible.",
                "Strengths: Good support for psets from TA and the psets themselves were not difficult (most problems just manipulating provided formulas)\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures by Professor Zinn were pretty dull and he tends to get sidetracked (sometimes in amusing ways, but usually irrelevant / distracting info), personally it was really easy for me to lose interest during lecture / course material as the semester went on, exams are not difficult but without a background in astronomy studying / memorization can be time consuming",
                "Strengths: not too heavy of a workload but still felt that I was learning a lot. Weakness: can sometimes be difficult to know what is important for the exams.",
                "Strengths: Great Professor whose engagement with the class was very high, always peaking our interests and giving us very detailed feedback on all assessments.",
                "The course was extremely interesting and provided a broad introduction to astronomy. However, the problem sets were confusing at times, and I wish there were more times for peer tutoring.",
                "The weekly problem sets helped me better understand how stars and other astronomical structures are described mathematically and how problems in astronomy are approached through a mathematical lense. \r\n\r\nI think having more office hours spread out throughout the week would be helpful. Even though the problem sets were due on Wednesdays, having one or two sessions on Thursday or Friday would allow students to ask questions on material covered in class or on problem sets if they're able to get a head start on them."

                "Yes. The course content is very interesting and the class was well taught.",
                "Yes! This is a great introduction to the field of astronomy. Even without a heavy science background, this course gives you the opportunity to learn a wide range of topics and apply knowledge in problem sets (some physics helps, but zero calculus is involved). Everything is manageable: problem sets can be completed relatively quickly, quizzes are extremely straightforward, and all you need to know is delivered in the lecture. If you're interested in the major and/or just want a solid exposure to space and astronomy things (not gutty, but also not intensely rigorous), this is a great class to take!",
                "I'd recommend this course to anyone with a high school physics background. The material isn't very hard and the psets aren't bad at all. If you're not interested in astronomy I don't know if I'd recommend it, but if you're interested in any level it's a fine class.",
                "I would recommend this course to any astronomy or astrophysics major who must take it and anybody interested in learning about astronomy from a slightly more involved level than a 100 level astro course.",
                "Yes! I loved this course. Im a physics major that took it for an elective and I will be continuing to take more Astro courses to fulfill my electives because of this one.",
                "ABSOLUTELY!! Even if it's to gain a greater understanding about our Sun and the processes it has gone through and will go through, it's a very fun course to take.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in astronomy and stellar evolution. You will learn so much about not only stars and their remnants, but also about the essentials of astronomy; such as properties of the solar system, detection of exoplanets, Kepler's Laws, and Relativity."
