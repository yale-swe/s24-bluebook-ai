In addition to learning new vocabulary and more advanced sentence structure, I gained a deeper appreciation for French and Francophone cultural diversity. I highly recommend taking the class with Professor Ngame as he is a phenomenal instructor and brings an unparalleled wealth of knowledge and experience to the classroom.",

                "I really love the 'learn through doing' way that this course is taught and the French In Action series. It's been so helpful to be able to use French as it is really used in conversation."
