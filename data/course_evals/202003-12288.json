            "comments": [
                "The course went a bit slow in some parts, so we ended up getting behind. As such, Prof. Harris rushed through all the ending sections, and we still didn't get to relativity.",
                "Strengths: This is the best intro physics class for a high-level conceptual understanding of mechanics. The textbook (Kleppner & Kolenkow) helped describe physics in a new light, and was the perfect text to accompany the class. The lecture slides were also very helpful and made for a good set of notes for reference. \r\nWeaknesses: Professor Harriss lectures often spent too much time on concepts that were covered in the prerequisites of the course, and too little time on new material that was required for some of the problem sets. Overall, the classs pace was a little slower than it could have been, and we didnt get to cover some more interesting ground (the likes of special relativity and the details of rotational motion in 3 dimensions).",
                "One of this course's strengths was how it managed to connect myriad concepts through a relatively similar process of solving with calculus and infinitesimal reasoning. Overall, the lectures were very interesting, and Professor Harris was always open to answering questions and did an excellent job at it.\r\nI think the greatest weakness of the course was that the content we covered in class was often not applicable for our problem sets and general use. We might do the occasional example; however, it was often not useful for the book-derived homework problems. This meant relying a great deal on the textbook, whose examples and writing was not always the clearest, and office hours.\r\nThat said, office hours were usually very helpful. In particular, if he still TAs this class next time around, Tausif is an absolute hero.",
                "While the course did provide an introduction to mechanics, there could have been less review so that we could have spent more time on the new topics.",
                "Strengths:\r\nI thought Professor Harris was a good lecturer.\r\nThe questions on the midterms were similar in difficulty to questions on the problem sets, which helped in studying for the exams.\r\nOnly rarely did we need to know things that were in the textbook but not mentioned in lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThere were occasionally mistakes (mostly dropped minus signs) in the slides. We usually caught them during lecture or at least by the next lecture, but they occasionally led to some confusion. This is a fairly minor problem.",
                "The content of the course is interesting, and Professor Harris is a good and approachable professor. However, the online format of the course wasn't ideal. The PowerPoint presentations were sometimes a bit dry and occasionally had small errors in their formulas, which wasn't ideal.",
                "I enjoyed the lectures, although sometimes the material was contradictory with what was in the textbook and took time to clarify. Grading is also usually late, which did not affect learning too much since solutions were usually posted promptly.",
                "Strengths: I interacted with a lot of knowledgable and smart people who I would describe as pretty nerdy at physics. I was challenged when new concepts and pset problems didn't come to me as easily, and I learned the hard way the importance of figuring out what confused you. This can be done by actually attending office hours, discussing with a smart friend, or spending the time to do the dirty math and (re-)derive a result. Additionally, I generally found it helpful whenever we derived results that didn't include many skipped steps and whenever we walked through example problems in class.\r\n\r\n(Just a disclaimer that this was the first time Professor Harris taught 260)\r\nWeaknesses: I struggled to learn new topics from Harris' lecture style. His format was preprepared slides, where each slide was heavily packed with paragraphs, math, and diagrams. For me, this was a bit overwhelming. The class moved fast, and I sometimes felt there were steps in logic or math that we skipped. Since I couldn't clearly identify them, even though Harris regularly paused to check for questions, I wasn't sure what to ask to resolve my confusion. It would take rereading the slides and the textbooks multiple times after class to really understand some points. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, so much of the pset and test questions we got were much more math heavy than interesting in terms of physics concepts. While I understand that this level of classical mechanics necessarily involves much more math, I felt it didn't always have to be so messy. \r\n\r\nI think Professor Harris can definitely teach a better class the next iteration.",
                "The content of this course is excellent for anyone looking for a very rigorous introduction to university mechanics. The lectures were well-written and easy to follow, and the problem sets while extremely time-consumingwere instrumental in my learning and understanding the material. The midterm exams were fine (while difficult), but the final left much to be desired. Instead of being a cumulative final (as advertised), it covered maybe three topics while including very little physical reasoning and an immense amount of difficult by-hand calculation. I felt frustrated with the exam, not for a grading reason, but because I studied so hard and learned so much and didn't get to show any of that on the final.",
                "You REALLY learn classical mechanics.",
                "The exams did not seem to reflect the homework\/class content. I often wondered why our professor chose our textbook, as he did not seem to be very fond of it. Although most of our homework problems were from the book, our exam problems had a very different flavor. It was extremely helpful when extra problems were given by the professor to help in preparation.",
                "This course could be improved by varying the format more, with the goal of creating a more collaborative climate. In contrast to MATH 230, where office hours and group study were a common feature that made the lectures less important, this class was condensed into longer lectures, with less out-of-class exposure to the material. Otherwise, I was happy witth the lectures and engaged frequently with the TA's.",
                "Some strengths are that the homework assignments are very fair, and the TAs are great at helping with them. It could be improved by having practice tests\/past tests to use to study before the exams, as they were usually much harder than the Psets.",
                "Strengths: Professor Harris's lectures are really informative and it was fun going to them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The TAs and course staff were extremely underwhelming. I heard from classmates that office hours were often cancelled, and for the ones I went to (with one notable exception: Tausif) they didn't seem keen on really helping us understand the content; they just told us what part of our solution was wrong and very vaguely told us how to fix it. Furthermore, the grading seemed very arbitrary at times and the exam difficulty was totally uncorrelated with the lectures, textbook, and problem sets.",
                "The major strength of this course was the existence of undergraduate peer tutors. They were essential for understanding the content and for clarifying textbook content, since office hours with the instructor and with some graduate TAs were not particularly helpful. \r\nWeaknesses: too many. The professor often lacks patience and sometimes avoids students' questions; there were unacceptable delays with homework feedback. This last point, combined with the fact that lecture notes and PSet solutions are riddled with algebra mistakes, made studying for exams unnecessarily difficult. For instance, we did not get feedback on our last PSets before the final exam, and the final exam was dependent on our results from the psets. Additionally, lectures were often dedicated to tangential topics and we were left with a shallower understanding of some topics (such as rigid body motion) than if we had just gone through the textbook in class. The course should change the textbook to (perhaps) Morin's Introduction to Classical Mechanics, since it has much better problems (and explanations) than K&K, and the fact that K&K has an abundance of typos for a 2nd edition book. Finally, grading is erratic.",
                "Strengths: I believe that I got a lot better at solving Physics problems as a result of taking this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures didn't prepare me adequately for the problem sets and exams.",
                "Overall quite strong. The only weakness for me was that problem sets could become a bit tedious. I don't think this is anybody's fault in particular. There were good problems that did a good job of reinforcing the material. Just a bit tedious.",
                "The grading was terrible. There was a lot of variation between the graders, problem sets weren't turned back in time for studying for the midterms, and the grading seemed unfair. Too many points were taken off for simple sign errors and mistakes. The midterms and finals did not provide enough time; a two-day take-home final would have been much more reflective of how we did the problem sets and how I learned the material.",
                "Study groups were made at the beginning of the semester but I wish more was done to promote their use. Most of my psets I done solo, or with one person. Overall, the course was largely as advertised: an intensive Newtonian physics course",
                "This course provided a rigorous treatment of Newtonian mechanics. I feel like I have a firm grasp of physical concepts and their mathematical formalizations (using vector calculus, complex numbers, and differential equations). We covered oscillators in great detail, which was fantastic. The PSETs are at the proper difficulty. There is a very good community surrounding the class; we would often check our work with friends and review the week's problems. Professor Harris brings an interesting perspective to the subject by exploring the philosophy of physics, discussing the useful but technically unnecessary relationship between math and physics and determinism\/chaos.\r\nHowever, feedback was often delayed and minimal. When we took the final, we didn't have our last three PSETs back. The final, which was supposed to be comprehensive, overly emphasized the last few weeks of content and did not seem to accurately represent what we learned throughout the semester. Additionally, we did not get to topics like Lagrangian or Hamiltonian formulations (although they were mentioned) and most of the new content (details about noninertial frames and the central force problem) were pushed to the end.",
                "The lectures were perfect. I would have watched them for fun on my own. They always involved derivations or interesting applications\/thought experiments related to our current unit. Professor Harris is a really talented lecturer, and gives ample time for questions.\r\nThe problem sets were fun, relevant, encouraged collaboration, and really strengthened my understanding of the material.\r\nThe exams werent great. They tested our problem-solving skills (and for the final, our ability to integrate by hand without making a careless mistake or simply losing interest...) far more than our understanding of mechanics. The exams consistently involved problems unrelated to and far more advanced than any pset problems we had seen (this despite the fact that we were promised several times that nothing would be on the exams that we had not seen on psets). On the final in particular, many of my classmates were only able to solve particular problems because of what they had learned in multivariable calculus, in phys lab, or high school physics competitions. If the course is to be improved, the exams relevance and level of intellectuality would have to be raised substantially to meet the lectures and psets. \r\nI suspect that the exams were the way they were as a form of grade deflation, since nearly everyone aced nearly every pset. Most of us in 260 this semester believe that the solution to this problem is to have more difficult psets graded more stringently, and not to have exams like this.",
                "Strength: Interesting lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The problem sets often felt impossible to complete due to the difficulty of the problems. It was a bit discouraging.",
                "There is no strength of this course. Weaknesses: Disorganized - lecture notes weren't posted until one minute before class and problem sets were constantly posted late and covered material outside of the course. The instructor - prof. Harris was terrible and didn't help students understand concepts further then the textbook, in fact many of his lectures would have mistakes and fail to show how any result was gotten without using Mathematica. TAs - to be fair 2\/4 of the TAs were great, however the other two were horrible and didn't even know how to solve many of the problems correctly. They would give hints that were wrong and make solving a problem harder."

                "Professor Harris always posted lecture slides and always posted them just before class started, so you could view the slides at your own pace. This was very useful, and the slides were a main study material along with the textbook. However, during class, Harris would also make many useful annotations and corrections to typos or math mistakes we found. These were up to us to update in our own notes because lectures slides were mostly not updated with newer versions. This would have saved some time and confusing when referencing the slides while working on psets.",
                "This course was perfectly formulated as a remote course. It was accessible to students in all time zones, and no in-person anything was required. The exams, too, were very pandemic-friendly, as we had a 12 hour window to complete the exam (of course, it was timed after we started it, but we could start it any time in the window).",
                "Having an active online presence is important for remote engagement. I would love to see a Piazza or Discord page where the instructor can post comments and the class can generate a sense of comraderie.",
                "I think the virtual lecture format succeeded, though it made class discussions and questions more difficult. Harris was great about stopping for questions periodically throughout the class.",
                "Allowing us to use online resources for problem sets and exams was very useful, because it was hard to understand the content on the first pass. This leads straight to the main weakness: in a virtual class format, I'm afraid the lectures were way too hard to follow. Too much text and too little time, and I felt that I was never able to fully grasp the content\/calculations, and then there weren't enough support opportunities (office hours, etc.) to make up for it.",
                "Lectures were fairly good. The only criticism I can give is on Prof. Harrison's handwritten annotations on the slide. A tablet of some sort would have made these far more readable and useful.",
                "The recorded lectures and shared presentation notes were highly appreciated as I could go back and review the material on my own time and at my own pace.",
                "The live virtual lectures were engaging and preferable to having asynchronous lecture. It was helpful to be assigned to study groups and have a review session before the final. I did not attend TF office hours after having a bad experience in the first couple weeks and shifting to friend study groups. I found it more effective to collaborate with peers. In this respect, it would be helpful to have an open Gather Town or Zoom room for discussing and working on PSETs.",
                "This subject overall is just very difficult to learn virtually.",
                "The online format worked really well. Professor Harriss lectures would have been enlightening and followable in any setting.",
                "The live lectures were generally done well. However, I did miss watching problems being solved by being written out live (as opposed to being prewritten out on slides).",
                "The course was a simple virtual lecture. There is really nothing they could due to improve this course virtually."

                "Yes",
                "This course was a good review of AP Physics C while also including some new content, but Professor Harriss lectures were somewhat dull. Overall though, if youre looking to learn to work with equations (rather than numbers) and build on your mechanics understanding, this is a good intro course for you.",
                "It depends on what they're looking for. This class teaches some valuable physics and greatly expands one's understanding of mechanics; however, it is hard. Conceptually, temporally, and with respect to exams, this is an unambiguously tough class--and one that expects a lot of independent work outside of class to truly make the most of it. If this sounds like something you are willing to do, your studies will net you a lot of knowledge. Just know what you're signing up for.",
                "It was the most brilliant and illuminating physics class I have ever taken. If you are interested in physics, this course is definitely worth the workload.",
                "Definitely. I learned a lot from this class, and I found it very interesting. I thought the lectures were engaging, and the problem sets were of reasonable length. The content was certainly challenging, but not unreasonably so.",
                "Yes, if they're seriously considering physics or a related field, this is a good course to start with.",
                "Absolutely, to anybody who enjoys physics. The material was very interesting to me, the problem sets were reasonable, although often challenging, and the students were eager to help. I thought it was a great environment in which to learn and found the experience rewarding.",
                "If I were to start anew, I would choose to take 200 over 260. While I'm thankful for the interesting and smart people I've gotten to work with a little, it was not worth the time and frustration I sometimes felt and I cannot say I liked the majority of questions we had to work through. I became impatient and sometimes desperate to get the pset done rather than having some fun with it. Before, I thought I loved physics and solving cool problems. Now, I am more doubtful than ever about my interest in physics. Perhaps that is necessary for me, but it was the result for me from taking the class.",
                "I would, but I would caution you to make sure this is what you want. You will likely spend a large chunk of your time on this course. You may spend at least 2h\/day on problem sets, or much more if you leave them until the weekend\/if they are particularly hard. This being said, if you're a physics major who wants a rigorous mechanics class, this course is excellent. The material is fascinating, and if you apply yourself, you will learn a TON. You may not get the grade you wanted, but if you focus instead on learning, you will be satisfied with this course.",
                "If you enjoy physics and are pretty good at it, I'd definitely recommend this course. You will absolutely become a better physicist, but do expect a high workload!",
                "If he\/she has tremendous preparation, experience, and enthusiasm for physics, strong computer science and programming background, and familiarity with difficult multivariable calculus topics, this is a great class. Students should be absolutely confident that they fit this description, or else another class will better serve them.",
                "Yes! Any student hoping to maor in physics should take this class. The matieral is accessible, and it's a great introduction to the problem solving skills that are necessary for physics and widely applicable across other disciplines.",
                "Yes, especially if they have taken AP Physics C, and are interested in learning about other particular topics in class. Sometimes, the class lectures will veer from the textbook content and the psets, which can be fun, but means you should study and prepare on your own time too.",
                "Absolutely take 260 if you place into it, because you owe it to yourself to see challenging physics if you already made it this far. However, I cannot in good conscience recommend this class until the TA staff\/class organization improves dramatically. The graduate TAs graded the problem sets and exams, and I often found the point deductions to be extremely arbitrary (I know they said they're following a rubric, but that just leaves me with questions about how the rubric was constructed.) For example, on the second midterm many people messed up a calculation at the end, and they gave us 12\/20 only to give about half of it back instantly upon appeal! This one case makes me skeptical about how a lot of the other unusual deductions were determined. Most of the TAs were not great with office hours either (shoutout to Tausif for being a notable exception to this; his office hours were FANTASTIC) - I heard from classmates that many times they were cancelled, and though I often saw announcements on Canvas rescheduling them, this was apparently not always the case. Furthermore, when I went to them with any other TA, they were way too vague with their help for my taste, only telling us where in our solutions we had gone wrong but not giving any advice with how to fix it. Jack Harris is a really nice guy and clearly knows his stuff inside out, but I found his lectures a bit hard to follow over Zoom because of how much text was on each slide. Finally, it's a problem when the p-sets and exams are designed to be \"learning opportunities\" that expand beyond the textbook and lectures, which I have no problem with on its own, but then the class ISN'T curved in an attempt to support us, so on two of the exams a vast majority of the class received a lower grade than in a standard introductory class distribution. The workload is objectively less than MATH 230, for example, but if you don't understand the content it might be harder to do well in PHYS 260 just because of the intellectual challenge (and unbelievably messy calculations) in all the problems. So tl;dr: take this class if you place into it, lectures are great and thinking about physics is fun, but if you're not planning to major in physics I'd suggest taking it when the organization is better because otherwise you're running a huge risk of tanking your GPA.",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if they have a very strong character (or if there is another instructor). The content becomes unpleasant due to poor teaching. They should strongly consider taking 200\/201, since they are equally as useful for the Physics major (or related majors) and they apparently are less haphazardly arranged.",
                "Yes, definitely recommend. A good introduction\/review of Newtonian mechanics.",
                "If you are very interested in physics and likely pursuing a related major, I would take this course. Otherwise, PHYS 200 or PHYS 180 will probably be enough.",
                "Yes, this is the course to take if you want to go into physics! You will gain a thorough understanding of mechanics, especially with respect to its mathematical formalizations. I appreciated the detail at which topics were addressed this semester. Also, the workload is manageable. It is worth noting that each instructor will add their own flair to this class (Professor Harris focuses on oscillators and delves into some philosophy).",
                "I would recommend 260 to a physics-oriented student interesting in abstraction and mathematical rigor, but not to an engineering major or a student looking for breadth of physical knowledge.",
                "I wouldn't recommend this to any student that isn't EXTREMELY prepared and knowledgeable on the subjects of the class already. In general, it is probably more worth it to take one of the less intensive intro to physics classes.",
                "If Jack Harris is teaching this course absolutely not. Take another course, any other course. Also if you have seen mechanics this course really doesn't add much and is better skipped. Take another cool class while staying on track with math and then take 410 later which I hear is much better and better taught. If another teacher is teaching this course then maybe take it if you want to review mechanics. But if you haven't seen the material before take 200 or 180 not this course."
