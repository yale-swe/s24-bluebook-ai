                "I learned how to practically think about effective health-policy making and how to center equity at the forefront of public health decisions. I was also exposed to many different perspectives on how to best approach complicated health issues, and acquired a broader appreciation for the level of care, detail and planning that goes into ensuring that no one is left behind when drafting public health policies, and that interventions don't have collateral effects that are worse than the problems that we are aiming to solve.",

                "This course taught me valuable skills in synthesizing large amounts of the dense information on health policy into short, impactful 2 page reports. The ability to distill tens of pages of academic journal writing into a brief message is one of the most important skills needed in public health communication and the presentation assignment and writing prompts required of students in this course granted me valuable practice with these techniques, helping to build my analytical skills.",
                "I learned about a variety of topics in global health, including global clinical trial and research ethics, the political economy of health, the impacts of immigration policies on health, and many more. I gained a better understanding of how policy is designed and how considerations of equity figure in to influencing policy decisions. The readings in the course consist of policy recommendations, social science academic articles, news articles, etc. so there is a wide range of content to learn from.",

                "The course really pushes you to form your own opinions, illustrate them and critique your illustrations in less than 2 pages which is a huge feat for someone used to rambling. The readings were relevant and generally thought provoking. Classroom discussions however sometimes felt a little dull, although this could just be because of Zoom. It would be nice if Prof. PB pushed people to be more vocal\/drew on submitted critical analyses to encourage participation.",
                "This course was one of the best I have taken during my time at Yale. The breadth and depth of material that we covered, the variety of topics that Professor PB brought to conversation in class, and the engagement of everyone in the seminar with the discussions made it such an exciting, interesting, enlightening and engaging learning experience!",
                "Professor PB was the absolute highlight of this course. Our discussions were interesting and she encouraged participation with her facilitation. Her implementation of podcasts, videos and guest speakers in addition to readings, discussions and class presentations made class enjoyable.",
                "Strengths  the reading assignments were incredibly engaging, important, and fascinating. This course helped me build my skills in reading academic papers in a time efficient manner and note taking.",
                "I think the course could benefit from more discussion into how policy decisions\/policy itself is drafted and made in global health contexts. Doing so could provide opportunities to see how equity is (or isn't) considered in enacted policies, as well as think about ways to implement equity into health focused policy. In terms of logistics, it was nice to have options over which readings to complete, but I think a core set each week with optional supplements could help with facilitating discussion throughout class sessions. The assignment schedule was structured well and allowed for flexibility while ensuring that students did not fall behind."

I learned so much in this class and will take the analytical writing skills I developed in this seminar with me in my future courses.",

She was more than willing to implement changes to the syllabus that the class suggested and was extremely accommodating. Beyond the assigned readings, Prof PB offers so much from her experiences working in global health and never shies away from sharing or speaking to topics students are interested in.",
