                "An amazing course!! Definitely the best chem course I've taken  weaknesses obviously include the virtual nature of the lecture, but Jon did a great job lecturing regardless. I really appreciated having the lectures recorded, as I could go back and watch them later if I missed anything. Again, because lecture was virtual, we couldn't view multiple chalkboards at once  this sometimes detracted from direct comparisons Jon was trying to make, or sometimes I didn't catch everything that was written (but being able to view the recorded lecture\/having pdfs of the lecture was really helpful). Strengths: everything but the virtual nature, Jon, the clear and organized lecture style and direction of the course. Psets and exams are also returned super quickly, with clear feedback (and there are answer keys)."

Jon is an incredible professor, and I learned so much. There are weekly psets, but they're accessible\/clear and Jon holds office hours to help you. This course is really well facilitated for student learning :)"
