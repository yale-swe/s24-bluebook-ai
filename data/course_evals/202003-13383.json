                "How to write a preliminary research design... You learn how to swiftly read political science papers and how to digest what seems like overwhelming language! I had a very vibrant group of peers, so I would also say in this course I also developed the ability to talk about such complex ideas casually, and relate them to our daily lives.",
                "I learned about women's underrepresentation in government in the U.S. and abroad (but mostly in the U.S.), what steps have been taken to ameliorate this disparity, and to what extent they have worked. I developed my ability to quickly and efficiently read technical political science papers and gained insight into the barriers women face in achieving equal representation.",

                "I loved this course. I learned about the quantitative research grounding what we currently know about women in politics, took part in fascinating discussions with a powerhouse cohort, and wrote a really interesting research design (tons of takeaways on research in this field throughout the class).",
                "This was an amazing course challenging and exploring the problem of achieving gender parity in politics. With an excellent focus on intersectionality and a mixture of American and global politics, this course not only functions as an interesting source in fascinating information about this topic but provides countless opportunities for students to engage in discussion and craft their own ideas.",

                "Strengths: \r\n- super interesting readings each week with a reading journal\/response to submit, which helped me stay involved all along the semester\r\n- the seminar format enables great discussion on the readings prepared \r\n- the group project based on the data of the elections 2020 was so interesting too!! I loved it (also collecting data was great)\r\n- Professor Aldrich is a great Professor!!!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I would have liked to spend more time on the possible implementation of measures to solve the issue of the underrepresentation of women in politics. Even though we studied it a bit (e.g. quotas), it wasn't that much compared with the time spent on the issue and its complexity",
                "It was very helpful that the research design was broken up throughout the semester. It was never an assignment that was \"huge\" and impending at a scary rate. It was very manageable and Professor Aldrich provided consistent feedback. The one weakness is how early we had to choose our research question before we were familiar with the course content. A brief course survey may have been helpful early on to help pick topics. I chose a very abstract topic and I think I would have chosen a more niche direction if given that initial guidance.",
                "Strengths: Professor Aldrich is very thoughtful and encourages lots of participation--everyone got to speak a lot in seminar and we had really engaging discussions, not just regurgitating the material. She doesn't make you feel like any of your questions are stupid (even when you ask how to read a graph) and takes our feedback very much into consideration. Weaknesses: I wish we had looked at specific case studies and talked about the lived experiences of women leaders.",
                "This course is organized well with weekly topics, from \"conservative women\" to \"women in the legislature,\" that build on each other. It provides interesting insight into phenomena we see in the news, and it also goes beyond the U.S. to look at women in politics in different countries.",
                "Strengths: Professor Aldrich has created a very supportive learning community and is super empowering. The class cohort really connected this semester, too. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses I can think of at all!",
                "This course is very engaging and I would recommend no changes.",
                "Strengths: The readings and topics were very interesting!\r\nWeaknesses: At times, discussions would veer a bit off-topic, but that is also the nature of seminars!",
                "This course does not need any improvements! It was an incredible discussion-based course and while the readings were discussed in good detail, they mainly acted to supplement our thorough class discussions. Other seminars normally would only focus on the readings without students being able to bring in personal stories and reflections, but this class is not like other seminars.",
                "I loved this class, and don't think there were any weaknesses at all! This was my second seminar and I loved Professor Aldrich's method of connecting with students, being straightforward and pausing to answer questions when needed. She approached the information in a way that made it easier for students to comprehend, and enjoy.",
                "The professor cared so much about the academic success and wellbeing of all her students and it completely showed in her style of teaching.  She made accommodations to the virtual format utilizing zoom breaks, tools to further discussion, and zoom mechanisms to help the class."

She makes sure everyone understands and gets involved in the class. In addition, she manages to foster juicy discussions between the students.",
                "Yes! Professor Aldrich presents big ideas in an approachable manner. In introductory political science courses I have certainly felt intimidated, so I came in thinking a seminar would be more intimidating, but it was very accessible information and Professor Aldrich does a wonderful job leveling conversation between all her students and making sure everyone understands the material\/papers before them, while also giving students a personal reflective outlet to encourage personal conceptualizations of what could seem like distant topics.",
                "Yes, if you're prepared to learn about women in politics in a rather narrow sense (mostly in the U.S., and not looking at LGBTQ+ people in politics). As a humanities-geared person who's mostly taken English and History classes, I was surprised by how much of political science is quantitative, esp. interpreting graphs and charts, and found the readings pretty dry, but if you're already a political science person and you want to learn about women's representation, this is the class for you! Professor Aldrich is great and fosters a fun classroom community, even in the virtual space.",
                "I definitely would if they're looking to learn more about women in the political world; the only caveat is that we limit most our discussion and analysis to the gender binary, so while we do analyze LGBTQ women in politics, the research we look at is often not inclusive of other genders.",
                "For sure! This is a really important and informative course, to understand more about why women are underrepresented in public service careers and what potential improvements to the pipeline might look like, now and in the future.",
                "Absolutely - this class leaves students with clear takeaways about gender in politics, as well as with excellent understanding of how to engage with future research on the subject.",
                "Yes! This is a great course for students of all backgrounds. Very accessible and interesting content.",
                "Definitely!! Professor Aldrich organized all of the assignments in a very understanding fashion which prevented students from cramming last minute to meet assignment deadlines. In addition, the assignments that we did helped us apply our class concepts to real-world examples such as when we gathered data on women running in the 2020 elections.",
                "Yes! I learned so much about women and politics, and truly enjoyed hearing from such an educated and experienced individual regarding the field.",
                "I would recommend this class in a heartbeat.  The professor is phenomenal and the content is relevant, probative, balanced, and fascinating."
