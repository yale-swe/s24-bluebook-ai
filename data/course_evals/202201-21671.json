                "I thought the course did a great job providing an overview of different parts in the field. I think potentially giving short quizzes on the textbook reading since I know many other people didn't end up reading the textbook since it wasn't as necessary to complete the problem sets.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Interesting, engaging instructor\r\n- Relaxed atmosphere made it easy to ask questions\r\n- I feel like we learned a lot throughout the semester\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Sometimes the lectures felt a bit convoluted. Basically, I think we need more information about how to approach general problems in lecture instead of just specifics. We do a lot of examples, but sometimes I think it would be helpful to zoom out and talk about the general rule that applies. \r\n- The exams should've been better proctored. \r\n- The problem sets are graded very unrigorously, which makes it hard to tell how well you're actually doing.",
                "Great course with a lot of the context following the textbook, which was helpful. It could be improved with options for Zoom or class notes for students who had to miss class due to Covid.",
                "This course was overall very fun. I really enjoyed it. The life in the classroom and excitement for class was definitely one of the strengths of the course. Sometimes it would feel as if the problem sets had addressed topics that weren't yet taught, but the professor was always open to discussion and promotes understanding above all else, which was greatly appreciated.",
                "The course content was so interesting, and it introduced me to different applications of environmental engineering. I think the course could benefit from a more clear structure and clearer directions in the PSETs.",
                "The course doesn't really teach the chemistry foundations that you would need to go further in Env. Eng. but instead gives you what you need for the psets and what not. Kind of annoying to not really understand the chemistry stuff super well but that's okay. Strengths were the broad variety of topics and the professor Peccia. Funny and nice prof.",
                "strengths: very interesting topic, prof. Peccia is a good teacher and makes class enjoyable, exams aren't unnecessarily complicated\r\nweaknesses: p-sets don't have the most direction, sometimes it's hard to tell what we are expected to do for those; didn't receive much feedback on p-sets",
                "Very clear instructions, staightforward",
                "Strengths include straightforward lectures and good teaching, weaknesses include some confusion with homework problems when reviewing how to do them in class. It was also difficult to figure out exactly what was done wrong on problem sets at times, but the grading on homeworks was generous, which made up for this.",
                "I thought this was a great introductory course to environmental engineering. We covered a large variety of topics and it was still easy to understand even with jumping around.",
                "Strengths: straightforward and got a good foundation regarding what the environmental engineering major encompasses; the PSETS allow for better understanding and are more difficult than the exams. Prof Peccia is very helpful and cares a lot about his students\r\nWeaknesses: more emphasis on chemistry than I originally anticipated, which may make it difficult if not yet taken chemistry or taking concurrently",
                "It was very unorganized with the homework and it was sometimes unclear what we were expected to know.",
                "Sometimes the professor could go a bit off-track (we learned a lot about his dog and Cut Bank, MT), but this was honestly charming, enjoyable, and usually related back to some idea in environmental engineering. Overall, some strengths are that it teaches interesting material and has an engaging professor. A weakness is that it is a little loosely structured and the material taught in class didn't always relate to the problem sets unless we specifically asked questions about them in class. Peccia is always happy help walk through homework problems, though.",
                "This course was carried by the enthusiasm and dedication of Professor Peccia. I had learned a majority of the scientific concepts prior to the class and therefore found the lectures slow at times, but the professors enthusiasm for the course material helped maintain my engagement throughout the semester. I wish there were more optional practice problems given so I could have fully grasped the concepts. Personally, it felt 75% sure how to solve problems similar to problem sets and I would have appreciated additional problems, even if it was just problems that the professor recommended in the textbook. Also, I would hold the class in a different classroom as the class always felt hot and made me drowsy (this had nothing to do with the lectures, I only noticed drowsiness on days when I took my jacket off and was sweating).",
                "I think the format of the course was good, but there couldve been more clear notes in lecture, because some of the information was difficult to understand.",
                "For what it isa class sort of designed to introduce you to an entire fieldthis course does quite well, insofar as it sets up a necessary preliminary foundation of science, through units on acid-base chemistry, kinetics, units, etc., and then gives a small preview of some of the \"major\" environmental engineering issues and how they're tackled. The weakness of the course, I'd say, then comes from this very format, too; that is, though you cover a good deal of material in breadth, there's very little depth to that learning. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that this is an issue that could be addressed. That said, there is another specific weakness of this course that I think could and should be ameliorated; namely, it was hard to review for this class and check over your work, because Professor Peccia's answer keys were often difficult-to-follow, and furthermore office hours were often somewhat unhelpful, as the TFs themselves often did not seem to know what to do for problems or seemed to be out of the loop with the professor. I never went to Professor Peccia's office hours, and perhaps this would have helped, but there did seem to be some kind of disconnect that made it difficult to review subjects that were tricky to me.",
                "It is well structured and comprehensive.",
                "Strengths: meant to be an intro to environmental engineering, Peccia is very nice and understanding, did everything the course was meant to do.\r\nWeaknesses: I can't think of any.",
                "A strength of the course was the breadth of the material and that it was able to cover a variety of topics within environmental engineering, so if you aren't interested in air pollution (for example), you wouldn't feel stuck or bored for too long. Additionally, the class exposes students to topics that I hadn't had much of an introduction to such as risk analysis, and I thought that that was really nice. The professor was also very flexible and listened to students' needs. A weakness of the course might be the organization of the course and that sometimes I wasn't sure what the next lecture/coming weeks were going to be like.",
                "Great professor",
                "Peccia is a very interesting man, but sometimes he can go off the rails. While his tangents are interesting, I often feel unprepared for the week's problem sets. Additionally, the problem sets often lack the necessary givens to answer the question. Despite this, Peccia does go over homework problems in class if we ask him to.",
                "Classes are not structured well and the class work did not help with psets at all. TAs were just as lost as the students",
                "Strengths: good breadth of content, engaging and fun problem sets, extremely straightforward midterm and final exams (easier than homeworks), great lecture communication from professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: at times, it felt a bit disorganizedbut sometimes, this allowed for homework extensions and flexibility, which helped!",
                "The professor was definitely the biggest strength in this course, he tough the material in a clear and engaging way. Something that could be improved about this course is that some of the problems on the psets did not completely align with the methods of the material covered in the class/textbook.",
                "Strengths: support network and content \r\nWeakness: lack of online presence",
                "Specifically for the problem sets, if often took students a while to complete problems because not all of the data needed to solve each problem was provided. Additionally, the class materials do not give any information about websites and platforms to find data made finding the data difficult. Problem sets would benefit students more if the many challenge was solving the problem rather than trying to find values of very specific data.",
                "Excellent engaging lectures. The lack of online out of class resources made it so that if you missed something in lecture it was difficult to find elsewhere.",

                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course whether you are majoring in environmental engineering or not. It is relatively math/chemistry heavy, so if you're a humanities major, maybe consider a different QR credit if you're looking for a total gut, but I think that anybody with any love for environmental sciences would love this course.",
                "Yes, especially if they are interested in environmental problems.",
                "If you're interested in env. eng. or any environmental focused career yes. Gives a good base knowledge of how the world is changing around us in environmental / health / climate terms and is a chill standard engineering class. Professor was nice and nothing was unfair.",
                "Yes; it is a very interesting class and not overly complicated but you do learn a lot. The p-sets are significantly more difficult than the exams, but most of them are not overly time-intensive. As an engineering class, it is not too stressful, and Prof. Peccia makes class entertaining.",

                "I would recommend this course to students considering pursuing environmental engineering. The professor is great and I feel it gives a very good background on the types of problems environmental engineers solve. I would not recommend this course to individuals who do not have a decent background in general chemistry.",
                "In all honesty, that depends. If environmental engineering is something that interests you, I think that this is an important class to take, though it might often feel slow if you already have some background in the subject or in similar subjects like chemistry. I am not particularly interested in environmental engineering, and will not pursue it after this class, but I took this instead for an EVST requirement, and to any EVST students out there looking to meet the Natural Science Core Course requirement as I was, I would recommend taking something else. Indeed, I'm not unhappy that I took this per se, but in the grand scheme of things I personally think that this credit could have been better used on another class for me.",
                "Yeah, good intro class, worth taking if you're considering ENVE as a major",
                "Yes. This was a great course to see whether or not environmental engineering is something for you or not. Also, this course was not stressful, and the professor was very nice and understanding. I would also recommend this course to someone who needs a science credit as it was not too difficult.",
                "This course is a great introductory class to take even if you aren't going to major in environmental engineering because it covers a lot of interesting topics, and the professor seems to care a lot about students and listened to our concerns/struggles. I think it would be good if people taking the course have taken high school chemistry and maybe physics before because some of the basic chemistry concepts aren't covered too in-depth in class, but the pace of the course is definitely manageable, and almost every lecture was interesting. The problem sets and exams are also pretty straightforward and related to the class content, which makes studying and learning easier.",
                "yes",
                "I would recommend this class to another student. It's a fun QR credit, but it's not exactly a gut. There are only 6-7 psets and two exams, but the psets can be somewhat difficult and time-consuming.",
                "Not really, Professor is super nice but the class is structured terribly. The Psets are also super hard and class did not really help. TAs were also super lost and couldnt help.",
                "Yes! This is a wonderful class to develop some literacy in environmental engineering, as well as gain insights and skills into how a vast range of environmental issues can be addressed. The material was engaging, problem sets were relatively rigorous but manageable, and Professor Peccia is not only a great lecturer but one of the funniest professors you'll ever have. I enjoyed attending class each day! The midterm and final exams are extremely straightforward, and as long as you keep up with the course throughout the semester, you'll take a lot out of it.\r\n\r\nNote: assumes a bit of chemistry knowledge (if you took high school chemistry once and \"vaguely\" remember what a pH is, you'll be fine).",
