   "comments": [
    "I learned about the large scale events in North African history, with a focus on events after the 19th century.",
    "As a novice learner of North African history, this course was really insightful on the politics, history, identity processes, and religious histories. The continuous, fluid process of identity construction and the constant process of decolonization were the biggest takeaways.",
    "I learned a ton about North Africa from pre-colonial times until today. We mainly studied Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria, and much of the course focused on the colonial and post-colonial periods (but we did learn about pre-colonial and present day North Africa). There was a lot of comparison between Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria in the readings, which really helped me develop a nuanced and thorough understanding of colonialsim and its legacy in various North African states.",
    "I developed a breadth and depth in my understanding of the Maghreb region. This was primarily related to history and politics.",
    "I learned a lot about North Africa and also since this class pretty much focused on the sociology aspect of things, I learnt a lot about identity, nationalism in Maghreb and state-building as well.",
    "I learned a lot more about the North Africa region with good temporal scope. We learned using primary sources and secondary sources with good diversity. We also had the opportunity to apply sociological theory to the history."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Class discussions were lively, and I appreciated the inclusion of many guest speakers from Morocco. There was a lot of reading, and sometimes it was hard to get through it all.",
    "The biggest plus to this course was how Professor Wyrtzen did not focus on the security aspect of the region, which is often overly represented and sometimes overemphasized in other syllabi I have encountered. The brevity of our term meant we could not go as deep as we wanted to on all the material, but I think should the course be taught over a normal semester this should not be an issue.",
    "The class was organized very well. There was a great balance of lecture and discussion and we had a fair number of guest lecturers. The course modules show what readings and assignment we have due each day of class, and I really appreciated that setup. I can't think of a way this course could have been improved.",
    "The strengths was that it was very engaging and involved a nuanced view at Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria in discussions and class times. Weaknesses were that it was a little ambitious to cover the society and politics of North Africa in 5 weeks: readings were lengthy, but that was the best way to learn this information, and it's important to note that much of it was skewed to Morocco (given the study abroad portion of it that was supposed to be a factor, this did not surprise me, but it's good to know).",
    "Since it's listed as a seminar, I think there should be more focus on facilitating the student conversation. Otherwise it was pretty good in my opinion.",
    "The sources and professors insight were very interesting. I really felt my insight into the region was greatly improved. I feel as though sometime we didnt get as much seminar discussion as I would have liked, but it didnt impact my enjoyment that much.",
    "This was a very strong and interesting course."

   "comments": [
    "Yeah! Nice balance between sociology and history, so Id recommend it for people who dont necessarily have a lot of experience with the social sciences but would like to dip their toes in that subject area.",
    "This is a class you can not miss! Professor Wyrtzen's expertise and experience shine through and his careful attention to the nuances of the material amazing. I am glad to have had the opportunity to engage in this course.",
    "Absolutely. This is one of the best (if not the best) course I've taken at Yale so far. I'm majoring in history and the sociological lens of the course was quite refreshing and engaging. Professor Wyrtzen is amazing and articulates himself very clearly and makes himself available to his students. The class was adapted really well to an online format (virtual field trips, guest lecturers Zooming in from Morocco, etc) and assignments were easy to submit online. The readings are always insightful and never excessive and I truly just cannot say enough good things about this course.",
    "I would! The guest lectures are great, Professor Wyrtzen really values questions and discussions that the students spur, and it's a good intro look at that region.",
    "Yes but be aware that even though its listed under History\/ Global Affairs, this is pretty much a sociology class.",
    "If you are trying to learn more about North Africa through many sources and in an interesting way this course is great. I really went from knowing very little to having a broad perspective on the region. The course is somewhat centered on Morocco as that is the professors focus, but you still do get to learn about the region."
