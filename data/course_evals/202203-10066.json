                "This course is not designed well in terms of accommodating the creative projects. I think that if instead of/in addition to a prospectus, creative students were asked to consider equivalent deadlines to the syllabus, that might be useful. The course as it stands requires you to write a 20 page paper before you're finished with your project, which felt counterproductive. It sometimes felt like not-that-useful work to do on top of doing the work for my thesis. I think it could potentially be restructured to accommodate a wider variety of final projects, which are the reason a lot of people choose AMST to begin with.",
                "The format of the course is mostly for students doing traditional 60-page projects which made it a bit less effective for students doing creative projects. Kelsey is very kind and thoughtful though and gave great advice.",
                "Strengths: Very flexible! It's great to have a community to get feedback from and to go through the process with, even when everyone's doing very different projects. Also, if you're looking for guidance on how to do research, there are a lot of strategies discussed in this class. \r\nWeaknesses: Very flexible! There was so much variety within the class projects that some of the assignments were only helpful for some of us. Also, there's a weird effect in a year-long project that when I spent time working on the class assignments instead of my individual project, I felt satisfied enough with myself that I wouldn't work on my actual project. So sometimes the seminar readings felt like extra assignments that weren't directly helping me get stuff done. It might be helpful, especially in the second semester, to have more time dedicated to just working or even workshopping.",
