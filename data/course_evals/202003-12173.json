                "This course was an overview of technical art history methods and techniques with a specific focus on the Ghent Altarpiece. We learned about the altarpiece's history and many ongoing controversies about its creation and restoration. We also got the opportunity to meet and learn from a lot of museum curators and technical art historians who have worked with the Ghent Altarpiece and could provide further information about it and about the current restoration project.",
                "This skill gave me a good foundation of what technical art history is and provided amazing opportunities to consult a variety of experts who work in different areas of the field. I learned a lot about the physicality of art, technology that has developed to better understand it, and the ethical issues surrounding conservation and restoration treatments.",
                "It was a wonderful experience to investigate a single artwork for a whole semester. It showed me how many perspectives by which you can approach an artwork, and I feel like we could have kept considering it beyond our basic introduction! We considered the methods of technical art history and how science and data evaluations can inform our understanding of artworks and their artists themselves.",
                "I learned a great deal about not just the Ghent Altarpiece, but about early Netherlandish paintings in general. The art objects in the course were approached from several themes, including technical examination, social context and historiographic interpretation. There was also discussion of the interfaces between connoisseurship and technical art history. I found this multimodal approach to a single artwork to be really helpful in recognizing the advantages and drawbacks for each perspective. The methods of technical examination were discussed in detail, so I have a much firmer grasp on which techniques (e.g. infrared reflectography) are useful in specific scenarios."

                "Though this course was interesting, I also found it to be a bit all over the place. The professor did not update the syllabus to reflect this past semester's new academic calendar so we started a week late and probably had fewer classes than we should have. Some classes had more of a structure because the professor lectured about a specific topic, or we had a guest speaker, but in the weeks where it was just a discussion I felt that there was not much structure and the discussion often strayed from the topics we'd read about. We also had very few assignments, and the professor provided very little information on the syllabus about what she expected from these assignments. If I didn't reach out to her outside of class to ask for help, it was sometimes very difficult to figure out what I was supposed to do.",
                "The course was very interesting and taught at a good pace. It covered a large amount of material. One of the biggest strengths of the course was the number of guest lectures from experts in the field. This gave students an unparalleled opportunity to ask questions and learn more about the field. The instructor herself was also very knowledgable and encouraged positive discussions.",
                "The material is super interesting, Nenagh was amazing.  Honestly it was hard because of the virtual format, but still good with all the speakers and the discussion was super interesting.  The only thing I thought could be improved was the feedback Nenagh was very helpful and clearly knowledgeable, and I thought she gave great advice and was just a genuinely kind person.  But I wasn't really sure how to do better (obviously I had plenty of room for improvement, but I did feel kind of lost).",
                "The main strength of the course was the many people that she brought to speak with us (over Zoom, of course!). We were able to speak with people who were directly involved in the current conservation project on the altarpiece and others who are experts at the top of their fields, like Maryan Ainsworth who is a head conservator at the Met. I felt incredibly lucky to have this opportunity. The conversation during our class discussions did seem to lull at times or lack direction, however. I felt sometimes like the course had a general framework, focusing on a general topic relating to the altarpiece each week, but beyond that, it could feel a bit scattered.",
                "A definite strength of the course was the quality of the readings, which incorporated book chapters, essays and technical studies. The readings were engaging and had a wide variety of perspectives; I always found myself in concurrence or (productive) disagreement with several of the assigned readings. Another strength was the guest lecturers, who provided great insight into the world of conservation, analysis and exhibit design. I have a much clearer understanding of the challenges inherent in caring for a famous work of art in the public eye. \r\nOne weakness of the course was the lack of in-person experience with the technical methods discussed in class. I now know how x-radiography is used to examine an artwork, but I'm not entirely sure how the equipment is used, what its physical constraints are, etc."

                "This course actually used the COVID pandemic to its advantage, inviting experts to speak on Zoom that normally would not be able to  attend an in-person lecture. The seminar format worked well for this class, and online museum lectures outside of class were also incorporated.",
                "The availability of the closer to van Eyck website was indispensible in maintaining access to the Ghent Altarpiece despite lacking physical library access. I would have liked an in-person tour of a conservator's lab (even if not being used for early Netherlandish paintings), but the website allowed great access to various imagings of the Ghent Altarpiece. \r\nThe discussion format worked well over Zoom, owing to the small size of the class."

                "I would recommend this course to another student but with a few qualifications. First of all, this course is not so much a study of the Ghent Altarpiece as it is a study of other people who have studied the Ghent Altarpiece - it is much more focused on connoisseurship or technical art history approaches to the altarpiece by other historians. If the study of art historical practices really interests you, I would recommend this course. I will say that I'm not sure this is a great option for someone without an art historical background. I've taken many art history classes at Yale and I still felt like the readings and subject matter could be confusing.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in chemistry, science, art, or art history. The course, while it focuses on technical art history, was highly interdisciplinary and allowed students to learn about a variety of fields related to technical art history.",
                "Yes!  The final essay was pretty challenging to me (granted didn't have much experience coming in), and I have no idea how I did exactly  but I felt like I grew a lot, and the class wasn't needlessly stressful.  Kind of perfect balance truly no busy work, just interesting readings, challenging but rewarding essays.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. The opportunity to study a single artwork in this kind of depth should be required for all art history students. I think that the course will also be a bit more organized and well-structured going into its second time of being taught.",
                "This course offered a deep dive into a single (albeit multifaceted) artwork. The advantage of this format was being able to evaluate several different approaches to art history, as well as exploring a pivotal time period of Western art. The disadvantage (such as it is) is that only one period is examined through the lens of painting; there was little discussion on, for example,social structures in the Low Countries in the early 15th-century. Seminars tended to focus on technical methods, which have broader ranging applicability, but were grounded in early Netherlandish paintings. \r\nI'd consider this course to be a useful experience for those with an art history background in applying multiple perspectives (technical, social, historiographic) to a specific artwork, and for those without that background to learning about technical methods used in art conservation. Even though it is quite focused on a specific period, it exposes a variety of broader insights and methods that are universally useful."
