                "-Engaging Discussions: Professor Marcus fosters lively and active discussions, particularly around assigned readings and debatable topics. This approach encourages critical thinking, a deeper understanding of the material, and active participation from students.\r\n-Positive Learning Environment: Professor Marcus creates a safe and supportive space for students to express their ideas, ask questions, and learn from each other. This fosters a sense of community and belonging in the classroom.\r\n-A well-organized final paper submission process ensured we stayed on track, met deadlines, and received prompt feedback from both the professor and colleagues.\r\n-Peer assessment was inspiring.\r\n-The course seminar supports student-centered learning.",
                "The course is very well set up to guide you through writing the final paper and Professor Marcus makes himself very available to students. I appreciated the organization of the course and how reading/discussing primary sources each week prepared us to think critically about primary sources for our own paper. Overall, a very well organized course with a professor that cares about student learning and values student opinions."

                "Yes! The amount of reading may seem like a lot for someone not used to it and the final paper is long, but Professor Marcus really guides you through it and has a great structure in place to help. I not only learned a lot of historical content but learned how to read and analyze primary literature. Writing the final paper did not come easily but it feels so rewarding to have produced that work."
