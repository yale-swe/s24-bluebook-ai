                "Analyzing history far removed from my time and experience.",
                "This course gave me a general overview of ancient Greek and Roman history, the earliest political thought, and the development of the Abrahamic religions. The variety of texts and formats made me think about new (to me, but really old) ways to conceive of history and politics. And, although we didn't talk much about writing, it also helped me get used to the style of college essays.",
                "This class was a great opportunity to enhance critical writing and readings abilities. Certainly left course with a much better understanding of the relationship between history and politics and the influence of personal histories on our understanding of the concept and practice of history as we teach and learn it today.",

                "Well-organized curriculum and accompanying lectures. Biggest weakness is that the lectures are on Fridays, after all the corresponding seminars.",
                "Strengths: You get a sense of a long stretch of history and some of the major intellectual forces in the Western tradition, including religious ones. The lectures are amazing, even if they came too late in the week to really frame seminar discussions. Weaknesses: You move fast and aren't able to form a full, clear idea of one thinker before rushing to the next one. The historical readings have lots of little excerpts, so, for the continuity of the reading experience, I wonder if the assigned passages could involve less jumping around, even at the expense of certain moments.",
                "Strengths: Essay feedback; Pre-seminar questions; Professor Wilford clearly genuinely cares about each of her students and is always willing to set up office hours and go out of her way to help students.",
                "Strengths: Taking this course definitely makes you a much stronger writer, and the intensity of the reading load means that your time management becomes much better over the course of the semester."
