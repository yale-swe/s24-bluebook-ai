You learn how to challenge your own conceptions of wisdom, the self, attaining knowledge, suffering, and happiness, and be content and familiar with uncertainty and unanswerable questions. You perform a synthesis of wisdom literature across societies, religions, and cultures, and do this with the help of classmates with differing perspectives, extent of exposure to different philosophies, and religious and ethnic backgrounds.

                "Strengths: The structure of the course was excellent. Focusing on a different topic every one to two weeks kept the agenda engaging, novel, and exciting. It also felt like we were on a journey toward meaning and understanding. That trajectory made the course very fulfilling. The grading philosophy of the class was also very conducive to student learning and ownership of learning. \r\n\r\nPersonal opinion about one of the week topics: I did not particularly enjoy the readings for War/Strategery. I thought the topic seemed interesting in theory, but I felt a little unsatisfied with the way the readings connected to our as-developing conception of wisdom's relationship to happiness and suffering. All the other topics went over really well, though!",
                "The only strength I can think of is the selection of readings. Everything else, teaching, organization, grading, etc. has lots of room for improvement",
                "Some of this course's strengths include the breadth of sources we read and the discussion format. Still, I think additional reading into the historical context behind the philosophical texts we read might have facilitated a deeper understandings of the texts. Additionally, a more consistent schedule for readings would be helpful, as some weeks were much heavier than others."

                "Absolutely! To get the most out of this class, I suggest doing all of the readings! This is a class about analyzing texts and letting them guide cross-cultural philosophical questioning and analysis. Don't take this class just to get a writing credit, or because it seems 'easy'. It can be deeply meaningful if you put in the effort, sincere questioning, and listen attentively to your classmates and professor. This class will open your mind to the remarkable potential that comparative philosophical analysis has for understanding reality and human connection/happiness. I took it because I was dissatisfied with the purely Western philosophical approach of the major here, and this class absolutely satisfied my urge to reach beyond European male philosophers and logic systems.",
                "NO. It was disappointing. The professor is stubborn and likes a very particular style of commentary that is frustrating to grasp. I have taken multiple other literature classes and gotten good grades in them, but Prof Hunters grading style nitpicks at everything marginal and unimportant while missing the main points in my essays that are clearly stated. He asks how what I wrote relates to the main topic, when my commentary and the answer to his question is literally two lines below. In class, he begins multiple sentences with as a scholar of Chinese literature and clearly enjoys bathing in his status as a teacher at Yale. I did not feel welcome in the class environment and found my communication with him via email highly frustrating and unproductive. Further, while there is a flex week in the syllabus, Prof Hunter rejected every single idea students brought up and went with his own topic. The course style is restricting and it feels like we as students are repeatedly trying to figure out what Prof Hunter wants, rather than bringing in our own perspectives. The readings are well laid out and this course has so much potential, but in the state that its in right now, I cannot in good faith recommend this class to other students. Please consider other courses with teachers who appreciate diversity of thought and communicate clearly with students.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in sampling a wide range of ancient philosophical texts, but I would mention that prior knowledge of the historical contexts these texts were written in and/or the texts themselves aids in one's ability to understand each philosophy and perform well in the class."
