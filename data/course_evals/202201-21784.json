Concepts like comparative advantage have helped me make decisions in my own life, and the course has allowed me to better understand this dynamic economic moment that we're in. Also, as someone interested in politics, our study of Aggregate Supply\/Demand, monetary regimes and exchange, fiscal crises, monetary policy, and how to minimize deadweight loss in taxation has been extremely pertinent and useful. I now feel I can approach policy from a much more economically technical perspective. The insights gained from this course have encouraged me to take more economics in the future.",

                "The problem sets should have more flexible grading.",
                "At some point the lecture slides were a bit convoluted when compared to what he was saying in class.",
                "I would like more explanation during class, the professor sometimes glossed over subjects and going to office hours and section felt like a replacement for learning the material instead of strengthening my understanding of it",
                "The topics are interesting but it's very much a survey course and it always feels like you only touch on the surface of many ideas without really understanding any of them in depth. The course is very well organized and the course director, Prof Hawkins, does an amazing job at making resources and help readily available to us. In terms of organization, it's the best course i;ve taken at yale and it's thanks to Hawkins. The professor is nice and funny but always unclear and not too logical. slides are chaotic and not logically organized.",
                "Strengths: organized, engaging lectures, material is presented well\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: psets are graded very, very hard, and the TAs are often unavailable or unhelpful.  Office hours were virtual which made matters even worse.",
                "- this course was very well planned: the lecture summaries were very useful, and the Ed platform for questions was very helpful as well\r\n- Professor Tsyvinski made the lectures very funny and enjoyable.\r\n- weaknesses: none",
                "The course is organized very well and taught in an interesting and engaging way. I learned a lot from it, but some of the questions we were asked were very open-ended, with no answer that seemed right. The lectures were all taught well, but since the class was so big, it was normal to have interruptions or late starts that meant we got through less material then we could have.",
                "Professor was funny and kept class engaging even though the content was boring at times.",
                "I liked the content covered in this course, however, I was not always motivated to go to class since everything the teacher went over was directly on the slides so I could essentially teach myself the course at my own pace.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Very engaging professors\r\n- Mostly pretty thorough\r\n- Loved the worksheet + pset combo\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- A lot of emphasis on memorization: memorize the 4 things that make a good indicator. Memorize the authors of different econ studies. Memorize the steps of a recession. A lot of them are intuitive, but it very much felt like it was being graded for how well we could recite the way things were told to us in class, not the ideas behind them. \r\n- Sometimes the lectures went way to fast, other times they were a bit slow. Honestly I think one or two lectures could've been cut out and the rest could've been slowed down a little bit. \r\n- Some things needed more clarity. For instance, for the different ways to calculate GDP, there are a bunch of edge cases to deal with. It would've been very helpful to go through each of those cases and establish some rules, especially since those tricky edge cases were often tested in psets and exams. I occasionally felt like I was just kind of making things up and I wished they had been taught to us more clearly.",
                "so many resources to help such as office hours, section, ed",
                "Strengths: well-run. psets and worksheets that helped facilitate learning. bountiful office hours. good lectures with clear plans that we pretty much always got through. witty banter. lovable prof (Tsyvinski).\r\nWeaknesses: willingness to go on tangents. sometimes information in lecture wasn't going to be assessed, and so could be easier to zone out.",
                "Slides were a plus and problem sets\/assignments facilitated student learning, but could benefit from being more one-on-one",
                "Lectures were engaging and entertaining  really encouraged in-person attendance. Lecture material was sometimes dense and hard to follow, but help was available when needed. \r\n\r\nEdPuzzle and TFs were helpful in reinforcing concepts that I didn't understand in lecture. Interesting knowledge gained of macroeconomic concepts.",
                "Great structure and organization",
                "Professor Tsyvinski and Dr. Hawkins are the true strengths of this course. Even students who weren't macro-inclined really enjoyed the class because of Tsyvinski's humour, enthusiasm, and passion for macro.",
                "Strenghts: Professor Tsyvinski's humor and knowledge, Dr. Hawkins' knowledge and ability to handle all the logistics so well. The lecture topics were well structured and the Professor used good examples in his teaching. It was great that the course didn't only focus on the US but also on global economy too. Midterm feedback was great because that allowed the course to be improved within one semester. The section material and problems were very helpful and thus I think these sections were more helpful than the intro to micro sections.",
                "Sometimes the lectures were a little confusing.",
                "I thought that some of the lectures moved really fast towards the end. \r\n\r\nLoved the professor though and the psets and worksheets were very reasonable each week.",
                "There could be even more student engagement outside of the classroom  for example, a study hall was talked about but never materialized.",
                "Strengths: Extremely supportive structure (frequent office hours, Ed discussion board with live answers to questions during lectures, excellent email response rate, productive sections throughout the week, different materials to practice), a very humorous but informative lecturer who felt attached to the material because he drew from his own research and fields of expertise.\r\nWeaknesses: The speed at which some of the important material is covered to fit everything into an hour and fifteen minutes totally understandable but occasionally frustrating when we spend the beginning of class talking about less serious concepts.",
                "I enjoyed this class in large part because of the engaging style of the lecture, particularly the back and forth that occurred between Professor Tsyvinski and Dr. Hawkins. Regarding weaknesses, the only real thing that bothered me was that often, in order to get full credit on problem sets, it would be necessary to go to office hours, not to see if the answer I had was correct, but to clarify what the grading rubric expected us to include in our answers. At times, the problem set questions were a bit vague, especially in comparison with the specificity desired by the rubric.",
                "I think Professors Tsyvinski and Hawkins are the courses greatest strengths. It's macroeconomics, so some sections can naturally be a bit dry, but I think they helped make the class entertaining, and I think the use of Ed discussion board and the use of worksheets in addition to Psets were strengths.",
                "Taught in a really good way and lots of support for students",
                "The lectures weren't consistently solid, but Aleh was really engaging, and the combination of lectures, sections, p sets, office hours, the textbook and review sessions allowed you to master the material if you put in effort.",
                "Strengths: well-structured, well-designed class; engaging, funny lectures; incredible array of support for all questions\/needs\r\nWeaknesses: many questions on exams\/psets felt poorly designed\/ambiguously worded and could be reasonably argued both ways, but graders typically picked a single side and refused to budge",
                "Strengths: Professor Hawkins' organization is unmatched. Absolute frikin GOAT. Ed discussion board? EVERY LECTURE CLASS SHOULD HAVE THIS! Pset organization? GORGEOUS. Professor Tsyvinski is also hilarious.",
                "The strengths of this course are how applicable the concepts are to real life. Almost all of our topics and models could be applied to how the world works in terms of interest rates, employment, the money supply, the Fed, inflation, and a lot more. This made the course extremely interesting and relatable. The weaknesses of this course are that sometimes the concepts were reviewed quickly, so you'd need a lot of extra help at office hours and discussion section to fully understand them.",
                "Strengths: Ed platform was extremely helpful for clarification on Psets and lecture questions, lecture summaries were well-organized, and practice materials were made readily available to students\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures often feel extremely all over the place and present a confusing mix of high-level research and oversimplified concepts; challenging to decipher what content is relevant for exams until doing practice questions",
                "Interesting",
                "The course is pretty slow and the material would probably be very dry if you don't have an interest in macro econ. Professor Tsyvinski is this course's greatest strength. He would fill in the slow bits of class with jokes and anything else to increase engagement and it was clear he cared a lot about the material.",
                "This year due to Covid, lectures were all recorded, which was very helpful as a study tool or a way to not miss material if you missed lecture. However, it might have also been a bit of a weakness because it probably encouraged a lot of people, me included, to miss class and just watch the lecture online instead, which is definitely not as ideal as actually attending class. Tsyvinski and Hawkins were a strength of the class; I would definitely recommend taking the course with them if possible. Tsyvinski is really funny and makes the content interesting. Him and Hawkins form a great duo. Weakness I guess is the sheer size of the class but that can't really be helped.",
                "tsyvinsky and hawkin duo is really iconic, and makes class always super fun. class is really structured, with slides, summary, discussion section worksheet and answer, as well as 5 past exams listed. it's really easy to study for this class because of the organization. the weakness is sometimes the pset felt a little subjective, and even if you check it with the TFs, it might be wrong",
                "The course is very well organized and I could go on about wonderful aspects for while (lecture summaries, sections, the humor, etc.), but there are two important things that really need to change. Firstly, the textbook is, at many points, entirely inconsistent with the lectures, sometimes to the point of complete contradiction. This caused some real trouble and should be remedied. Secondly, the lectures were often unorganized; it was sometimes unclear what the Professor was talking about. This could be rectified by starting with a lecture outline and showing where we are as we move through the lecture. Also, it would be great for the Professor to draw the diagrams and work through math live during the lecture to show the process (as was done in Econ 115) instead of just printing everything on the slides.",
                "He tried a lot to be make jokes and keep things interesting which I thought was nice. But he also spoent a lot of time on his own research which I didn't think pertained to the class as much.",
                "Tsyvisnki and Hawkins are great; I love their chemistry. The topics covered are interesting and valuable for understanding daily politics and news. Ed discussion is excellent. The course is well put together, with a clear syllabus and help forums (ed discussion). I have never seen a class this organized.",
                "Lectures were very interesting and the information was taught well - only feedback would be to make lecture material reflect exam material more",
                "One of the biggest strengths of this course is the extensive support available to students, from the Ed discussion board to the abundance of peer tutor and office hour sessions each week. The course was also very well organized. I found the one page summaries that were posted after each lecture particularly helpful in helping me understand what information I should focus on when studying for the midterms or final.",
                "Lectures and their slides are difficult to quickly apply to P-set questions, although everything is very organized, ED discussion board was extremely helpful.",
                "Professor Hawkins ensures that the course is very organized, which is incredible. Additionally, I thought Professor Tsyvinski had interesting and engaging lectures. The worksheets and sections helped students stay on top of the material. However, I felt that the problem sets and tests sought to trick students rather than test conceptual understanding.",
                "Going over core material in section better rather than just examples.",
                "I think the course was very well taught for a large lecture based course. I think at time the pace in lectures moved a bit too fast and I was unable to follow and process everything that was being said\/displayed.",
                "The lectures are very chill and entertaining, but they don't seem directly applicable to the problem set and exam material. The grading in this class is very harsh on problem sets and exams.",
                "Strengths: Incredibly well-taught. The best-organized class I've had at Yale, with fascinating material and focus on key insights gained from using macroeconomics to understand the world.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes lectures were taught very quickly, but this wasn't often and it was helpful to have the lecture slides, recording, and summary to review.",
                "The strengths of this course were the two professors. A weakness would be the amount of content that we were not tested on prior to the final.",
                "I liked how many resources this class gave. There were a lot of ways in which you could get help to better understand the material.",
                "Strength: lecture summaries, extremely organized\r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes the class touches on too many things and doesn't explain them in detail",
                "I think a strength of this course was the office hours and Peer Tutors. Specifically, Grace Miller was an amazing peer tutor and I don't think I would have gotten through the course without her. I also found the lectures engaging and entertaining, although sometimes they were slightly too fast and hard to follow.",
                "I cannot think of any weaknesses. The primary strength is how engaging Aleh is.",
                "Strengths: access to help\r\nWeaknesses: harsh pset grading",
                "This course was very, very well organized. It was incredibly easy to follow, and the course materials and resources were all very helpful. One drawback is that the course material all seemed to be very rudimentary - I wish there had been more opportunities for further optional study in specific areas for those who were interested in learning more.",
                "The way the class was taught was very good.",
                "The structure of this class was phenomenal. We knew exactly what to study and what we were going to be evaluated on and the worksheets were extremely helpful in testing our knowledge.",
                "It was enjoyable. Great teaching and helpful peer tutors",
                "Strenghts: interesting topics. weaknesses: sometimes the lectures were unclear",
                "More practice problems and practical examples during the lectures",
                "Prof Aleh is a great professor who is well versed in macroeconomics and very engaging for students. Applications to real world economic events and research also make lectures more interesting.",
                "-Strengths: so many resources \r\n-Weaknesses: size",
                "It had great organization but sometimes moved fast.",
                "Professor Tsyvinski and Dr. Hawkins were very well-versed with the material. Dr. Hawkins went above and beyond for course management duties.",
                "Strengths: very organized, information is clear",
                "I really loved the lecturesTsyvinski and Hawkins were great. Lecture slides were created with extreme care. Sometimes, it was difficult to see connection between topics.",
                "Strengths: gave students a strong, fact-based foundation in macroeconomics. The old exams provided as a resource were very helpful in understanding the material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: problem sets were not very good preparation for the exams and often asked about material that were stated not to be on the exams during lecture. Certain broad economic claims were made like institutions are the fundamental cause of growth that I believe lack some nuance. The evidence provided in class supported that it was one of the, and possibly the most important, cause of growth. But I did not see the evidence as completely discounting the other factors from having any affect. Some of the grading (especially on problem sets) came down to semantics and whether students used specific buzz words. If a student answered a question correctly and implied a certain fact when answering the question that the said students must say, the student would often get points off on the question for their wording of the answer. I know this because I know students who worked together on the problem sets and had the same answers, but got different problem set scores because of wording which seems unfair to me.",
                "There were really no glaring weaknesses of this course. Everything was well organized and the teaching was fine. It improved a lot at the end of the semester, I felt because we werent rushing over the last parts of the lectures, or, if we were, the reviews at the beginning of the following lecture made up for it.",
                "Strengths - all lectures are recorded so can review them before exam.",
                "Building a better connection between the different lectures, at least in the second half of the course",
                "The lectures are very well taught and engaging; I enjoyed attending them albeit they were sometimes fast paced, so you may find yourself reviewing the slides often. Also, Ed and office hours were great resources and the professors do everything to make sure you understand the content fully.",
                "V good it was recorded",
                "The course was structured very well and the content was extremely interesting. There were no weaknesses",
                "The strengths of this class included the lectures. At times, the psets felt beyond what was covered in the lectures.",
                "It was a great course with very fun professor.",
                "good professor",
                "I think there is a little discrepancy between the course director and the lecturer.",
                "Strength of course in the relationship between the Tsyvinski and Hawkins; they delegated tasks well and organized a great course. Sometimes the slides went quite quickly",
                "The course was well planned and structured, the lectures were comprehensive and well paced. In the beginning, sometimes there was a lack of examples, but the professor included more towards the end.",
                "Absolutely elite course. Tsyvinski and Hawkins are the best. Covers a lot of topic material, graded fairly, and definitely feel like I learned a lot.",
                "I thought the sections were a strength of this course, as well as the many office hours that were offered almost every day of the week.",
                "Love the professors who run the course; some of the best at Yale. My only downside would be the lectures felt a little long and a 5 minute strwaching break in them would've helped a lot.",
                "very organized course with great professor",
                "The professors are excellent and the lectures were engaging. The homeworks were graded extremely harshly, office hours were necessary (and sometimes still not enough)",
                "Strengths: professor, engaging lecturer, lecture summary sheets, practice materials\r\nWeaknesses: organization (it was sometimes unclear how different topics connected to each other)",
                "Lectures were good but some topics were very obscure and the answers werent always super clear",
                "I thought that this was an incredibly well-run course. Ed was a very helpful website, and most of the time, if I had a question about old exam questions, it had already been answered on Ed by William Hawkins or by a TF. The course was very well-organized. I found that there were lots of office hours and opportunities for me to receive the help that I needed. I also really liked having both a worksheet and a pset every week, because the worksheet allowed me to work on problems until I got them right and this really helped me learn the concepts. \r\n\r\nI also thought Professor Tsyvinski and Professor Hawkins were amazing! Professor Tsyvinski was a very engaging and clear professor with great comedic timing. I appreciated how he would signpost during lectures and give us an overview regarding what was important to know for each lecture. I also thought the summaries posted to Canvas regarding what we should know from the slides were super helpful when it came to prepping for exams. The review sessions for this class for exams were also so great --- especially William's and John Finlay's were very clear.\r\n\r\nLastly, I absolutely wanted to RAVE about Grace Miller who is one of the peer tutors. She singlehandedly helped me do well in this course --- her review sessions for the exam were literally game-changing. She explained topics so clearly and so effectively, and was able to breeze through lots of material in a short amount of time. I also attended many of her office hours sessions to get help on my Psets. Grace always asked us questions and her office hour sessions were like a very interactive section meeting. Please promote Grace and hire her forever, she is incredible and is one of the best teachers I've ever had (not even being hyperbolic here; Grace is that good!).",
                "Strengths: the class is well organized and assignments are clear and easy to find. Lots of office hours and resources if you need help. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The professor often has to move quickly during lecture so taking notes can be difficult. Sometimes it is hard to know what information is important from the lectures since he moves so fast.",
                "Strengths: TFs are helpful during office hours, especially when tackling some of the more difficult Pset questions; review sessions with Dr. Hawkins are very useful; Ed Discussion is generally useful|| Weaknesses: exam questions can sometimes be a bit frustrating; the final grades are more or less determined just by exam scores, which can be frustrating since the range of scores on these exams is so narrow that the difference between an A- and a B can feel like two mc questions",
                "The content material was very engaging and applicable to daily life. I believe that the course provides essential knowledge about economics that everyone should have. However, the exams and problem set questions, especially the true false questions were very nuanced and nitpicky. At times they were overly specific in the required responses. The format of these assignments made the class much less enjoyable. Perhaps there was a disconnect between the course director and lecturer.",
                "The lectures moved very fast and left little time to fully comprehend the material before new material was introduced.",
                "Strengths: well organized, professor is great and super funny, a lot of resources to help you out, good foundation, applicable\r\nWeaknesses: prof does go very fast and he puts in a lot of information on the slides (though one page summaries with the most important information are posted)",
                "Professor Tsyvinski was the biggest strength by far.",
                "There are a lot of resources for this course, which is really nice. I think the course could go over some of the more important things at a slower pace.",
                "Great course instructors, fun lecturesvery well organized",
                "It was very well organized. No clear weaknesses",
                "strengths: section & all the practice available\r\nweaknesses: lecture is extremely unorganized and hard to follow",
                "N\/A, I thought the course was very well done!",
                "The way its taught sucks nothing makes sense",
                "Less problem sets",
                "I'd say it really had no weaknesses. I genuinely looked forward to attending the lecture because Dr.Hawkins and Professor Tsyvinski made the class so enjoyable and the slides were always concise, and straight to the point of what the topic was for that day. I'd say one of the greatest strengths aside from the professors themselves was the lecture summaries made available on Canvas before each class. It served as a kind of checklist to verify that you had understood the content for that day and provided further resources if you found that you hadn't. Office hours were really accessible too and the TAs were extremely helpful. 10\/10 class for sure! Definitely recommend. Also, follow @econpets on IG!",
                "Class is really well organized. Grades were given back quickly. Lecturer was really fun (well as fun as it can get to learn intro macro).",
                "Strengths: Tsyvinski and Hawkins are a great pair, and with the TFs and ULAs help on EdStem and office hours, the class runs pretty nicely. The class has fun moments and is also very well organized. There are lots of practice exams to use to prepare. Weaknesses: some topics we only cover for one lecture and feel one-off or rushed.",
                "Strengths: Stuent-Professor engagement was excellent. There were many different ways to ask questions throughout the course and all of them were answered effectively by the two professors.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "The organization of the course was spectacular. The sections were helpful, all the files were well organized, the resources and office hours were bountiful. Overall spectacular course. Well done by the course directors and professors.",
                "I think one of the strengths was proving the resources from the lectures on Canvas, and this is based on one of the weaknesses of the course, which was that all the necessary information from lecture could not be absorbed in the lecture alone, and necessitated the use of outside time and effort. The lectures themselves sped through material that required more time and attention, which resulted to that time and attention being spent outside of the classroom.",
                "The lectures could be more structured.",
                "This course is well taught, especially with the 1-page summaries of what we needed to know. I liked the extensive office hour schedule and study material from past exams as well. Perhaps make section mandatory so more people show up.",
                "Good course that is well organized. More supplemental resources should be provided to give students a deeper understanding, because the textbook and lectures sometimes only give a surface level explanation",
                "Strengths:\r\n- interesting case studies, examples and economic concepts to focus on\r\n- well-structured and chronological \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- sometimes the exam questions seemed to measure qualities other than subject proficiency",
                "Great course thought the exams were pretty fair.",
                "It could be improved with lecture style and including more walkthrough examples.",
                "Hard course to understand if you're not engaged.",
                "I thought that the worksheets were very helpful to my learning. A weakness could be that the problem sets were on material that felt like we covered a very long time ago, making it difficult to remember the material.",
                "I think the lectures for this course were fairly engaging, though it was sometimes unclear what information was important and what wasn't. Since there was always extraneous information presented in lecture, it felt like we sometimes could have spent a little more time on key course concepts than we did.",
                "The lectures for this course were very engaging. Professor Tsyvinski and Hawkins were a funny duo and entertaining to watch while explaining the material quite well. The material was well organized and section\/lecture summaries and class materials were very helpful for me to understand the content. Some weakness of the course were that the problem sets did not also align well with the lecture material and felt very different from the type of questions we were asked on the exams. Also, although the lecture summaries were helpful, it was not always super clear what content was important to know since lots was always happening in lecture.",
                "Great lectures and good professor.",
                "Stronger sections, there was a disconnect at times between the class and the TF's\/",
                "Incredible professors (both Tysvinski and Hawkins are hilarious and make the lectures entertaining), lots of resources (class summaries, recordings, review sessions, Ed discussion board). The one improvement is that because there are so many resources, sometimes it can be hard to know which ones to actually use. The one page summaries are a MUST! I would look at them before the class and definitely study the statistics on them for multiple choice questions.",
                "Grading problem sets too harshly\/unevenly",
                "strength: great organization to facilitate learning process - in both teaching material and feedback loop.",
                "The lectures were fun to watch and the material was presented quite clearly. Sections were quite dull, however - I very rarely attended.",
                "Review sessions for exams werent very helpful. The content shouldnt be separated like it was for the review sessions. The lectures were great and sections were too. Good assignments too.",
                "Strength - lots of materials for study accessible. \r\nWeaknesses - hard for me, personally, to concentrate during lecture.",
                "This course does what it sets out to do very well, and as such I think I dont have much to say. One weakness may be that sometimes the grading rubrics are too strict",
                "Hard to stay engaged in the course and found myself often not going to class and only watching recordings",
                "The class is great, the professor is great, but because lectures are recorded, I often felt very unmotivated to go to class. Taking away this option could be beneficial.",
                "the course material is extremely broad, but i'm not sure if this can be changed because it's an intro course -- a strength of the class is definitely the clarity of what material we need to know",
                "The weakness of this course is probably the lecture environment; there is often little engagement and a lot of distraction. However, the strength of this course, the TF's immediately solve this problem when you go in for section.",
                "Strengths: organization, teaching, office hours\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lack of connection between topics",
                "Worksheets were incredible helpful. PSET length was also just right. Moving forward, keep Ed discussion and PT\/OF hours over Zoom. Maybe create a more accessible way to see\/know when\/where PT\/OF hours are. \r\nKeep Tsyvinski and Hawkins together!! Power duo!!",
                "One of the weaknesses is that sometimes Problem Sets feel as though they require an understanding of the material much greater than that supported by the depth of the lectures. This is exacerbated by the fact the course covers an inordinate amount of material.",
                "This course is incredibly well organized. In the words of Prof. Tsyvinski, Dr. Hawkins is a \"machine of administrative efficiency.\" Lots of resources are available to students, including the one-page lecture summaries, which were very helpful as I was reviewing for the final exam. I also liked that we started with a discussion of long-term economic growth before moving into the business cycle stuff. While it's perhaps an unusual way to structure an Intro Macro course, I think it helps to dispel the notion that Macro is just about stocks and recessions, and introduces important and deep concepts about economic growth and its relationship to quality of life early on. I also really liked that there were some lectures that focused on specific issues, like the rise of China or climate change, to show how to apply some of the theoretical principles we had been learning.",
                "I dind't like that it had a remote option.",
                "I feel like there were strengths in the relationship between professors, and I felt like Section was extremely helpful (unlike in Econ 115). It was a good combo of fun and academics. I feel like a weakness could be the way that the test was designed and how the multiple-choice was weighted (ie. if you got half of it right, you would still get 0 points). It felt very SAT style, where even if I felt like I knew the material before, I felt extremely discouraged due to the format of the test (not necessarily the material).",
                "This course was so well structured. There was immense support and Dr. HAWKINS is a legend. I wish Professor Tsyvinskis lectures had fewer words on the slides.",
                "The problem sets (unlike some courses) genuinely contributed to grasping and understanding new material. The worksheets provided practice with relevant calculations and a very welcome grade buffer.  The lecture summaries were very beneficial, sometimes explaining content which was unclear after attending class. The slides used in class themselves were disorganized and often detracted from my understanding. The textbook was wordy and dense- I feel the class could be improved by either heavily revising this book or by using a standard macroeconomics textbook. I felt the assessments (especially due to the number of multiple choice) were more difficult than was appropriate for an introductory course which was taught in such a jovial manner.",
                "The professor kept lectures engaging, and I would say that there weren't any major weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: engaging lecturers! Weaknesses: sometimes moved a bit fast and hard to keep up",
                "The excellent instructors are the best part of this course. Prof. Tsyvinski is an engaging lecturer and explains concepts very well. Dr. Hawkins is also an excellent instructor- his posts on Ed are especially clear, helpful and informative!",
                "love how organized canvas",
                "The strength of the class was most definitely the professor, Professor Tsavinsky, who organized the lectures in such a way that it was fun to learn the material and provided a wide array of real-life examples of the material of each lecture before each class. There was also a great amount of resources available to all students.",
                "More engagement with what's currently going on in the world.",
                "I liked the real world applications that were mentioned in class because it provided a more concrete understanding to both real world issues and how theories at hand apply. I also loved the econpets featured!",
                "I think the manner of examination in this course could be improved. Rather than quizzing us on recalling very specific information, I think the students would benefit more from being tested on our understanding of the specifics and nuances of the models we are taught. The current structure rewards binge watching lectures right before the exam, as opposed to attending lectures and gradually building up a conceptual mastery. I would recommend shifting towards more of an essay-based\/LAQ style exam as opposed to a short answer, T\/F, and MCQ style.",
                "The course started off a bit rocky for me as the content differed a lot from the AP exam. I would make that clear in the syllabus. After I figured that out, I started doing much better. Also, it would have been nice if the psets were due at midnight. For those of us who had practice, we could not go to office hours to get help on Friday.",
                "Strengths: Course was, unsurprisingly, very well structured, and loved how lectures were recorded to allow for some flexibility. Additionally, lecture summaries were really helpful in review period and going over those in addition to the posted lecture slides and my notes helped to learn a lot of the content in a short period of time before the final.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the first midterm was a little too early, and in general i think there was a little too much new content between midterm 2 and the final exam (i think delaying both midterms so that number of lectures covered before each exam is more similar would be amazing).",
                "The strengths of this course is the amount of resources available for students. It is a well structured class with very efficient access to resources and help of all kind. The weaknesses is the slides presented in class; they are often not clear and have many grammatical errors. The professor often rushes certain topics that are necessary, and go off on a tangent on things that are not necessary, and it is often hard to tell what we would be tested on. The exams also often have questions on facts that are way too specific (ex: which thing was covered in which lecture), and questions that have extremely ambiguous answers (ex: the answer could be true and false).",
                "The bond between Professor Tsyvinski and Professor Hawkins was wonderful, and the anecdotes and personal discussions made lecture fun and interesting, and also helped me remember concepts better. I had a great time in every lecture and was genuinely excited to go to class. The concepts were explained clearly and relatively slowly for the most part, and I feel like both the professor and course director really wanted us to succeed. \r\n\r\nOne weakness is that the problem set questions sometimes felt a  bit like trick questions that weren't assessing our actual in-class learning as much as they were assessing our ability to read the question carefully and figure out what it really meant. The midterms also had many small facts that we had to know, which was slightly annoying to try to study for.",
                "As students we had ample resources to learn the material, multiple psets, published lecture slides, and TF\/peer tutor office hours.",
                "I thought that this course was really strong.",
                "The professor and course manager are two of the best educators I have ever encountered. The only weakness was that the worksheets did not really help my learning.",
                "Exposes you to a lot of macroeconomic topics, but the topics are covered to a very minimal degree",
                "Aleh was a strength of this course for sure - he is pretty amusing and engages students well even if that means he goes immensely off topic in the best way possible. Aleh and William's interactions made this course. William the course director steers Aleh back on track and runs the Ed with insane efficiency. I think a lecture connecting the different models and things in the course could have been helpful. Also breaking down what the lecture is covering, signposting and summarising is always very helpful.  \r\nPsets felt a little pedantic at times - some of the questions felt like they were not useful in the long run.",
                "The teacher explained everything in a concise manner. He was also very funny which made it easier to engage with the course content. I was excited to go to lectures every class because of that. He also took the course evaluation seriously and implemented every change students suggested.",
                "Strengths: Professor Tsyvinski and Professor Hawkins are AWESOME; lecture summaries; clear communication; frequent review sessions; helpful and free textbook; interesting subject matter and connection to Professor's research and real world. Weaknesses: You really have to do the problemsets, section problems, and read the txtbk to be able to do well on the exams because the material in lecture is largely broad concepts. If you don't do the problems outside of class, you won't know how to apply it; a lot of success on the class is based on economic \"intuition\"; sometimes correct answers seem a bit arbitrary or there are multiple answers since all of these macroeconomic issues have nuance; little class participation (except for Expert on Everything)- more class participation could be better",
                "stregnths: outreach and multiple ways to learn\r\n\r\nweaknesses: wish there was more textook correlation",
                "I think this was a good course overall, and it's tough to make it more personal with so many students. I think the lectures were engaging, but I think not knowing our grades on our exams was frustrating.",
                "Strengths- it is very inclusive. Professor Alex would use international examples for us to understand the course content. This made it interesting. \r\nDr Hawkins ran his section very well. He was focused on making us understand the content intuitively which improved my understanding of economics as a whole. The two are a great duo!"

If you don't plan on studying economics, this is still a good course for you to get introduced to a lot of different topics to see if you'll be interested, and even if you aren't, a lot of it is applicable to everyday life.",
                "Yes if you are considering the econ major.",
                "Yes, it was an interesting course and taught useful things for economics.",

                "Yes, even if you are not looking to major in economics, this course gives a strong foundation of the basics of macroeconomics",
                "Sure. I mean you're probably taking it as a requirement for some econ track, so I doubt you're reading these reviews. But if you are, it's a fun class. Would recommend having\/making friends in the class, so they can all mooch off your psets (looking at you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, and you  you know who you are).

                "Yes! I'd recommend it to anyone",
                "Yes, this course teaches students the basics of macro economy and how the economy works in real life. Interesting international examples, learning about past and current economy.",
                "Yes! Intro macro covers a lot.",
                "Yes, I would. It provides you with a basic understanding of the essentials of macroeconomics which are fundamental in explaining many phenomena regardless of your major or career choice.",

I think the insights themselves are important if you're planning on going into any field that in any way relates to the macroeconomy, and I think that taking the class with Professors Tsyvinski and Hawkins is an especially good idea. The banter between the two definitely makes the class much more enjoyable and entertaining.",

                "Very cursory foundation to macroeconomics, would recommend placing into intermediate if possible",
                "I would say this course is more useful than microeconomics, especially if you're not an econ major. I understand that it's not a QR credit, but the things I learned here are so much more applicable to my everyday life and understanding of how the world works. Like, I can watch and understand \"The Big Short\" now because of Prof. Tsyvinski's lectures. Every student should have an understanding of how the economy works and why we have things like recessions. It just makes you a more informed citizen, and equips you with the weapons to fight people on Facebook who blame everything money related on the president.",
                "Yes; This course is extremely applicable and interesting. I didn't like learning about microeconomics at all, so I assumed I wasn't going to like this class because I realized I didn't like economics, but this course is extremely applicable to my life and changed how I view a lot of things in my life. Def recommend to someone who wants to know more about macroeconomics in terms of inflation, interest rates, employment, labor supply and demand, and such.",
                "Yes, but it can be dull. The content is interesting, but some topics are dry and challenging to understand.",
                "Yes because its a good class",
                "If you're interested in macro econ, then this is a good course for you. Lectures are pretty slow and not math oriented, so if you want something faster paced, take intermediate. I was on the fence about this course until I heard Professor Tsyvinski lecture. He brings so much enthusiasm that I couldn't say no to the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to others if they are really interested in economics going into the class, and if Tsyvinski is teaching it. If you're not really invested in the course material, the class is still good but it's very easy to not be very engaged, which happened to me later in the semester. Because the class is so big, and section is optional, the responsibility is really on the student to make sure they stay engaged and keep up with the class. If a student is willing and capable of doing that, I would definitely recommend. If not, maybe try to get into one of the intro macro seminars.",
                "Yes. it's nice to know how the economic system works roughly, and this class is a great intro. it's also really fun because of the instructors.",
                "Yes - great intro. Aleh is awesome and made going to lecture really fun!",
                "Take this course. It is SO worth it. This course is a foundation for life as a productive member of society, even if you have no further interest in economics. It will challenge you and cause you to think about things in a new way. Best course of my freshman year.",

                "Yes.",
                "If you have already taken macroeconomics, it might be a good idea to skip to intermediate. A lot of random topics were taught because the professor has research in the field, and it could be skipped by not taking introductory.",
                "Absolutely! A great introduction to macroeconomics and relevant to almost any field. Super well-taught, interesting, and also a fun class!",

                "Yep",
                "Yes, it should be taken by everyone. It gives great insight into a lot of the Econ behind policy.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student if they were pursuing a major in or related to economics.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to all students at Yale.",
                "yes, good insight into macro world and very applicable content",

                "Yes, I would. The professor and the course material were engaging and useful.",
                "For sure. You should really take this course (of course if you're an econ major) if you're interested in anything in the social sciences. Very well taught and you'll learn a lot. Hawkins is an absolutely incredible section leader. He cares tremendously about making sure his students understand what is happening, and he complements the lectures extremely well.",
                "100%, if someone wanted to learn the basics of how the world of money works, this would be an excellent course for them, or for someone who wants to become an Econ. major.",
                "yes!",
                "No, they need to fix the terrible rubrics and homeworks. You can completely understand the material and get 70-80% consistently.",
                "Yes, the lectures were engaging and interesting. Professor Tsyvinski made the course content relevant to the students with interesting examples. He also connected these topics to Nobel Prize winners and his current research which was fascinating.",
                "I would recommend. Professor Tyvinski and Dr. Hawkins are both amazing",

                "Yes, if you want a basic understanding of economics.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone who wants a solid introduction to macroeconomics (and to be honest, these are concepts that everyone should understand to some degree); just be prepared to study and put in the work for exams\/psets.",
                "Yes, as it provides essential knowledge about economics that is useful in the real world, no matter what field you will find yourself in. The lecturer and course director are brilliant economic researchers and provide insight and knowledge that you will really only get at Yale. While the exams and problem sets can be a bit nuanced and specific, the course is still worth it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because everything we learned was very interesting and relevant to the world.",
                "Yes, great macro foundation - taught me way more than AP macro; overall a class that definitely left me feeling like I learned valuable ideas",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed the material",
                "100%. Excellent course with very relevant content.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in learning about the economy on a broad scale this is a great course.",
                "Yes! Its fun and you learn a great basis for macroeconomics.",
                "Sure, it was a pretty good class. I took it as a non-economics (or related fields) major, and I still found parts of it interesting and good to know.",
                "Yes. The course is very engaging and you will learn a lot.",
                "Yes learnt a lot",
                "10\/10 YES!! I loved this course. If you've taken AP Macro in high school, don't think that you will know everything though. I definitely learned a lot outside of the AP Macro curriculum from this class.",
                "Yes, I can now engage with economic news that I couldn't understand a semester before. Tsyvinski is a great professor that uses his curiosity in several research topics to make for some interesting lectures. He and Hawkins form a power duo of humorous and well-organized instruction.",
                "Yes. Great for learning about the world economically and how countries interact with one another.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who needs to take it, as well as to anyone who is interested in global and domestic markets as well as the workings of the economy.",
                "I would! Tsyvinski\/Hawkins were a great duo for this course.",
                "Yes. Very good core understanding of the macro economy",
                "To students interested in a QR credit or simply with an interest in economics, yes. I would recommend this subject perhaps more than micro because I do think it was less math-intensive and more concept-oriented.",
                "Yes for sure! Important to know for anyone going into any field.",
                "Yes, it is a great entrance course to many classes in the future.",
                "Sure.",
                "Yes if you need it for your major, otherwise I would say to not take it.",
                "Yes, even if you're not an econ major, the content helps with general economic fluency (understanding inflation, interest rates, central banking, etc.).",
                "I would recommend this course with Professor Tsyvinski and Hawkins. The lectures are very engaging and the workload is very manageable. Great intro to Macroeconomics.",
                "yes",
                "Yes if you want to learn econ basics.",
                "Yes, if you are planning on majoring on econ. It doesnt provide the non-major with much, unless you really want to get a feel for market health indicators.",
                "Yes if your interested in it - try to take it with Tsyvinski and Hawkins",
                "Yes, good to know and has real world applications and relevance",
                "yes, an engaging, well-delivered class on important and applicable material.",
                "Yes, 100% would recommend. As for as lecture classes go, this one has been my favorite. Aleh and William have a wonderful rapport and the content itself is interesting and applicable to many fields.",
                "Yes. Great prof and excellent material.",
                "Yes, its great for understanding the economy.",
                "Yea, if Dr Hawkins is a part of the faculty",
                "Yes, the professor is fantastic, and the skills are valuable, but if youre not interested in econ, dont take it.",
                "yes, if they are interested in econ",
                "I probably would, as I think it does a good job of explaining the economic concepts that many people hear but do not yet understand.",
                "Yes. While I sometimes struggled to see the connections between the topics we studied, I felt like this class gave me a strong foundation in macroeconomics that would be useful to future students.",
                "Yes! Tsyvinski and Hawkins are a power duo. They make lectures fun, engaging, and memorable. The class had inside jokes that Tsyvinski would make at least once in class. Hawkins also had jokes. It was my favorite class this semester. Hawkins' discussion section and review sessions were the most helpful.",
                "Yes. I loved the class and the Professor",
                "I would, but I would recommend they be rather diligent in reading lecture slides before, attending office hours, et c. The professors do not make it easy to succeed without reaching out for substantial help beyond course hours (which, of course, is unfair but is the reality of many intro courses).",
                "I think everyone should take this course, even if they have no interest in economics (which they should). Macroeconomics is directly relevant to all of the most pressing issues of the day, like climate change, and provides a great theoretical toolkit for analyzing them.",
                "Definitely.",
                "Yes I would because I felt like I grew a lot from it. Yes, it was challenging and I didn't get an A, but it was ultimately very rewarding.",
                "Yes. It is a great preparatory course for more economics courses and it provides a good foundation for global understandings.",
                "If you are interested in economics and in understanding the financial world around you, I would recommend this class. Most of the material was relevant outside of an academic setting, especially the topics covered in the last few weeks (interest rates, exchange rates, asset pricing). Though understanding the more complicated subjects will require a substantial amount of review and studying, the teacher (Aleh Tsyvinski) is highly entertaining and makes even the most dull subjects fun.",
                "only if necessary",
                "I would recommend this to anyone with a slight interest in macroeconomics.",
                "Yes- great professors and good foundation in econ",
                "Yes! Would recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about \"how the economy works\" and how government policy affects the economy.",
                "yes",
                "I would definitely recommend this course for any Yale student, especially as a prerequisite and QR credit.",
                "Yes!",
                "I didn't come away from the course particularly wanting to study economics more, but I don't feel that it was a waste of time.",
                "Yes I would because it provides foundational knowledge in macroeconomics that are very useful for everyday life from just personal finance lessons to understanding real world issues",
                "I would take it if you are interested in Poli sci, econ, global, etc. But not if you are not interested in this.",
                "Yes, I would tell them it is not in line with the AP but that it is a good intro to economics.",
                "If you are interested in the social sciences or humanities, yes. Because it is an introductory course, it is very much manageable even if you have never had prior exposure to the subject. However, i do think a lot of the knowledge is a little specific at some points, so i would not recommend it for someone looking for a distribution requirement.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! This course is very well organized and there is a lot of support for students. It is a great introductory economics course, and even thought it is a large lecture, it really feels like you get to know the professor\/course director.",
                "Yes, I would. The course was very well structured and easy to follow along.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course because I think it is a manageable but (seemingly) comprehensive view into macroeconomics that is well-taught, students are well-supported through a variety of resources, and the subject-matter is intriguing.",
                "Yes, it gives you a very good economic foundation.",
                "Yes, helpful to learn about macroeconomics.",
                "yes, it is a fairly low-stress way of learning macroeconomics in a very short space of time and gaining an insight into a very broad area. I now understand financial terms and articles slightly better. It is also a good atmosphere in lecture and generally pretty engaging.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This has been my funnest class at Yale so far.",
                "Yes! Every student should take macroeconomics at Yale- doing so is essential to being an informed citizen. In my summer internship, my macroeconomics knowledge has come in quite handy even though the internship is politically-focused. This course has changed the whole way I think, for the better. And while it was challenging (I found the tests and material quite difficult), this made it rewarding. I enjoyed the course material and found it much more difficult than microeconomics.",
                "of course! it is essential for any citizen of a government to learn how they play a role in our society economically",
                "Yes. If they want to learn this content, this is a good class.",
                "Yes. It changed my way of viewing events in the world"
