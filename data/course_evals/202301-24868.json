                "Strengths: The course material is super interesting, and changed my perspective on how computer science can be used. The exercises are really useful for getting a coding perspective of the more theoretical material covered in lectures, and it was fun and satisfying being able to see the cool results. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class is a bit hard for those with a weaker mathematical and machine learning background. I had taken linear algebra a couple years ago, so I was quite rusty on a couple of topics, which made it harder to follow along in certain parts of lecture. I would definitely recommend doing a refresher on linear algebra before taking the course, and if possible, learning a little about machine learning beforehand.",
                "I think the class could have benefitted from having tests. Personally, the way that I am really able to learn stuff is by studying for an exam. The class had super interesting topics but it was hard for me to force myself to sit down and really learn them since it didn't really matter to do well in the class.",
                "really like the part which relates how deep learning origins from the traditional CV concepts",
                "Strengths: very organized, Professor Wong tailor each lecture to what students want to learn",
                "Strengths: Great Lecture! and Great Assignments! \r\nWeakness: The workload will be a little too much",
                "Strengths: Prof. Wong is one of the best professors in the CS department I have had. After taking many other Yale deep learning and machine learning classes, Prof Wong is the only professor that has emphasized and explained the intuition and purpose behind each concept. Even though the lectures can get technical and are quite thorough, he makes sure you dont get lost in unimportant details and guides you through the technical parts in a easy way to understand.",
                "I really enjoyed the direct applicability between the class content, the way assignments were structured, and my own personal projects. All assignments felt very practical and focused on modern engineering. Even when dealing with complex tensor math, nothing in class felt too abstracted from the results. We always got course content paired with direct and exciting examples of what was being working on in the industry and I felt that my own engineering horizons were greatly broadened as to what I could comfortably approach in computer vision, data science, and machine learning.",
                "Strengths: Professor Wong is an incredible lecturer.\r\nWeaknesses: The mathematical basis can be challenging, especially if you havent taken linear algebra/machine learning before."

                "I would! It's definitely a challenge, and I would strongly advise against going in without a linear algebra background, as I foolishly did. But overall I recommend it.",
                "Yes. This was one of my favorite CS courses taken here at Yale, and this class gave me so many great tools to use in the future. I'm really happy about how much I've been able to learn from this class and even now after taking it, I'm excited to find out what else I can do with what I've learned. It's a cool class with a really nice professor.",

By the end of the course you'll have a great understanding of the practical implementations of computer vision in your own engineering projects. The course doesn't get incredibly deep into pytorch, but you'll get past all of the initial confusion and know where to go next.",
