                "I learned a lot of 'what' journalism stuff happens, but not necessarily 'why' it does. I also learned a lot of journalism-related fun facts (ex. did you know the reason why The Daily's production quality is so high is that they recruited radio broadcasting professionals?). \r\nPerhaps my biggest takeaway from this class is having developed a more critical lens on journalism altogether. I'm far more aware of the immense disservice and damage that news coverage often does for social crises and advocacy issues. This is not to say that journalists should spin their coverage to present such issues in a more favorable light, but rather is to say that the whole notion of 'representing both sides' should be rendered a thing of the past. So, in addition to disparaging Fox News and Breitbart, I now hold a less-than-favorable view of a good number of left-leaning news outlets, too (ex. NYT, CNN, etc.)",

It truly makes you read, watch, and listen differently and broadens your journalism intake (both types of journalism and political spectrum). As a liberal, I found the analysis of more conservative media to broaden my understanding of politics and value systems in the U.S.",

                "No suggestions for improvements -- phenomenal course.",
                "loved the course, highly recommend! structured very well to give a comprehensive understanding of the political journalism landscape",
                "The strengths are definitely the instructor, who is delightful and always super helpful, and the discussions themselves, which are always great. Having to write a weekly journalism diary that evaluated the happenings of that week made me and everyone else in class highly informed and thus our class discussions were always substantial and significant. As for weaknesses, the course by design lacks a bit of structure, which can be fine at times and a bit annoying at others, especially if it's not clear what a diary is supposed to be about one week or when something is due exactly. Perhaps just updating the existing syllabus more often would be helpful.",
                "This courses strength is also its weakness. Prof McEnroe is CHAOTIC, as evidenced by the syllabus and class blog. We did not ever get any grades on anything (truly have no idea what I'm about to get in this class), we rarely understood the assignments (if we had any), and what we needed to actually read was confusing. That said, there was MAGIC in that chaos as we were able to have lively bizarre conversations, engage with what was happening around us, and really meaningfully build relationships. Prof McEnroe is unlike any teacher I've ever had -- and that's a good thing.",
                "Strengths: Colin as a person is great (he very much rebukes established college class practices, such as letting you know how assignments will be graded and what the final project will be ahead of time, but he is great in spite of this!); journalism is a cool topic to discuss; not much work outside the weekly diaries (which only take a few hours to do, depending on how much you write)\r\nWeaknesses: truly do not feel like I learned much; Colin, in spite of being a great person, did not really teach much; the seminar seemed to be concentrated with students who just liked hearing themselves talk; class sessions didn't build on previous weeks; we didn't talk about the politics behind political journalism; discussions were obsessed with minutia, so if you weren't interested with what was being discussed you couldn't contribute; the weekly diaries, though fairly easy to complete, are time-consuming and you don't learn much",
                "The weekly diary entries were overall a strength. They were a great space to reflect. The only weakness was that they could get a little tedious toward the end of the semester. That being said, the course has a ton more strengths! Colin is such an interesting prof and really cares about student learning. He knows the business and is very candid.",
                "I loved the light hearted nature of the class. It was a fun environment.",

Only long seminar I've had at Yale that I actually enjoyed.",

                "Definitely! A great way to better understand the modern journalistic world. It's a great course regardless of what you want to go into. You definitely need to have some interest going in, but it's great knowledge to have for any person.",
