    "As this was an entirely new subject area to me, a lot of the topics discussed in class were new to me. But more than that, I learned a lot about the process of argumentative research papers, which I believe will be incredibly useful in the future.",
    "I learned a lot of new information about race, ethnicity, immigration and their intersections with education.",
    "I learned about residential racial segregation, education inequalities among races, racial attitudes and discrimination, racial identity, model minority, race and criminal justice system, and interracial marriage.",
    "I gained a larger understanding of race, ethnicity and immigration in America. I learned about the main trends, some of which were surprising to me.",
    "I learned a lot about how to have conversations about race and ethnicity, and a lot of knowledge surrounding it.",
    "I learned a lot about the field of sociology and the research methods conducted within it.",
    "In this course, I learned more about the history and present of race relations and immigration in the United States."

   "comments": [
    "I absolutely loved this course! No weaknesses that I can identify off the top of my head.",
    "I feel like there are too many things going on in this course. The information and readings are fairly interesting considering they are dense, academic work but Professor Kao never assigned too many at once so that was really nice. The issue lies with the amount of assignments for the layout of this course. There are three review papers, two midterms, and a final research paper. I think it would make more sense to either have three review papers and a final research paper, or two midterms and a final. It just always felt like I was constantly trying to prepare something for the class. Lecture could also be a little dry some times. I think with some improvements, it could be a great class because the information is genuinely interesting.",
    "Strengths: Very interesting topics, great professor and TAs\r\nWeakness: sometimes the lectures were just summaries of the readings required for class. We write 4 reviews and one literature review (final paper) in this course, but no guidance about HOW to write those are given. Difficult and confusing for people who aren't familiar with these types of writing to get started. Also the sections aren't structured and unproductive.\r\nTo improve: more guidelines on how to write the assignments. TAs could have a clearer guideline and plan for each section.",
    "I liked that the class had two midterms and a final paper instead of a final exam. The review papers that we wrote we also helpful in solidifying concepts. However, I think there were a few too many readings.",
    "I think the course should be a bit more interactive, especially considering this class was somewhat small.",
    "The course was a general survey of the topics. I think It would've been more interesting to go further in depth and cover fewer topics.",
    "The course content was depressing, but it provided me with the ability to critically analyze the different how different structures affect different groups of people. I think the course could benefit from more structure in section. Initially, the feedback for the short reviews could have been more straightforward."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. I had no idea what sociology even was before taking this class. I just so happened to luckily find this course while shopping, and I'm glad that I did! I would recommend to any friend even if they have no interest in majoring in any sociological major (I don't believe I will major in ER&M either).",
    "If you are willing to engage with the material, then sure. It's also a good intro socy class. If you don't really have to or don't care for race, ethnicity, or immigration, you're kinda wasting your time.",
    "Yes, if you aren't familiar with this topic and want to have a broad knowledge.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. All of the topics, from criminal justice to family formation to education were interesting. No prior sociological knowledge is needed.",
    "Yes. It is a good introduction to topics of ER&M and sociology for interested students. For ER&M students, it will provide a new perspective more focused on statistics and the history of sociological research in this area.",
    "Yes because it has a lot of information that could help people have more open conversations about race.",
    "I would recommend this if they don't know much about the topics. For some already engaged in these topics, they might not learn very much."
