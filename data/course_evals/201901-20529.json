    "I learned all about art and meaning and how to convey meaning through art. I also learned about my own artistic style and preferences.",
    "I didn't learn much drawing technique per se, but I became much more confident in using different materials and understanding how to represent an image on the page, even if it's not an \"accurate\" representation in the strict sense of the word.",
    "Learning to think creatively about drawing skills and problems in general.",
    "Art",
    "How to draw perspective and how to draw things proportionally.",
    "I learned that art is a form of communicating the world.",
    "Experience drawing with different mediums. Use of space.",
    "How to draw and visualize images that I want to draw. I improved my understanding of lines, shading, figure drawing, textures, and other art techniques.",
    "I learned how to accurately depict space and bodies in this class, and how to be selective with drawing materials, some of which I had never used before.",
    "A good base level of understanding how to draw.",
    "I learned the basics of drawing from the very fundamental skills.",
    "I learned to see the world with an artist's considerations of space, form, positive and negative space, perspective, weight, and light. I increased my control of the muscles used in drawing. I gained comfort with the use pencils, charcoal, and ink.",
    "Through this class, you will learn the basics of art class, concepts such as positive and negative space, how to think about using them, spatial sense.",
    "Drawing, visual thinking, spatial awareness, sketching a vision"

   "comments": [
    "The coursework Professor Messer is great as is, but I would ask to be thought more detail occasionally (like how exactly to draw people and faces).",
    "I loved how informal the course was. The focus was on developing our own craft as artists, rather than becoming the best at drawing as possible. We were given a lot of creative freedom, and the classroom environment was very relaxed. I did wish, however, that we got more opportunities to look at art in galleries, museums, etc.",
    "It lacked some structure. A syllabus would have been nice.",
    "More time to learn about drawing not just draw",
    "Its strength and weakness is that it is loosely structured.",
    "I wish we did more projects in general.",
    "Fun and engaging. Weaknesses are that its not super structured.",
    "It was a great class, I wouldnt change a thing. Professor Messer was extremely good.",
    "The course was very good for students with limited knowledge on how to draw but not very engaging for students who had more experience.",
    "Some of the strengths were that it was great learning environment. Messer was an awesome teacher.",
    "The greatest strength of this course was that it was taught by Samuel Messer. I'm not sure how the course would have worked if not for him. Sam doesn't print syllabuses, and dynamically readjusts the course to the needs of the class. I imagine the strengths and weaknesses of the course would be very different with different structure, but my experience was that the class was very relaxed, with a low workload, but high engagement, dedication, and a great opportunity to focus on a skill that Yale doesn't always value so highly.",
    "The strengths are that it is an enjoyable course from which you get to learn about the basics of drawing. The course mainly deals with charcoal\/graphite drawings, so color isn't really touched on through the course material. Because there's so much already to be learned with using just charcoal, I would say it's pretty reasonable that the class does not do color.",
    "I enjoyed how the course could change easily depending on what the class was interested in",
    "I think this course was wonderful and conducted incredibly well to maximize learning."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. It was so much fun and I learned so much.i recommend other Basic Drawing teachers to encourage freedom and working hard in class with less homework (learn from Professor Messer).",
    "Absolutely! It was such a pleasure to have 4 hours every week where I was doing nothing but being creative. Especially if you are a STEM major, it's a really nice change of pace from coding, doing psets, etc.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! Drawing and mark-making is an important skill to have in life in general. Also Prof. Messer is a great teacher.",
    "Yup! I loved it!",
    "Yes. It was a good intro to drawing and very meditative.",
    "Absolutely! Even as a non art major, I learned so much and really enjoyed the class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, if anything, to provide fro a much needed break from the intensity of Yale academics. I appreciated that there was very little work outside of the class and that the environment of the class was very supportive. I felt encouraged to take risks, and to do the necessary work of the projects that I personally committed myself to.",
    "Yes, awesome class.",
    "Yes. The great thing about a liberal arts education is having the opportunity to focus on many different kinds of intelligence. Plus, Yale students tend to work too hardthis class would be a good complement to a tough schedule.",
    "I would recommend the course. I think it really lets you do what you want and lets your creativity flourish.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, it greatly improved my ability to think artistically\/visually",
    "I absolutely would. Taking this course was the best decision Ive made at Yale. I learned an incredible amount and took time to figure out what I was interested in."
