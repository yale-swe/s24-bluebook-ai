                "The class is good! Professor Bennett does a great job with the class. It's super organized, the expectations are clear, and there are plenty of opportunities for extra help, just like all of her classes. Lectures are a bit dry, but this year they were all recorded so you could go back and review a concept you didn't quite grasp in the class.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely a lot of work though. It's not even like the work is exceptionally difficult and the coding problems can even be somewhat fun to do, but there is just a lot of it. I ended up devoting my Sundays from like 9AM to 9PM exclusively to this class. The Pset we had to do over Spring Break, which ended up being the most difficult code to write, was pretty annoying. \r\n\r\nOverall, I'd still recommend taking this class, but just make sure you balance your courseload appropriately.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bennett was clearly invested in teaching this course. The class was incredibly organized, with a semester-long calendar available, frequent updates from the instructor and TA, detailed and well-thought out lectures, ample office hours, and useful handouts to facilitate engagement with the material. This is truly one of the best taught courses at Yale I have ever taken, and the material is incredibly important for quantitative analysis and research. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no real weaknesses. The psets will take at least 10-15 hours, but the work we do each week is incredibly rewarding."

                "Yes, I would. I definitely enjoyed it overall. But again, know that this class involves a fair amount of work so make sure to balance out your schedule appropriately.",
                "Absolutely! If you are willing to put in the work on the weekly homework, attend all the lectures and ask questions, and get excited about the material, this is a wonderful course that combines fundamental math concepts, computer programming, and result analysis.",
                "Yes, this course is great, and you will learn a lot from it. It is a great course to take if you are going into a field that deals heavily with computation and applied mathematics.",
                "Yes, especially with Professor Bennett. The class is challenging but definitely worth the skills developed and there is as much help for the class as you are willing to seek out."
