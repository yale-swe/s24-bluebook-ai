There's a lot of hands on work directing involved in this class. I think one of the most difficult part about it is that projects often require people to come and work with you for really little return which can be limiting.",
                "This course was amazing.  I learned so much from Dr. Stokes speaking from her experiences directing and just doing multiple projects over the semester.  I feel like sometimes class time could be used for rehearsals, or class could be canceled to allow time to do other coursework before I did rehearsals outside of class could have been helpful.  The organization of this course was a little off, but Dr. Stokes originally wasn't planning to teach this course and also got COVID for a bit so it was great for what she could do."

                "I definitely recommend this to any student that has any interest in doing a collaborative artistic production in the future. This course helps you to better understand the work that is required to lead a creative project and methods and techniques that are helpful to effectively communicate how to pull a project together. While this class is focused specifically on theater I believe that it can be useful in any creative context.",
                "I 100% would if you're interested in directing and developing your directing skills in a low-pressure environment.  In extracurricular theater, there feels like high pressure to produce something good, while here, it was focused on learning.  After taking this class, I feel more confident in directing and calling myself a Director."
