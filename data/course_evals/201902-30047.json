    "All basics about game theory, like normal form game or extensive form game.",
    "The logical way of thinking in Game Theory",
    "Critical thinking in the social sciences",
    "I learned a lot about more complicated game theory, than I've come across before. It seems like a relevant course for economics students, but could also be taken by people with other academic backgrounds if they are proficient with the level of math. The course was divided fairly straight forward and the professor more or less stuck to the syllabus, which was nice. \r\n\r\nA part of the course that stands out for me is the part where we focused on extensive form games and Baysian games with imperfect information. This. I think, is something I will take with me in my further economics  studies.",
    "The basic knowledge\/concepts of game theory and how to apply it in real-world cases.",
    "Critical thinking skills",
    "I have learnt a lot about Game Theory. For instance, the Nash Equilibrium and Subgame Perfect. And I learned to read articles by myself.",
    "game theory",
    "I learned about many useful models in the area of game theory, and I also developed an idea of this field.",
    "Abstract a game into mathematical form and think strategically",
    "skills to use simple model to evaluate common games in normal life.\r\nsome insightful views of math and economic evaluations.\r\neven some philosophic looks in economics!",
    "I get to know more details about the famous stories in game theory, and I know how to think in game theory way to solve problems and to make decisions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The instructor focused more on stories so we can have a clearer idea but this makes mathematical definition very vague and sometimes hard to distinguish.",
    "If there could be a basic definition before the example, it would be better.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- The level of relevant examples was a key \"ingredient\" in this course. We saw a lot of different examples during the course, both videos and different written examples on the board. This is to me a very crucial component to be able to understand and learn.\r\n- A very nice professor, who was very approachable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The classroom provided for us was way too small. About 1\/3 of the students had do desk to sit at which was very unfortunate, especially during the exams. I don't know where or with whom this responsibility lies, but hopefully next year they will match the number of students with the right classroom.\r\n- There was not very good feedback from out problem sets. The problem sets were marked with a grade and that was it. It would have been nice at least to be able to see the solutions, so you had a chance to improve.\r\n- The exam very much focused on the last to lectures had before the exam. It would have been nice to make it ore representative of the course by including more of what we had learned in the first couple of weeks.",
    "Overall, it was great.",
    "It is set a it hard for problems sets",
    "I think it's perfect!",
    "strengths: there are interesting videos and the prof's notes are really well written, the notes really helped me a lot.\r\nweakness: I hope to learn more about how those theories are applied into practical cases.",
    "maybe could be easier on examinations...",
    "It's good that the instructor play some movie clips in the class to help us better understand some ideas and concepts,  but I hope there can be more details in its math part."

    "Yes, the professor is really good.",

    "It is rather hard course . I would recommend if they are interested in economics",
    "Sure. I think it's a really nice course because I learned a lot in the class.",
    "Yes, because it is suitable for beginner of economy (economy students can also learn a lot). And it requires less in English thus is friendly to non-English speakers.",
    "of course, game theory is a great model."
