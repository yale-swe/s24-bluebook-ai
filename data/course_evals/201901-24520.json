    "Could be more interactive with the students instead of the professor talking the whole time.",
    "Strengths: great discussions in class.",
    "The movies are the strengths but some readings do seem less relevant than others.",
    "I think the variety of the films and the introduction to war films as a whole was a strength of this course. I believe seminar discussion could have been more focused and the students given more time to speak.",
    "The discussions were the best part of this class. The professor facilitated engaging and respectful conversations in a very graceful way. There were some films that I might consider taking off the syllabus, but that is just personal preference and not a reflection on the quality of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, would recommend. Professor Garofolo is a great guy, and the workload is easy. Interesting class.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course. Generally, as someone who came into the course clueless about military culture, I'd say the main benefits of the class were: (1) the novel, interesting subject matter and (2) the first-hand perspectives on the military provided by Professor Garofolo and the students (most students in the course were male ROTC students).\r\n\r\nIn particular, Professor was great. As a full-time Captain in the Coast Guard, he brought a fresh, first-hand perspective on the military and war films that we don't usually get from other professors in academia. It's one thing to read textbooks on military culture, and it's another to hear your professor's stories about challenges he's encountered as the officer in charge of the Coast Guard's culture and wellness (e.g., preventing sexual misconduct). So not only is Professor highly qualified, but he also has a wealth of life experiences to share that made me feel immersed in the topic.\r\n\r\nOn a weekly basis, this course had a relatively low workload: one Monday 1:30-3:20pm meeting, one 7-9pm film screening, and a totally manageable amount of readings for a humanities course (50-100 pages). However, there are around 20 total pages of essays spread throughout the semester (3 + 8 + 3 + 8 pages), so if you're weak in writing, you might want to avoid this course.",
    "I think this course is a good opportunity to hear other people's opinions and ideas about war--ones that might differ from your own. I would recommend it for that."
