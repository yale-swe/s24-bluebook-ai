                "I appreciate how Josh let the conversation go where it did according to whatever was on students' minds (lots of freedom), but sometimes conversation tapered off.",
                "The course was great! I enjoyed the format of providing a brief response before class to get things moving. Sometimes, it was difficult to know where to jump into the conversation when the discussion changed rapidly, but overall it was a great experience.",
                "It is a great set-up with a low workload and interesting seminar meetings. I liked the students don't have to present papers like in many other psych seminas. There are big expectations for the final project so I think that the proposal should be mandatory and there should be feedback given on our plan earlier.",
                "Everything about this course is absolutely wonderful! From the very first class, Josh took steps to help students feel at ease and create a space that felt collaborative and generative for ideas from everyone (including through not have students say whether they're an undergrad or graduate student, saying that we could call him Josh, and taking time in the first class and the beginning of each class to ensure that students understood the relevant background knowledge to discuss a particular paper or theme). The content of this course is incredibly fascinating, and Josh is also very willing to change the syllabus in order to better accommodate students' interests (which wasn't just something he said, but actually ended up doing, including by polling students on which topic they would prefer to discuss in an upcoming week). Even during the discussions themselves, Josh was amazingly open to allowing the conversation to shift and change direction based on student interest, leading to some fascinating and unexpected discussions. I have never had a seminar where the class time flew by so quickly. I have never had a seminar where the professor created such an uplifting environment for student contributions across disciplines and experience levels, including in-person classes (let alone over Zoom). Each class you will come away with genuine insights and further thoughts on the material, and you will be amazed at the intelligence of the other students and of Josh. It is extremely rare to find a professor who is so brilliant and knowledgeable in his field (there's literally an incredible discovery that has inspired a huge amount of literature in the field called the \"Knobe Effect\" - you get one guess for who discovered it) yet so welcoming, generous with his time, and invested in student learning and success. While the final project might seem intimidating, don't let it be. Josh somehow manages to find the time to meet with students and talk through their ideas with them in between all his other responsibilities, which is an absolutely crazy opportunity to take advantage of and talk one-on-one with such an insanely knowledgeable professor. During a semester filled with stress from so many different areas and a general sense of discontentment with the academic loss of learning over Zoom, this class was an incredibly rich, thought-provoking, and enriching experience that I was excited to participate in every week and was actually sad to see end. If you can get into this course, take it without a doubt or a moment's hesitation. If you have the opportunity to take any course ever with Josh Knobe, take it without a moment's hesitation. I wish that I could have a class with him every semester. It is amazing to come away from a class thinking that there is literally nothing that could have been changed to make it any better. The other students in the class, the material, the discussions, the format of the class, the form of assessment, and the instructor are all absolutely fantastic. You will never find another class at Yale quite like this one or a professor as insightful and kind as Josh."

If you do not want to develop your own project/original work in the field, do not take the course. However, if you start early and delve into something you are genuinely interested in, you will learn so much more than regular lecture courses. It was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale!",
