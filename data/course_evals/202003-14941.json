How might I approach archives? What do practices of refusal, care, etc. do for my writing? How does my story relate to my subjects of study?  \r\n\r\nI also gained insight in methods of observing, reading, and narrating outside the usual strictures of academic production but which nonetheless are critical, deep intellectual engagements.",
                "This is an incredible methods class for anyone looking to do writing in ER&M or outside of the major. We thought critically about what poetry and poetics can (and cannot do), and what it means for writing to live in the world.",

                "I developed a lot of skills in thinking about methodology and theory of creative practices. Beyond this on a broader scale, I also learned a lot about specific histories and the broader context of racialization in the United States. Much of what I learned we drew from queer and BIPOC creatives, and so I feel like we were able to learn a lot about the creative process that is very different from a \"Standard\" academic approach, which was very engaging and fulfilling.",
                "This course allowed me the space to really think about how to use poetics as a way of expression that goes beyond writing as well as its importance beyond academia. The different writing exercises throughout the semester really inspired me to experiment with different modes of presenting nuanced and accountable narratives.",

                "The readings for this class were phenomenal and I was able to learn so much from the discussions we had in class about the readings. The final project and smaller projects leading up to it really helped me apply the topics that we learned into the context of my own life and my own interests and curriosities. If anything I wish there could have been more time to spend extra time on certain readings and topics.",
                "The course was a great healing and learning space for students as we were able to engage with materials created by BIPOC for BIPOC. I saw no weaknesses in the course.",
                "This course was honestly the highlight of my semester. The syllabus and materials we reviewed were amazing, and the discussion posts and portions of class were often honest and insightful, lacking some of the empty discussion that sometimes happens in seminar classes. Maryam is so intelligent and insightful yet down to earth and understanding in class discussion and overall helped to create a welcoming and safe class environment even over zoom. The only real weakness of this class is that didn't seem to be enough time to address all that the course had to offer, that and that it was so amazing that I wish I could have taken it in person.",
                "strengths - it truly is a course tailored to the students' interests; Maryam designed this course to be the course she wish she had in undergrad and it really IS a course for anyone who wants to dedicate a chunk of their time this semester to ethnic studies and their identity\r\nweaknesses - not rly a weakness, but it is really up to you how much you want to put in and get out of this course",
                "There are many strengths! Class discussions were structured and facilitated very well, especially as most classes included a short free writing section in which we were able to synthesize our thoughts and process what was brought up in class. The texts we read themselves were very engaging, and there was a lot of variety in types of work we looked at from creative writing, to essay, to music, to visual art, to film. In addition, I really appreciated the outside of class engagements with speakers or writers that we were able to learn from and engage with not only in a public setting but in class. In addition, for people that enjoy project based work, this class is great, especially as the final project is a very progress based and thoughtful process that you can rally take in any direction that interests you.",
                "I truly loved everything about this course. While a lot of that had to do with Professor Parhizkar and my classmates, the writing exercises and the carefully curated content were key in creating the necessary context for deep self-reflection to occur through our discussions. It opened me up to ways of expressing academic theories that captured everything academic writing typically cannot.",
                "Strengths are really everything. To be more specific, though, I felt appreciated and was given room to actually appreciate others\/the works themselves.",

After the formal event portion of class, students would then have time with just the guest speaker where we could ask our questions.",

In general the class rules were crafted with students in mind and the current state of the world so throughout the semester knowing that I could email if I really needed an extension or had to be absent helped minimize the stress that could've come from this class.",

                "Absolutely. The practices Maryam centers this course on are vital, in my opinion, to pushing scholars (especially those seeking a career in the academy) to trouble their methods and approaches. It simultaneously asks artists to consider the ways that the academy has shaped our practices and what otherwise methods and visions for the future can be created. I found this course to be a form of sustenance this semester. I'd especially recommend it to students who are feeling exhausted by the disciplinary demands of their work and to those interested in a scholar-activist\/artist-activist role.\r\n\r\nPlease note: I declined to answer #9 and #10 because I took an undergraduate course as a graduate student. I'm not sure how useful my response would be for Yale College.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Absolutely. I took this class as a sort of challenge to myself as I had never taken an ER&M class before unlike most of my classmates and so sometimes there were topics and concepts that I did not previously learn or understand. However, due to the openness and eagerness to see me understand and be able to fully grasp these topics from my classmates as well as Professor Parhizkar, I never felt like I did not belong or that any of my thoughts and words that I shared were less valuable. This class taught me so much about myself and really opened my eyes to new interests that I hadn't even considered before.",
                "Yes, students not only engaged in archival materials made by BIPOC, but also had the opportunity to curate their own archives based on their interests to practice the methods we learned.",
                "I would highly reccommend this class and any other classes with Maryam to another student if you are interested in better understanding communal archival work and the exploration of artistic and liberal forms of histioriography. This is definitely the most academically and personally enriching class I have taken at Yale so far.",
                "YES. It truly is the course that every undergrad wishes, especially those who want to dedicate time to explore their relationship with identity and community. By taking this seminar, you put yourself in a community of other students interested in ER&M and learn so many from them.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student broadly interested in the humanities or any of the cross listed departments, and especially if you would consider yourself as someone who likes to write, make art, music, or engage in other creative outlets! This course is very student driven, and it is formatted especially well for learning with the communal documents, quotes, and other sources that Professor Parhizkar offers to us each class, and she is always open for feedback or really anything you might want to talk to her about.",
                "Definitely take this course! It will open you up to different ways of expressing yourself and your academic work.",
