                "We learned about the field of Black classicism by discussing how several Black authors from Africa, the United States, and the Caribbean have responded to\/adapted the classics in their own work. We talked about a few different adaptations of ancient Greek tragedies, uses of the Odyssey in African American and Caribbean art and writing, several authors' responses to receiving classical educations themselves, and Greek tragedy and the Persephone myth in other works of African American literature. This course helped me learn about the role of the classics in Black cultures, and it challenged me to think about how artists respond to and remodel prior work through their own writings. I think this course taught me how to be a much more critical reader of adaptations and other works that respond to or take some kind of inspiration from other texts. It definitely helped me learn a lot more about literary analysis. Prof. Greenwood is INCREDIBLY knowledgeable, so the combination of her pre-recorded lectures and insights in class, our class discussions, and the assigned secondary sources was very helpful for learning more about literary analysis and prior scholarship on the works that we discussed in this course. In addition, I think this course encouraged me to write more creatively. I found the 300-word weekly discussion postings helpful because they encouraged me to turn out short and succinct pieces of critical writing relatively quickly.",

                "Strengths: interesting subject matter, engaging format, predictable and manageable workload, frequent and clear feedback.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there'd been more graded assignments throughout the semester.",
                "Many strengths! The readings were all super interesting, and it seemed to me that they were well-chosen to give us a geographic and thematic range of works. These are works that you may not get exposure to in other courses, or that you wouldn't approach in the same way if you encountered them in another setting. I also thought it was very interesting that we didn't just read poetry, plays, and novels, but also nonfiction accounts relating to classical education. Prof. Greenwood's expertise in the subject matter is also a huge strength of this course. Not only is she an extremely knowledgeable classical scholar, but it was also always clear from her pre-recorded lectures and our class discussions that she knows a great deal about the context for each of the works that she assigned and about other relevant scholarship and artistic works. Overall, this course provides unique perspectives on Black literature and intertextual dialog that I don't think you'll find elsewhere. \r\n\r\nEven if I didn't think so every week, I've decided that the weekly discussion posts were also a strength of this course. I think they challenged me to write creatively and succinctly, and they also made sure that I spent some time thinking independently about the readings before our class meeting, not just reading through whatever the secondary sources might have said about the text(s) we were discussing that week. I liked that Prof. Greenwood asked us to compile and lightly edit the posts for submission at the end of the semester, since this was a nice way to look back on what we had learned over the course of the semester. Another strength was that Prof. Greenwood sometimes gave us written comments on our posts, and she often brought them into the discussion in class. \r\n\r\nFor improvements, I do think that some weeks there was too much reading. The week about classics and the \"uplift of the race\" in the United States was particularly heavy, as was the week with Invisible Man (I almost wish we'd devoted two weeks to that novel). Trying to cut down some of the reading in a few places may help students think about them more critically instead of just struggling to get through a large volume of reading. (I think the reading quantities were a bit uneven, so some weeks weren't a problem and some were just particularly heavy.) However, did like that we had Antigone assigned for the week about The Island. Reading the ancient Greek play was useful for me personally, since I don't have an extensive background in the classics (a few other students seemed to be in a similar situation to me in that regard). I wonder if it would be good to have Oedipus Rex assigned as well, and\/or maybe excerpts of the Odyssey or other works when relevant. I wouldn't want these to get in the way of any of the other texts that we read, though, since they are all so important! But if it's possible to work the classical plays\/excerpts in from time to time without the reading load becoming overwhelming, I think that could be helpful for some students. This is just something to consider.",
                "Strengths: I loved how thoughtful, passionate, and caring Professor Greenwood was! She was open to everyone's interests in sending discussions sometimes unexpected directions. Her weekly video lectures helped give us both background information and interesting interpretations and relations between works and authors and ideas, which really did help make discussion richer. We also got personalized feedback on discussion posts basically every week, so we really did get a lot of helpful feedback.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: She did end up moving it back, but having us read The Invisible Man and turn in an essay the same week was a bit daunting!",
                "The cap for this course was 10 people, which meant everyone was able to participate fully in discussion. I particularly enjoyed the class on Romare Bearden's collages. The readings were also really good, except the weeks with full novels or longer readings assigned (Invisible Man, Beloved, Omeros) were difficult, and it felt like we weren't able to fully cover the entire work or go in-depth in those class discussions. Perhaps splitting those readings into two weeks or assigning specific chapters \/ passages could be considered."

I found the background material provided in the lectures very helpful, and it was nice to be able to refer back to them when I was writing the final paper. I think that in a virtual setting, 75 minutes is a good amount of time for a discussion-based course. The other seminar I had this semester that kept the full 1hr50min meeting time was exhausting over Zoom, but it's not nearly as difficult to stay focused for a 75-minute class discussion. Sometimes it did feel like we weren't able to discuss as much in class as would have been ideal, though, so that may be a tradeoff.",
                "I thought this course was really well organized for online learning",
                "One drawback of zoom is that discussion is basically students talking one-on-one teacher while everyone listens, and seldom do we get to discuss with each other. Breakout rooms is a solution to this, but maybe also on the weeks there are presentations, each presenter can lead the discussion for a few minutes after presenting. This would give students more chances to be actively discussing with each other."

It's a niche class, but I think that if you're interested in African American studies and\/or Black diasporic studies, or if you're interested in the classics and world literature, then this would be a really good course to take. This class offers unique perspectives on artistic production, and I felt like it really pushed me to think about writing and Black cultures in ways that I hadn't before. Sometimes it was very challenging, but I hope I got a lot out of it. Prof. Greenwood is a great professor--she's extremely knowledgeable, very nice, and also very well organized. I think that her comments on our discussion posts and papers were always thoughtful and helpful. It's very clear that she's put a lot of thought into the design of this course, so I really think that it's a unique opportunity that's worth taking if you get the chance and you think you'd enjoy the material!",
