Although there was no availability of tutors, whenever I asked for help from my teacher she was very helpful and made herself available.",
                "Strengths: good content and concise examination. Weaknesses: problem sets often deviated from curriculum and was sometimes hard to focus due to other students (though this was at no fault of professor  those students were sneakily distracted)",
                "Strengths: Often I felt like there was no connection with the work we were doing. One day we would jump into one topic and the next day something completely different.",
                "The preview of the class material for the week in the form of pre-class quizzes was incredibly helpful both for the preparation of class, and as supplemental material for the topics covered in class. The weekly math workshops were also incredibly helpful to supplement the learning in class, and a great opportunity to ask questions about uncertainties in the material if office hours and peer tutor hours don't work with someone's schedule.",
                "The material is easily understandable when taught in class, however I feel like there is a gap between example problems in class and the problems on the problem sets. The example problems in class seem to be simpler, and the problem sets are usually more challenging/theoreticalwhich is a good challenge, but I found it difficult to be able to complete them in the beginning because we did not practice the same type of problems in the class itself. I appreciated the support systems in the course! There was a lot of practice and preparation for exams, the ULA/professors/John Hall were all responsive and really helpful too!",
                "Good course I had a great teacher, and it could be improved by having a more review on the building blocks of calculus.",
                "Strengths: ample ULA office hours, sufficient time between each problem sets, professor was great and very explanatory, tests not beyond difficult, good amount of review sessions and in class detailed worksheets help studying \r\nWeaknesses: at times office hours were so hectic because they were understaffed leading me to being there for days and hours on end before finishing a problem set not very time efficient",
                "Strengths: Great material and ULA tutoring sessions were very helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not enough ULA tutoring for the numbers of students that show up for questions about the problem set"

I did a few review sessions in the summer in order to help prepare myself for this course and still found myself struggling because I had not taken calculus in High school.  I felt like those who had taken calculus in high school found It easier to understand class lessons because they already had learned this, so it was mostly just a review for them, while for me it was my first time seeing this information.",
                "Most definitely  gives students with semi-strong understanding of calculus a way to better hone/ develop skills. I placed into 112 but classmates recommended I try 110 (and later) 111, and I am very happy with this decision.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students who want to get comfortable with college/advanced math, and those whose's highschool did not provide them with a good stem education (specifically math).",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. It is taught in a manner that is well-paced and easy to understand. The material is often supplemented out of class to solidify understanding of overarching concepts, which better prepares students for the midterm assessments and final.",
                "Yes. I am a humanities student, so I was nervous about taking an actual MATH class. But, I found the class to be taught clearly and approachable and there are many supports in place (ULA office hours, supportive professors, etc). To succeed in the class you really need to understand the theoretical reasoning beyond the concepts, which can be hard at first for some (like me), but its definitely worth it to build those skills, particularly if youre going further in the MATH sequence.",
                "Yes, I think getting a stronger calculus foundation before going to more advanced  math courses is critical. It lowers the stress but also increases confidence in the material. Taking math 110 then 111 also fulfills the common math 112 requirement",
                "Yes, this course is a great intro level course to college calculus and taught well for non stem students"
