You will learn a lot about vectors and vector fields on a fundamental level that was not covered in MATH 120 (Multivariable calculus). Honestly the material taught in this course is a necessary foundation for a lot of Mathematics, Physics, and other sciences, and since it's proof-based it really builds your intuition on these concepts that you grow very confident in by the end of the semester.",

The course is extremely theoretical and extremely proof based, so much so that people who don't know proofs should take Math 225 instead, but those who are experienced with proof writing will find Math 226 extremely interesting.",
                "This was my first formal proof-based math course so I feel that I learned many skills in proof techniques and proof writing.

Because the class lecture and homework consist almost entirely of proofs, improvement in this domain is unavoidable.

                "Strengths: Psets were very managable; professor is responsive to advice\r\nWeaknesses: Exams were way harder than psets; lectures and content aren't very organized and are taught in a confusing way at times",
                "I enjoyed the course.",
                "Strengths: very logical and rigorous, didnt use any theorems that werent proven\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the theorems werent given many easy to remember names, aside from the Dimension Theorem. This made it hard to refer to theorems.",
                "The professor, Ebru, was a very clear and knowledgeable instructor. Even though the classes were at 9 am (which were a bit too early for me, so I often did not attend class), she posted clear lecture notes that were easy to follow. Ebru's office hours were also very helpful for completing the homework (which was also very helpful). The only weakness would be the early class times.",
                "Strengthsskipped introduction to proofs but that did not make the course difficult to follow. Rather, writing proofs was integrated into the rest of the syllabus really well and it was very easy to pick up on all the concepts you need thanks to Ebru's very easy-to-follow lecturing style. The material is also very interesting and important for a lot of higher-level maths and sciences.\r\nWeaknessesby the last few weeks the course felt a bit rushed (the material on norms, inner products, etc.) and due to the more sophisticated nature of this material compared to the rest of the course I wish we had spent more time on examples and problems for it. Direct sums of vector spaces were also difficult to follow and it felt like we rushed through this concept. I also wish we had used a better book because the ours felt very dense, and trying to study from it often gave me a headache because of how dense it was.",
                "The proof-basedness of this course makes it appealing for anyone who has had prior experience with proofs before. Because of this, students are able to connect with each other easier, as all of them have a common math background before.\r\n\r\nHowever, at times, all of these proofs can become monotonous. I would enjoy the class more if there was a healthy dose of non-proof material as well.",
                "The greatest strength of this course is that it covered pretty much everything it promised to cover, hence serving as a complete linear algebra course. As someone who enjoys math, I appreciated the amount of content we were able to cover.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that I believe this course needs to improve is its course description in Canvas and Yale Course Search, because the student pool is severely different than the course description would imply. Although only Calc II is required to take this course, it would not be a good idea for someone whose highest level of math is Math 115 or a Math 115 equivalent to take this course alongside a class in which many students are taking linear algebra for a second time to build upon their already existent knowledge foundations. In fact, for anyone who hasn't taken linear algebra before, it would not be best to take Math 226 for that reason, especially with Math 225 already being a great proof-based linear algebra course.",
                "The Psets were a good level of difficulty. They were challenging, but still doable and helped me learn a lot.",
                "I thought the lectures were very well done and the TA Nico was extremely helpful. Ebru answered any questions after class and was always very supportive throughout the course. She also made the course a bit more enjoyable with her lighthearted sense of humor. The problem sets and exams were fairly well written in my opinion, including some very nice proofs. The curve was also fairly lenient considering the high class average. I would say the only weakness of the course was that sometimes theorems in the textbook were skipped over in lecture, but this can be easily overcome by reading the textbook which I think is a necessity in this course anyway.",
                "Strengths: well paced, interesting material, fair PSETs that test and solidify knowledge without taking too much time. Professor Toprak is very kind and helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: none.",

                "Strengths: Great professor, psets really help in better understanding the material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures are sometimes not very engaging due to just presenting theorems and proofs with not much thinking from the students. If in-class proofs were made more interactive (maybe lots of small group activities in class or a flipped class structure), that would be an amazing and lot more engaging way to learn the material.",

                "Strengths: The problem sets and exams did a good job of going over the content from class and developing our understanding of it. Ebru made the lectures interesting and engaging.\r\nWeaknesses: The solutions to problem sets were often difficult to understand due to how they were presented, which made it difficult to get answers to questions you were struggling with. The course did not teach how to approach problems involving proofs, so the class may be inaccessible for a student that doe snot have experience with it.",

                "Strengths: Ebru was extremely friendly and accessible. She knew what she was talking about. Weaknesses: Lecture notes were sometimes really confusing. Exams were graded harshly and she punished silly mistakes more than I think she should have. Final was hard.",
                "Strengths:  \r\n  - Great at teaching how to think about proving a mathematical statement\r\n  - Provides great understanding behind theory of Linear Algebra\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n  - Occasional typos\/lack of clarity on problem sets \r\n  - Sometimes applications of proved theorems are not explored",
                "A strength was that we never skipped over any of the steps when building our understanding of linear algebra, nothing felt like \"magic.\" I appreciated that we proved everything from first principles\r\n\r\nA weakness is that we didn't get to the spectral theorem because we ran out of time in the semester. I personally feel that this problem could have been solved if we had not spent so much time proving properties of determinants (e.g. that you can expand along any row and get the same answer, and that its linear with respect to one row). I didn't find that these proofs helped me to understand the determinant any better, and I think they could just be left as optional reading for those interested to make room for other things like the spectral theorem.",
                "This course taught a lot of material from the textbook and challenged us to think about what we learned and use it in new ways on the tests and homework. I didnt like how some homework problems were annoyingly tricky in ways that werent possible to figure out without getting a hint directly from the professor or one specific example in the textbook that was not referenced in class.",
                "The biggest strength of the course is how much it helps with proof writing. It also has a very reasonable workload. Since the course is mostly targeted towards first-years, it would be nice if it in some way facilitated group work, as other courses with 'first-year' in the title often do.",

                "Not necessarily; there's not too big of a difference between 225 and 226, so you might as well take 225 which presumably has an easier exams. The nature of the people who choose this courses allows for little margin for error on exams and assignments which causes a lot of unnecessary stress. The content itself is very standard, and I don't think 226 is taught in a particularly outstanding way. The professor is really nice and understanding, though.",
                "Yes, but only if they are interested in math.",
                "Yes. Its not really that intensive, and it covers linear algebra pretty well without spending time covering proof-writing (which is pretty intuitive anyway)",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, even if they aren't a math major. This is a perfect class to get exposed to proof-based mathematics while learning about concepts that are applicable to applied mathematics. Even though the focus is on proofs, I gained a much stronger grasp of how to use a determinant and matrix manipulations than in the applied linear algebra class I had taken previously.",
                "Definitely over Math 225 if you're somewhat familiar with Proofs\/logic. It felt like more time was given to the material of the course and as someone who has never encountered linear algebra before, I was able to do well and I really didn't find the course too difficult. I think if you make sure to consult all the resources you have and try to build intuition behind the concepts taught (which aren't too sophisticated except for the last chapter perhaps), you'll do fine. Exams were okay, the PSets were doable and you could go to Ebru's office hours if you were confused on any of the concepts, the final is difficult due to it relying mainly on the last few parts of the course, but overall the course was well-balanced and it felt like a really good introduction to linear algebra.",
                "I would recommend this course, but only to students who are interested in a math or math-related major and have substantial previous proof-based math experience. This course is definitely fast-paced and intellectually challenging.",
                "It is useful for quite a few fields and generally interesting, but it'll be a heavy workload.",
                "If this student is familiar with proof-writing (to the extent that they've done a couple dozen or more proofs before), this course is perfect. If not, Math 225 would be a better fit.",
                "If you do not have any prior linear algebra experience before taking this course, please heavily consider taking Math 225 instead. The amount of content covered is very similar to the amount covered in Math 226, and if you seek more intensive coverage of topics or want to explore some of the few topics Math 226 covers and Math 225 does not, you always can do so in your free time. From a grades standpoint, not having linear algebra experience puts you at a significant disadvantage in the course because from my experience, many of the students in the class have taken some sort of linear algebra course before this course and the class, unsurprisingly, scores quite well on exams. Math 225 may be an outlet of learning proof-based linear algebra that will more likely help your GPA, and there are other ways to learn math outside of a classroom setting. You can still explore uncovered concepts recreationally without taking an approach that is strictly worse for one's GPA.",

                "If you have a background with proofs, this is a good class to take. Though, I think it kind of assumes knowledge of proof techniques like contradiction, inducation, etc...",
                "For those with previous math competition or proof experience looking for a challenge, this is the perfect course. I would say the non-intensive version of this class does not foster as deep of any understanding of more difficult concepts as there is a lot more computation in 225 compared to 226, where almost all questions are proofs. Those without confidence in their mathematical proof skills should not take this course.",
                "Yes iff they want to learn linear algebra and have written proofs before. If you have not seen a proof before, take 225. (Or you could take analysis (255) if that class is being taught as an introduction to proofs, and then come back to linear). When I took 226 (with Professor Toprak), the workload was quite reasonable and the class felt very chill, but my friends who took linear last year (with O'Neill) had a very different experience.",
                "This is a hard course. I would only recommend taking it if you know some linear algebra and you should definitely have some proof-writing experience.",
                "Yes! I loved the Professor and the class was super interesting!",
                "Yes, if deciding between 256 or 255 I highly recommend to shop both!",
                "If you are a hardcore, gigachad, dedicated math major, then yes. Even if you never seen proof, you can take the class and reasonably get an A but expect to go to office hour and ULA session every week, and read the textbook religiously.",
                "If you are confident with your math skills and you want some challenges, yes. Don't be too scared about the course being \"intensive\"apart from being more proof-based and skipping the proof-writing part, the material is quite comparable to 225. Ebru is also a very nice professor who keeps the psets and exams very reasonable. The good thing is you will be studying with some very smart people and enjoy a decent learning environment.",
                "Absolutely -- the course was super interesting, and I very much enjoyed it! Keep in mind that knowing how to write proofs is assumed (and definitely needed) for this course, so be ready to learn proof-writing if you haven't done it before!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who plans to pursue future high level math classes as long as they have experience with proof-based math. Otherwise, there are more accessible classes that will be more useful.",
                "If you are a prospective math major or know that proofs and math will be a significant part of your years at Yale, I would recommend this class. As someone who is considering a math major, I really enjoyed the rigor and pace of 226.\r\n\r\nThat said, from what I understand, MATH 225 covers very similar material as 226 (In the year I took it, the material seemed almost identical). MATH 226 offers more depth, mathematical rigor, and challenge (especially on the psets and exams) than 225. If you're just hoping to finish linear algebra, though, 225 might be a better option.",
                "Yes, covers the fundamentals of linear algebra, which is important for math and a lot of its applications. You will learn the ideas behind the results and get a solid understanding of concepts by writing rigorous proofs.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless you have a very strong background in linear algebra. The homework and exams were very challenging and time consuming. However, if you enjoy mathematics and\/or interesting in majoring in math, this is an useful course to consider.",
                "Yes, if you are willing to go to the lectures and constantly work on concepts\/practice. If you expect to be able to cram\/read the lecture notes last second and let your natural math ability carry you to an A, I'd suggest 225 -- the curve\/difficulty in 226 makes it hard to get an A just because of how smart everyone is in that class. But, if you want a challenge, go ahead. If you want to be above average, spend time with the concepts, and have the confidence to not be able to rely on the curve -- there will barely be one because the majority of the class will be USAMO qualifier-level smart or above.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. I think that students would like this course if they enjoy puzzle solving and finding the right way to prove theorems! Students will probably enjoy this course less if they care more about applications of linear algebra.",
                "Yes, I would. I have talked with some people who took 225 instead, and it seemed like they did not go over nearly as many of the proofs of various theorems. As long as the student is comfortable with proofs, I think the 226 course is a really good option.",
                "I would recommend this course to people well versed with proofs and\/or linear algebra. Not knowing any linear algebra or props will make this class very very difficult. Even with a strong math background, expect to work hard. It covers more than the basics of linear algebra and takes a more abstract look rather than a computational one. You should be willing to work very hard and be confident in your problem-solving skills. Anyone looking to take a deeper and abstract look at linear algebra with the appropriate background would benefit a lot from this course.",
                "Definitely! If you didn't take linear algebra in high school, but are mathematically ambitious, this is a great class to take. If you did take linear algebra in high school, ask yourself: did I write multiple complete proofs for every homework assignment? If the answer is no (and it probably is!) then this is a great course to take, and you won't be bored by the repetition.",
                "Yes, very good dive into linear algebra and proofs."
