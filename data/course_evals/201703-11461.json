    "I wish we had interacted more with Italian culture through movies or field trips to the YUAG. I also wish that we talked more in class and had actual discussions as opposed to just all answering the question of the day. It felt like a waste of time to go through the grammar each day in class, because it isn't anything that we can't learn on our own.",
    "There are many exams, but we continue to learn Italian daily, so I don't think anything should be changed at this time.",
    "Strengths are the staff, the teachers do a great job trying to help you. Weakness is that it is exam heavy with there being eight throughout the semester",
    "I think the professors are very kind and understanding and the structure of the class and the course is very great. The department really facilitates learning in many great ways.",
    "I thought that the class did a great job of reviewing difficult concepts to remember. I think there may have been a little bit too much review."

    "I think that unless you came out of L2 Italian extremely confident in your abilities, it is a good idea to take this class, especially if you are trying to eventually take an L5 level course.",
    "Definitely, for those who love Italian, this course is wonderful.",
    "Yes, Italian is a beautiful language to learn. Dont be discouraged if it sounds difficultl, it is much easier than you think",
    "Yes. The Italian department is a great department.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it was taught well and was enjoyable."
