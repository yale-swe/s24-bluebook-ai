I think the course should be restructured to have more small assignments instead of a few large assignments. Other than that, the course was great. I liked my classmates, the reading material, and the discussions and workshops.",
                "Professor Zarin is a great instructor. The variety of the assignments kept the class engaging throughout, and the other students in the course were really wonderful. I think our discussions of the readings took a bit too much time from our workshops.",
                "this course was really disorganized and rushed. in future iterations, it would be great if there was a more consistent syllabus and timeline.",
                "Its a great class that will only get better with time.",
                "This was Profesor Zarins first time teaching this class, and I really enjoyed the format! I think one thing that can be improved that we already discussed is time allocated to workshopping, as these sometimes felt a bit rushed."

                "the strength of the course was the relationships we built among the students over the course of the semester. by the end we all really knew and understood each others' styles and goals and it really helped us facilitate each others' writing. the biggest weakness, again, was the lack of organization and how rushed it was.",
