I think the course should be restructured to have more small assignments instead of a few large assignments. Other than that, the course was great. I liked my classmates, the reading material, and the discussions and workshops.",
                "Professor Zarin is a great instructor. The variety of the assignments kept the class engaging throughout, and the other students in the course were really wonderful. I think our discussions of the readings took a bit too much time from our workshops.",
