    "a great amount about the SDGs, UNICEF, child development, global health, and writing and understanding international interventions",
    "I learned about the structure and process of writing project proposals\/reports, about international development and humanitarian aid, about child development, about specific issues surrounding child health in Africa.",
    "This was a great course in learning how to develop a thorough public health proposal.",
    "-creating a policy document \r\n-finding and using data\r\n-researching a country\r\n-about the UN and policy making\r\n-about the SDGs and how they work \r\n-analytical skills",
    "I learned a lot about the way that global health initiatives impact peoples' lives, the current UN approach to global health, and the way that health and development projects are designed",
    "Feel prepared to step into any project intervention creation due to this class. Learned so much about the current state of child health in Africa in addition to how to prepare a project intervention.",
    "We were taught the details of how to devise a project proposal and how to implement interventions in the setting of the sustainable development goals."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - small lecture style, if you want to be very involved and put in a lot of time into the course you can, and you will get a lot out of it. Professor is very passionate and willing to help. Great topic as well.\r\nWeaknesses - not the most clear or organized course regarding structure of the class, due dates\/criteria of assignments...(but if you don't mind this, it can still be an enjoyable course).",
    "STRENGTHS \r\n-interesting content \r\n-professor very passionate and gave great feedback\r\n-it feels like you're actually creating something that could be used \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES \r\n-2 hours on a Friday afternoon is rough.",
    "It was fascinating to learn from Dr. Alipui about his experiences working in global health but the actual work of the course was somewhat disorganized",
    "Strengths: Creating project interventions could be used for any field and preparing a proposal throughout the semester was super helpful.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes the class was unevenly prepared for seminar because sometimes large assignment components were unclear.",
    "I found the course to be very engaging and we worked through a large amount of background material very well. We covered the topics very well and also covered detailed case studies that translated the abstract concepts we were learning to a real world setting and forced us to think critically about the material and the problems we were presented with. I thoroughly enjoyed this course. The workload and level of research and time required for the project proposal was very high, and was little difficult to manage with other courses. But the process of developing the project proposal was very illuminating and imparted crucial skills."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in child development, Africa, and\/or humanitarian aid.",
    "Yes! If anyone is interested in global health, this is a great course to take. It teaches you necessary skills for developing intervention proposals, and learning is emphasized more than grades. A lot of the learning is done in the process of writing your proposal, but it teaches you things you can't quite learn in a classroom.",
    "Yes, I loved this class and learning from Professor Alipui was amazing.",
    "Yes if you're looking for inspiration but probably not if you're looking to get a concrete learning experience",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. Easily one of my favorite classes at Yale. Nowhere else have I seen a class of this caliber of curriculum and preparation for real world situations.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student."
