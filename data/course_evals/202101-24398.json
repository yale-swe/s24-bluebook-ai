                "I learned how to describe different aspects of music in academic terms and how to listen to/break down a song like a composer. I also learned a lot about the 20th-century history of American music and the links that connect different genres.",
                "I learned how to critically listen to music and understand music production in its unique spacial and temporal context.",
                "I learned about genres I didn't even know about before. More than that, however, I learned about how music develops and what things influence artists and how a beat from an anticolonial, yet slightly homophobic song, came to be ubiquitous in reggaeton, and I learned how to better appreciate music and yeah this course taught me so much.",
                "I learned about different genres of American music, from Go-Go to Tejano. I gained insight in how to compare musical genres, as well as how to gain listening skills for sonic features that distinguish a specific genre.",
                "A historical, cultural, and musical background in sousa, ragtime, blues, and jazz (mini units), and go-go, reggaeton, tejano, and kpop (in-depth units). Through each of these units, we had the unique opportunity to explore places, peoples, and musics; I feel like I gained the knowledge of a history, sociology, and music class all in one. \r\n\r\nI also gained skills in close reading and music and text analysis (through our reading summaries) and close listening (through our quizzes), all while feeling extremely supported by professor Baca and my classmates. I feel incredibly fulfilled after being a part of this course."

                "I liked the way that Professor Baca's monologues used the personal lives of specific influential people to retell musical history. It left you with an understanding not just of how each genre started and developed over time, but also why - the goals and motivations of the characters making those key decisions. I thought the reading summaries could have been spaced out a little better so that they were more spread out over the semester, but I enjoyed doing each one of them. I was also a fan of the listening quizzes - as someone who had never taken one before this class, Professor Baca's approach made them fun rather than stressful.",
                "I think this course is near perfect, if not perfect.",
                "I very much enjoyed the content of the course. I was able to learn about different music genres that I had never heard of before, and the classroom environment was very supporting and responsive. I especially enjoyed listening to over 10 tracks in each genre, which made me gain listening skills for identifying different pieces.",
                "This was a really great class, I only wish it were in person!",
                "I have only good things to say about this course. I loved the format (the units were well organized and informative), the quizzes (which were actually enjoyable, and centered our learning), the discussions & lectures (in which it was clear how much effort professor Baca has put into presenting about each style), and the opportunity to listen to music as a group (which we are all deprived of since the start of the pandemic). This is an excellent model for a course, and the content is so engaging for both music majors and people who simply enjoy music, which is a difficult balance to strike."

                "having breakout rooms in the beginning of class to informally interact with other classmates was very nice at imitating the classroom experience.",
                "This was the perfect course to take during the covid pandemic. I loved how Trevor would sometimes take time in class to let us discuss the real things affecting us today and somehow he would find a way to tie it in to the course.",
                "I really appreciate how supportive the professor was, and how he constantly expressed his support throughout the semester. He was very aware of different struggles that students may face during a pandemic and was willing to work with us to make sure that we were both physically and mentally sound in order to learn class material.",
                "Sharing sound so we can watch music videos and hear demonstrations of the sounds we were studying.",
                "One of my favorite parts of the course was the first five minutes, when Professor Baca put us in breakout rooms to chat. This student-to-student bonding is something that I have felt is missing in most of my courses during the pandemic, and it truly does improve the class environment, discussion, and learning over Zoom. I also enjoyed the breaks in lecture to listen to music, watch videos, and discuss. The variety of activities kept things engaging and fun, without distracting from the course content."

If you are already a fan of one of the genres on the syllabus, you will greatly enjoy hearing about it from an academic perspective, and if you are not familiar with any of them, you will be lovingly introduced to some amazing works. None of the work you do for this class will feel like work, but you will still learn a ton.",
                "Yes! Professor Baca is very supportive and knowledgeable. He does a fantastic job explaining the course materials to those with no previous music background and gets the class excited about learning. He was also very attentive to his students and made sure everyone was feeling well and not stressed out by the class. It was a great space to learn and I hope that more courses can be taught this way.",

                "yes, yes, yes. this is one of my favorite courses at Yale. Trevor cares really deeply about the subject matter and about his students. you will gain skills in music listening, learn history of different genres, be able to place different musics in their demographic/historical context. I really hope this class stays in the rotation for future classes",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. For music majors, it is a great Group IV class that is both engaging and intellectually interesting, but does not overload you with work.",
                "Absolutely. It is a class not in my major and I took it solely because it looked so interesting and I was not disappointed! One of my favorite and most memorable classes at Yale, even in a pandemic.",
                "YES! This is my favorite course I've taken at Yale. It will make you view music in connection to physical location and culture differently, and you will improve your listening and writing skills in a fun and enjoyable environment. Professor Baca is excellent-- he gives great feedback and lectures, and deeply cares about his students. Whether you are a music major, a music lover, or a beginner, you will love this course!",
                "Yes absolutely. A wonderful professor and a fascinating course. Academia can and should be enjoyable and not punishing.",
