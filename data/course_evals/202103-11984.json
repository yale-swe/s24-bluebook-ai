This course covers weekly vocabulary and grammatical topics that build over the course of the semester, and by the end, you are able to speak, read, and write about a variety of everyday topics in the present tense.",
                "An excellent introduction to Modern Israeli Hebrew. The course will cover four verb binyanim (pa'al, pi'el, hif'il, and hitpa'el) and a good amount of vocabulary. Focus is strictly on the present tense, and an emphasis is put on speaking and typing (aside from weekly handwritten vocabulary, essentially all work was either recordings of our voice or else typing assignments on google docsthis was somewhat unusual for me, as I've never had a language class which put more emphasis on typing than writing, but it was useful! I can type in Hebrew now), although reading and writing (both print and script\/cursive) feature throughout the course. If you put in the work (and really, it's an L1 language class, there's not that much work) you will see a really big improvement in your ability to understand and produce Hebrew! I went from knowing nothing aside from a few expressions to being able to have simple conversations and stumble through short stories and newspaper articles. What you get out of it will depend a lot on what you put inpracticing speaking and listening are super important and will make the class a piece of cake. Oh, there's also a textbook that's used, but I didn't buy it and that was never an issue. YMMV"

                "This course is extremely well organized. You always know what work you have to do and what to expect in class and on exams. The Professor gives every student a lot of one-on-one attention so you are receiving individualized feedback daily. The smaller the section, the better, there were two sections when I took the class and the smaller section (5 people) was noticeably more successful than the larger section (11 people).",
                "Strengths: great professor, great TF, great classmates. I was in the smaller section (only ~7 people) which had roughly half the enrollment of the larger section. This was a big helpsmaller class=more time to speak and more individual feedback. I think we were definitely better-prepared for the final as a result. If you have the opportunity to take the smaller section, do it. I really appreciated the cultural enrichment activities too: we watched a movie as a class and heard from some speakers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The Padlet+Canvas combo could at times be confusing, but I think this is really just a symptom of the whole semi-online-instruction thing, not with the class itself.\r\n\r\nImprovements: Even more emphasis on extemporaneous listening comprehension, which I think is probably everyone's weakest skill when first learning a language (I know it's mine)."

                "I 100% recommend this course. The Hebrew department is small but mighty. The professors are outstanding pedagogues and really support every students' individual learning. This course is a great choice to start the language requirement because the course is very well organized (daily homework, weekly exams on vocabulary and grammar, weekly writing) and you will see a huge amount of progress.",
                "Yeah, absolutely. It's great fun and the people you meet are really excellent. I had a wonderful time, and it's definitely been the highlight of my semester. If you're interested in connecting with the Jewish community on campus, supplementing Biblical Hebrew with Modern Hebrew, or want an entry point into the NELC department, the Hebrew program is a great way to go about it."
