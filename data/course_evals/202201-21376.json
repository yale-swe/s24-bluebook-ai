The essays helped me further engage with the material we read. The class discussions were also very helpful in understanding material and practicing having intellectual conversation. I felt that the peer review sessions though were not as helpful, sometimes yes but often the feedback I received was surface level.",
                "This class was fast paced, but it still managed to explore ideas for a long enough time to understand it.",
                "Strengths: the readings we did in class were very engaging and exciting, and I could relate them back to my own life. Professor Ellermann also pushed us to think critically about the readings and think from other points of view. I appreciated how the longest assignment (the research paper) was not our last assignment which made balancing the workload from other classes during the last two weeks of classes much better.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not sure this is a weakness per se, since this is an introductory writing course that would need a lot of writing, but it did feel like we always had an assignment to work on and there was rarely any time to breathe.",

It is certainly not easy, and there will be a lot of writing, but you will get better. I would highly recommend making sure that you are truly interested in the topic of the course because otherwise ENGL 114 will be a large pain. I would highly recommend The Right To Be Lazy and Professor Ellermann in particular; the topic was incredibly engaging and Prof. Ellermann is knowledgeable and excited about the topic and provides clear feedback that pushes you to grow.",
