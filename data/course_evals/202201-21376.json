The essays helped me further engage with the material we read. The class discussions were also very helpful in understanding material and practicing having intellectual conversation. I felt that the peer review sessions though were not as helpful, sometimes yes but often the feedback I received was surface level.",
                "This class was fast paced, but it still managed to explore ideas for a long enough time to understand it.",
                "Strengths: the readings we did in class were very engaging and exciting, and I could relate them back to my own life. Professor Ellermann also pushed us to think critically about the readings and think from other points of view. I appreciated how the longest assignment (the research paper) was not our last assignment which made balancing the workload from other classes during the last two weeks of classes much better.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not sure this is a weakness per se, since this is an introductory writing course that would need a lot of writing, but it did feel like we always had an assignment to work on and there was rarely any time to breathe.",

                "Yes, I think an ENGL 114 course is very valuable to students looking to improve their writing skills. It is certainly not easy, and there will be a lot of writing, but you will get better. I would highly recommend making sure that you are truly interested in the topic of the course because otherwise ENGL 114 will be a large pain. I would highly recommend The Right To Be Lazy and Professor Ellermann in particular; the topic was incredibly engaging and Prof. Ellermann is knowledgeable and excited about the topic and provides clear feedback that pushes you to grow.",
