                "This course is very interesting, the discussions are engaging, and the group collaboration projects were really nice.",
                "Strengths: There were so many opportunities for creative engagement with the Arabian Nights and collaboration with others in the class. We also got a fair amount of history and background, which was incredibly helpful when analyzing the stories for their social/historical significance. I really loved when we got to meet in groups before class and come up with a mini presentation about a specific topic-- it made it feel more like a real, in person class even in the virtual setting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only weakness I can think of is that sometimes, the comments on the papers were a bit vague and didn't seem to leave a lot of room for improvement. For example, our papers were only 2-3 pages, but most of the comments were \"elaborate on this\" or \"explain more,\" which were hard to do with zero space and very open-ended prompts. These were some of the more tricky papers I've had to write for the English major, specifically due to this space requirement.",
                "Strengths the variation in the readings, and the assignments!\r\nWeaknesses There were some days when discussions turned into lectures, and vice-versa... I wish it was a little clearer when we were encouraged to chime in, or sit back and take notes.",
                "The material in this course was absolutely amazing. I mean, it's the Arabian Nights, you really can't go wrong. I'm just sad we couldn't watch the movies together as we would have done in-person, but I really enjoyed the class and the people in it.",
                "This course is great! Main strengths are Prof Creswell and our TA Maru. They were both wonderful and engaging and fun. I also liked the balance of professor lecture with student presentations, groups, and projects. I felt like this was the one class this semester that I actually made friends in, because the format of the class facilitated that so well. I really enjoyed being a part of this class.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Creswell and Maru, literary translations of Nights tales, focus on Arabic literary and cultural conventions, Nights stories are engaging and entertaining\r\nWeaknesses: Stories can feel repetitive"
