                "I feel that this course has definitely helped the skills I learned in high school mature. By this I mean that I've had to take many of my skills at analysis and harness them in a new way: for instance, working on catching onto themes within a complete text rather than simply pulling out specific points of interest within a short extract. My skills, particularly risk-taking, for interpretation have also greatly improved, as this professor always allowed for students to defend their personal interpretations extensively. The professor is especially knowledgeable and helpful for picking out specific nuggets within the text, and giving us unique ways of reading the text.",

                "Some concrete skills DS literature helped me develop: close-reading of ancient literature and connecting textual details to the larger thematic context and complexity of the work; Professor Barasch's detailed feedback on papers also helped me improve my writing in general.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the value of this class and DS in general lies beyond specific skills. Reading Homer, Dante, Ovid, Virgil, etc first-hand (often for the first time) is a challenging and enlightening experience that has made me more culturally literate. The papers, mostly written without the help of any secondary sources, really encourages you to delve into the minute details of literature and develop your own independent interpretation of the work.",

Professor Barasch offered helpful and constructive comments - especially about considering purpose behind not only each paragraph, but each phrase and word. Reading for any DS class produces a certain blend of picking out what is important and also managing time so a skill I developed through this course for reading was picking up on trends and patterns. Another key lesson was asking about purpose behind the words used by the authors we were reading.",

                "I think we had very strong conversations in this course despite the format. I can't think of any particular weaknesses.",
                "This class was fantastic; it was certainly my favorite among the DS seminars. The seminars ran smoothly and everyone was engaged and encouraged to build off of each other's ideas. I appreciated that we were able to take papers in different directions and I think Barasch's openness to us choosing our own prompts and exploring the topics we were interested in is a particular strength of the course. The biggest (and really only) weakness of the course seminars sometimes running long but if I had to have a class run long, it'd be literature. Generally, in terms of the syllabus (which Barasch doesn't have control over), I think it could include more diverse voices, but otherwise all the texts were engaging and thought-provoking.",
                "I found this course to be very engaging, enjoyable, and stimulating. The readings were interesting and the discussions always extended my understanding of the material. I see few flaws or weaknesses.",
                "If you're reading this you're probably looking at Barasch's section in particular. Well let me tell you it was a lot of fun! Professor Barasch is super intelligent and would get super deep into a topic. But he WOULD lose track of time... so if you like the highly structured stuff, maybe he's not the best. He should let the students speak more in discussions and do their own thinking! Barasch goes deep, not broad, so be prepared to just not discuss entire sections of the reading (some of which I would have liked to touch on!) But it's great and all very interesting!\r\n\r\nSo don't be afraid to write about something you've never talked about in class! Because Barasch holds absolutely awesome office hours (and they're legit office HOURS, toothis man values insightful, not perfunctory conversation!) he'll help you think through your ideas for your essay.",
                "strengths: very supportive and encouraging environment\r\nweaknesses: would appreciate more openness to people's thoughts",
                "Strengths: fantastic writing feedback and professor availability; nurturing and friendly seminar environment conducive to important discussion\r\n\r\nWeakness: Professor often spent slightly too much time offering his own points and students arguments often got glossed over.",
                "I mean one of the obvious ones was the fact that everything was online rather than in person. I think it would have been better had there been more personal talking and less of the teacher employing most of the discussion. Also, I was very confused when office hours were to talk to the teacher. I found it a bit hard to follow sometimes, and there were topics that many people wanted to talk about but that we didn't actually get to talk about because we were so hyperfocused on one idea.",
                "Strengths: The paper assignments, despite their quick turnaround, are really worthwhile experiences that helped me develop more in-depth understanding of the works I wrote about. Professor Barasch also posted discussion prompts on Canvas from time-to-time; although I'm not sure if they were ever full-blown \"discussions\", they felt like mini-papers that also encouraged me to do a paragraph-worth of detailed textual analysis and respond to others' ideas. Professor Barasch is also a great resource to bounce ideas off of during the brainstorming stage; he is genuinely devoted to helping you explore, revise, and expand the ideas you find interesting. The seminars led by Professor Barasch are also mostly helpful experiences where my classmates and Prof. Barasch brought up ideas that I hadn't considered.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Seminar discussions can sometimes seem like going down an endless rabbit-hole; while close analysis is certainly valuable, I would prefer if we at least attempted to cover more than only a couple passages for some works that we read. Lectures also provided helpful context and insights in general, but it sometimes seemed like they could be more organized and focused.",
                "The individual attention from the professor was amazing, and the lectures and discussions were very useful and informative. The reading load was a bit much; at times seminars felt rushed, and class almost always went over time. I think this course could be improved by removing perhaps one or two works from the syllabus to prevent this.",
                "As with any DS course the reading load is hefty and sometimes it feels as if portions of the reading are untouched. The lectures paired well with the seminars as a way to fill in for gaps of understanding in the reading. DS Literature has amazing seminars as the texts are rich for discussion.",
                "Strengths: The texts were phenomenal, and the students within the discussion were always eager to share their opinions.\r\n\r\nPotential Strength: Some lectures were phenomenal, like the first of the year. Unfortunately, few of the lectures came close to that one in quality. The DS Literature class lectures, in general, were the weakest of the three subjects. I think the lectures could be better if they spent less time describing the authors, and actually explored the events of the works and provided thematic analysis.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The class is easily hampered by the professor. Roughly two-thirds of the discussion time was devoted to the professor reading aloud sections he enjoyed and giving his own interpretations. While these were sometimes insightful, it is supposed to be a discussion. Unlike my other sections, I felt like I never had the opportunity to speak."

                "this was in general a success!",
                "The Professor made a clear effort to keep the atmosphere of the class lighthearted and enjoyable. He often took the time to ask us all how we were doing, and showed genuine interest in our individual (and often distant) lives. The conversation often flowed smoothly, although the class would often drag on past the end of class.",
                "Canvas Discussion Feeds were highly effective as was live Zoom seminars.",
                "Raising the hands succeeded pretty well. However, I wish there were some things that were done on a smaller scale from time to time so that people can get a chance to discuss their ideas, because a lot of times people would raise their hands, and when it came time for them to talk, the conversation had already passed by that topic. I also found it a bit difficult to engage when I was confused by a subject. I think a general breakdown of ideas that were discussed and possibly having a plan for discussion would help a little bit so that we can expand upon ideas within; however, the talks did continuously flow by themselves. I think making it more clear office hours and having them stick to a certain time period would also be good.",
                "Zoom seminars: this is not necessarily an area that can be improved, since it is pretty much the only option, but zoom seminars can obviously be straining and frustrating; this has especially been the case for DS, the bulk of which is seminar discussions. I would perhaps suggest that zoom seminars be split into three 50 min (or less) segments per week rather than two 75 min segments--I had trouble focusing during the longer zoom sessions, which also tended to go over. I think it's overall much harder to participate in seminars over zoom in my personal experience; I feel compelled to make a speech every time I speak, where in-person discussions flow more naturally. \r\n\r\nLectures and handouts: I feel like these could be more engaging, so maybe the lectures should be made live, where we could ask questions and interact with the professor more? There also shouldn't be a \"lock\" on the lectures and handouts to be released on Sunday night or Monday morning; it makes more sense to release the lectures as soon as it is available to give students more time to watch them.",
                "The zoom seminars worked well for me and not much else could have been done given the circumstances.",
                "The pre-recorded lectures for DS worked really well overall and most professors uploaded their lectures ahead of time which allowed for some flexibility to view the lectures at a convenient time. At times some of the accompanying handouts were hard to find (note to past self, check files and media library and modules). As for our seminars for DS literature they all went really well without any technical problems.",

I learned a lot and gained a new appreciation for the classics but I never slept and spent way too much money on coffee. Take DS if you're already interested in the subject, at least tangentially. You will be spending too much time on the class to not be interested in it.\r\n\r\nFor Barasch's section of Literature: This section was both enjoyable and thought-provoking.

His insights were often very helpful, and he felt knowledgeable on the subjects.",

                "Yes.\r\n\r\nDespite the challenges of zoom seminars and recorded lectures, I still found it worthwhile to take DS lit. I do think there is something special about the classics that makes them inherently worth reading and studying, not only in their literary significance as canon, but in their tremendous power to probe complex ideas like violence, desire, gender, and duty with great nuance that makes you genuinely reflect on the human condition. What I think are the most valuable parts of DS lit, the reading itself and the paper assignments, remained largely unaffected by virtual learning.",

                "Yes! DS Literature bettered both my reading and writing abilities. It is also a great way to encounter a large array of fascinating literature. I had read some of the texts in high school, but revisiting them through DS literature deepened my appreciation for them as I was able to analyze them better and learn from my peers' analysis of them. I'd also suggest making a reading schedule and trying to develop a strong weekly routine to balance the readings, lectures, and essays as well as turning to peers if the readings are piling up and especially for peer edits which were by far one of my favorite parts of DS.",
