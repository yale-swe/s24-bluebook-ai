    "I developed the ability to read the Parthenon through time as not just a physical building but an image and symbol of retro-active construction of ideology.",
    "This is not a course on just the building that is Parthenon. It teaches you how to approach a subject from many different angles and allows you to see it through different lenses. I gained much more from this class as an individual than any of my other art history classes because of its unique structure.",
    "In this class we learnt a LOT about the Parthenon, were challenged to participate in weekly seminars on difficult readings, and write a full length research paper with an extensive bibliography. This class required heavy use of critical thinking.",
    "This course used a multi-disciplinary approach to analyze the Parthenon.  For example, we examined it as an architectural wonder, a site of religious cult, an artistic model for paintings and replications, a theme in literature, a representation of different national identities, and more.  But more importantly, we pooled together all of these different facets to understand how the Parthenon (as a building and as an idea) has changed overtime.  It also introduced me to Classical architecture, authors, and literature, all topics that I had only vague knowledge of before taking this course."

   "comments": [
    "Kind of a disparate syllabus with no clear theme throughout other than the theme of the Parthenon as having changed through time. Otherwise, extremely fascinating.",
    "The class is really good. But since there is so much material to go through sometimes we did move a little fast through periods. If there was time it would be great to talk about contemporary interpretations, Parthenon in modern art etc.",
    "This course had a really great premise, and I consistently felt that the in-class discussions allowed me to think about historical analysis, art, and cultural legacy in new and interesting ways. I sometimes felt that it was a little disjointedit wasn't always clear to me how each individual lecture or discussion fit into a broader wholebut the course feels more cohesive now in retrospect, it just may have been difficult to see the whole picture from within it. I felt that the many opportunities to engage with the materials in new ways were real strengths of the course. The paper, in-class debate, and weekly discussions were great, and I absolutely loved the opportunity to be creative with the final project. Also, the feedback I got on both the major assignments was prompt, thorough, and helpful.",
    "I loved the visit to the YCBA and the various lenses in which we looked at the Parthenon, but wish there had been a little more diversity in source-type. When we watched and discussed Spike Lee's Chi-Raq that was such a fruitful, interesting, and engaging discussion, and I think greater incorporation of other types of media like that could have enriched classes and aligned nicely with the ultimate focus of the course. I also think the handling of the final project at the end of the course became kind of confusing organizationally.",
    "Not only was the subject matter incredibly interesting, but both Professors Gaifman and Greenwood were eager to share their vast knowledge and experiences with us. They planned the entire semester so that seminar topics built upon each other in intuitive and helpful ways.  Thus, they created an overarching narrative through which they explored the many themes of the Parthenon.  But on the other hand, individual class meetings felt a bit disorganized and incomplete. More often than not, we were unable to discuss everything that had been planned for that day and one or both the Professors would have to rush through their presentation (or not get the chance to present at all)."

   "comments": [
    "It was an interesting approach on a subject I had not studied before, but I wouldn't recommend the course in itself without other interest in the subject.",
    "Yes. Take it! Professor Gaifman and Professor Greenwood is a match made in heaven. They know everything in and out and there is so much to learn from them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, if it's offered again! It was one of the best humanities courses I've taken at Yale, and the professors were both great!",
    "Well this class will likely not be taught again, but I would recommend to another student who was specifically interested in Classics or Architecture and ready for a seminar that did often prove itself to be very intellectual, sometimes in a challenging way.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student for many reasons. For one, you will learn so much just by listening to class lectures and discussions (nonetheless, the readings are absolutely essential as they contextualize everything and truly do benefit you in the long run). Additionally, both Professors Gaifman and Greenwood were so passionate about their respective fields and wanted nothing more than to share their knowledge with us.  The Professors also structured the course so that even the students with limited Classics backgrounds were not overwhelmed.  This was then balanced with how thoroughly we explored the Parthenon so that everyone was able to learn something new."
