                "This course is really great for someone who wants to study drama, or who is looking to improve their creative writing skills. I think the syllabus is really good, however sometimes the workload is heavy when you have to read 2 plays and also create a short scene for class, in addition to anything else.",
                "There was VERY little feedback from the instructor in this course. Even after the semester is over, I have 0 clue what my grade is or truly how I performed in the class. The compliments are spare, which is how he does things, but really the feedback is spare as well.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Margulies obviously, the workshop focus, and a great selection of readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many formal check-in points to see how my writing is going or how I am doing in the class, I think workshopping pieces in breakout rooms also would have been better than doing them as a whole class",
                "The course was mainly talking about plays. It felt much more like a reading group than a writing group. I wish I had gotten a clearer traditional toolbox for writing. The mini prompts each week were very fruitful."

It is a bit of work, but the plays are really good, and there aren't that many opportunities to just focus on your creative writing, and to have it workshopped by others.",
