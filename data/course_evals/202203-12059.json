I would have found these helpful, even if only to give me a sense of the kinds of questions the professors expected to be addressed in the final assignment.\r\n\r\nPS: Look at the disclaimer given to students by the Registrar at the top of course evaluation forms: \"As you evaluate your learning experience in this course, remember that everyone is influenced by unconscious bias. These subtle biases can be positive or negative. Please think carefully about your responses to this form.\"",
