This course has a strong quantitative focus in terms of homework and exams, which felt relatable to other disciplines. After taking this course, I have a much stronger understanding of cool topics like black holes, galaxies, and relativity.",

                "Textbook reading a little too heavy",
                "The content of this course was really interesting, but sometimes the language/terminology was just so difficult for a non-STEM major to understand",
                "Strengths: Well organized, interesting",
                "I enjoyed Professor Kenney's use of synchronous participation in class. That helped with student engagement. The course was well organized into three different sections.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Kenney's lectures are engaging and fun! Even when the content felt confusing or a little boring, Kenney would catch our attention with funny slides or in-class demonstrations. This course is very accessible to everyone. Even though students might assume this class is a \"gut,\" the structure of the course made it feel like an introductory astronomy and astrophysics course, just with a very understanding professor and sympathetic grading. I never felt like the class was easy or a throw-away lecture; instead, this class's broad focus builds a really strong foundation in this topic area. Additionally, the observatory extra credit excursion was SO COOL!\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures are not recorded in order to encourage in-class attendance and participation - this made me feel more motivated to attend lectures, but this could be inconvenient when students were sick or had conflicts. The midterm was pretty difficult in terms of the time constraints and tedious calculation questions, but Kenney graded the midterm with a very forgiving curve.",
                "I loved the textbook.",
                "The course has interesting content, however I would say a weakness is the lack of similarity in the lectures and the homework/test content. Oftentimes on the homework I had no idea how to begin even though I attended every lecture.",
                "Not a beginner class, would appreciate demonstrations of example homework problems in class.",
                "Each lecture could be 50 minutes instead of an hour 15, as many students appear to loose focus in the middle of class. There's a lot of information crammed into each slide, which is useful for review, but harder for students to take in during class. It would be great if the professor could give us access to the slides beforehand, or record the lectures.",
                "I really liked the observation opportunity and the psets were good practice",
                "The lectures were poorly organizeda lot of the slides were repeated every class. Also the psets tested problems that we never went through in class, the lecture material was pretty irrelevant to them.",
                "lectures are more confusing than helpful. learned the most reviewing the slides by myself.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kenney was a very engaging lecturer, and I liked that there were elements of participation in the class  it definitely helped me pay more attention and understand the concepts. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had spent more time doing example problems with the various formulae we had to learn instead of being thrown into the PSETs with little understanding of them (however, the sections/office hours were very helpful for this, I just wish we did it in class too)."

                "Yes this was a great course to gain knowledge in the basics of Astronomy and to see if I wanted to continue Astro.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you genuinely have an interest in astronomy because the material could get quite dense for potential non-stem majors. If you need to fulfill a science distributional requirement, then this course is manageable if you are prepared to put in the work. Moreover, I would caution against waiting until the last minute to complete the weekly p-sets as they were long and quite difficult. However, going to TF office hours will significantly help you on your homework.",

                "Yes! This is a great science credit for non-science majors. This class taught me a LOT but never at the expense of anxiety about grades. This class definitely feels like a QR, so if you're not a fan of calculations-based homework assignments and exams this might not be the science credit for you.",
                "Yes good science credit and overall easy class",
                "No. The psets & exams have nothing to do with what is taught in lecture. Professor Kenneys slides and teaching style was confusing, repetitive, and it was never clear what information we actually needed to know. Outside of psets, not really any opportunities to practice the QR skills that take up 50% of the final exam.",
                "I would say it was a fine class to take, but I would say be aware that you will have to put in more work than just being active in the lectures since what you are expected to do is not necessarily taught to you through lecture.",
                "Yes I thought the material was really interesting but it is very math based if you like that kind of thing",

                "Yeah its a quasi gut",
