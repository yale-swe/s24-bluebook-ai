                "I developed a vocabulary for talking about climate change as well as a variety of different lenses for looking at climate and art issues.",
                "I learned about the incorporation of anthropocentric themes into modern art, both intentionally and subliminally. I also learned how to develop a micro-exhibition incorporating these new themes. Overall, great for anyone with previous art history or environmental studies experience, even non-majors!",
                "Taking this course exposed me to a diversity of writings spanning Science & Technology Studies, environmental studies, and the history of art. The pieces that we explored in readings and in class were helpful for developing critiques and discussions around issues of engagement with the world around us. By spanning a range of topics, this course engages the nature\/culture divide often found in the humanities in a way that is both creative and generative. We were also offered the chance to create a micro-exhibition (online), the process of which Professor Angus was incredibly helpful and informative about. This, in conjunction with our final paper, meant that we had a variety of ways to pursue in-depth questions and concerns that were relevant to our fields of study, while drawing on topics we were learning about in class. A few of the particular focuses included plant collaboration\/conspiracy, colonization\/empire and ecology, animal studies, and environmental art. We also took many site visits which prompted thinking about how history of art critiques develop, and are changed by context.",
                "Close looking of art to understand environmental connections. Understanding how scholars looking at the causes of the anthropocene tie into arts and change making.",
                "I greatly improved my ability to make connections across a variety of disciplines, and I became much more comfortable with art history.",
                "Developed a strong theoretical and practical understanding of the issues and arguments surrounding the Anthropocene hypothesis, and their connections to artistic trends across centuries. Gained greater sense of how to formally analyze a work of art--compositionally, materially, ethically, historically, etc. Learned how to apply ecological and ethical concepts to artistic analysis.",
                "This course challenged me to think beyond disciplinary boundaries to question and engage with artworks, literature, theory, and scientific\/historical narratives.",
                "I learned how to better analyze and critically discuss art, how to write art history papers, how to look at art through themes of the Anthropocene, and how to engage with Yale collections in class discussions and for assignments.",
                "This course explored the intersection between art and the environment, specifically the anthropocene. This course is unlike any other I have taken at Yale and has expanded my academic knowledge and research approaches in vast ways that I will take with me far into my future studies. Based on an interdisciplinary and intersectional model, the course approached the anthropocene from multiple perspectives that gave me different entrypoints into the topic. Overall, this course encouraged me to look at art as intertwined with issues of land possession and environmental degradation, an interconnected perspective that is often ignored in survey courses of art history."

                "Visiting the collections was fantastic and one of the highlights. I wish we could have had a little more classroom time to unpack the experiences since the conversation was so great.",
                "The only weakness was the density of some of the readingshonestly, I was unable to complete them some weeks, although some were quite engaging. In addition, I found Sway a moderately unintuitive format for the midterm presentation. Other than that, Professor Angus is engaging, the museum visits were well structured, and all around it was a course well situated to the seminar format!",
                "strengths: flexible assignment deadlines, kind & knowledgable prof, engaging and well-led discussions, site visits, diversity of materials for study and discussion, multiple ways to engage in the course (perusall annotations, in-class contributions, etc), interesting projects.\r\nweaknesses: n\/a",
                "Strengths: I loved how the course centers around engagement with campus art galleries. It really brought the course themes to life. The involvement of guest speakers\/curators was perfect, and I learned so much from them (but it didn't feel like it took away from our engagement with the professor). I also loved the course readings and the use of Perusall, which helped strengthen our class discussions.\r\n\r\nMy main critique of the course would be that I wish it ran in non-COVID times so the field trips to Central Park and NYC would have been possible! Also, as I think Siobhan realized throughout the class, balancing our time spent in the galleries with pre-recorded lectures or half-lecture\/discussion and half-gallery visit is important to keep up with connecting the readings and course themes.",
                "Strengths: flexible deadlines, collection visits, interesting discussion \r\nWeaknesses: not enough time for discussions consistently",
                "The course is a very low workload and extremely enjoyable. However, I felt a bit behind in the first half due to my lack of background knowledge. More discussion\/foundational material might have been a bit more helpful.",
                "Strengths: The course material is fascinating, and Prof. Angus's engagement with the material is always incredibly helpful and insightful. The course's structure around field trips, case studies, and guest lectures helps to ground the theoretical material of the readings, and is very engaging. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Only small ones. The readings sometimes got a little overwhelming (for me, at least) in their length and density. Perhaps providing some guiding discussion questions ahead of time, or shortening some readings might be helpful. Prof. Angus's occasional pre-recorded lectures also really helped me dig deeper and get a handle on the readings!   It also might be nice to have a little more in-class discussion time towards the beginning of the course before field trips, just so we all have a chance to develop a shared understanding of the subject matter.",
                "The biggest strength was the high level of engagement with the museums and collections. We had classes at the YUAG, YCBA, Beinecke, and Peabody. I've taken classes before that have visited the collections once or twice in a semester, but this class felt more deeply and organically connected to the collections than any other class I've taken. A weakness was, though, that the high number of collections visits (which were also mostly at the beginning of the semester) left us with fewer classes where we could actually discuss the readings for a full class period, so at the end of the semester it felt a little incomplete. I also would have appreciated a bit more structure\/direction from the instructor, like a brief lecture on the week's readings every class or a time dedicated to summarizing key takeaways from the collections visits or readings.",
                "Strengths: Many! A fantastic, kind, knowledgeable, engaging professor, a really welcoming atmosphere and sense of community in class that made it easier to share my thoughts, and field trips to Yale collections almost every week that helped me engage with the course themes and artwork. It was also useful that we were required to turn in proposals of our final paper and micro exhibition assignments because Prof Angus gave very helpful feedback that gave me more confidence going into each assignment. Prof Angus was also very eager to engage with students, especially during office hours (the Calendy link to schedule office hours was great!).\r\nWeakness: none",
                "While the syllabus and lesson topics drew on art history, they also incorporated environmental sciences, Indigenous knowledge, and the humanities more broadly. The course was thus accessible for many different majors which allowed conversations to be varied in viewpoint. \r\n\r\nMultiple readings were assigned for each week however some discussions became centered in students' own personal experiences rather than the readings. I would suggest requiring weekly reading responses so that discussions can draw from the texts more. Siobhan did require students to annotate at least 3 weeks on the site \"Perusal\" which I found helpful as I could see other students' comments; doing this for at least 1 reading every week might help the class discussions have more focus.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the class also drew heavily on Yale's collections, including the Peabody, the Beinecke, the Yale Art Gallery, and the Yale Center for British Art. I really appreciated how Siobhan thoughtfully chose specific works in each collection. However, these collections-based classes were led by curators in the department rather than Siobhan herself so discussions often felt tangential to the class. Siobhan created such an incredible syllabus that I would encourage her in the future to lead the discussions in the collections herself so that she can tie the objects back to the class."

                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in the topics, especially those with a background in modern artistic trends, even at a broad level. From the museum visits to Professor Anguss kind demeanor and great in class discussions, this a good art history course in many different ways.",
                "I really hope this course is offered again in the future, as I could not recommend it more highly. Between the diversity of readings, the support of Professor Angus, and thoughtfully developed syllabus, this has been my favorite course at Yale. The class environment was comfortable, but critical, and Professor Angus supported the development a level of trust between students that is not often found here. Because of it, we were able to engage genuinely with each others' ideas, offering support and making connections. There is also flexibility for course engagement. The course paid attention to and built itself around people's diversities in identity, learning style, and personality. \r\n\r\nProfessor Angus was incredibly knowledgeable and helped us not just understand readings, but to develop our own critiques, which she readily encouraged us to share. The topics were interesting and relevant to literally any field of study, as well as one's ability to be in relation with the world around them.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course -- 10\/10! I loved engaging with the art galleries, and I really appreciated how our diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and interests were celebrated in the class. It was a very comfortable learning environment, and seminar discussions were great. The assignments (especially the micro exhibition) were so fun, and I felt very supported by Siobhan in carrying all of them out. Lastly, this class really fills a gap in our EVST curricula -- it connects so many critical themes and fields of thought centered around climate  justice, and the course helps operationalize them in critical ways.",

                "Yes, especially if you are interested in the topics, its a great interdisciplinary look.",
                "Yes, it was incredibly interesting and you get to visit so many art collections.",
                "Absolutely! This is a class that is so easy to care about and love. This class brought together so many people from so many disciplines and interests that I'm still blown away by how much we managed to cover and share with each other in the short span of a semester.",
                "Definitely! This has been my favorite class at Yale. I really enjoyed our class discussions and trips to Yale collections as we engaged with essential concepts about the environment, inequality, and how human actions shape the Anthropocene that I had not considered through the lens of art. Prof Angus is amazing! She is very knowledgeable, kind, and dedicated to making the class rich with materials and experiences.",
                "YES 1000% YES! Even as a senior art history major who has taken more than a dozen art history classes at Yale, this course introduced entirely new epistemologies and approaches to research that I will take with me into my future studies and career. This course is for any student interested in the natural world and the humanities and who especially has ideas \/ projects related to these topics that they would like to realize."
