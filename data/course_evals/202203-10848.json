After having taken the course, I have a much better understanding now of the present-day literary sphere in France.",

                "Strengths: A really engaging professor who cares deeply about the material and our success as students. She edited our papers thoroughly, she engaged with every comment we made in class, she put a lot of effort into crafting the assignments, etc. Really Professor Cadieu is a gem! I learned a lot throughout the course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many, just some of the assignments/ books were a bit boring/ redundant. I would've preferred an expose on a novel rather than a literary medium for example. And I would have loved more science fiction or dystopian novels.",
                "Strengths: very interesting readings, professor very knowledgeable, discussions were insightful and fun\r\nWeaknesses: greater balance between instructor selecting students and free discussion would help achieve a more organic discussion",
                "Strengths: Interesting material/very well designed syllabus, class discussions were very interesting and insightful, the assignments and Prof. Cadieu's detailed feedback allowed me to progress as a French speaker and reader; Weaknesses: N/A",
                "Starting with weaknessesthe class was slightly too big (around 15 people, which is a lot for a seminar where participation matters). Also, I didn't love many of the texts we had to read for class. Many were more experimental and less like traditional novels than I would have preferred. That being said, the class discussions were rich enough to make up for it! Everyone brought different perspectives to the table and were genuinely interested in hearing what others had to say about each book. Prof. Cadieu is also AMAZING (she's very kind but comes off a bit intimidating at first). She guided the discussions with pointed questions and let us do a lot of the talking while still offering valuable observations and contextual information. I also loved the second paper, for which we had to rewrite a passage from one book in the style of another author we studied in the course.",
                "Strengths: really interesting/varied selection of books in terms of style, author, and genre; course is kept at a smaller size so everyone has a chance to speak; great flexibility in essay topics and content, different from traditional thematic analyses or comparison papers often assigned in literature classes; Prof. Cadieu is open to mistakes and creates a very comfortable class environment; discussions are always engaging; clear feedback\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None! This was genuinely my favorite French course I've taken at Yale.",
                "The course might be improved if it met more often, since it was difficult to recall such large amounts of reading with so much space between meetings. It might also spend more classes on a single book, and supplement each week with shorter related readings.",

                "I would certainly recommend this class to any French student who is interested in perfecting their written and spoken French, who enjoys contemporary literature and literary analysis, and who wants to know more about the present-day literary sphere in France.",
                "Yes, if you like contemporary and experimental literature.",
                "Yes! I would highly recommend this course to any student who is even slightly interested in French literature or who just enjoys reading. The workload is very manageable and the class only meets once a week, so I always had ample time to do and digest the assigned readings (only about 100 pages each week). The discussions were always super engaging, and I was always shocked by how many great ideas my classmates had that then inspired me to come up with interpretations. The essay topics are genuinely really interesting and a bit unconventional compared to other literature courses I have taken, so I was actually challenged to step out of my formulaic writing style and had a great time while writing. Also, Prof. Cadieu always offers such great feedback and gives students the time and opportunities needed for improvement. She also has such immense passion for the course and really crafted an amazing syllabus.",
                "I would recommend this class if you are interested in literature. As is the case with many French courses at this level, I found that my spoken French did not improve as much, other than my confidence, since there arent many opportunities for corrections to speaking.",
                "Yes! Fantastic literature course, Professor Cadieu is wonderful. The course is very well organized and the professor gives great feedback"
