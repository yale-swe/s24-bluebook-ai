                "I learned a lot about LGBTQ history and found it to be a very informative class",
                "I learned a lot more about queer history in America and American history in general from this class. I had never taken a WGSS class before, and I think the texts we read and videos we watched really introduced me to the field and helped me understand many concepts. In addition to getting an introduction to WGSS, the class encouraged me to think more about the importance of the words we use and the origin of those words. It encouraged me to think more about intersectionality, the importance of addressing biases, and the importance of being able to critique something. I really enjoyed the class.",
                "It challenged a lot of my previous notions and beliefs about queer history. I think the one word I will never forget from this course is metronormative. It helped me keep an open mind with the variety of queer histories that make up American history.",
                "This course was my favorite course this semester, I had never been exposed to LGBTQ studies in a formal academic setting, and I had a blast learning and critically thinking about intersectional themes relating to queer ethnographies and theory that stem beyond just those two things. I learned to engage with my readings and apply them to my own thoughts and life experiences, and how to discuss these findings in a seminar setting. Overall, this course essentially taught me how to engage and think about the material I am given.",
                "Professor Herring taught us how to think critically and break preconceived notions of where and how LGBTQ people live.",
                "I developed a new depth to my critical thinking because Professor Herring really pushed the class beyond conventional ideas and reasonings. I also learned so much about queer lives in the US and garnered a new vocabulary to talk more competently about queerness and queer studies.",
                "I learned to rethink how I (a queer person) viewed queer people's relationship to space\/'where one comes from'.",
                "I gained a greater understanding of queer history, queer spaces within the U.S., and intersectionality. I developed research skills during the final research project including some familiarity with Yale's library systems."

                "I loved the way this course was organized! The syllabus is very well planned out and clearly thoughtful.",
                "I felt like this was a super fun course; I really enjoyed the books we read and I felt like I learned a lot from the discussions. I also enjoyed the freedom to write about whatever we wanted for the final paper. I probably could have done more writing for this course and not felt like I was overwhelmed (eg some smaller essay where we could choose which text from class we wanted to write about) and I would have liked more guidance on the queer idyll assignment: I haven't done any creative writing since elementary school so I struggled to come up with cohesive ideas and a way to format them.",
                "I think Professor Herring is great, but wish he acknowledged his own privilege at times when talking about sensitive subjects. The class was very interesting though and he was very accommodating",
                "Some strengths include that the class was interdisciplinary, engaging, informative, and fun. I loved that discussion on intersectionality and positionality occurred multiple times throughout the course. I also really liked how much discussion happened in the class. The discussions helped me learn a lot from my classmates.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the class was that the conversation of why wed say certain words and not others (for example: saying the d-word for lesbian woman but not the f-word for gay man) didnt come up until about midway into the semester. I feel like the class, with the focus it had on words, could really have benefitted from this discussion taking place early in the seminar.",
                "I think there could have been a bit more clarity on some of the assignments. As this is a first year seminar, the class is filled with freshmen, and we dont know how to do things like a research paper. One day with basic lessons along the lines of This is how you format a research paper. These are some examples, etc. could have been helpful. There were some resources through office hours, but some people, like myself, did not have the time to make it to those.",
                "Strengths: Extremely diverse curriculum, engaging discussions, the professor \r\nWeaknesses: At times, the readings are a bit long which causes students to not do them in their entirety, which in turn leads to a less robust discussion.",
                "I think a larger recognition of positionality would benefit the course.",
                "Strengths: clear assignments for grades, meaning all the readings were done out of interest and pleasure; phenomenal atmosphere in which everyone could speak as much or little as wanted; very diverse curriculum \r\nWeaknesses: reading load occasionally overwhelming",
                "This was an amazing course. The syllabus was rightfully diverse in reference to the different types of queer lives\/spaces we talked about, and all of the readings were interesting and relevant. Additionally, Professor Herring prepares stellar presentations and guides conversation well.",
                "This course was always intellectually stimulating I came out of every class session having genuinely learned something new or changed my perspective in some way. The readings were on the whole very interesting, although many of the articles were too long and dense to read thoroughly. The combination of academic and literary texts was a strong point of the syllabus, although the organization could be improved. The discussion of decolonization during the last week, which focused on Queer Indigenous identities and spaces, would have been better placed earlier on in the semester, in order to inform discussions of other texts and spaces. Another strength of the class was the inclusion of a variety of LGBTQ+ spaces and places across the country (urban, rural and suburban). We spent much of the semester discussing metronormativity and deconstructing cultural narratives that depict cities as more accepting to queer people than rural or suburban spaces. While there was a solid foundation in urban studies with regards to New York City, I felt that San Francisco was missing from the syllabus, and learning about the queer history of S.F. (and its role in \"flight to the city\" narratives) would have been helpful for many of our later discussions and for students' understanding of metronormativity as a whole."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student and have recommended it to many. I really enjoyed my time in the classroom with Professor Herring and loved the readings he picked out for the class to work with this semester.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. I enjoyed the opportunity to read lots of queer texts and get a sense of how queer people have lived in different places throughout US history. I felt like the discussions helped me get a sense of how to look deeper into texts.",
                "Yes, if you are LGBTQ plus and want to learn more about an inclusive history of LGBTQ people across America, this is a very interesting course. I feel like there was a certain narrative to the class that I didnt necessarily agree with that Professor Herring tried to push, but at the same time you had the freedom to disagree and argue your points.",
                "I would recommend this course because I loved its interdisciplinary focus. The class was very informative, without ever being dry. It was very fun throughout. The class didnt just encourage me to think about queer and trans social life throughout the US. It also encouraged me to contemplate topics like intersectionality, the origin of words, the need for ambivalence when dealing with a variety of topics, and the reason why certain histories have gone untold. While it could be a lot of work certain weeks, I never thought any of it was busywork, and I enjoyed the readings. Even the one reading that I didnt enjoy as much, I still found very informative. The class gave me a great introduction into the WGSS and American Studies departments, and I feel more confident in my ability to take on material in future WGSS and American Studies classes. The class was honestly my favorite of the semester.",
                "Yes, especially if they have a regard for queer history.",
                "Absolutely; this course was absolutely incredible, especially if you haven't been exposed to queer academia. The professor was so engaging and understanding that it also felt like a class that was a safe space, yet one that did push and challenge you.",
                "Yes, because I learned a lot and the difficulty was manageable.",
                "Absolutely! This course really confirmed all my reasons to come to Yale: wonderful, very respectful class community and great relationship to the professor, very critical and multidisciplinary topics, very diverse authors. Please take this class, especially if you identify as queer and finally want to theorize parts of your experience.",
                "Although anyone will benefit from taking this course, I would highly, highly recommend any queer person to sign up. Our class was just of queer people and was the ultimate safe space. It would be nice to carry on that legacy.",
                "Yes. 100%. This course was great. Would highly recommend for any prospective WGSS\/ER&M majors.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any LGBTQ+ first-year with a potential interest in queer history, ethnography or literature. My class was entirely queer, and being in an explicitly LGBTQ+ space was incredibly important for the development of our seminar dynamic, and for learning and intellectual engagement.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any queer first-year, particularly those who come from more rural or suburban backgrounds and those who did not have access to queer education. Professor Herring always took care to challenge the assumption that the only queer lives existed in New York City and San Fransisco and encouraged us to challenge our assumptions about what queer lives should look like. Additionally, he provided thorough feedback on all our assignments and was incredibly helpful during office hours."
