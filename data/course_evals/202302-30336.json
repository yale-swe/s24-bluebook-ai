What I mainly took away from this course is the different places we find these processes occuring which helped me really understand the importance of these concepts at a deeper level. \\",
                "I developed a strong concept and understanding of chemistry. The materials presented me were at a high level then what I was used to which benefited me by exposing to a higher level of learning. I developed better understanding and studying habits overall. I developed better time management skills. I also developed the quality of my assignments overall.",
                "I learned how to become a better test taker, better learner, to stay attentive in class and to advocate for myself. I found that I was never behind because I knew how to talk to my teacher or another peer in case I had issues. I thought that the live demonstrations in class were very beneficial to my learning as they \"brought to life\" the concepts of the course.",

                "I feel like it moved a bit slow and we could've covered more. In particular I would've rather explored chemistry applications such as industrially, environmentally, or biologically to a greater extent rather than focussing too much on solving problems like limitting reactant, enthalpy, pH, etc. These types of problems are emphasised on the hw anyway so I'd rather devote more of class to explore chemistry past the problems that appear on the hw.",
                "For this course I do wish I was told a prerequisite was required for this course. I was told no prerequisite were required and I took the course without a chemistry background. I found this class extremally difficult even though I did learn a lot I feel like if had a chemistry background I would have done better in the class.",
                "One weakness I found was a lack of a syllabus for the exams. I'll pass it as something minor as the problems from the homework were what we had to solve for the exams, so it wasn't too hard studying. That being said, I think an explicit syllabus for the exams would've been highly beneficial.",

                "Yes, I would. The professor is extremely passionate about the subject, and I truly do not think anyone can teach chemistry like him. He was always willing to help and aid his students and offered tons practice to his students. He also answered as many questions as possible and even stay after class to answer any remaining questions. \r\n\r\nThe course is extremely difficult, but you will learn. I feel like learn more in six weeks in his class then I learn in 6 months in another class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it is a very in depth class with live demonstrations in class on the topics.",
                "Yes. This course builds on the foundation of high school chemistry by greatly deepening the depth of the content studied and helping students discover the fundamental laws of chemistry for future study and research. At the same time, this course closely integrates chemistry knowledge with social development, teaching students not to focus only on their report cards, but to apply what they have learned to their future work and life, and to promote the development of society with their own strengths."
