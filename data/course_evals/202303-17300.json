                "I came in this course really confused about how to approach disability studies, people with disabilities, and the conversations surround that community as someone who does not have any personal disability or anyone close I know with a clear disability. This class was very nerve-wracking for me to go into as someone without much experience, but I really feel like I gained a lot of perspective and nuance to the topic of disability education, policy, representation, and topics. I learned about the history of disability policy in K-12 education, practical implications, future directions, and how disability identity intersects with race, gender, and sexuality. The assignments were clearly to facilitate learning, and I gained ample feedback! By far one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and it very much has an impact on how I move forward in society and in education accessibility.",
                "This class got me thinking about the intersections of disability and public education in the United States, covering much of the history and many of the current debates in special education.",
                "Learned more about how we teach students with disabilities in the K-12 education system",
                "I learned so much about special education and the history of disability studies. How have models of disability changed over time, ed policy, school accommodations and modifications, social and familial aspects of being a student with a disability, diagnostic processes and challenges, etc.",
                "I learned a lot about disability studies and education, and how to have a good discussion.",
                "This was easily one of my favorite Yale courses. I loved the topic and how much new material it felt like everyone was learning. We discussed policy and social implications of physical, mental and emotional disabilities.",
                "I feel that I learned a lot through this course not only through the readings/discussions but also through the assignments we completed."

                "Strengths: Great readings, discussion, projects, lectures, class makeup, community!! Weaknesses: That I can't take this for another semester :(",
                "This class is amazing! Yale should definitely offer more disability studies classes. The professors are lovely, and it was really fascinating to look at education through a disability studies lens. The only thing I think could be improved is that there was more reading assigned every week than we ever had time to go over, so it would be helpful to either have a narrower syllabus or at least have some guidance of which readings to prioritize. It was also a little too focused on K-12 for my liking, but that is more a function of Yale not offering enough disability studies courses than a weakness of this course specifically.",
                "Teaching staff was great, very responsive, accommodating, and provided fantastic and helpful feedback",
                "Strengths: I loved the format of the class, with student led discussion/presentation, a break, then lecture-guided seminar discussion. This was one of the only classes I've done readings for; they were very insightful and well curated, offering many perspectives on each week's topic. The teachers (both of which are leaving :((( ) were amazing!!!!\r\nWeaknesses: I think the class was a bit too ambitious, and each week-long unit could've been its own class. This is the only class on disability and special education at Yale, and I think in the future there should be more classes covering subtopics of this one (like one on policy, one on teaching, focuses on different disabilities, etc.). Another weakness was that I felt lost on some of the assignments, and wish we spent more of class time going over the rubrics. I had no idea how to find a policy for the policy brief, and wasn't sure about the rubric/what to focus on for the podcast.",
                "I really liked the readings and our discussions of them, and I thought my professor's presentations were very interesting and informative, especially when they talked about their own work. My professors tended to talk very casually about our assignments in class but have write-ups of the assignments which felt very rigid and demanding. This made it difficult to know what the expectations were and how much flexibility we would have with the projects. I think either description is fine, but I would try to keep them a bit more consistent so I have a better idea of how they will be graded. \r\n\r\nI don't know if this is universal, but as a stem major I don't get a lot of opportunities for long form writing, so I find them very valuable. I also find listening to my voice very stressful. As a result, I prefer written assignments to podcasts or posters. I really liked the way we did presentations on our essays, though, it was very cool to hear what other people in the class were working on.",
                "I thought this course was so great because it was equally technical as well as engaging with discussions and guest speakers.",
                "Strengths is that the professors have organized the course in a manner that is very accessible  Weakness is that there was a lot of reading each week"

                "Yes!! If you are at all motivated by the material, take this class! Of course, I can't speak to whoever will be teaching this in the future, but the material is so so important (Yale please keep this class), and all the ed studies teachers are amazing. You will be sitting in the room with a bunch of other passionate students. Many of us had a personal/familial connection to the material, and it was amazing to hear so many diverse perspectives.",
                "Yes, I think this is a good course to take if you are interested in the subject, or some element of the subject. It does a good survey of general disability theory and you also get a good sense of the education system and IDEA.",
                "Yes! This course was designed to facilitate student learning and for us to take the topic and dive into niches that most interested us.",
