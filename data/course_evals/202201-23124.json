The psets were great applications of what we learned in class. Open note midterm and final policy are very real-world and much appreciated.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none!",

                "I think that the assignments for the course are good - they don't take too much time but are still helpful for understanding the material. I also appreciate Elena's emphasis on understanding edge cases for common metrics like the R^2 coefficient for linear regression.",
                "Strengths: Elena is very nice, grading is fair. \r\nWeaknesses: engagement with course topics feels surface level, so it sorta felt like we spent a lot of time on a very small amount of material, but then we werent really equipped to handle any serious problems.",

There is an abundance of in-class examples and homework assignments for students to gain hands-on experience with implementing each technique on a new dataset. The purpose of each technique is also explained clearly. However, the questions on the quizzes seem disconnected from the lecture content.",

Also, while the problem sets were difficult at times, they did a good job of illustrating concepts and how they work. Our exams were timed and take-home, which helped alleviate a lot of finals-week stress.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The problem sets weren't very representative of the midterm and test, which had questions that seemed a little out of left field, and seemed much more conceptual than we had discussed.",

                "Strengths: relatively well organized. The provided class slides and code were useful.\r\n\r\nWeakness: doesn't really cover any new material in depth. It was more like a review of concepts that we have already learned before.",

It was also nice to have the opportunity to do a final project on any dataset of my choice! It was also relatively engaging/interesting. Weaknesses: the flow of information was sometimes unclear (how one topic led to another)/I would have liked to have spent a little more time on topics that showed up heavily on the midterm (such as design matrices and factors).",

The only thing I would say is that sometimes it felt like too much time was spent on going over the same easier material, while more complex content was glanced over. I do think that the practice exercised in class were very helpful and helped to understand the material better!",

I did not feel like I learned that much or was intellectually stimulated, which was ironic provided that this is a 300-level class that Sekhar (our DUS) insisted I take. One can take S&DS 220 and learn everything covered in this \"advanced\" course.",

                "Yes, if the student is looking for an upper-level stats class to fulfill requirements. Otherwise, if you are interested in the certificate or learning about data analysis techniques, I would still recommend this class as you probably will learn new material!\r\n\r\nIf you have taken many S&DS electives, there may be significant overlap in the covered content.",

I'd say this class helped me get my post-grad job; a lot of these skills are essential for the industry jobs! If you're already coming from a more advanced stats background, this class may be too easy, and you'll end up worrying over some trivialities to do well in this class.\r\n\r\nAlso, Elena is really pretty imo, so if you need some extra motivation to go to class...",

This course would be great for someone in their second or third year of the S&DS major, especially the second year because it covers some very foundational topics that other S&DS courses use but don't teach. Elena is an AMAZING professor, and it was incredible to have a female S&DS professor for the first time! I am a female S&DS major, and it meant a lot to me.",

                "Honestly maybe not. If youre looking to get a general sense for the data analysis topics you should be looking into and get some practice with basic applications, then take it. But if you want to study the intricacies of those topics, I feel like it would be more useful to just research them on your own. I was not really engaged by this class.",
                "Yes. Elena is very nice and the class is well organized. Nothing too intense or challenging either which is nice.",
                "Yes. If you want to be a data scientist and deal with a large amount of data, this course is just for you.",
                "Absolutely! The content is very useful and helpful in a broad variety of statistical settings, and quite interesting to learn as well.",
                "Yes, though if you took S&DS 230 you might find some parts of this course to be a bit repetitive (more in depth though, so if you didn't pay attention in 230 you'll probably learn a bit even from the repeated topics)",
                "Yes",
                "yes",
                "Yes! You learn real skills and get a feel for what data analysis involves. Its also super low workload! A great class to develop R skills and get a feel for what to do when you see a new data set.",
                "I would recommend this to another S&DS student who has not taking a practical course in order for them to feel comfortable using R, which is a very popular language for most statistical research. The practical nature of the course lends itself well to students who have a strong theoretical background, such as by taking S&DS 241 and 242, by expanding their programming and analytical skills.",
                "Yes, it's good practice with R.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, good upper level s and ds class. Material overlaps a lot with Linear Models (312)",
                "Yes I would. It's not incredibly engaging, but you leave the course more comfortable working with data and learn some practical insights in the field of data science.",
                "Yes as this course is really practical and useful!",
                "No, again, there are other courses (eg. linear models) that teach the exact same material in a better way.",

                "Yeah, definitely. This is a must-take for S&DS majors - a practical class that has the perfect blend of theory and applications. The workload is very reasonable too (6 shorter psets, one every two weeks roughly, plus open laptop exams: a midterm exam and a final exam/project) and there is plenty of help in office hours and on Ed Discussion (the best question-answering course staff I have had at Yale). Elena is an awesome instructor, so I'd highly recommend taking it with her if she's offering 361 again. If you have taken 242 and 230, you definitely have the background to get a whole lot out of the class. You get out what you put in, since there are always ways to go above and beyond on assignments, but what's required is fairly minimal compared to other related classes. In all, 361 is a really good class for learning tools that will be useful however you use statistics in the future.",
                "If you are looking for an easy class where you won't learn much, then yeah. It's very chill. But sometimes, the work can just become annoying to do because it just seems like busywork. \r\n\r\nThe exams and quizzes are extremely frustrating because they are basically trivia questions. Elena even acknowledges this to be true because on the final, she states that these questions \"are not trivia\" at the top of the exam. As a result, the midterm and quizzes do not accurately reflect how well a student understands the course material.",
