But, more importantly, I gained important knowledge about how to think critically about my sources and engage with them in dynamic ways, rather than just accepting their biases and methodologies.",
                "Deep dive into archival work. We learned a lot about the archival process. Also, read and discussed some high quality literature in African American Studies.",
                "This class exposed me to various works of African American Literature in the James Weldon Johnson Collection and, in turn, I feel like I have more knowledge of the content, politics, and meaning of the works studied as well as an understanding of how connected Black writers in the 20th century were. I learned how to successfully navigate the Beinecke library system, build my analytical ability when engaging with archival material, and greatly improve my writing skills with the reading room exercises. One of the most interesting insights from this class was our acknowledgment of Yale's complicated history regarding the acquisition of the James Weldon Johnson Collection and subsequent discussion about the place of students to engage with this collection ethically.",
                "We learned how to use the archives for scholarly research; how to interpret archival material from letters to photos to handwriting; how to use the archives as a resource alongside our readings of notable African American literature (e.g. Zora Neale Hurston, Richard Wright, Langston Hughes, etc). One of the most rewarding and tangible practices was going into the Beinecke reading room for various writing assignments throughout the semester. There, we learned how to physically interact with archival material and form our own conjectures about what the author's original intentions, relationships, etc.",
                "I learned how to use the Beinecke archives and how to best honestly and responsibly use archival materials. I also developed my research writing, as well as trying critical fabulation.",
                "I got great practice doing research in the Beinecke, and a fascinating look at how archives are put together, what they mean, and the ethical questions involved in archivism that will inform every other academic project I engage with in Yale and beyond."

                "Strengths of this class were definitely 1) Melissa and Kassidi, who deeply care for the success of their students both in and out of the classroom; and 2) the days we spent discussing different aspects of archival artifacts, which usually occurred on Wednesday.  The only weakness was that I wish we had time to discuss the literary texts themselves more, but I also think that that sort of analysis is not the object of this class, so once I realized that I did not see it so much as a weakness.",
                "The strength of this course is definitely how flexible and friendly Melissa and Kassidi were while also facilitating interesting, fun, and useful discussion. The only weakness was that we didn't get to be in person!",
                "Strengths: Dr. Barton was a huge strength. She's empathetic, flexible and just an incredible human being. I always felt like I could talk to her about anything and she went above and beyond to make sure everyone was comfortable in the class. She also put a lot of care into the syllabus and the extensive class pages she made for every class. The material in this class was also AMAZING! We read a lot of texts I had been hoping to read at some point anyway -- great pieces of literature like Native Son. I loved all my visits to Beinecke and interaction with archival pieces as well. It was really cool to be physically touching such historic and original pieces -- especially during a pandemic. I loved the assignments we had to do. The workload was high enough that I felt I was putting things together but not so much so that it felt overwhelming. I will also say (and this is big for me), this class has a very respectable and manageable reading load. There were very few weeks I didn't finish all of the reading. This is INCREDIBLY uncommon at Yale. Most classes give out more reading than anyone can possibly do and that usually means I read none of it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1000% the people in my class. This was the worst classroom environment of my time at Yale and it had nothing to do with the professor or TA (who's also great). From my first day in this class, I felt people thoroughly judged what others said. They seemed to self-separate into the academic elite. There was a clear divide between those studying the humanities who were well versed in what we were reading and those who were trying to learn from the ground up in this class. Further, NO ONE participated even though they thought they were so much smarter than their peers. This included in breakout rooms which were often quite awkward. Further, I understand and LOVE that we interrogated the ethics of archives including Yale's. However, I often felt like in these conversations, students antagonized Dr. Barton which was unfair. She is not the institution. And the issues with Beinecke's accessibility, history, etc are much more deeply rooted institutional issues.  I've never felt such an unwelcoming environment in a class (and again this has nothing to do with the prof and TA).",
                "I think the workload of this course was really well thought out. Having three page papers removes a burden of stress but simultaneously helped build my concise reasoning\/writing skills, which I feel makes me a better writer all around. I also appreciated that there were two final project options and that neither was an overwhelming amount of work. Further, the reading content of the course and reliance on outside primary sources was incredibly interesting and engaging, though I do think it could be difficult to keep up with some of the longer novels we read.",
                "The strength of the course is in the premise itself. There is a wealth of knowledge and material in the archives at Yale, and tapping into that space is incredibly fulfilling and rewarding. Especially during a semester of Zoom, being able to go into the Beinecke and interact with material there, see material during class (via screen share), and share ideas\/material with peers was something I began looking forward to doing each week. A suggestion that I would propose is for more written feedback on our weekly Canvas posts and\/or questions. Forming conclusions about what we read\/see in the archives is difficult, and I think having more regular feedback as we learn the ropes would be helpful! I think it'd be also interesting to learn about what other classmates have been looking at in the archives -- more info-sharing would be a great added element as well.",
                "Strengths -  very engaging course, good mix of lecturing and discussion. Assignments allow for a lot of freedom of focus, with very detailed feedback. There is also a good balance of the amount of reading we do with the written assignments, and the course moves very smoothly through each topic.\r\nWeaknesses - the example projects we were given for the final assignment were very helpful, so I think that some kind of example could have been helpful for the earlier assignments as well.",
                "This course was fantastic. Professor Barton adapted incredibly well to the challenges of meeting virtually, and made better use of zoom rooms and canvas pages than any other professor I've had. With that said, the course will be even better in some ways, I'm sure, when people can meet in person to look at physical documents together."

                "I think we made a good use of virtual archives. I enjoyed watching Melissa present materials herself in Beinecke, but it felt more difficult to engage with those materials.",
                "I think all of the practices in this course succeeded!",
                "The use of breakout rooms was great. Participation wasn't always ideal but I enjoyed the opportunities to engage in a different way.",
                "Having the page of the day on canvas was a really effective way to keep the course organized for the students. Further, I think the format of discussion based breakout rooms (regarding a reading, primary source, etc.) allowed me to feel very engaged with the coursework while not being overwhelmed with the prospect of speaking in front of the whole class. Generally, it can be stressful for instructors to pop into zoom breakout rooms so if there was any way to limit that occurrence it would help improve the course.",
                "Break out rooms and screen share -- anything to break the regular monotony of an hour plus long seminar -- have been extremely helpful. Sharing different media in class (videos, audio, pictures) was also greatly appreciated, as well as any breaks to read\/turn our cameras off.",
                "I think normally the course would involve visits to the reading room in class, allowing us to see the materials as we discussed them. The normal class discussion and lecture portion translated well on Zoom, but not being able to actually use the materials in class did take some away from the experience. However the instructors using the document camera and images were the best that could be done under the circumstances, and we still were able to go in alone!",

However, the course does lean more history than most other English courses, which I wasn't expecting, so I would just keep that in mind if you are looking for an English course to take.",
                "Yes! This course is awesome and Professor Barton is so kind and accessible. If you have any interest in exploring the archives at Yale (which should include everyone) then you must take this class. So basically everyone at Yale should take this class!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this to another student, no matter what their major is. Our class consisted of a combination of English, AfAm studies, and History majors but it's really relevant to any humanities field in terms of how we thought about our sources, methodologies, and the authors we were reading.",
                "Yes I would! This class is worth it for Dr. Barton alone. She's an incredible professor who puts a lot of time and effort into making the class accessible and organized. The class pages we had for each class were so efficient and helpful. The workload was also super manageable. I would consider Credit\/Ding because the grading isn't easy by any means, but it's a great course. \r\n\r\nMy one big caveat to that though is to pay attention to the people in the class and general vibe of the classroom. I really did not enjoy the peer environment in this class. There was a sense of elitism -- in which the people who study the humanities and have the skills and language looked down on the contributions of others. People would also frequently go after Dr. Barton in class in ways that weren't fair. She works for Yale but she does not represent the institution. I'm glad we were reckoning with the ethics and history of Beinecke, but I think people often treated Dr. Barton as the antagonist which wasn't great.",
                "Yes. This is one of the most interesting and engaging courses that I've taken at Yale. The content of the class is really well thought out and you will be exposed to a wide array of sources in the archivesmanuscript drafts, letters, photographs, etcthat all provide a more personal insight at prolific literary figures such as Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. In addition to developing your own analytical skills while engaging with primary sources, Prof. Barton provides a lot of additional knowledge which helps facilitate learning. We read a couple of novels in this class which can be difficult to keep up with, but for the most part the workload is perfect (three 3 page papers and the option of a project based final) so this definitely won't be a class you stress to keep up with. Highly recommend, take it if you can!",
                "I would 100% recommend this course. I think everyone should learn the history behind the Yale archives, and the readings and archival material that were chosen for the class were both engaging and relevant. I found that having the opportunity to explore material that interested me personally was a very rewarding experience, and Melissa is extremely helpful in shaping your experience with the Yale archives. If you are curious about archival research and want to read some texts by some brilliant Black writers, you should consider taking this class.",
                "I definitely would! This appeals to anyone interested in the subject, in any major. Using the archives and being able to deep dive into writer's experiences is fascinating and a rare opportunity. The workload is also very manageable and the instructors are very understanding and supportive.",
                "Yes! If you are doing any kind of historical or literary research that involves an archive, you owe it to yourself to take this course and learn about how archives are put together, and the fascinating ethical questions involved in creating a collection that deals with questions of racism and black liberation."
