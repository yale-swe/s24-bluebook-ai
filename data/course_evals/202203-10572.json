More importantly though, by in Prof Knobe's helpful guiding of a debate-like (but chill) class discussion, I also learned how to think critically about how evidence might or might not support theories in social science. Finally, devised as an assignment to produce a piece of original work in this domain, the final project taught me a lot about model-building in the social sciences.",

                "Strengths: 1. Prof Knobe is an amazing human and a fantastic seminar leading. The fact that he's one of the pioneers of the domain of the class is only the icing on the cake. 2. The material itself is intuitive enough to be easy to grasp, yet complex enough to motivate a lot of thought (and self-reflection). 3. The only assignment is the final paper, which makes the class pretty low on workload. Weaknesses: 1. Perhaps the fact that there were no graded assignments made the final project a little stressful.",
