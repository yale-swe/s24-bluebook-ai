                "More structure, other wise great.",
                "Strengths - Professor Latham is really knowledgeable about different topics in bioethics, so it's an amazing opportunity to ask some interesting questions. Prof. Latham also brought in a great guest speaker at one point. The research paper is also a great opportunity to delve into one topic. Weaknesses - Prof. Latham seems to use the course a bit for research purposes. In other words, he's learning along with us. It possible to study topics that are super current, but sometimes the readings weren't a great fit for discussion.",
                "Strengths: You don't have to do any work. To be fair to Professor Latham, he does have extensive knowledge that does come out, and you do have freedom to write your final topic based on something related to the class so you do not have to do all of your own research unrelated to the class. He also invited an interesting guest, Sophie Grace Chappell. Weaknesses: You don't learn anything. There is absolutely no syllabus or guidance at any point. He would assign readings only at the end of class, and only if someone reminded him, and sent just a sheet of links for our week on gun control. In the class, he didn't really bring out conversation from everyone, just gave his take and moved on, and most of the time class ended 5-10 minutes early. For the final paper, he never met with us or talked about our final papers, and even now we have no idea what our grades are or will be.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Readings were very engaging, and I appreciated being able to discuss entire books rather than a bunch of short articles\r\n- Discussions were interesting\r\n- I absolutely loved the guest speaker, Sophie Grace Chappell! Her insight was so valuable and I found myself talking with friends about her philosophy outside of class because I found it so compelling. I think that more guest speakers could add even more to the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- We may have benefitted from more support throughout the semester on our final essays",
                "There were no strengths to this course. The course was conducted as a lecture, where the professor sat in the front of the room, and all of the students faced him. There was zero student-to-student discussion throughout the entire semester, as Professor Latham would ask a question, allow a singular student to answer, and then proceed to talk for a minimum of five minutes about his opinion on the subject before asking another question to the class. Usually, students' hands were raised to participate for several minutes, during which Professor Latham would look at them dead-on and continue speaking for several minutes. Professor Latham did not bother to learn the names of the 15 students, and relied on \"you\" and \"you in the back\" to call on students. The course readings were unengaging and weak compared to the potential of the course. Moreover, Professor Latham literally did not respond to a single email I sent him this semester. The same was true for most other students in the class. This professor is incredibly disappointing and a classic example of academic arrogance and mediocrity."

                "Look, if you're a senior or anyone looking to take a nothing course, this is it. If you're interested in the topic and want to learn, take Bioethics and Law. If you're interested in making the most of 1/36th of Yale, don't take it. This class was, quite frankly, a waste of my time and I really regret taking it. I would have learned more by dedicating 1 hour per week to reading bioethics-related news, reading 1-2 of the books independently, and writing a 10 page paper at the end. It doesn't really do anything to meaningfully apply political science or economics to bioethics topics, and not all of the topics even felt like bioethics issues. To be fair it is a really easy credit and you can phone in most of the semester, which may be something you need. Just be aware that you won't know anything about your grade and you really won't learn anything you couldn't have learned all by yourself.",
                "Yes! I really liked that the course is mostly seniors who are passionate about these topics, and the discussions and readings are valuable. The final essay is a bit intimidating since it is the only grade in the class, but Professor Latham is a reasonable grader and I would recommend emailing him for feedback before the deadline to make sure you're on the right track.",
                "I would recommend this course to a senior who does not care about whether or not they learn something. For all other students, this course was painfully boring and frustrating."
