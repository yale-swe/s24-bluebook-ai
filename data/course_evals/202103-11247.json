But almost immediately I learned how to have a short conversation. By the end of one semester I have basic communication and comprehension skills - the level of which which took me years of taking a different language in high school to learn.",
                "I'm astounded by my quick growth in Italian over the past semester! Prior to this course, I didn't know a single word in Italian. Now, I'm able to watch films, listen to dialogues, and read in Italian, and generally have an understanding of the plot. I picked up tons of Italian vocabulary and acquired an understanding of grammar (articles, verb tenses, indirect/direct object pronouns, etc.)",
                "I learned so much from this class. You learn the basics needed to speak, read, and write. If I was dropped in ITaly I wouldn't be fluent at all, but I would not be completely lost.",

There's a lot of vocab to study, but putting in a bit of time every day will give you a good understanding of Italian by the end of the semester. The first few weeks can be tough because the class is taught in Italian but you don't know any yet.",
                "This course was great! The biggest strength was Michael Farina, he is a phenomenal professor and does a very good job of investing in his students.",

He is always there to help and encourage and he makes even the challenges of the course manageable. The course did not have many weaknesses, but at times it did feel like it was going a bit fast. The daily quizzes were also challenging and a bit nerve-wracking at first, but they forced me to keep up with my work which made the course easier in the long run.",
                "Strengths: fast-paced, encourages quick learning, highly engaging/never boring, aligns closely with textbook, daily quizzes to self-assess and ensure we stayed on track \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: would've loved more opportunities for student-student dialogue",
                "I loved everything about this class.",
                "This course gave a broad view of the Italian language and culture. The work directly connected to what was being taught.",
                "The intimate environment of the class and the fact that its everyday truly allowed me to build on my language skills quickly. The choice of exercises, homeworks and everyday quizzes were highly useful.",

This class, like all L1 languages, can a bit demanding as it requires you to put in work every single day to make sure you're staying afloat (missing class makes it easy to fall behind if you don't stay on top of the reading). So if you're interested in this class to get an easy A, there are better options. But if you want to learn Italian (and probably still get an A if you're willing to work hard), then this is a great class.",

                "Yes! Italian is a fun language to learn and if you are going to do so, you should definitely take the course with Michael. Even the hard parts of the class were fun and I looked forward to it every morning.",
