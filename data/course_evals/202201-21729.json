                "I learned so much! Just a few of the things I learned are: challenges of children's theater, the state of children's theater today, different philosophies around children's theater, how to put together and perform short pieces in limited time, etc. I've grown immensely as an artist and as a person interested in working with children.",
                "The most important insight: that TYA is a flourishing branch of theater in urgent need of care, investment, community collaboration, and humanity. What ingredients of storytelling architecture, theme, music, humor, and audience participation (criteria our class developed!) does TYA needs to be resonant for children and families. I and many of my peers really took this mission to heart--along with the power of TYA's brand of captivating, compassionate storytellingand I left this class so compelled in the power of the medium. I want to pursue a career in YA theater and literature now!"

                "This course was absolutely beautiful and has the best atmosphere, I cannot think of a weakness.",
                "This class was incredible. The professors and students brought great warmth, enthusiasm, and insight into the classroom. I felt encouraged and safe stretching outside of my comfort zone. Students had a lot of autonomy, so we could mold the class to make it what we wanted it to be. Assignments and activities were creative, enjoyable, and informative.\r\n\r\nThe only weaknesses of the class were that many readings were fairly old and the class was occasionally disorganized, particularly towards the end as we started running out of time. The final project, in particular, was a bit chaotic. Overall, however, the class was wonderful.",
                "STRENGTHS: incredible professors both with extensive theater/TYA experience! They brought us to consider important questions about TYA today, probe the creative depths of our childhood, and grow as creators. A close class community of students who gave so much of themselves throughout the course. Insightful readings and assignments that really challenge you! No weaknesses!"

                "Yes!!! This class was revelatory, largely because it involved so many creative projects--or tudes, mini-productions of TYA. Our projects were original, fun, all performed in front of each other--not to mention group-based (one of the first times I *thoroughly* enjoyed working with peers academically)and inspired by our discussions, fascinating TYA readings (+ some fantastic plays!), conversations with big time TYA practitioners and directors, our own work, and Professor Margolin and Roberts' insights. LOVED this course--it helped me realize one of my passions (and even helped me, and all of us, gain an industry connection in the TYA world!)"
