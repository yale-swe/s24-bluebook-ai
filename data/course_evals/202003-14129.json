The most interesting part was looking back on Reconstruction with a critical eye and determining whether or not it was a radical change (and what a radical change even means).",

                "I learned a lot more about essay writing and what makes a good essay. I also learned a lot about how Reconstruction has shaped and continues to shape America today. This class really reshapes how you think of Reconstruction. It's a shame that this period always sort've gets brushed over in American History, but Professor Shinn does a really good job of shining the light on the different historical and cultural facets of the time period.",
                "Learned about different and often uncovered aspects of Reconstruction including immigration at this time, differences in urban and rural black life, political and economic history, etc. Was exposed to a lot of fascinating primary sources and learned about the different ways of interpreting and judging Reconstruction as a failure or success, but with much greater nuance than was presented in history classes. It was also my first history seminar so I learned how to write primary source analyses and argumentative historical papers.",
                "In terms of historical knowledge, I gained a more detailed understanding of the Reconstruction period, including the legal framework of the period and some of the social and economic patterns. I came out of the class with a better understanding of how incredibly complex Reconstruction was, as we studied the progress and lack of progress in both the North and South, by both the wealthy elite class and the freedmen in the South.",
                "I learned about the potential of Reconstruction, reasons that potential was not lived up to, and a lot about different perspectives and aspects of American society between the 1860s-80s. I improved my writing and analysis of historical sources.",
                "Thanks to an extensive, thematically and geographically diverse reading list, captivating once-a-week lectures, and critical-minded discussions, I developed a deepened understanding of a very important yet overlooked period of American history. I came away convinced that from a political and racial perspective, Reconstruction was one of the most \"radical, revolutionary and transformative times in our history. The movement touched every region differently, and was vulnerable to shifts in political fortunes and severe, violent backlash. This is also a great class in which to develop historical writing skills, by virtue of the assignments (blogs, primary source analysis, argumentation, original research).",

                "I liked the format of having one meeting every week serve as a lecture to provide information about Reconstruction and give us context for the later discussion.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Shinn clearly knows a lot about Reconstruction and it showed in his lectures, which were very organized, clear, and full of loads of interesting detail. He is also very open to feedback for papers and to talking in general in office hours. He's just a very nice, pleasant guy to be around. The readings are also, on their own, very eye opening and do a great deal to expand you to a wide range of perspectives that are not covered in normal history classes.\r\nWeaknesses: This was my first history seminar so I didn't know what to expect, but discussion was not as illuminating as I thought it would be. It was mostly us just noting specific details from readings. Some days were more engaging than others, but by the end of the course I lost a decent amount of engagement (maybe it was just Zoom). Also feels like class discussion can become a bit of an echo chamber? Like some people bringing up points and everyone nodding, as opposed to interesting takes, although maybe this is the nature of history classes.",
                "This course was really incredible in general. Its strengths include how engaging it was, how well-taught it was, etc. I cannot think of any significant weaknesses.",
                "The material is very interesting, and the lectures were very organized. Some weeks had a lot of reading, but most weeks it was manageable, and the readings were interesting for the most part. I also liked the Tuesday lecture, Thursday discussion format so we could get some background on the topic of the week before discussing it.",
                "STRENGTHS: James Shinn, for one, is a caring and kind professor, great at lecturing and managing discussions that students push in any direction. He very much values what students think about the material. I found the lecture-seminar hybrid very effective in balancing students learning styles (listening and Q&A one day, seminar the other day), and also appreciated the thematic lenses through which we covered Reconstruction. Students will emerge from this class with a thorough and nuanced perspective of the period. \r\nWEAKNESSES: I cant think of any!",
                "This course provides an excellent overview of the period and supplements this understanding with specific stories that illustrate larger historical trends and phenomena. While I would have liked to have more drafts and revisions of the final paper and fewer readings, I thoroughly enjoyed this seminar."

Either a lot of people wanted to talk and we sort've lost track as a class who wanted to speak and who didn't. I mean there's nothing you could really do about this cause it's just a bad format to have over zoom. But I will say that I really liked the one class lecture and one class seminar that Shinn adopted. It was very nice too because he recorded all that information which came in clutch during the essay.",

                "It was fine. Aside, from some technical difficulties with Zoom, there weren't that many differences.",
                "Professor Shinn adapted this course very smoothly to pandemic learning conditions. He even attended Zoom from his lecture room! He made it very easy to attend office hours, or arrange meetings outside of that window. Recorded lectures made revisiting past lectures easy, and we were able to hold just as fruitful discussions on Zoom as well.",

                "Yes! This is a fantastic seminar that really lets you dive into Reconstruction and its origins, how it played out, its effects, etc. There are a lot of readings and to be honest I feel slightly behind on them in the later half of the semester, but they are all really interesting and you end up wanting to do the work. The three papers you write are really engaging (especially the argumentative paper on whether Reconstruction was radical and the research paper\/final) and you get great feedback. Professor Shinn is really engaged with the class!",
                "Most definitely! James really cares about the content he teaches, and cares even more about students getting a good experience out of the class. He holds frequent office hours (more in weeks where papers are due) and always makes himself available outside of those hours as well. He splits up the course between lectures on Tuesday, where he contextualizes the readings for the week, and Thursday discussion of the week's readings.",
                "Absolutely",
                "YES! This course is great. Shinn does a great job of really explaining the material and helping you with your writing giving you clear and concise feedback to really improve your writing skills. He also does a great job of really breaking down the historical material at hand explaining why it is relevant in the grand scheme of things. I will say the readings may be a lot some weak, but it all came together in the end. Also, the discussions were great, I saw the different ways in which other students broke down the material which has definitely reshaped my overall understanding of the period. This is one of the most engaging seminars I've taken at yale.",
                "Yes. I am more interested in political science and philosophy, so I found this history seminar to be a change of pace -- a bit slower, sipping tea around the dinner table discussing our observations -- which had its strengths and weaknesses. The course material, though, is without a doubt fantastic and opened me to so many diverse primary sources. Shinn was very knowledgeable, and this class just touched on so many aspects of a time period that is so rarely covered in US history. Overall, while it was not the most invigorating or challenging, I think it was worth it and a nice exposure to what history seminars are like.",
                "This course was extraordinarily good. I thought the balance between lecture- and seminar-format was great. The lectures were always engaging and informative, pretty much all of the readings were interesting, and the writing assignments were genuinely enjoyable to work on. Even if you aren't 100% interested in studying history, this class is really worth taking. Shinn is all around incredible -- you can tell that he puts immense effort into choosing the readings, etc. Do not miss an opportunity to take one of his classes.",
                "Yes. Reconstruction fell through the cracks of my high school U.S. history curriculum, and after learning in some depth about it, I think it's a time period that really helps contextualize later history and current events. The discussions explored interesting themes, and the class was well-taught. The workload isn't anything crazy, and I definitely got something out of it.",
                "Yes, without a doubt. A valuable opportunity to learn more about a fascinating period most Americans know little about, while engaging with carefully selected primary sources and historical literature in a small seminar environment. Recommended leminar for those not yet fully accustomed to seminars or already enrolled in other seminars. Note that, like most history classes, and despite the lectures, this course heavily relies on the assigned readingsso be sure you can get them done (theres a fair amount, but its manageable and Professor Shinn is sensitive to your needs). If you're new to history classes, you may consider taking a non-seminar lecture first; on the other hand, this course introduces students to fundamental historical skills. If you are coming in new to intensive History courses (or if you're experienced) be sure to attend office hours frequently, as Professor Shinn is always happy to discuss material, essays, or just get to know you.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in  American history. This class reveals a number of connections between America's past and present injustices and political conflicts."
