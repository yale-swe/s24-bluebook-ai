   "comments": [
    "Comparing and contrasting the mental lives of babies and animals",
    "Since this was a remote class, I learned how to effectively manage my time and prepare for remote learning. Additionally, I have developed a newfound admiration for cognitive science.",
    "Within 48 hours of a baby being born, the child has enough grip strength to support its body weight. Hang your 30 hour old baby from a clothesline.",
    "I learnt loads about childhood development, psychology of adults, babies and animals and all aspects of cognitive development",
    "I learned a lot of concepts within the psychology\/cognitive science field.",
    "The similarities of babies and animals, in addition to what advanced cognitive abilities are \"uniquely human.\"",
    "I learned about some more nuanced perspectives on developmental psychology, and evidences for the overall class pitch that animals and babies are more capable and complex than most mainstream psychology has historically assumed. Super interesting and easy enough to follow with no college psychology experience.",
    "I learned about babies and animals.",
    "I learned how to integrate information for multiple sources (readings, lectures, discussions) to solidify knowledge of concepts. I learned new material about the psychology of a demographic I was not previously exposed to.",
    "Learned about basic cognitive functions that are present in babies and different animals.",
    "I was able to develop an understanding of the cognitive, social and emotional capacities of babies and other animal species."

   "comments": [
    "too much content at once. The lectures are very long and dense",
    "The section reviews were way too long. It is unreasonable to have kids attend 2 hour zoom sessions.",
    "Strengths - interesting and engaging lectures and sections, diversity of content, passion of professors\/TA, fair exams that covered a lot of the material\r\nWeaknesses - some of the readings felt unnecessary and time consuming \r\n\r\nI think due to the nature of the course, it would benefit more from being in a normal semester timelines so that the lectures can be more spread out since all of the work was bunched up at the start of the week in order to be fully prepared for the first section on Monday",
    "The concepts were interesting, and Professor Wynn and my TA Ashley definitely were very knowledgeable. The flipped classroom model lended itself to a LOT of homework (readings plus watching lectures), though.",
    "I think that the grading of the exams was a component we hadn't gone over, and I found the grading of the short answer questions to be critical to our success. I wish we had gone over how to answer the questions, rather than just what to answer\/include and understanding the content- both of those categories were taught very thoroughly.",
    "Strengths: TAs and Professor Wynn are extremely knowledgeable and very engaging with the readings, lectures and curriculum. I enjoyed the discussion and small sections as I was able to ask questions and speak directly to my classmates and the TA and prof. No weaknesses",
    "The video lectures were great and very informative. I liked how the discussions sessions were formatted (question and answer).",
    "Little to no feedback along the way due to the fact that the only assignments are the two exams.",
    "I found the course to be full of intriguing material (well-balanced between conceptual knowledge and specific examples)."

   "comments": [
    "yes, if they are willing for the challenge",
    "Yes this course was very engaging and very insightful",
    "It's interesting material! Watch the lectures, come to discussion with questions about anything you don't understand, do well on exams (my final is in 3 hours lol). Psets aren't graded and serve as a guide for you while going through lectures.",
    "Yes - one of the best courses that I have taken at Yale. It is a shame it is only offered during the summer",
    "Yes! Even if you haven't taken Intro to Psychology, you'll be fine--you'll learn a lot! The classes were pretty short and I couldn't always get questions answered and the workload was pretty heavy, but it was manageable.",
    "Yes; it was enjoyable and the Professor and TA were both very helpful and invested in our learning experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course. Professor Wynn knows a TON about babies and animals and I felt that I was genuinely receiving and retaining the information that I was learning. She's funny and I was very engrosses in the fascinating information. Only a midterm, final, and participation (which is a good portion of grade, so speaking up and interacting with the lectures and readings is important. I found this only facilitated my learning and was able to hear great insights from my classmates). 100% would recommend!",
    "Yes! The information is super interested and it is not a super demanding workload.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. It covers material that is hard to find in other Psychology courses.",
    "YES"
