    "I learned a lot about the content of the topic and about how to improve my writing. The environment fostered by the instructor made me more comfortable to share my writing  with peers to improve it.",
    "I did acquire a wider range of knowledge and insight from taking Eng 114. I learnt how to effectively write a research paper. Which I believe is very instrumental and useful to my success in the coming semesters. \r\nI also learnt to constructively engage in an academic discussions, respecting the views of others whilst putting my views across as well.",
    "I am much better at analyzing papers as well as my own",
    "I have developed many key writing skills.",
    "This class has taught me how to be a better writer in terms of how a college paper should look like and what kind of information professors are asking for when writing any kind of paper, especially like a research paper which a different class of mine required of me. I've also learned about the different health movements that have occurred or are currently happening in the world that I wouldn't have heard of in any other environment. I've learned how important it is for multiple drafts and for peer editing because that helped me a lot when I was writing my papers."

   "comments": [
    "This was a very interesting course, and Meredith is an absolute gem. The only thing is that we didn't get a ton of feedback on our first drafts, and if we did get feedback, it generally came extremely late.",
    "The environment was great, as was the instruction on editing papers. However, I feel like we could have spent more time in class to actually improve our writing.",
    "To the best of knowledge, Eng 114 was a fun class and I learnt a lot.",
    "The strengths of this course include interesting readings and engaging assignments.",
    "The professor was wonderful.",
    "We wrote multiple types of papers which was nice to practice writing for different kinds of papers, and I think my writing has gotten better. The professors really try to make sure that the students are learning and provide help for them through checkups or just by asking in class, so there's lots of time for you to ask them questions about your paper. I really liked that our drafts had a due date, so that we could edit them in class and also had an extra week to edit them for the final draft. However, the prompts sometimes confused me, so I had a difficult time trying to think of what I wanted to write about, and for these kinds of classes there is no break between any of the papers, so be prepared to write paper after paper. I think if the articles and prompts we got were a bit easier to understand, I might have found an easier time with my essays."

    "Yes! Super interesting topic and wonderful professor. Everyone was super engaged.",
    "Yes! If the topics in the short course description interest you, the course is great. It was quite challenging with the readings at first but we worked through understanding them and I learned a lot about the complex intersection between health and religion\/morality.",
    "Yes, I will recommend that every student take Eng 114 because it is the best foundation to succeeding almost all the other courses at Yale. Students would learn to write research papers, engage in academic discussions etc.",
    "I would recommend this course for the interesting readings",
    "I would recommend. The workload isnt too much but one still learns",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially a first year because I think it is best to see what college writing standards are like, and it fulfills a distributional requirement. I think that this class really is helpful to do in the first semester because I had another class that I had to write a research paper for, and we had just written one in ENGL 114, so that helped me a lot in terms of how to find sources and what the organization of the paper should look like."
