                "Overall, how to be a better writer, not just focusing on academic writing but more so writing in general. I learned how to think thoughtfully about a sentence and how I chose my words, I learned how to reflect and appreciate my writing and the journey that got me to each of my weekly pieces.",
                "I greatly improved my writing skills in this course. This course taught us how to be direct and clear in our writing, engaging our craft at the sentence level. I feel I have become a better writer, editor, and even reader as a result.",
                "I learned how to construct sentences that communicate clearly what I am trying to say. I learned how to reflect on what I wanted to write about.",

Everyone is immensely respectful, professor V is extremely helpful, and you learn a lot! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I loved the class just as is!",
                "The most important strength of this course is the quality of feedback people receive on their writing. We all received detailed feedback on every piece, as well as workshops in class. As the semester went on, I think we all gradually began to be able to decouple criticism from (for lack of a gentler word) our egos.",
                "Strengths - small seminar style. Clear learning improvement over course. Learning from professor as well as from other students. Very easy to access feedback and help.\r\nWeaknesses - maybe would have been useful in first couple weeks to have some more guidelines about how to write and what the expectations were. But I guess that is part of the learning curve of the course - to try and to fail.",
                "This was a fantastic course and I think its strength is the emphasis on experimenting with new ideas and strategies. There are no penalties to trying new things in your writing!"

                "YES! 100% It was so pleasant to be able to write every week anything that I wanted to write about and not have to meet a large word count, just two pages double spaced. I felt comfortable sharing my work with the class and learned so much from my process over the weeks, the advice from Professor V, and my classmates. I would strongly recommend everyone at Yale take a class from Professor V. Truly one of my favorite classes I've ever taken.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to any student, and especially anyone who cares about their writing. I think this class was what I was hoping to get from English 120, but in many ways didn't.",
                "Yes - if you are looking to improve your writing in an academic and non-academic capacity. Also if you want to experience a very collaborative small classroom environment. \r\nNo if you are looking for a class that is only about environmental themes/learning.",
                "Yes! This may sound like an intimidating class based on the description, but the workshop format is welcoming to people from all writing backgrounds."
