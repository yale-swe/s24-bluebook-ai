   "comments": [
    "I learned a great deal about how to think about and write for philosophy, and I learned about centuries of Western philosophical thought.",
    "Philosophy timeline of the modern western canon, logical analysis, critical reading, philosophy essay writing.",
    "I learned about some important questions\/responses relating to God, the purpose of life, and morality.",
    "I learnt how to think critically and analyse and arguments made by philosophers. The course also broadened my general perspective and made me reflect on my own life and thoughts because it covered a range of themes like self, faith, our understanding of the world, ethics, morality and so on.",
    "how to write an effective philosophy paper. how to read complex philosophic texts in consideration of its philosophical background or context.",
    "The course was a good overview of modern philosophy, and made me a better philosophical thinker. I also developed my ability to write a philosophy paper.",
    "I learned a ton about modern philosophy and how to analyze and object to a philosophical argument.",
    "I learned how to read, dissect, and interpret tough philosophical works by parsing them into proofs and then critiquing them. We focused a lot on the interactions between and the contexts of the works, as well as the biggest flaws as read by criticism following the publishing of the work.",
    "This course is an excellent way to learn about modern western philosophy in a way that feels relatively comprehensive and cohesive."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I very much enjoyed this course! The combination of lectures and seminars was beneficial in understanding each thinker generally and more specifically. Philosophy also felt less rushed than the other DS courses; we sometimes had several weeks to devote to a single philosopher, which I appreciated.",
    "Overall, great introductory course on modern philosophy.",
    "Strength: some interesting topics\r\nWeaknesses: we move way too fast through very hard thinkers, so unless you are exceptionally talented in philosophy, you will probably be like most of the kids and often confused. But I will say it very much depends on your instructor. If your instructor is good at giving context and simplifying ideas, then you will get a lot out of the class (like I did first semester but not second semester). But for an introduction to this philosophy, this class moves way too fast for meaningful learning.",
    "I would say that the lack of female philosophers is a weakness.",
    "Very engaging material, but perhaps too much.",
    "Professor Franks knows his stuff and you will learn a ton throughout the semester. The one area in which it could be improved is a little more student participation, which I acknowledge is tough because of the difficulty of the texts.",
    "This course was at its best when the whole class would sit around, write out a philosophical argument on the board (such as Mill's argument for Utilitarianism), and then spend the class deriving sophisticated arguments in response to it. Occasionally, the class could get off track discussing a work from classes prior, but for the most part we remained very engaged in the stakes of what we were discussing.",
    "The selections for this course are great for a survey, although there isnt enough 20th-century philosophy, as well as minority\/female authors."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would! I learned a lot about philosophy, Professor Franks was a great professor, and DS as a whole is wonderful.",
    "Yes, esp. to those interested in philosophy and Directed Studies.",
    "I hate to say it, but of all the DS classes, this is the only one I would not recommend to anybody. We moved way too fast through very difficult material, so it was next to impossible to really engage with anything unless your professor was exceptional or if you have an exceptional talent for philosophy.",
    "Yes. DS is a great first year program and even though I personally prefer literature and H&P over philosophy, classes were very enjoyable and the connections we draw across the three, especially with Hegel, Kant, Marx, Mill and so on was invaluable.",
    "Yes, if they are even marginally interested in philosophy.",
    "This course is very different and - in my opinion - much harder than first semester DS Philosophy. Whereas the first semester focused a lot on questions of \"How to live best\" and religious analysis of concepts like perfection, the \"good\", etc., this semester is focused on somehow even more abstract questions, like what is learning (and, is it even possible?), what is morality (very different from first semester notions of ethics), what is the place of subjectivity and objectivity in philosophy, and the ever confusing question of how are synthetic a priori judgements possible?\r\n\r\nIf you're into these sort of discussions, then by all means, you'll love this course. If you don't, still consider it (it's DS, after all), but be warned that the readings are not going to be as philosophically accessible as the philosophy of Plato's earlier dialogues. It'll take a lot of work to build up your own understanding of the thinkers.",
    "Yes. DS is good, and philosophy is great.",
    "Yes - DS gets so good in the spring!",
    "I would recommend this course if the student wanted to dig into the rigouroks and difficult texts of post-Enlightenment philosophy to answer questions of epistemology, skepticism, and ethics.",
    "Definitely. This course effectively builds on fall semester DS philosophy, and it gives a good sampling of most important modern philosophers. The sampling definitely doesnt guarantee that youll know everything about their work (like Hegel), but hopefully its enough to spark interest about a few of them."
