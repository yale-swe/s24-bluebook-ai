                "This class was my favorite class at Yale (yes I am serious). The class was very engaging and well-structured. You will learn in this class as much as you give. My learning process was very steep because this seminar was not like any other economics classes at Yale. Big part of this class relies on our opinions as students, and our deep understanding (sometimes our experiences too) of the material discussed. I learnt so much about economic development mainly in South East Asia. We looked at different fields in the economic development through economic research papers. It was amazing to read those papers because some us graduate from the economics department without reading actual economic research papers. I found that to be very useful as someone who tries to relate the economics I study at Yale to my real life outside Yale. Also, the best part of the class was the final project. It was challenging because you have to come up with your own research idea and present it to the class, but it was fruitful! For all of us, it was our first time to do that. And that it the best part of the class! You get to learn economics in a very different way! It is not about exams or psets, but rather your opinions and thoughts about economic research."

                "The course was very well-structured. Every student had to present readings at least once and lead the discussion which was genius idea because it made the class super engaging. Most of the time it is us the students who were leading the class, and I learnt so much from my peers. Another strength is the final project which allows you to explore your OWN research idea for a potential research paper."

                "Definitely!! I recommend this course to every student but especially those who are interested in pursuing PhD or even masters in economics or development studies. I mean, you finally get to use the R you learn in introductory econometrics to get fascinating results. It was great to also come up with our own research idea and present it on a research poster which is something very common among economists but we rarely hear about in the economics lectures offered at Yale.",
                "Yes definitely, ZBH is a great instructor and really tried to make this class fascinating and engaging virtually. Our class was small (6 students) and we had great discussions about topics in developmental economics."
