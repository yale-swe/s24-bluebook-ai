    "I learned about many different areas of philosophy through the overviews that Prof. Greco provided.",
    "I gained a better understanding of a number of philosophical topics and terms.",
    "I learned about the major debates in the field of philosophy and some of the different approaches to them.",
    "Introductory grasp of several fields and techniques of philosophy.",
    "New way of looking at an array of concepts.",
    "I received a good level of survey knowledge on a variety of important philosophical topics.",
    "I gained significant knowledge of various perspectives surrounding key topics in philosophy. This provided insight into how various philosophers engage with certain topics, and how wording and the structure of arguments play a role in ideas of truth and logic. I developed some skill in expressing myself using language and arguments that placed emphasis on internal logic over the scale\/complexity of the argument itself.",
    "Writing philosophy papers, which was certainly challenging at the beginning of the course.",
    "This course taught me how to structure a logical argument (specific to the field of philosophy, but also useful in general), and I learned the major names and themes of big issues of philosophy.",
    "Learned how to write a philosophy paper and break down philosophical arguments.",
    "I learned how to become a better reader and writer. Especially in writing, I improved through learning how to better organize arguments to make my point more clear.",
    "I developed my ability to write for philosophy and think critically about philosophical issues.",
    "This course gave me an overview of philosophy as a study and greatly aided me in improving my writing and logic.",
    "I gained a rough understanding of the field of philosophy in general, and learned about several philosophers as well. Also, I now have a much better understanding of how philosophy papers are supposed to be written.",
    "Better understanding of the various problems of philosophy, as well as some of the important contributions from various individuals",
    "Sitting through a lecture at 9am, the basics of philosophy",
    "writing philosophy papers",
    "Broad knowledge on philosophical topics, I learned that I have an interest in philosophy",
    "I learned a lot about my own ideologies and even ones that contradicted mine, which was very interesting. Most of the topics covered were very interesting, but seemed redundant at times. I have previously taken a philosophy course and maybe that is why. It was fun to entertain different theories of free will and God, those were my favorite discussions!",
    "From this course, I learned about a wide breadth of philosophical subject areas. In addition, I honed my philosophical writing skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lecture format was a little tough. I think this course wanted to be a seminar, but people weren't engaged enough to really contribute productively to conversations.",
    "Strength: well organized; lots of interesting material.\r\n\r\nWeakness\/Improvement:  The professor tried to be very neutral about his opinion regarding the various topics.  This is good.  However, I also think it would be useful if we had a little more direct back and forth\/debate in class.",
    "The content of this course is simply unbearable at 9am. I would often find myself zoning out and unable to zone back in because the thinking required to follow along was complex.",
    "The content was very interesting. However, the grading paradigm felt unnecessarily punishing. The final exam, in particular, seemed to run counter to the philosophy of the class.",
    "Very interesting topics covered but more in class interaction and debate would be good.",
    "The 9am time for a philosophy class was very hard to focus in class, especially because it was a lecture class rather than a seminar. The topics were broad and interesting, but that also meant reading some obscure current philosophers rather than famous older ones, which is what I'd hoped to be reading.",
    "The course features a strong selection of readings that cover diverse topics and perspectives. The lecture style was well-paced and clear, and writing assignments were reasonable but challenging.\r\n\r\nThis may be intrinsic of most college lecture courses, but to get individual instruction on writing philosophy, students had to either teach themselves these skills through the readings or by deduction, come prepared to the course, or ask outside of class.",
    "Strengths were the significant amount of subjects covered while maintaining a good amount of detail and the feedback\/communication to students",
    "The course had a lot of discussion for how big it was, which was great. Maybe in the future, it could have a separate discussion section or something?",
    "More discussion in class mostly teacher led discussions. Most people who want to discuss already did the reading so perhaps a shorter review on the reading, more time on student thoughts.",
    "A strength is the content.\r\n\r\nProf Greco is great and I understand the course is a lecture but at sometimes variety was needed.",
    "Strengths: I found the course material very interesting and Professor Greco is a very interesting, good lecturer. I really enjoyed the topics we covered and I enjoyed writing the essays for this class as there were many different options to write about.\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures were pretty much just the professor discussing the readings, so they didn't add too much to the content of the class",
    "The interaction between the students and teacher during class is a huge strength of the class. At the same time, I think there were too many people in the class to which the dialogue became overbearing.",
    "I felt that one of the main strengths of this course was how the work was set up. The course followed a clear and manageable schedule. I do think that sometimes the lectures felt a little longer or more drawn out then it needed to be.",
    "One of the strengths of this class were the readings. They were often very interesting and were, in most cases, a reasonable length. However, I found the time in class to be quite mundane because it primarily involved the professor describing the readings and there was very little engagement or discussion from the students. I would recommend offering a discussion section where the topics could be discussed by students more freely, or by spending a portion of class time dividing the class into small groups and delving into the topics. Personally, I find it much easier to grasp concepts like these by talking about them rather than listening to someone talk about them.",
    "The course covered a good variety of material, and offered a broad overview of the various topics that have come up in philosophy. However, despite the class originally being a discussion based class, it was converted into a lecture style class due to the number of people. This greatly lowered the overall level of engagement in the course, and many people opted to not attend lecture thereafter.",
    "Great feedback on essays, too lecture-heavy, which makes the content hard to absorb. If it was more conversation-based we would have been more engaged. \r\nI love the printouts.",
    "strength: the papers and the topics \r\nweakness: quite boring lectures. Not much interaction, rather just the professor talking by himself",
    "Strengths: Easy to understand the lectures, homework were very helpful in doing so.\r\nWeaknesses: Learning philosophy at 9 am can be difficult at times, so moving it to a later time would be helpful! The class wasn't very interactive, I thought it would be more like a seminar.",
    "I get the feeling this course was designed to be discussion-based and likely seminar-sized. It ended up being neither of those -- just a lecture. That was neither an effective nor an enjoyable way to learn philosophy, since the same three or four students would answer Professor Greco's questions all the time, while the rest of us were barely staying awake (though that was likely due more to the time of the class, not the lectures).",
    "I think the course covers a great many topics which is good. The essay topics could reflect that variety a little better."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "For a student who wants a good survey class of various philosophical questions, this is a fantastic choice.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if it were not offered at 9am. The professor is a very interesting lecturer, it is just hard to concentrate on complex content in the morning. I would not recommend the course to someone who is looking for an easy writing credit, while the workload is not that high for a writing class, 3 5-6 page papers, the papers are graded harshly and philosophical writing is not easy for those who have never done it before.",
    "Yes - the content was very interesting, and the teaching style was good.",
    "Yes if they are willing to be challenged on essays.",
    "I probably would not, because it was not what I was looking for in terms of a philosophy course. I think the class was interesting, but I would have preferred something more rigorous or similar to a normal philosophy class. I came out of the class feeling like a learned a little about a lot, but there are classes here that make you feel like you learned a lot about a lot, which I know that the amazing philosophy department has the capability to do here.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning accessible basics of philosophy and practicing their writing, so long as they are willing to supplement this with as much outside help as needed.",
    "Yes as it is a great introduction to philosophy, especially to writing for philosophy.",
    "I would recommend it, mostly because you learn good writing skills and argument structure.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to be introduced to philosophy as it is a survey of topics. I would not recommend it to someone wanting to fulfill their writing requirement because it is a whole new style of writing.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in philosophy because it exposes you to a a broad overview of many topics in philosophy, which can help you find which areas interest you most. The readings are all very interesting and it isn't too much work.",
    "Yes. This  class is a great introduction to a wide variety of philosophy.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is unsure of whether or not they wish to major in philosophy as well as a student who wants a general introduction to philosophy. This is because I feel that this course does not necessarily delve deep into the different areas of philosophy but it definitely gives a good overview.",
    "I'd recommend this course. The content is super interesting and Professor Greco breaks down the readings so that they're easily digestible. I really enjoyed this course.",
    "I might recommend this course to another student, only if they were super interested in learning about philosophy. Although this class was pretty intriguing at times, it was often a bore. It didn't help that it started early in the morning either. So, someone would have to be really into philosophy if I were to recommend it.",
    "I would recommend the course only if the number of people taking the course isn't too high. If there are enough people taking the course such that it is forced into being a lecture style course again, I would not recommend taking the course.",
    "Yes because it effectively gives the intro to the most important philosophers of our time, and a basis for further discussion.",
    "yes, if one is interested in learning how to write philosophy papers",
    "Yes",
    "Not really if they have taken a previous philosophy course. If this is one's first shot a philosophy, it would be a very interesting course to take!",
    "Yes, this is a great introductory course for people to get them interested in philosophy. It's the perfect amount of depth to pique any student's interest."
