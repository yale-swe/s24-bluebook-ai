We developed insight on how to possibly respond to those difficulties and questions through discussion in class, working with some archival material, meeting scholars in the field (even an author of one of the works we read), and forming our own conclusions through three papers as well as a \"Worlding Project,\" an open-ended multimedia assignment towards the end of the semester.",

                "The greatest strength of this course was Professor Xiang's leadership in class. It seems hard to lead zoom classes, but she did a good job. I also liked many of the readings, especially A Grain of Wheat by Ngugi wa Thiong'o. \r\n\r\nThe greatest weakness of this course was probably its early start time. I know this sounds like a ridiculous thing to critique, especially during a time when all courses are online and it seems like it should be easier for students to attend early classes. Still, a lot of students came to class very tired, and because zoom classes are already lower energy than in-person classes, this definitely affected the discussions sometimes.",
                "I loved the readings but there were too many to really fully dig into each one. In the future, I would suggest reading one less text and allocating that time to the rest of the books read in class.",
                "I think one of the key aspects of the course's success was introduced at the very start of class by Prof. Xiang -- she told us that everyone would be given the same participation grade at the end of the semester. This was more of a mental shift than anything, but it immediately made discussion much more welcoming and collaborative during a semester of Zoom where online courses often hurt the interpersonal nature of discussion-based seminars. I think this was something unique to this semester to help create common ground with everyone while we were all scattered throughout the country. With that being said, we were able to really delve into the readings and discuss freely with each other, without some of the pressures of being evaluated at each contribution. The assignments throughout the semester were also well thought out and structured, and the readings were also genuinely interesting. I would just say I wish all my courses had a shared participation grade - I think it does wonders for making the class environment more welcoming, and I think it makes sitting in front of a screen for an hour more enjoyable as well.",
                "Given the nature of the course, it felt like the texts did not build upon one another (was more like a surface level survey of texts from some areas). It honestly felt more like a post-colonial literature course, but regardless, I enjoyed the diversity of the authors whose works we read.",
                "The course follows a natural progression for learning, and Prof. Xiang brought in several authors\/speakers, which was interesting. I wish the syllabus didnt focus so heavily on colonialism, but I guess that cant be helped in an anglophone world literature class. A lot of the books on the syllabus were just hard to read\/get into in general, except Tiangs State of Emergency, which was amazing. I wish some of the assignments could have been broken up into smaller parts, but thats kind of what I expected from a higher-level English course anyways."

                "Any moment where a video, an audio segment could be played -- something that allows our brains to rest -- was very helpful and appreciated. I think all professors need to understand, if they don't already, that being in front of a screen is a lot more taxing than sitting in on an in-person lecture or seminar. Implementing some form of break for eye-strain, for mental concentration, in the form of a multimedia clip or any sort of breather, would be immensely appreciated by any student.",
