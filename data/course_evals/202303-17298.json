Another weakness is that the weekly presentations are not engaging, and they do not provide a good explanation of the weekly readings. A strength is that the readings are very interesting, however, it would be nicer to dive deeper into them.",

                "I felt the readings of the week sometimes would be more digestible if we had a preview of them from the week before. It would help to make connections with policy work better as well when reading about all the different theories."

                "Absolutely. Easily one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. Canfield is a great facilitator, so you get some fun discussions going, and it's a very ed-studies-safe-space vibe, which I think Yale in general could use a lot more of. You really get what you make of this class -- I recommend actually doing the readings every week, as they're very well-selected and engaging. You can genuinely leave this class with a shallow but broad understanding of different critical theories, or you can leave having really engaged with each, and gotten a lot out of it -- not just academically, but personally as well.",

                "Yes, Prog Craigfield was a wonderful instructor and I enjoyed going to each seminar each week. He made the classroom setting a safe space and fostered a productive learning environment."
