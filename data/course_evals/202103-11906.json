In addition, by having the opportunity to apply calculus in more complex contexts, I learned how many of calculus concepts I learned actually apply to the real world and thereby gained a deeper appreciation for calculus.",
                "I learned how to apply calculus to higher dimensions such as 3D and 4D. I also learned important concepts like line integrals, vector surface integrals, partial derivatives, and double and triple integration.",

Definitely got better at integrating things accurately, as well as thinking about math logically. Good tough class where I had to work hard, and it made me grow.",

            "comments": [
                "I think the comprehensive homework given each week was a strength as it gave students the opportunity to really practice the concepts they learned. In addition, the office hours and peer tutoring made help really accessible. One weakness I think is that fact that because there is so much to cover, some of the concepts learned early on in the semester are put to the side until finals.",
                "The course felt very self-taught at many points since most of the actual content was taught through watching videos prior to class time. Class time was only intended to answer questions. However, this ended up not being great because many people still didn't have a good enough grasp on the material to ask questions. The strengths of this course were that it was able to cover a lot of material in depth and that the peer tutors and teaching fellows were extremely supportive and helpful.",
                "I think the strengths of this course are the problem sets and the pre-lecture videos. I learned primarily through the different types of problems on the problem sets and the pre-lecture videos were really helpful in priming my understanding for lecture content. I think the weaknesses are varying engagements of professors across sections  I felt like I learned more from pre-lecture videos, the problem sets, and self-studying than lectures.",
                "Loved the way they used canvas for resources and grades. Gradescope was really helpful for getting feedback on homework and exams. They also did a great job with tutoring; there was always lots of help available when I needed it.",
                "I liked how there were videos available in advance so I could prepare for the class in advance. I wish there was a more consistent homework schedule. Sometimes there would be two assignments due in one week, other times there would be one assignment due in 2 weeks.",
                "I wish my professor had taught the content more herself, rather than relying on pre-class videos.",
                "The strengths of the class was that course was very well structured and all the topics were outlined well on Canvas. The reading were also supplemented with videos and resources like Ximera which I felt very very helpful in grasping the concepts. The practice exams and review session were also very helpful for exams. The weakness of the class would have to be the problems sets were usually very time consuming and sometimes not representative of the problems we would actually see on the exam.",
                "Strengths: Miki is a wonderful teacher, if you can get a section with her (or even a review session) it helps a lot. Practice tests and videos given to us by the class are very useful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of the section leaders are VERY weak teachers. It's really hit or miss from what I've heard. John Hall and Miki are tremendous from what I have heard and Meghan Anderson is very solid. Try to get a section with one of these three! Some friends with the grad students had people who couldn't even solve homework problems on the board...",
                "Strengths include smaller sections and great textbook choices.\r\nWeaknesses include lesser emphasis on weekly pset grades - people end up spending a considerable amount of time on psets (not generally due to the difficulty of the problems, rather the tedious computations involved) and it feels weird knowing that the effort wont be rewarded. Additionally, involving more use of computer graphics in class might be invaluable for better understanding.",
                "Videos were clear and class was effective. It could be improved by having more discussion in class and maybe going through some pset questions during class. I sometimes struggled to understand the application of what we were learning in class to real life.",
                "From my experience, the strength of the course differed between instructors; some classes got more resources and more attentive teaching than others, and it did not feel as though there was consistent learning across sections. The class does do a good job of keeping a singular framework for tests and daily assignments, though.",
                "A weakness of the class was the structure of the teaching that used pre class videos as the main source of instruction with a only summary of the lesson in class.",
                "i believe my integration of basic single variable was a strength that translated to higher degrees of integration. concepts of planes in 3 dimensions was a weakness",
                "Weakness: grading percentages and homework did not always reflect tests. Strength: lots of resources, tutoring, and teaching"

However, if they are not one of those majors, I would recommend that they only take this class if they are willing to commit a lot of time to learning the material by themselves and completing the extremely long Psets.",

                "Yes, definitely. I had to take this for my major and had heard it was super hard so I was worried, but it ended up being not bad at all. It required a good amount of work on the psets and studying for the exams, but overall it felt very fair and there was so much help available. There are videos on each topic by John Hall that are excellent, and there are tutors available almost every day of the week for help, in addition to office hours with the professor. Definitely go for the challenge if you're thinking about it.",
                "Yes, the videos and class are easy to follow along with, and the problem sets are helpful in reinforcing skills.",
                "I would recommend this class to students who are willing to put in the work for the class and is actually interested in understanding the Multivariable Calculus concepts of the class.",
                "It depends. There is an equivalent class in ENAS to this which is a much safer option. But if you can get into a section with Miki, Meghan Anderson, or John Hall then you probably want to take this. The issue is that the people who run the course don't often let students switch sections, so if you aren't with one of the three of the bat it could be tough.",
                "If taking it is necessary to fulfill requirements (most likely in STEM-oriented cases), then yes, otherwise there could be more interesting options.",
                "Yes because it is required for a lot of different majors.",
                "I would not recommend this class in general to students who are new to the material. It is advertised as an introductory math course, but that was not how it felt throughout the year. However, I would recommend this class to students who have a level of familiarity with multivariable calculus. It is definitely possible to succeed in the class if you have worked with the material before.",
