                "I thought that Professor Adelstein did a great job of introducing concepts by building on prior understandings. He would talk us through two-dimensional examples, and then move to multivariate examples, which gave us a far stronger intuitive grasp of concepts. I am sometimes frustrated with math classes that introduce abstract computations without grounding them in why and how the process works. Our class never felt like that; I always knew why and how we chose different approaches for different problems. And many of our concepts circled back to overlap and reaffirm each other. I would have appreciated a clearer syllabus with a list of topics we would cover each day and ahead of the midterms / finals. Each day was a surprise, which kept the class interesting, but I found slightly stressful. Nonetheless, a great class!",
                "Overall this course was great. Ian was a great teacher and the material was interesting. The material that was discussed did could feel limited in scope at times.",
                "strengths: Ian, he is a great professor; 118 is a GREAT option to ditch the 115 and 120 if you don't need them. I'm a humanities major trying to get data science experience, and my last math class was literally in high school, and this class was not hard at all. as long as you attend lecture, take notes, and study decently because ian is pretty great at explaining the concepts and answering questions during lecture. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: can't think of any to mention here except that sometimes the lectures, especially at the end, can get really repetitive, but this could be a strength because if you are confused about some of the material then you'll know ian will go over it again more likely than not the next class.",
                "Although the course covers a wide range of topics, I really enjoyed how we connected them all and how they flowed from one to another.",
                "This course could probably dive deeper into the topics that will actually be relevant for Economics 121 as I felt that they were only lightly discussed. Obviously, I will not know until I take the course itself.",

                "Strengths were the problem sets, very representative of the in class topics and helpful to check progress. The big weakness is that there was only one midterm instead of two, which made gauging performance difficult",

                "The strengths of the course were that Adelstein was a very caring professor who throughly explained concepts. The biggest weakness of this course was that we spent too much time on basic concepts and too little time on more difficult ones. I always understood the basic concepts quickly but then I was really confused about how we brushed over the more difficult ones. For instance, I feel like we thoroughly discussed ranks of matrices but then we really brushed over Taylor approximation, which I found much more difficult."

                "Yes, I would recommend this class to any student who doesn't love math but wants to be passionate about the math they are learning. I say this because I do not love math, but this class was taught in a manner and at a pace that allowed me to engage with and be passionate about the material we were learning. Math classes in the past have just been information/equation overload, which prevented me from internalizing and learning the information, and instead I would just memorize so I did well on the tests, instead of actually processing the material. This class went at a pace and allowed for questions such that I felt that I was gaining a strong understanding of the material and was comfortable asking questions.",
                "Yes! Not only does the class build a great conceptual basis to approach all forms of multivariate or linear algebra-based applications in economics and other fields but it also gives you the opportunity to think through why and how different mathematical approaches work together. I liked seeing topics that I understood in single-variate calculus come together in higher dimensions, and you will leave the course with a great visual intuition that you can apply to all future courses in math and other fields. It was also a great way to try out more proof-based math, while staying mostly on the computational side, if you have an interest in learning new ways to approach math. And the homework clarified what we discussed in class and never felt gratuitous. The workload was manageable, and the work we did always helped me learn.",
                "Yes. Ian taught this course exceptionally well and made material feel very accessible. The class moved relatively slowly which I actually really appreciated as it emphasized understanding the material and its relationship to other concepts more so than maximizing the number of topics covered (though sometimes I was left wondering about the somewhat limited scope of the course).",
                "Yes, Ian is really great and accommodating, and this class is not hard if you just keep up with lectures and note taking. if you can do the psets well, then the exams will only be slightly harder if not the same level of difficulty as the psets. there are no surprises ever with psets or exams such that if you go to lecture and take notes (and study for exams), the questions will seem just perfectly connected to the lectures.",
                "While this course is geared towards econ majors, I took it as a CS major wanting to learn some more calculus and linear algebra before taking courses in computer graphics and AI. I could have learned a lot of the topics on my own from YouTube or Khan Academy, but it was nice to have a structured and chill environment where I got to explore them without worrying too much about harsh grades or hard psets.",
                "This class is more advanced than it appears. It is essentially a mix of 120 and 222. Although, the class doesn't get as deep into linear algebra and multivariable calculus as the other courses, it is still a wide range of topics and their application to economic principles. I wish I was more prepared going into this course and I would make sure other students were as well before I recommended it.",
                "I would, without a doubt, recommend this course to a student that was interested in the mathematical topics such as linear alegbra and calc 3 but who did not want to continue higher level math courses at Yale.",
                "Yes! especially for econ majors (and if you have prof adelstein). The course is very seminar-esque, and the prof was always willing to stop and answer questions. There was typically 1 pset a week, and the tests weren't unreasonably difficult. Overall, a very solid math class.",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes! Math 118 is a gem, but if you want a more in-depth course on linear algebra or multivariable calculus, this class is probably not what you're looking for. However, if you're interested in economics and want to be exposed to a broader overview of topics in linear algebra and multivariable calculus that apply to econ, this class is perfect. Although the math content wasn't necessarily entirely centered around the econ applications, different econ-related topics would pop up every few classes. Professor Adelstein is really great professor! He's receptive to student feedback and genuinely cares about seeing students do well. Nothing in the course felt like we were being set up to fail,  and there were times where he would intentionally slow down the material when everyone was confused to make sure we really understood the topics we were learning. However, be warned that the exams are usually pretty short so if you miss a small thing you might sink your grade by a lot.",
                "Yes. Good preparation for an economics (or other social science that relies on mathematics) major, with a patient and dedicated professor who cares about student welfare.",
                "Yes, good economics-based introduction to multivariable calculus. Not too dense, if you want a working knowledge of the topics this class is good. And it does go in-depth, not as in-depth as a pure math course, which is good for those of us who are looking to infuse that economics-based knowledge.",
                "Yes, it is interesting and challenging without being too hard or too application based.",
                "Yes I would. If you have to take a math class, some students may prefer this format to other lecture-style calculus classes. Additionally, if you are planning on taking higher level economics classes, this course does a good job of preparing you for those courses.",
