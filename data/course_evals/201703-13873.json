    "There were definitely a lot of strengths to this course. The readings were extremely interesting and well picked. They showcased multiple aspects of family in that they were all very different and unique in their own ways; they were all a joy to read. The different kinds of assignments were very helpful as well because now I know how to write a variety of different things well. The activities could be a little repetitive which could make class a little dull sometimes, but this was probably good in the long run because it really brought the points about writing well home.",

    "Strengths: good variety of assignments-- video project at end of class, start and end class with free-write, readings, peer editing, etc,.",
    "The course was very well organized with the papers and the readings",
    "it was great having readings that were manageable and interesting, it kept people engaged with the material in a donut of class. It was also great hint the rough drafts and the final drafts of the essays due for each of the assignments so that we could get feedback and allow students to get their work done in a timely manor.",
    "This was an overall great course."
