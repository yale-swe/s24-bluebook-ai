                "Only strengths; Professor Williams is brilliant and engaging. Seminar is enjoyable, and the essay prompts are quirky and thought-provoking.",
                "The strength of this course is that there was a lot of room for interpretation, class discussion, and critical thinking. The novels we discussed ranged from a wide variety of voices in American literature that come from different backgrounds, races, and periods, which I felt made for a very holistic conversation about American Literature. I really enjoyed how the works ranged from old forks from the 19th century that flowed into contemporary works that brought up interesting conversations and connections.",
                "Strengths: engaging discussions, understanding professor, welcoming class environment\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, the discussions were not entirely about the text. But overall, no other weaknesses.",
                "- while the student presentations were interesting, toward the end of the course, i really missed just getting to discuss our texts",
                "The stength was definitely the selected reading list. The novels, poems, and short stories were engaging, versatile, and gave a comprehensive understanding of American literature for the short amount of time we had in the term. I think the class time could have been spent better. Although there were very productive class discussions, they were often focused on very small sections of the text or even singular words. I would have preferred a broader discussion that was led by what students found interesting. I think this would have increased class engagement as well."

                "english major requirement. \r\n\r\nI'd recommend this course with Prof Williams specifically because the essay prompts were interesting, not just the run-of-the-mill \"place text A in conversation with text B.\" which makes it a much more enjoyable experience. \r\n\r\non the other hand Williams was constantly behind on discussion, grading, and releasing prompts. Our we'd be discussing readings 2-3 days after the syllabus scheduled, and we'd never really catch up. often we talked about something completely separate from the readings. there were also multiple times that Williams brought up the same slides, and gave the same analysis/lecture style thing as if he hadn't done it before. this happened with connections to the Odyssey and palimpsests, which would first be brought up during the Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass and Moby-Dick, only to then be brought up again a month later, with the same explanation, almost word for word, for 15 minutes.   \r\n\r\nthe feedback /commentary on the essays was little to none, seemed like it was rushed, and not indicative of a writing credit. So, if you're maybe a freshman looking to improve your writing through a WR credit, this isn't the spot. but if you're an English major, this is a great foundation course to take. especially after coming off of 126's very boring essay prompts. \r\n\r\neither way, if you're going to take 127 take it with john. \r\n\r\n(he's also in a band, so obviously you'll have entertaining conversations with your classmates when they inevitably find out he's in a band)",
                "I would recommend this course to other students if they are genuinely interested in studying literature and understanding literary theory. This is a great course for aspiring writers, and English and Comparative Literature majors. The discussions surrounding these canonical works truly changed my perspective on American Literature and helped me to become a better reader.",
                "I would! I got a great introduction to American literature and even got to talk to the writer of one of our books! Great experience!",
                "yes - enjoyable for english major requirement",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to students who are interested in delving further into American literature but am not sure I would give it as a broad recommendation as the course feels fairly specific."
