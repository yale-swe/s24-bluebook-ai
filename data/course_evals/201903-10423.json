    "I grew as an artist and gained the skills to take professional photographs.",
    "I got much better at using my camera in a technical sense, but also learned to do more than take the pretty sunset pic.",
    "I became acquainted with the basics of Photoshop and Critiques!",
    "I learned how to work a DSLR camera, shoot in manual, and properly expose digital photos. I learned a lot about the work of some historically famous photographers and some past Yale Art School photography students. We took field trips to the YUAG, Brooklyn Museum, Yale HAAS Art Library, and West Campus to discuss work. So I learned how to analyze photographs to an extent. I also learned some basic Photoshop skills like color correction, curve adjustment, gradient tool, making masks, adjusting overexposed areas, etc. I learned how to tweak photos to adapt them for Inkjet printers. I also learned a little about composition and the questions one should ask him\/her self before taking photographs."

   "comments": [
    "I love the in class assignments and the work we did. It could be improved by giving us feedback on where we stand with grades throughout the course.",
    "There could maybe be more feedback earlier in the course, but that may be more of a Yale kid needing to know where they stand than a course\/artistic necessity.",
    "The field trips are fun and interesting--the work we got to see was all awesome, and it gave us a lot of both technical and abstract things to talk about. The photoshop tutorials are pretty helpful but kind of slow. A great thing about the course is its small size--Ted can go around and help people individually, which was great. The critiques weren't great--there were only two of them, and I didn't get or learn much from them. Sometimes it just felt like meaningless talking. Also, a lot of class was just free time for us to work on editing and selecting photos--I would have liked it if we had learned more about Photoshop or even Lightroom or other editing software. I also think at least one more critique would have been good."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I loved learning to edit and take proper photos, and the instructor facilitated an environment conducive to learning those skills.",
    "Yes! Ted is great in that hes funny and engaging but also does not tolerate BS. You get to spend time in the collections of the YUAG and Haas, and look at the work of some incredible photographers. Its a great way to dabble in photo even if its outside your major, or to test if youre interested in majoring in art. And you get a very cool final product (a printed series) to keep.",
    "If you are super passionate about photography and want to get out and photograph a lot, then go for it. The thing is, you'll learn almost nothing if you have any experience with DSLR cameras and basic editing. But you will get to talk about the meaning behind famous work and learn how to think more deeply about the pictures you take. I think overall the course made me slightly disillusioned with photography, because I ended up hearing too much about what was a \"good\" photograph and a not so good one, and what kind of photos of people were acceptable to take, etc. It's crazy that making photographs takes a fraction of second and you never know what people might like or think is a masterpiece (unexpectedly), while a lot of other visual art forms force you to build the work slowly from scratch. This class is about you doing you. Overall I'd say it's pretty fun and easy. You get to get out a lot. Extremely laid-back class too."
