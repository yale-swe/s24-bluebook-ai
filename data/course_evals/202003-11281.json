                "I became excellently versed in the methodology and theory behind phylogenetics, which as a field is becoming more and more important to our modern understanding of biology. This class was excellently designed to get students to practice and play around with phylogenetic tools and software. Class discussions were focused on the interpretation of the mathematics and theory behind the methodologies and conclusions of phylogenetics. Our class paper presentations allowed us to really pick apart scientific literature, as did the final project. For those shopping this course, here's how it worked:\r\n\r\nTuesday-Class discussion around the subject of interest for the week. This could either be a methodology (i.e., Bayesian analysis) or some aspect of the theory behind phylogenetics (e.g., incomplete lineage sorting).\r\nThursday-In-class practice\/problem solving. In these classes, we would start the homework in class and work through parts of it together so that all students really started to get a sense of the methods to be applied. Since the final project essentially took the entirety of the semester to complete, these practice sets were perfectly sized. \r\nTuesday\/Thursday-paper presentations. Students would lead discussions of papers they selected from the literature. This was my favorite section because it demonstrated the relevance of the material we were learning in class to the recent literature.",
                "I learned a lot about phylogenetic biology methods and theory, as well as how to use software to build and interpret phylogenetic trees.",
                "I learned so much, not just about phylogenetics, but about molecular evolution, R and Git, how to be a computational biologist, math, and even graph theory(?!) I developed so many practical and theoretical skills: I can now build my own phylogeny from molecular data, use the command line, and understand all the methods sections in phylogenetics papers that had previously mystified me. I also got tons better at coding for this class, which had a big impact on my ability to research.",
                "A solid basic understanding of phylogenetic methods, maximum likelihood, bayesian inference, comparative methods etc. Working knowledge of R and cluster.",

                "No weaknesses. To repeat my answer on the in class survey, I would say that this class is so well-designed for the digital sphere that I almost worry it will be difficult to replicate how good it was in an in-class setting.",
                "The main strength of the course was Dr. Dunn's dedication to the course throughout the semester. The lectures and lab exercises were extremely well though and detailed, with clear learning objectives. Each exercise felt like climbing a ladder, going from simple to complex, with a clear learning path, so even when the final steps were fairly complex, you build up the knowledge in the way. \r\nThe reading of papers for discussions was also great, because it allowed the students to think about the content and engage with the material more deeply and personally, as well as help each other with common questions and insights.  \r\nLastly we used a book that Dr. Dunn was writing as we moved along, and that was extremely helpful, since the material was 100% relevant to our course.\r\nI would say the main weakness of the course was that the students have very different previous experiences of software and coding, and when you are a beginner, it is easy to feel left behind during the virtual lab classes, since the conversation was often stirred towards more advanced questions. I think this is probably exacerbated by the zoom format, because in a regular classroom you can ask questions one-on-one, and in zoom you need to ask for everyone to hear, which can feel intimidating. Maybe one way of solving this would be to group students in breakout rooms of similar levels of experience and the professor and TA could move between groups.",
                "This course was truly excellent. A huge strength was Casey's teaching ability and his skill at explaining incredibly difficult concepts very well, his responsiveness to student questions and feedback, and his willingness to dive deep into some of the more philosophical and practical aspects of this work. The material was really good, especially the book, and I really liked the structure of reading-lecture-problem set. The problem sets were useful, but never unfair or trying to trick you.\r\n\r\nIf I had to name a weakness, I would say maybe the paper presentations and discussions could be rethought. I often felt like the conversations took a while to get started but then we never had quite enough time.",
                "Honestly no weakness. Professor Dunn is wonderful at teaching and super supportive.",
                "This course was a very good overview of phylogenetics methods, and I think there was a good balance of theory and practical tools. The readings were very good, as were the homeworks and final projects. I do wish more class time had been spent working with the software relevant to the field instead of discussing the readings."

But I would much rather have a regular in-person class in the future. \r\nI really appreciated how he managed to use the no-verbal feedback tool in zoom to ask for students input at different times. That really helped with engaging in the course and feeling involved in the virtual setting. I also liked how he used the camera to show him drawing or writing during explanations. That can be more engaging than looking at a power point.",
                "Of the classes I took this semester and last, this was the class that dealt the best with virtual learning in a pandemic. Frankly, Casey knew that the workload needed to be cut down in order to deal with the fact that the world was ending around us and we couldn't pretend that everything was normal. I am especially enthused about the way he allowed us to access the same information and then reinforce it in multiple ways, accommodating multiple learning modes. We would do an (excellent) reading before class and sometimes watch a recorded lecture, then we would go to class and have a lecture and discussion about the same content, then on the second class of the week, we would start working on the problem set on the same topic. This was so helpful for me, because it's really hard to focus over Zoom, and I really did need to engage with every topic three times before I actually got it. I also thought Casey and Lauren were very competent at Zoom and using all the functions to take polls of where people were at. They also multiple times solicited feedback on how the class was going, with thought-provoking questions and sufficient time devoted to discussion, and they were very kind and forgiving about deadlines and unforeseen circumstances.",
                "Honestly this course is exemplary, I don't know much else can be improved. Maybe if Prof. Dunn would give scores on paper reading so the paper discussions at the beginning of the class can be more engaging.",
                "It worked really well overall. I think one thing that could be better was the student presentations, as pre-recording them and then discussing them later felt a bit weird.",
                "This class was very well adapted to the pandemic. Zoom lecture was made compelling and interactive as much as was probably possible, a lot of effort was clearly put into doing this."
