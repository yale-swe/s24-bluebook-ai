I wish we had covered some specific techniques in a more practical way though, as many homeworks were focused on trying to write our own implementation of the technique, rather than use some pre-existing and well-documented module such as tensorflow for neural nets.

                "The subject by nature is pretty unclear so anything to make the material clearer.",
                "Not well organized and some topics do not go deeply that makes me confused.",
                "I felt the course is very strong, it is very very challenging so students are in-depth in all aspects of the course. Programming psets are long and demanding and they require great critical thinking. You should feel determined to master the fundamentals of python to succeed in this course.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses are that the quizzes are very challenging compared to exams or psets. Not a weakness but perhaps unexpected.",
                "Homework",
                "This course is very very interesting, and if a student stays engaged with it through the assignments and quizzes, I believe is sufficient to give them a well-rounded perspective of different tools, their possible uses and pitfalls. This course is perfectly balanced between being practical and usable, while also giving a bit of theoretical background, without getting too complicated. John was one of the most wonderfully involved and engaging professors I have had the privilege of attending a course by. The TAs were very helpful, and promptly answered all our questions whether on ED Discussion or office hours.\r\n\r\nOne of the best things about this course for me was that it was recorded. Going back to recordings to reinforce my learning (plug!) of different topics was really helpful. I have watched most lectures twice online before the quizzes or assignments, to ensure I fully absorbed the information. I would really wish all courses at Yale were recorded.\r\n\r\nThe assignments were great, and really added to our understanding of the course. Quizzes were tricky and complicated at times, but were always thought-provoking. One thing that could be done is providing descriptive answer keys to the quizzes.",
                "The lectures were easy to follow, but the course was not the most engaging.",
                "This class does a great job of introducing the concepts, motivations, and applications of major machine learning, and I think it definitely gave me a deeper appreciation for and understanding of machine learning topics and its limitations. However, I don't feel like I come out of this class able to actually design and implement machine learning on a dataset and it was relatively light on the implementation and coding side. It was certainly well taught both by Lafferty and the TAs, and they were always really helpful when I needed it.",

                "The course was very well organized, and we followed the outlined calendar pretty consistently. My only concern with the course is that lectures sometimes go over the underlying math/concepts a little too quickly which made following the higher-level concepts more challenging.",
                "This was a very good class in terms of the balance between assignments (coding) and the necessary theory (with quizzes and exams).",
                "Very surface-level knowledge of ML and weak understand of its internal workings. It sucks that other universities have top-tier departments dedicated to this field and Yale is like here copy some code about topics we are going to half explain at a super super surface level. Kids literally didn't know what PCA was while working on the PCA pset. What can you do about it",
                "Strengths: homework was a good mix of challenging and rewarding and i liked how they implemented the bulk of the code for us so we could focus on learning the big ideas, lectures were interesting\r\nWeaknesses: For some reason, the person filming the lectures would never have it on the board. They would randomly flick the camera to a whiteboard not being used, and this made it really challenging to follow lectures through video. I also felt like Lafferty could have benefited from explaining concepts at a very high level before delving into them (like how Statsquest does it). Finally, also felt like since HW questions were so code heavy, they didn't do a great job at preparing for exams, so some conceptual exam practice questions besides just the take homes would be great.",
                "Strengths: Great TFs which really helped students better understand the topics. Very important material and it was very rewarding to understand how the different algorithms work at the end of the semester. Also, Prof. Lafferty is very organized with his website clearly providing lecture slides, sample code, and release/due dates for homework and quizzes.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The course constantly struggled to choose how technical or in-depth we wanted to cover each topic. It seemed like there were some times where we leaned more into the \"introductory\" part of the course by simply talking about applications and the big picture while there were other times where we needed to go more in-depth. However, when we did go in-depth, it still wasn't done in a very precise manner and was still relatively hand-wavey. Thus, it made the homework assignments challenging to implement (since coding required you to know exactly what you are trying to do).",
                "The highest level of math I have taken was AB calc in high school. There were a few points in the class where I got a little lost on the linear algebra concepts, but overall, it was pretty accessible to me with some extra work. Some concepts were not explained that clearly, but supplementing lectures with StatQuest videos helped fill the gaps. The problem sets were really great tools for building understanding, and I really appreciated how they were spaced out throughout the semester. Having to handwrite Python code on the midterm was kind of brutal. I had just started using Python in this class, and the code involved taking the derivative of a matrix, which I didn't even know was possible. Overall, the class was a good challenge and I am ultimately glad I took it.",
                "Some of the material had been repurposed from the previous version of the course. Material would've bene easier to follow if it had been dumbed down a little more.",
                "Strengths: Great feedback from the professor, TAs, and peer tutors. The professor is always receptive to questions and often prompts the class to ask questions. The content was also super interesting and it was not so challenging that people without the background would get swept up in the dust. The PSETS encouraged collaboration and we could apply what we learned in class. The professor is also super flexible and lenient (he even waived our final exams due to Omicron). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Oftentimes, this was a lot of material. The workload for this class was certainly high. The PSETs would take a long time to complete (atleast 5-7 hours), even when working with others. Additionally, we would have quizzes ever so often on the material, so it was important that we kept up with the content. Aside from the workload, this class basically had no other weaknesses.",
                "The course did a good job of introducing us to introductory techniques in machine learning. A small introduction to linear algebra at the beginning of the course would have helped. Additionally, having a smaller section to go over practice problems would be very useful as the class is rather large. However, the teaching is one of the best I've experienced in the Statistics Department at Yale. The material is taught at an approachable level and assessments are fair. The quizzes and exams were a bit difficult, but doable. Also, Professor Lafferty was incredibly supportive and thoughtful.",
                "Strengths: Very detailed problem sets and hard, but fair exams. Weaknesses: I feel like Lafferty can have a hard time explaining some concepts. Many of the Topics (such as Neural Networks) I learned through statquest.",
                "Strengths: really interesting topics, great TAs, interesting problem sets, good emphasis on implementation and testing\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, basic concepts were glossed over and that caused misunderstanding amongst the students",
                "A better balance could be struck between math and application based ML",
                "Strengths:\r\n1) Psets are very well made, however sometimes they are not clear and the grading seems arbitrary, but if you go to OH to make sure you understand the problem then you should be fine \r\n2) Wendy is an amazing TF, by far the best one I have ever had. \r\n3) You learn a lot \r\n\r\nWeakness: \r\nI can only think of one but it is a pretty big one. Due to the amount of stuff taught in this course a lot of the learning is done outside of the classroom. You really have to put in the time to understand all of the concepts. It is a class where you can easily think you understand something but then you realize you actually do not.",
                "The class is difficult, and the problem sets were highly technical. I personally had to attend 2-3 office hours a week for each problem set. However, because of the difficulty of the course, I did feel like I actually learned something concrete. The problem sets were the most insightful part of the course, as we were actually able to visualize and implement the concepts we were learning. On the other hand, lectures and exams were often too conceptual or mathematical - especially towards the second half of the semester with topic models and neural networks - which made the content more difficult to grasp. I'm more of a hands on and visual learner, and I don't feel as though how much of the content was taught was geared for students like me. The pace is also quite fast. For future iterations of the course, I would recommend possibly spending more time on less topics, with potentially a few weeks towards the end of the semester dedicated to a broader overview of some of the more advanced topics.",
                "Lots of great topics. Felt out of place most of the time. Didnt think the psets in terms of the coding was related to what was covered in lecture",
                "Professor Lafferty is passionate about teaching the material and is clearly an expert on the material. He will take the time to explain difficult concepts to you if you seek clarification. The difficulty of the material is reasonable for an intro class; however, I didnt have a strong linear algebra background and though it didnt hold me back too much, it would have been really helpful. Also because its an intro course we didnt dive too deep into the theory, so it seemed like lafferty was glossing over important math that was beyond the scope of the course.",
                "Great courselearning more packages in the psets would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths - well structured course that really helps you learn ML from the ground up. Weaknesses - doesnt explain the math too well.",
                "I liked the fact that the lectures were recorded so I could go back and watch them to review concepts. I found some of the problem sets to cover things that we did not learn, which made some of them confusing.",
                "Great course, I think one improvement could be going through examples as the lesson progresses. It feels more complicated to go to the jupyter notebook at the end of the class",
                "Lectures were very theoretical and sometimes felt disconnected from the application present in the assignments and quizzes. All-in-all a great course though.",
                "I think the class was great overall.",
                "This class was structured well for quick overviews of ML techniques, but sometimes it felt like it was going very fast.",
                "I thought the course was very well structured !",
                "I like how the psets are not weekly but like every ten weeks. I got more out of it. I think the professor could be better about not assuming so much knowledge, particularly linear algebra stuff, which is not a prerequisite. Also generally, the material on the advanced level was well explained, but my peers and I had to do quite a bit of work understanding the basics. Maybe using less mathematical equations for demonstration purposes (or at least clearly walking through them) would be useful!",
                "The course is very well structured and the materials are useful and insightful.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I hope it can be improved is that I hope there will be more explanation on the quizzes.",
                "Very good class. Slightly more instructive workbooks to aid psets would be good.",
                "Biggest strength is how it introduces the mathematics behind ML; not too daunting, but definitely also get a good idea of the concepts behind it. Also the breadth of the course was quite enjoyable, as we cover a lot of ground from linear regression to dimensionality reduction to NLP to deep neural networks\r\nDisadvantage I'd say the biggest glaring one was how there was python code writing in the tests; I still don't really see why this was part of the tests; I think it'd be much better to have a project of some sort due to test our coding capabilities rather than memorize python functions.",
                "This course covers a large range of machine learning courses, which is a great introduction to this subject. However, sometimes the lecture notes were not sufficient to understand the material in greater depth. Therefore, it could have been helpful to have some recommendations of textbooks or extra learning to understand some of the later concepts (deep learning, autoencoders, neural networks). The assignments were a great practice for the concepts learned in class.",
                "Strength: enough engagement of the course to allow students to be familiar with course material (quiz, homework, midterm etc)",
                "The course was very clearly structured and well taught. I honestly didn't think there was that much that could have been improved.",
                "Great instructor, great TAs. Some of the concepts in lecture could have been taught a bit more clearly/ slowly.",
                "The professor was very engaged throughout the course and did a phenomenal job explaining concepts. The teaching staff was also really good at providing support. Broad overview of multiple machine learning techniques.",
                "it will be great if the professor could list some reference books in the syllabus.\r\nSometimes, not quite clear about how deep we should know about the material.",
                "Maybe this was just a function of the course being new or me being overly ambitious, but the course really doesn't start from a \"we assume you know nothing\" standpoint. I'm a math major, so about close to S&DS as they come, and I still had to teach myself some stats concepts early on in the course. Sometimes the notation was tricky to keep track of too, and I'd spend 20 minutes trying to figure out how a certain variable played into what we were doing only to finally realize it's a constant or something along those lines. You should also be comfortable with python beforehandaside from the specific parts relating to machine learning, you're not gonna be learning much in the course. On the flip side, the psets were really, really cool. Frustrating to do, at times, but always exceptionally satisfying once they were done.",
                "Prof. Lafferty well-organized the entire course and delivered the contents clearly and well-structured.",
                "The course homework assignments were fun, engaging ways to teach the material. The lectures were rather dry as they were taught from slides and therein hard to follow at times.",
                "I may have glossed over it in the syllabus, but the linear algebra pre-requisite should really be more heavily emphasized. The course material, lectures, and PSETs rely heavily on a strong understanding of matrix and vector multiplication. The same thing can be said towards linear models and bayesian statistics - especially, the notation for different distributions, parameters, probabilities, and datasets. The lecture slides, PSETs, and quizzes all use these forms of notation exclusively to denote important information, usually without any additional verbal explanations.\r\n\r\nLastly, a number of my friends struggled greatly with the PSETs, which were all in Python. I did not run into this issue because I had previous Python experience, but most of my friends (even those who come from data science backgrounds) were more comfortable with R.\r\n\r\nDue to the issues outlined above, I quickly fell behind in my understanding of the course material. As the concepts became more sophisticated, I found it harder to interpret the equations, the matrix operations, and the underlying statistical principles because I was not comfortable with them. \r\n\r\nRecommendation: Something that would have greatly improved my course experience (and allowed me to understand the very engaging lectures) would have been a single class to review 1) matrix/vector operations (cross and dot products, dimensions, etc) and 2) statistical notation that will be used later on in the class.",
                "Strengths: frequent homework, which helps with understanding the course material. Interesting topics.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the slides were not clear (e.g. meaning of certain variables)",
                "The course is really well organized to facilitate student learning.",
                "I thought the language models weeks were the weakness. I felt I didnt learn as well during that material for some reason.  Neural network weeks were a strength.",
                "One of the strengths of the course were the very helpful and knowledgeable teaching fellows and ULAs. Whenever we went to them, they were always very helpful and clear in teaching us topics we didnt clearly understand during class, as well as troubleshoot all sorts of problems on our psets. They also were very understanding with me when I accidentally submitted the wrong version of one of the psets, and even regraded it for me after the due date. One of the weaknesses of the course was that the lectures were hard to follow and did not flow too well. We often would bounce between very conceptual ideas about topics and very mathematically-motivated explanations of said topics. What made this difficult was that the professor would go quickly through equations before giving us time to digest them, many of which involved a fair amount of linear algebra, which oddly wasnt a prereq for the course. I think this may be improved by being more clear with what parts of lecture we are expected to fully understand for future psets and exams, and which parts were good to know on a surface level, but not any deeper. It would also help if either 1) there was a solid review of basic linear algebra at the start of the course, or 2) an official linear algebra prerequisite. While we certainly didnt need all of the skills from a linear class, it probably would help to have students learn the basics, or brush off any rust on their linear skills. Another minor downside was the disparity between students  there were quite a few of *those* type of CS majors (you know the one) that would sometimes try a bit too hard in class by asking off-topic questions, and make it overall less engaging. Also, the prof asked a set of 6 students near the end of the course to do a panel discussion on societal issues surrounding ML, which was a bit sus because it seemed like he just chose the students that showed up to his office hours the most, rather than asking the rest of the class for student input. The actual discussion was interesting, but the process seemed to show a bit of favoritism.",
                "Strengths - great start to machine learning, excellent lecturer, psets are great hands on practice\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - course content moves fast and is very dense! Would highly recommend reading lecture slides before lecture just to be more prepared to follow in lecture. Additionally, I would recommend that you have Python/numpy experience. As a CS major, I still had trouble following some code.",
                "The strengths were that it was very application focused with homework assignments using Jupyter notebooks. I like how some of the assignments asked us to code some things from scratch and others implemented python libraries.",
                "Some homework sets are well laid out and facilitate learning, but some involve too much repetitive labor work.",
                "strength: very detailed very organized\r\nweakness: too much materials covered in this course",
                "The combination of coding demos with machine learning models is really useful for us to understand the abstract concepts.",
                "Strengths: Great overview, slides useful and informative, homework interactive.\r\nWeakness: For me, I expected it to dive deeper into the math of ML. It is a intro course so dont expect it to be more than an intro course.",
                "strength: very useful class material\r\nweakness: examples are not that much",
                "The course should facilitate more freedom and help in developing codes from scratch",
                "This is a wonderful, well-designed course! Take it!",
                "some knowledge covered are difficult but instructed shallowly"

                "Yes! If you are interested in Machine Learning then definitely, Prof Lafferty is so smart about this information. It can feel super overwhelming at times but I felt like I really learned a ton.",

                "Definitely yes if you want to get some hands-on practice on ML.",
                "Yes.",
                "I would recommend this course to any graduate student as I believe a Bayesian perspective and a machine learning attitude to research questions is a necessary tool in one's repertoire.",
                "Yes",
                "Absolutely! This course alone equips a student with all the skills to dive into machine learning based research right after. It isn't too complicated or theoretical, and is practical and application-based throughout. Perfect for interdisciplinary PhD students looking to incorporate machine learning in their work.",
                "Solid intro stat course, although the lectures were not very engaging the problem sets were a great way to get to know the material taught in the classroom.",
                "Would recommend it as a good introduction to concepts and a well taught course, but I don't think it teaches you to realistically implement machine learning on your own",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! This course is challenging but really useful, and the step-by-step improvement in coding",
                "Yes, definitely. Professor Lafferty is very friendly and master in his material",
                "Yes",
                "absolutely. I think students from all field of science and non-science can learn a lot about machine learning from this course.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student interested in machine learning.",
                "Yes, definitely a great course to take if you want a working understanding of machine learning and have never been exposed to the concepts before.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, the class material is really useful and interesting",
                "Yes. I took it in preparation for S&DS 365 and felt that I gained a solid intuition of different methods.",
                "Yes. Before this course, I never understood what machine learning actually entailed. The course provided an in-depth overview of machine learning concepts that was accessible to beginners and students without substantial coding experience.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students.",
                "Very surface-level knowledge of ML and weak understand of its internal workings. It sucks that other universities have top-tier departments dedicated to this field and Yale is like here copy some code about topics we are going to half explain at a super super surface level. Kids literally didn't know what PCA was while working on the PCA pset. What can you do about it",
                "If you've never done ML, this is a great class. It's also great if you want a refresher or to solidify your foundation.",
                "Yes if you are at all interested in AI / tech / ML. this course will give you a high level understanding of  the mechanisms behind the algorithms.",
                "Yes. I think that the topics covered are very important for anyone to understand and be familiar with. It really helps make machine learning become a lot more clear and approachable. I do hope that Prof. Lafferty is able to explain some concepts more clearly though.",
                "I took this class to complete the Data Science certificate because it USED TO BE the most accessible class that satisfies the machine-learning requirement. BUT if you are a social science major like me, you might want to look into the machine learning for political science class that is now on offer. If I had known that was an option, I probably would have gone with that instead of this course. That said, if you want to check a box on the certificate and learn Python at the same time, this is a good course, but only if you have the capacity for some more challenging material.",
                "Yes. The course is organized well and students learn a lot from it.",
                "Yes! Good class for the S&DS certificate.",
                "Yes, you should 100% take this course. Even if you are not a S&DS major or don't come from an S&DS background, this information is so important and relevant to modern day, that I highly recommend you take it. The professor and teaching staff are really good at distilling the complicated information into manageable bite-sized chunks so that it is easy to understand and work through it. It can be difficult at times but the teaching staff is always ready to help out in whatever way they can (office hours, individual meetings, etc.)",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in getting into ML/Research Data Science.",
                "Yep!!! Very good class as an intro to ML that isn't overly mathematical. The balance is very nice. Would just say that you should sit with the material between each lecture and really understand what's going on or else subsequent lectures will go over your head.",
                "Maybe wait a little for things to get better",
                "Yes, sure take it but please make sure you have the pre reqs.",
                "Only if you have prior experience with Python would I recommend this course. I personally felt like this course was marketed as a less math-intensive version of the more advanced machine learning course, but my experience was that math and theory was a large part of this course as well, though the homework was all in Python. The course attempts to balance computation, math, and theory all at once and much of the time, this balance wasn't great. If you are prepared to juggle different goggles, have prior coding experience, and are interested in the basics of machine learning, take this course. If not, you probably won't have that great of a time.",
                "Yes I would, the amount of work and difficulty of material is reasonable if you have a background in probability and statistics (241, 242, 238, etc). If you want to understand the basic algorithms of ML and learn how to apply them, then this is probably the class for you.",
                "Yes! If you want to learn ML fundamentals but be prepared to learn some math on your own.",
                "Yes, it's not super difficult, and the workload isn't that high. The quizzes are really confusing though, and some parts of problem sets make little sense.",
                "Yes! Great course for learning the fundamental basics of machine learning. For a field that is drastically changing our modern world this is a great course to get a technical understanding of how complex AI works",
                "Yes! If youre interested in machine learning at all I would recommend.",
                "Its a great intro to machine learning course. I came in and did well with basically none of the pre reqs and no math background but relatively strong python skills. The psets varied in difficulty but were all reasonable. A textbook would be helpful but lectures were pretty clear.",
                "Yes, if you have a background in ML like I did (with CS) and want to know a little but more about the statistics behind it, then yes.",
                "Yea",
                "Sure, but the class can move fast sometimes and it can feel like the professor thinks students are more experienced with ML than they actually are.",
                "Definitely, it gives any student regardless of background a great survey of machine learning a topic that is being implemented in a large breadth of fields.",
                "Yes, for an introductory knowledge to Machine Learning I would definetly recommend this course to anyone .",
                "yes",
                "Yes. It's a good introduction to machine learning that doesn't get too math-heavy. Professor Lafferty is a great lecturer; he explains concepts really well while also giving many examples. The psets are pretty straightforward and not too long either. All in all a great way to get exposed to machine learning.",
                "Yes! Great course material for someone interested in machine learning.",
                "Yes. Because it is a very useful and interesting course.",
                "Absolutely.",
                "If you're interested in machine learning, or if you're trying to decide if you're into machine learning, I'd say so!",
                "I personally wish I hadn't taken this class as I had already taken a lot of stem classes and doing ML personally is not something I plan to do",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student in statistics and data science, as machine learning is a fundamental subject in data science today. It gives a great introduction to the topic.",
                "Yes. very helpful for an intro to ml course. learned a lot from professor John.",
                "Definitely, if you are at all interested in machine learning, especially since it's such an important domain",

                "If you're an S&DS major it's probably a good way to knock out a credit. I'm not convinced that I learned anything I couldn't have taught myself in the same amount of time, so theoretically that's a strike against, but then again it's good to have someone else verify you have a sense of how machine learning works, and if you wouldn't otherwise teach yourself then it's probably a moot point. If you take it, go to everyone's office hours onceI found that some of the TA's were exceptionally helpful, and others liked to say something like \"look over your code again\" instead of providing a substantive response. Figure out which are which and the course will go way more smoothly.",
                "Definitely, I learned a lot",
                "Yes! You can learn a lot from John!",
                "Yes, the course and its professor are excellent at providing you with valuable material for the field.",
                "I would recommend this course ONLY if to someone who 1) has a strong background in linear algebra and is VERY comfortable with equations involving matrix operations, 2) has a good background in linear models and college-level statistics (AP statistics is NOT enough!) and 3) has had experience coding in Python, in particular - someone who understands how the python \"for loop\" works (or is at least aware of the differences between R and Python).\r\n\r\nIf you fit these three qualifications, then this course is an exciting, hands-on introduction to the complex and powerful world of machine learning.",
                "Yes, perfect as an introduction to ML",
                "Sure. I really learn a lot from this course.",
