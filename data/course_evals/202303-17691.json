                "I learned so much about Chinese art and history by taking this course. We studied different types of paintings and their broader significances within Chinese society. I learned that many painting styles and composition selections were made based on the emperor\/political scene of the time. There were also various themes that many paintings followed. After learning various ways of analyzing and studying paintings, we had the opportunity to view paintings from the Bionike, Nolan Center, YUAG, and even the Met in person. We also studied many of the most famous Chinese paintings by viewing them online."

                "The biggest strength of this course was Quincy's passion for Chinese art. He was clearly so very invested in the subject, and as a result, I cared so much about learning it; the excitement was contagious. It was also obvious that he cared deeply about our learning of the material and tried to make classes very interesting because of it. I loved the structure of the class with lectures and discussions, and then scattered meetings where we actually went to view real paintings. I really, really enjoyed this class.\r\n\r\nOne weakness could possibly be the fact that some of the readings felt very dense, although Quincy was very understanding when we might have misinterpreted the information."

                "It depends on why the student is taking the course. I think it is more effective as a way to learn about Chinese culture than it is to learn about art history",
                "Yes, I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. I'm a STEM person, and I plan on majoring in engineering. However, this class made me so excited about art history simply because of Quincy's excitement. I didn't need to be super art-minded to do well in the class and understand the material. I really loved how for the papers, we were able to insert much of our own personal interpretations and thoughts."
