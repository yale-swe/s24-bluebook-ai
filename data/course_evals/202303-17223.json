I learned about styled-components, theme providers, AWS S3 buckets all from my peers who worked on the same project as me.",
                "I learned how to coordinate with others in a group environment, as well as some minor SWE. But mostly it's communication and project setup skills.",
                "I gained insights on how software development is organized on a large scale, and how all the components (eg backend, frontend, testing, security, deployment, git collaboration, user stories, etc.) work together to ensure an efficient development environment.",

                "I learned about software engineering.",
                "This class was the most applied classes I've taken at Yale -- where the bulk of the course was building a software project in teams. I learned general best practices that are essential to software engineering -- agile, working in teams, git CI/CD practices, security, testing and user testing, and working on deadlines (milestones in this case). I didn't directly learn how to program, but indirectly learned new languages and skills in the progress of building our app.",

                "No notes, class was great. Honestly the material was pretty generic and I didn't learn any new information, it was just good to get credit for working on a project I was already planning to do anyway.",
                "I like how the course was centered around one group software project. This was good because it truly gave me a taste of what pursuing computer science would be like post-grad. One thing that I wish the course could have focused on more were coding skills. We learned a lot about group dynamics and project management. However, I would have liked to brush up on my coding skills.",
                "Include more technical information about how to actually create the project. Provided a lot of useful information about how to manage team structure with checkpoints to make sure groups are on track.",
                "The strengths are that there is freedom to pursue whatever project interests you. One weakness that I believe can be improved are the length / word count expectations for some of the assignments. Some of the assignments required around 4 pages or so. While this in itself is not a problem, I believe it does not take that long to answer questions or provide feedback to the teams. For me, I tended to write more verbosely.",
                "The course is way too relaxed and team dependent. Without a good team, it's very likely one will fail the course or overload themselves. The strength is that if you can find good team, it'd be a good chance to network and get some hands-on experiences.",
                "Throughout the course you complete a software engineering project using all of the content you learn along the way. The content is timed very nicely and is useful, however I think there could be better direction in how stuff like security should be applied to specific projects. Furthermore, I think it would be helpful to spent a few moments teaching about a language/platform (eg. AWS, React, Node.JS, etc); if you don't already have some experience in at least frontend/backend platform, you might need to play a bit of catch up.",
                "The lectures arent super engaging but the project is pretty fun to work on",
                "No improvements possible.",
                "Strengths: Well taught class, Professor Antonopoulos was amazing. I really liked the class structure -- most days lecture, but some were presentations or updates, demo fairs, etc.\r\nWeakness: I think there could be better lecture topics that cover beyond the more granular like project management, testing, security, etc. Maybe some more emphasis on programming practices or some high level system design.",
                "The course was effective and covers lots of aspects in the topic. It is really comprehensive.",
                "good lecture and project\r\nadd more content about the art of code design",
                "Overall structure of a term-long project with milestones is good. I wish more time was spent in class explaining specific concepts for how to write the code for different types of projects. I felt most of my time was spent reading various documentation, and my workflow did not benefit much from what was taught in class.",

                "Yes I would if you have a project in mind and have a group of people who you know can work well together. I would not recommend creating larger groups in the 7-8 range. I would ideally keep group sizes to 4-5 since having too many people makes it difficult for people to take initiative.",
                "Yes! It's an amazing GUT class to learn about SWE and project management. Conceptually it's helpful, but it's up to your own interests regarding the class materials. Recommended to enter the course with friends, but I didn't and I was able to find a good team of random MS students lol.",
                "Yes, it is a very good introduction to the world of professional software engineering. If you want to become a software engineer for a company, this class will introduce you to many of the concepts you'll need to know.\r\n\r\nAlso, you might build connections in the class with other software engineers. Working on a project together (5-7 people) is really fun",
                "Yes, definitely would recommend as a CS elective",
                "yes",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student if they are looking for a very applied class where they can build something real. You work in teams which is great (so you can learn from more experienced peers) and learn how to operate similar to how you would in a job or internship. I definitely greatly improved my programming skills despite the class not directly teaching them and learning really good practices when working in software teams.",
                "Yes definitely. It is a valuable experience to gain experience in software engineering",
                "It's okay if you have a good group. I spent a lot of time on this course and getting others to work on it was sometimes like pulling teeth. Much more stressful than it needed to be.",

                "yes, if you want the opportunity to work on a large scale software project.",
