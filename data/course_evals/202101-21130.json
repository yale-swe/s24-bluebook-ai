Students are constantly taking in material from different inputs, and this allows their Chinese level to improve rapidly. Also, the dialogue topics were really interesting and helped educate students on different elements of Chinese culture.",

They really do care about us and decreasing stress during what has been a tumultuous year and it shows, from the meditation exercises, to the thoughtful re-cancelling of some of our final assignments. They even respected the break day by rescheduling the oral exam. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n\r\nSome small pet peeves: dialogue homeworks for each lesson are assigned often before the second part of the lesson is assigned (i.e. during the first part), and this dialogue almost always has vocab that we dont learn until the second part (see Dialogue 11 as an example). It'd be nice if some of the dialogues focused solely on the first part vocab, and others focused on the second part vocab.",

Although, I feel like reciting it from memory does make us learn it better, as tough as it is. \r\n\r\nAlso, allowing us to pre-record the oral presentations took a LOT of stress off of students, especially because sometimes our internet connections were bad.
