                "I really was able to hone in on my writing skills.",

                "I became a much better writer and reader.",
                "This class really improved my writing. From the beginning to the end there was a drastic improvement. It also really helped me improve my revision skills.",

                "this course greatly improved my writing and reading skills",

                "I don't see any weaknesses; the strengths were the broad range of reading materials and essay topics",
                "I was sad that our class and not have a humor S at the end but otherwise I really loved every paper that we wrote",
                "This was an excellent writing course -- I took it because I needed a writing credit, and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I do think the weekly discussions would be more engaging if they were fifty minutes instead of seventy-five.",
                "This course is amazing. I love the structure of the 5 essays, and I wish we couldve written  the satire essay they used to have in this course! I thought the argument and cultural commentary were very similar. My favorite by far was the profile essay, both reading and writing in that unit. American Man Age 10 might be my favorite essay of all time. I like the opportunity for peer review on one essay, and workshop days were always so fun. Annas feedback was also very helpful and she is the biggest strength to the class.",
                "Overall, this class was great. I do wish there was more of an opportunity to talk about our writing with our peers.",
                "Strengths: the workshops were so awesome and so helpful, didnt feel like criticism at all and rly good vibes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish I could have gotten class opinion on more of my writing. I know at the end of the semester we talked about a discussion board to share writing which could be a good idea to structure a little more next time.",
                "strengths were group discussion and great teacher and peer feedback but weakness was that i felt the discussions went on for too long about one specific piece of writing",
                "Some strengths were the quality and variety of readings that we had to do. The timing of the essays was also useful and provided enough time to work on a draft and make a quality final draft."
