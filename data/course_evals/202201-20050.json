It sometimes felt like the prompts were vague but the teaching team was in fact looking for something specific, they just wouldn't say what.",
                "Strenghts: everything. Prof. Barraclough is the best seminar-teaching professor I had at Yale. At no point did discussions feel like they were going nowhere, yet at the same time she allowed us to explore our own ideas in class. We got really in depth in all of the readings and connected them to our own places. This is one of those very rare courses that strikes the balance between student autonomy (allowing us to develop our own research project through the semester) and structure (I was always actually learning in class)\r\n\r\nWeakness: This isn't really a weakness, but I feel like the feedback I got from my writing in this class was more helpful than the WR credits I took, and the grading was also more affected by my writing than in other non-WR courses, so maybe this course should be designated as a WR credit. I'm not sure how that would impact workload RE: writing more papers, but writing the papers was one of my (many) favorite parts of the course so I wouldn't mind.",
                "The content and most of the course readings were really impactful to my thinking about Space, Place, and Landscape, but the class discussions and assignments never seemed to fully engage with the material. The assignments were really interesting, but because the prompts were so broad I was usually frustrated by how vague they were. I never really understood concepts until I was thinking them through as I was writing the paper, but then the papers required putting those ideas into practice for our own projects so I never focused on the theories themselves as much as I would like. \r\n\r\nThe content of this course is so so interesting, and when we did get into meaningful discussions in class it always gave me something new to think about but I wish those moments could happen even more!"

The class itself was very interesting, the discussions were engaging, and I really enjoyed the guided tour."
