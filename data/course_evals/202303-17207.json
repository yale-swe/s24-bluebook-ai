The midterm is absolutely horrible: it's 6k words maximum where you have to go super in-depth on readings Brad briefly mentions in class.

Read the syllabus if you want to know all of the topics! .....SKILLS: I got very good at reading and skimming in this course. I read and skimmed between 100-250 pages for each class on average, but they were all very interesting. I also developed critical thinking skills and learned how to read and interpret judicial opinions because we read a lot of those. Finally, I improved my skill at looking at a bunch of very confusing, jumbled, grey area and making sense of it and trying to root out the real problems and potential solutions. .....INSIGHTS: This is where most of the value from the class is. He taught us about law, code, and norms, and each of their unique challenges and strengths. He taught us about heap problems, type 1 and type 2 errors, standards, and so much more, including a lot of great life advice. I learned that the world is a lot more complicated and has more grey areas than I thought before and that making sense of social issues requires nuanced study and multiple perspectives. I also learned that solutions all have their benefits and harms, there is no perfect answer to anything. I also learned that sometimes people are horrible and we can't stop them. In Brad's words, \"it's not illegal to be a dick.\" But I'm more okay with that, because sometimes it's okay to let someone get away with being bad if that means someone else won't be unnecessarily punished for doing nothing wrong. Finally, I learned to be more confident in myself and quit caring about what other people think. Weird insight from a CPSC course, but Brad's life advice has genuinely made me a better person and changed the way I see people.",

                "This course has been one of the best experiences of my time at Yale. It embodies the truth that learning does not need to take place in a sterile overly academic environment. Learning takes place in daily anecdotes and application of court cases to real life and hypotheticals. I feel better at forming my own arguments about court cases and policy approaches after taking this class.",
                "Strengths: Everything about it. The TAs are soooo helpful and Brad does an amazing job of tricking you into learning the content he teaches. He has a very specific teaching style that might not be for everyone but it was certainly helpful for me and a lot of my classmates. One will come into this course thinking they have all the facts they need to discuss the court cases but Brad never fails to point out something that you haven't thought about it yet. Which is what made this course so interesting. The best course I have taken at Yale so far. Weakness: No weakness.",
                "This course is very entertaining and low-stress, with little structure and lots of freedom. However, for a student that needs structure within their courses and solid deadlines, this course is a bit stressful and can feel discombobulated.",
                "Strengths: Good class. Fun lecture. Flexible and easy. No bullsh-t.\r\nWeaknesses: Brad  stop trying to write stuff out in Microsoft paint. It doesn't work. Just play a YouTube video that explains the topic in like 5 min rather than spending 20 min trying to draw a weird diagram with your mouse.",
                "Strengths is that this is a very entertaining class, lectures were always fun. Brad made it so that the students would be actively participating even in such a large lecture. Weakness is that there is so much content and at times it feels like were just jumping around. This is just because the overall topic of this class is so vast, but I think this class might benefit from a more narrow scope that would allow for a good understanding of a few things rather than a general understanding of many things.",
                "Strengths: Pretty much everything! Very engaging lectures, loved the format of the midterm as an issue spotter (hot take?), and the reading list always felt like it was worth my time. Fantastic feedback on all assignments. Also there is cupcakes!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Really the only thing is that sometimes the pop culture points can drag on too long. Like I get the idea that Brad tries to \"trick the students into learning\" during those sections but sometime the point just felt belabored.",

                "Strengths: very interesting readings, almost as if just scrolling random news articles; lectures are very accessible and enjoyable; assignments are relevant to the class and at your own pace",
                "Strengths: A break from the normal Yale classroom. Class is fun, not stressful. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it is clear throughout all the craziness why we do certain things in class, at other times it seems like we are wasting time watching dumb youtube videos",

                "Strengths: Engaging, encouragement for participation",

(i might just be a really slow reader though). not worth it to take the class if you are not willing to do a few hours of reading before each lecture because you will be lost without doing the readings and then also the midterm will be very difficult.",
                "BRAD ROSEN. I literally laughed so hard I cried during lecture multiple times during this semester, and I was always so excited to hear what types of insane examples and videos he'd bring up to connect legal concepts to our daily lives. The whole \"trick you into learning\" thing is real - I was literally terrified for the midterm, but watching things such as 1) lady gaga parodies 2) Star Trek fan edits 3) Todrick Hall Target Flash Mobs 4) Ain't Nobody Got Time for that remix and MORE, during class time, literally permanently cemented the legal concepts from readings into my brain. I literally texted my hometown friends about every single lecture!!! So much fun! I know I'll be thinking about this class for years to come! A handful of people were pressed about reading response structure/grading but I think everything was very fair (and feedback was very clear as well).",
                "There is plenty of reading assigned throughout the semester and it can be difficult to catch up if you fall behind. Lectures don't always cover everything assigned and the student has to figure out the connection. There is a lot of student participation in each lecture.",
                "Strengths: It's objectively a fun class. Brad is a really fascinating guy and if you enjoy his style of lecturing you will find this class super entertaining. The readings are interesting (some court cases are long and difficult to get through) but you can essentially skim all of them. The reading responses are fun to write if you enjoy the content of the class. Also, the sushi dinners after every Monday class are one of the best parts of this course. I beg you, at least go to one throughout the term. Also, this class has an objectively low courseload.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: If you don't mesh with Brad's personality or style of teaching drop drop drop this class will be horrible for you. The grading feels arbitrary and more based on whether or not Brad likes you as a student. The midterm gave me PTSD.",

                "Strength: You can get by with doing no work outside of class most of the semester. Be sure to actually pay attention to the Supreme Court cases though because theyll be really important in the midterm. The lectures are usually so much fun that you wont even know youre learning about the law. The reading responses, midterm and final project are all meant to be pretty chill and low-stress.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The leminar format. Consistent participation will bump your grade but being the center of attention in a 150+ person lecture is definitely not for everyone. However, youll be fine grade-wise because not participating just means participation wont factor into your grade at all.",
                "Strength: very flexible assignments \r\nWeakness: lectures sometimes all over the place",

If you ask him anything he will most likely know the answer\r\nweaknesses: if you like clear-cut rules and grade markers so that you know how you are doing, this is not the course for you. Only take this if you can handle a more 'comprehensive' grading structure. I wouldn't call this a weakness, it is just something to keep in mind. I, for one, loved this structure, but I know people who got stressed out about it.",
                "Amazing course with such a fun professor and amazing lectures. Plus free cupcakes and sushi dinners",
                "Course is fun, but I personally don't like copyright law.",
                "This course, at least for me, had an unexpectedly significant amount of reading. It is likely split 50/50 between dense law texts and easy-to-read articles. The articles did get a bit repetitive sometimes, and the dense texts were a bit too dense sometimes, but I say that as a STEM first-year who struggles to read for long periods. Each lecture took me roughly 3-4 hours of reading, and early on it was my heaviest course load. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Brad is an amazing prof, and really keeps you engaged with the course and makes the dense law texts easy to understand in lecture. his energy and enthusiasm are unparalleled, and I really enjoyed his teaching style (this cannot be said for all people). Once you get into the swing of things, this class is very enjoyable and I had a great time.",
                "Strengths: the course is so engaging. I found the assignments really fun, like the reading responses which could be creative if you wanted it to be and the final group project. The midterm takes a lot of time, but as long as youve been paying attention, its actually pretty fun! Weaknesses: Brad doesnt really encourage taking notes in class because (and hes right) you should remember the main topics from each class because of how its conducted. However, I think taking notes on readings is super important for the midterm, and it should be supplemented with notes from class especially with stuff you dont understand or didnt get to read. Sometimes Brad doesnt post readings until the day before class which can also make it tough to take notes and read it thoroughly (or write a reading response).",
                "Strengths of the course and the instructor were addressed on course-specific form. I think what attracts most students is the refreshing style of the course and the relaxed nature of lectures where we still learnt quite a lot of facts. The readings were interesting and diverse and gave good insight into the material, although there was perhaps too many videos to listen/watch through on some occasions. Some more specific guidance on tackling and understanding the case readings would also help greatly. The midterm was amazingly written and I've said to many others, probably the best exam I've taken at Yale. The final project I wish was slightly differently structured, as making and editing a video during finals week was a little nerve-wracking for my low-creativity brain, but I'm not sure this can really be solved given the size of the class and the broad range of topics covered during the course.",
                "I thought the class had a very good flow and structure: the readings primed me for lecture and discussion. The one thing that made the reading responses difficult is because it took a few weeks to receive feedback.",
                "Brad is great esp as an alumni - he understands how students think and was very candid.",
                "The class was super engaging and not too much work!",
                "strengths: class was super engaging and fun. Brad is an awesome professor and very knowledgable. I had fun learning the topics and felt like it was valuable information to have in the real world.",
                "The lectures are just Brad screaming at us or showing us videos. I don't think I learned much from them, but the readings were really interesting.",
                "The course had a great structure. We went through interesting, real world topics every week and learned so much in such a short amount of time. Grading system could be improved.",
                "topics and readings are very interesting, but the lectures were often only tangentially related to the readings and Brad would get completely sidetracked.",
                "Students are left a little in the dark on the way grading works",
                "I liked the readings of the course, it was quite interesting. I think some of the readings could be cut down though. The midterm was fun and engaging. Sometimes I felt like Brad got too off topic sometimes. Most of what he said was interesting, but some I could have done without. Definitely the class I talked about most often with my friends.",
                "I think this course's strengths include the highly complementary relationship between readings and lectures. Relevant information from the readings was always elucidated in an entertaining manner throughout each lecture, facilitating student engagement. However, many of the video examples we watched were from decades past, and could have been supplemented (if not replaced) by more modern content relevant to our generation's cultural understandings. Moreover, case studies exploring contemporary issues like AI, now occupying the forefront of tech-related concerns, could also be adopted into the course.",
                ".....STRENGTHS: Brad is hilarious and engaging, the material is fascinating, it's well organized and extremely relevant. He ask questions that make us really think too because they have no easy answer and there are so many perspectives on it. I genuinely learned so much from thinking about these questions and had so many engaging conversations with fellow students. It has changed my outlook on life entirely and made me a better academic, human, and member of society. Cupcakes. .....WEAKNESSES: This course definitely has grade inflation and it sucks that students who put in the effort to learn and engage with the material got the same grade as students who didn't try. .....IMPROVEMENTS: It is perfect, I loved the class! Some of the links to a few of the readings required subscriptions though so it was a pain to try and access them.",
                "Strengths: The teacher had a lively teaching personality that kept you awake. Weaknesses: Too many students in the class",
                "I think a strength of this course was in its existence. I think all students should have to take this course or one similar. It would be a shame to grow up and live in a country without any knowledge of how it operates. A weakness would be how much later grades sometimes were returned.",
                "you definitely need to keep up with readings to make sense of what lecture is: brad ranting about law being stupid. There's like a month worth of binging unhinged youtube videos and you're supposed to understand the legality of it and how it pertains to loopholes. If not, it seems like a waste of time. There trouble with accessibility as well. A lot of crucial information like deadlines, rubrics and expectations are left vague and unavailable. This can be the laid back class until you realize you've saved all your reading responses for the last moth of the semester."

                "Yes, please take the course and take advantage of any moment you can discuss/debate with Brad. He will challenge you and crack jokes at the same time.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, just purely due to the unique experience that it offers. Brad is truly unlike any other professor on this campus.",
                "Yeah, might as well take it. Very different from other classes at Yale and pretty low workload so might as well do it to get a change of pace. Brad has a lot of good takes too.",
                "yes. best class i've taken at yale",
                "Yes! this class is very fun and entertainign and the overall workload isn't too much! This is a very fun Social Science credit.",
                "100%! All I can say is that it will either be the best course you've taken at Yale or you will drop after the first lecture. Brad lectures and runs the course in a way unlike any other professor here. it's a much more ... how do I say this politely ... chaotic? But truly, it is the best pre-law course, giving you a wholistic view on the reason for how law actually works and the challenges that that system entails. I looked forward to going to every single lecture this semester. Couldn't recommend it to anyone enough",
                "Absolutely. This is one of those courses at Yale that is singular. If you're looking for something that feels \"serious,\" this definitely isn't the class for you. That being said, even with the performance art that is Brad's lecture style, you'll learn a bunch and will be able to apply a lot of class material to your everyday life. Other notables: cupcakes for answering questions, funny videos every class, sushi dinners... just sign up now and thank me later.",
                "Yes. Do it. You must.",
                "Yes! Absolutely. I came in a bit intimidated by the first couple of classes, but came to really learn a lot and enjoy it. Brad is a great professor that seems a bit intimidating but very clearly cares for his students, the structure of his class, and is incredibly intelligent. A bit out of pocket, but a refreshing class.",
                "Yes if you are willing to take in a lot of cursing, weird videos, and a crazy professor. It is a unique experience and a good class to spend one semester taking",
                "YES! Not necessarily a gut, but very interesting and manageable.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. This course is a once-in-a-Yale opportunity.",
                "I would recommend this course for the experience, Brad's method of teaching is engaging and entertaining - which helps students retain more of the content being discussed.",
                "I'd recommend if you want an interesting class with a fun professor (rare). i took it thinking it would be a gut - it was half gut, half not. most of the time there is really not a lot of work, but when there is work it's a bit heavy. just be ready to do the readings before class and just go to lecture and you'll be good. it's a great class and i don't regret taking it even though it was a little more work than i originally thought. also, i'd say to get the most out of the class you should really do the readings and take the time to talk to the professor after class about your opinions on the material and just have a conversation with him. he's doesn't seem approachable but he is and he really loves hearing people's opinions, and it'll make you stand out which is always good. overall, i'd recommend if you are ok with doing more reading than usual but the reading is most of the work. no psets or long essays make the workload super manageable (just 4 reading responses, midterm, and fun final project).",
                "100%. Definitely something to take before you graduate (and I highly recommend taking it with a friend as well). This course changes your perspective on so many elements of life and culture, and Brad's humor is so funny! Shop it, and if you like Brad's personality, then take it!!! I definitely think upperclassmen might get more out of it, just because it's such a refreshing break from the \"Yale\"-ness of other courses, and there's lots of participatory moments that benefit from upperclassmen perspectives.",
                "It is an illuminating course, but I would only recommend it to someone who has an interest in Internet culture, copyright, or technology law.",
                "brad is amazing take this class one of a kind at yale",
                "Absolutely, it's probably one of the weirder courses you will take at Yale but I promise you'll enjoy it (plus who doesn't love cupcakes).",
                "Absolutely. If you like Brad and his way of teaching. If not, do not take this class.",
                "Seniors be carefulthis course feels very structured to a first-year with a really high-energy/engaging professor but less than satisfying actual teaching of content. When he begins the class with \"is this class for you?\", you should take care. It ended up being 100% worth it, but going to class can be painful at times.",
                "Yes if you have the vibe",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone that likes Brad's teaching style and has some interest in the law. The topics are pretty applicable and fun to grapple with, but if you dislike how Brad runs the classroom, you should not try to power through. If you do like Brad, however, get ready for a fun semester!",
                "Yes, its the best class Ive taken at Yale. Even if youre not interested in copyright (I wasnt), its still a great course because of Brad. 10/10!!",
                "Yes! Enjoying, interesting, learned a lot",
                "Yes if they have a high workload semester and are looking for a fun course that can be ignored most of the time. Brad is hilarious and if you get to know him (which I didnt) you can actually become friends. Expect absolutely nothing to do with CS because its all about law and social norms surrounding technology.\r\n\r\nI took it freshman fall and that was probably a bad idea. I chose to always leave class early to go eat dinner with friends over staying back for office hours and the sushi dinners with Brad. And although I wanted to, I never spoke in class because it was too scary to be put on the spot like that.",
                "Yes, this is a must-take Yale course (if you like Brad's teaching style) because the knowledge is so relevant and interesting.",
                "Awesome class, 100%!! There is truly nothing else at Yale like this, youre missing out if you dont take it. Brad has a cult following for a reason. Not a gut!!",
                "Just go to the first class and see",
                "Yes! This was by far one of the most engaging and interesting courses offered at Yale! Brad is an amazing professor and will teach you so much. Please take this class if you can!",
                "ABSOLUTELY. This is a must-take in your yale education. Brad is a gem.",
                "10000%, one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Brad is hilarious and puts so much effort into getting to know his students.",
                "100%. This class is genuinely one of the most entertaining courses offered at Yale. Brad's style of teaching is really engaging (and funny) and allows you to learn about somewhat complex topics in a down-to-earth, relatable way. The class is super accommodating to people with no background in law or computer science.",
                "It's a fun class and not a lot of work. It's not zero work though so don't be fooled into thinking this is a totally free A.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. This class is not a gut, and doing the readings, particularly in the first half, is necessary to understand what is going on and do well. That being said, Brad is very understanding, and don't be stressed about your grade: if you do the readings+responses, you will do well regardless.",
                "Yes, 100%. I would strongly recommend speaking to students who have taken this course before to get a sense of the style, and to read the other course reviews. Shopping period should help you get a sense of whether the style of teaching/learning is a good fit. Regardless of major however, I think that the intellectual experience from the course is one that you can't find in many other courses at Yale, and therefore it is definitely worth shopping!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, even if they're not necessarily interested in law or computer science. It made me reflect a lot on how technology has changed society and how norms AND laws have shifted as a result. Also, Brad is an extremely engaging lecturer, and with such a large class, I feel like that's pretty impressive.",
                "Sometimes, I was rather uncertain about grade transparency, but if you try in this class, I guess you'll get an A. He has a grade appeal process that he's candid about. I appreciate his insights as an alumni.",
                "Yes! It was amazing",
                "Yes - at least to shop it. It is not for everyone but if it is for you it is awesome.",
                "I hated this class. The grading was inconsistent and you never knew the expectations for the class. Every assignment I completed I took forever on and was anxious submitting because I didn't know if I covered what I needed to. I felt like I got minimal amounts from the lecture.",
                "For students who are interested in law, computer science, or the intersection and application of technology in the world in regards to legal affairs.",
                "Absolutely, Brad is a wonderful professor who is super engaging and informative.",
                "Yes! Brad is funny and knows a lot (about the course material, obviously, and also about life).",
                "Yes. It is a low workload class, would make a good fifth class. But it is also super rewarding and interesting. I never left the class without learning something new or engaging.",
                "Sure, but maybe as an upperclassmen. Take other courses first, but this is definitely one worth taking in my opinion.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in the intersections of law, technology, and culture and looking for an entertaining class.",
                "YES TAKE THIS COURSE. DO IT NOW. ITS LIFE CHANGING. But there is one caveat... you get out of it what you put in. I am so glad I engaged with the material because I genuinely learned so much and left the course with so many more things I want to learn about so it was remarkably rewarding. With that being said, my pdf of the readings at the end is 3,493 pages. And news articles/websites only imported as one page. And I cut the vast majority of the pages we didn't read. Granted, some of these pages were optional readings or were skimmed, but if you want to do the readings, you will be in the library quite a bit! I had about 100-250 pages each class and I learned how to read more efficiently and it was very fun, but my stem friends were appalled. You can get away with not doing the readings though, don't worry. TAKE THIS COURSE!!!!!",
                "Absolutely.",
                "This course is NOT a gut! It was fun, but be prepared to put in a lot of hours and don't cry if you still get a A-/B+ at the end.",
                "In terms of content, yes, absolutely, but unfortunately I found the format of the class a bit challenging. For homework, we had to complete reading responses, but the readings were often posted the day the responses were due, which made it changing to complete the responses.",
                "Sure, if you can maintain a self-mediated habit of doing weekly readings and responses."
