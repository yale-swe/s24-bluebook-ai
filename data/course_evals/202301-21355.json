                "Strengths: Amazing professor and TF, interesting material\r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps we did not need the final exam if we had the final project, or vice versa",
                "Strengths: interesting applications\r\nWeaknesses: class could be a bit more organized, attendance was often low.",
                "Weaknesses: This class was quite disorganized and pretty hard to follow. I didn't feel like I learned much more than what I knew from ECON 117 (in fact, I used the slides from ECON 117 to study for this class). I think the class would have benefited from building a more thorough, comprehensive probability background in class instead of through the review handouts. The workload of the class was also quite high -- most classes have either a final project or a final exam; this class has both. Most classes have either quizzes or problem sets; this class has both. Quizzes would also include material up to and including the most recent taught class; so a quiz due over the weekend would include material taught on Thursday, which did not give enough time to clarify material before getting tested on it. The labs were also not well-integrated into the class in a meaningful or enriching way. The format of the slides switching between html and pdf also made it difficult to have a consistent style of note-taking and reviewing material. Unlike other classes, new material would be introduced in section instead of just going over/practicing material we did in class.",
                "Strength: if you plan to write an econ thesis, this is helpful because it exposes you to a lot of techniques and theory that you will probably need. If you do not want to write one, I think there are no strengths to this course.",
                "more organized lecture slides, clearer roadmap of the course and breakdown, consistency in quiz/pset/practices",
                "More organization would be nice",
                "Overall, I liked how the course blended theory, programming, and application/examples all together as we were learning the concepts. I wish there had been a bit of a clearer outline at the outset of the course as to the things we would be covering, as at times I was a bit confused about how the topics fit together, what the major takeaways should be, etc.",
                "Too many components to worry about - midterm/final/problem set/quiz/proposal/paper",
                "Strengths: Variety in assignments and quality in teaching materials. Professor Vytacil is a good professor and committed to helping students understand the material. \r\nWeaknesses: Overall, this course suffers by trying to do too much. It is a coding in R course, a stats theory course, and an econometrics course. This is reflected in the assignments, which include a full final paper in addition to a final exam, which is double the amount of work in the finals period of most other courses. The sections were not well structured to support the content, and the PSET and quiz dates were not communicated in advance and not clear. The PSETs were relatively easy but the quizzes were extremely difficult. If you put in the time, it is a very rewarding course were you can learn a lot and get some key lessons in econometrics, but it is almost too much for one course."

                "No. This course was very unorganized and it often felt like the professor and the TA were not on the same page. The material has a lot of potential, so it is disappointing that the teaching technique got in the way of it.",
                "For those whom its required for their major",
                "I would definitely recommend it if you are interested in economic research, as this class definitely helps you get your footing under you in an application sense that Econ 117 doesn't get to.",
                "Have to take for econ/CS major. Have a good friend in class helps tremendously.",
                "It depends. I think read the other evaluations, and then approach it based on your need. If you want a stats or econometrics course, take a S&DS course. If you need this for the thesis, take it pass-fail. If you need to take it for a grade, take it and make sure to start on the final paper/studying early and prioritize this class if it does not come naturally. I will also say that having a prior research topic to build on in the final paper is much better than trying to come up with an entirely new topic just for the purposes of the final paper."
