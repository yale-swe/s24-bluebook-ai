                "This course was really difficult for me as a student who had never taken a calculus course, but there were many resources and people to talk to to engage with and help me try to stay on track. I still fell off more than I would have thought, however, because the class lectures were rather fast-paced at times and very thorough and slow at other times. It'd be better to have more consistent pacing during actual class time, but the semesters as a whole were well-organized in the canvas files.",
                "Strengths: Lots of practice problems and textbook chapters are available to help prepare you for the exams. The TFs are really resourceful and help a lot with general questions and problems sets. \r\nWeaknesses: The only thing done in class are problems. Minimal effort is put into breaking down concepts before applying them to broader questions. The class is very fast paced, I understand that the class needs to cover a lot of content but there was not a lot of explanations when it came to the content being learned.",
                "I feel like certain topics were taught in a way that was unnecessarily confusing.",
                "This course has many strengths including resources and easy access to notes",
                "I felt there was much outside engagement required for the course that I was not expecting. The weekly workshops, problem sets, concept checks, in addition to going to office hours.",
                "This course offers a great textbook and office hours but the class instruction is difficult to align with the work outside of class.",
                "Strengths: The course held numerous instructor and ULA office hours spread throughout the week at different time intervals which made accessing help super easy. There were plenty of practice exams that really helped to prepare for the two midterms and final exam. The professors seemed to genuinely care about being available for and wanting to assist their students.\r\nWeakness: One of the ULA's was either inept or unwilling to effectively instruct the students they taught which caused me to regard the weekly sections primarily as a required waste of time for points that did very little to improve my understanding of the course material. I think, given a competent ULA and stricter screening for this position, these sections would have been helpful."

                "It was definitely one of the better stem classes because of the amount of people and notes we had access to throughout the semester, so I'd recommend it over some others. The material was really challenging, so I think it is paced to be easier for people who already have experience with the sort of material the class covers, otherwise it can feel rushed, and my motivation dwindled as I fumbled with learning the material from the ground up unlike the other students. I do think it'd have been a more effective experience if the pacing had been a bit more consistent.",

As someone who had never taken calculus prior to Yale, I found this content to get progressively harder over the semester, and had to spend lots of time teaching myself several concepts. However, I feel as though the TFs for this class are extremely helpful and every week they would help me.",
