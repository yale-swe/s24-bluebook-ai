In all honestly, this class felt more like an applied math class than an economics class if that's what you're interested in, it's great, but for me personally, I much prefer a more conceptual focus (similar to econ 116).",

            "comments": [
                "great teacher, well organized, interesting content",
                "Strengths: Interesting topics, applicable to students\/daily life, discussion of current events, kind professors and helpful TFs\r\nWeaknesses: Ridiculously difficult midterm, no extra office hours\/study session for midterm exam prep, office hours poorly spread out (all TF office hours on Monday, only 1.5 hours of office hours over the weekend when the P-Sets were due on Tuesday), peer tutoring frequently cancelled with minimal notice, no feedback on P-Sets (graded for completion\/effort), midterm answers not released, section inconsistent among instructors, not collaborative",
                "Strengths: Most things.\r\n Course content is about what you'd expect: building on intro macro with things like the Solow Model and AD-AS framework. \r\nI think it does a good job at blending some of the drearier algebraic theory stuff with some real-world applications. I appreciate that in addition to mathematical computation, psets incorporate some real life data and graphs about countries for us to deal with.\r\nThe course is well structured and content makes sense\r\nBe warned though: psets for this class are much longer and more difficult than in ECON 115,116 or 121. That's fine with me, because they're well designed I find them to be helpful in learning the content. \r\n\r\nMy only recommended change would be to the grading scheme. Psets are long and challenging, so for the amount of effort they take I'd like them to represent more than 20% of the grade. On the other hand, I think a 50% final is too high. My preferred grading scheme might be 30% midterm, 35% problem sets, 35% final, or something along those lines.",
                "weaknesses- office hours for exams are sparce and \"sections\" before the exam are not the best of help, would prefer more office hours or exam practice",
                "Professor Peters is a very strong lecturer. The pace of the lectures is spot on, and have been the best quality of any economics lectures I've attended so far at Yale. I am impressed by how he makes an effort to learn everybody's names, even in a large lecture hall. He is also responsive to emails and to questions in class. I enjoyed talking about current events in class.\r\n\r\nThis is a personal preference, but I think a 50% weight on one exam is pretty intense. A shifting of weight would be one change I would make, especially if the mid-term and final are supposed to be around the same difficulty and cover the same amount of new material. 'Cumulative' finals are always heavily weighted towards the back end of the course anyways. This is more unreasonable, but I greatly prefer take-home exams with questions that are more difficult, like how the economics department at Harvard is structured.",
                "The class was very early; however, the professor tried his best to make the content engaging. I felt like problem sets didn't connect to the lectures sometimes, which was frustrating. \r\n\r\nIt was frustrating taking the final and having so many people coughing - it was distracting and made it hard to concentrate.",
                "The exams are very math based and less economics based. You spend a majority of your exam time trying to get the correct equation - which can only be figured out quickly if you know some math tricks - instead of applying economics knowledge",
                "Dr. Peters was definitely the highlight of the course, as he was clearly very passionate and accommodating to students -- for instance, the slides he posted before each class made following along without furiously scribbling down notes much easier, and they were very clear in later review. Problem sets were a good level of difficulty, and there were plenty of support resources to help with those. I wish there was a seminar version of this class, though, just because that fits my personal learning style more (and section was more of a review of concepts than a seminar, valuable but different).",
                "The course was very challenging. I think the biggest weakness was the exams being incredibly difficult with huge curves.",
                "Professor Peters presented the content in an incredibly accessible and relevant way, which made me excited to learn about macroeconomic theory. Therefore, lectures were always interesting and I never felt lost or frustrated. In addition, he provided a ton of material to help us follow the course and engage with the content. However, the psets and exams (especially the midterm) were surprisingly difficult in ways that felt out of step with the lectures. Perhaps there could have been more time spent on solving problems and applications of the models, although this would have made lectures less interesting.",
                "The weakness of this course is that it weights class participation as 0% of the grade, and 90% of one's performance on the final exams is their math skills which have nothing to do with what is taught in lecture. It is pretty much a waste of time to go to lecture in this course.",
                "Presentation slides are high quality and thorough; solid connections to current events; learned more mathematically thorough models behind the ones I learned in Intro Macro; although some mathematical justifications were sketchy and I took them for granted; some short answer questions on the midterm and final seemed to be based on memorizing trivia and a huge assortment of graphs and trends scattered throughout the lectures, which was inconvenient",
                "Strength: Professor Peters is the only professor who makes it worth taking this course.\r\nWeakness: the material should be focused more on economic theory and less on math. Macroeconomics is a course that all at Yale should take, but the amount of higher-level math used in the course makes it less approachable for those in the humanities.",
                "The biggest strength is definitely the macroeconomic knowledge base the course helps you to assemble. It gives a useful toolkit for analyzing current happenings in the macroeconomy around the world. The biggest weakness for me is definitely exams. Exams were way too hard, more than they needed to be. Professor Peters lamented the lack of students showing up to live lectures but I think one of the main reasons for this (aside from the class being at 9AM in the morning) was that the midterm was so hard that it discouraged many students. When you study hard and still feel like you haven't done well on an exam, it really hurts overall engagement with the course in my opinion.",
                "If the class wasn't at 9am I would have attended more.",
                "It is a very interesting class, however the problem sets were quite lengthy.",
                "This was actually my favorite of the 4 core courses. Michael peters kept things interesting, I felt bad because it was better for me not to walk 15 minutes both ways and go to lectures so I didnt show up and watched after I woke up.",
                "It would be great if this class was not at 9am. I think there would have been a lot more engagement with the professor and class. I thought the in the news sections at the start of class were great and really enjoyed that the knowledge I gained was applicable to the real world and events.",
                "Material is just hard to make interesting",
                "Strengths: Interesting material, enthusiastic professor\r\nWeaknesses: Hard to get help at office hours because so many students and one TA. Would have been better if instructors address questions on an individual by individual basis and if there was a culture for collaboration (maybe this was a thing and I just didn't go to the right ones).",
                "Well organized, good information",
                "Strengths: interesting topics covered, professor was extremely engaging and thorough in his explanations during lectures.\r\nWeaknesses: difficulty and tediousness of problem sets, which was not adequate preparation for the examsmostly consisted of calculus problems with minimal room for applying economic intuition and insights.",
                "Weakness -- I feel like the only time I learned was in the Discussion Sections. The lectures were confusing.",
                "Amazing course, no weaknesses!",
                "Professor Peters is a fantastic professor that really really cares about the learning of his students. That being said the exams are unnecessarily difficult",
                "Strengths: The material is very interesting and relevant. Each new concept builds on the concept before it, which is really nice. Everything is logical. Professor Peters starts each lecture off with some current news and discusses it. Helps keep me up to date and gives me new things to read. \r\nWeaknesses: The midterm and final were both very mathy. Sometimes it feels a little bit more like a math exam than it does an econ exam. This made the midterm very rushed, but the average was low so the curve kicks in. The math is not hard, it's algebra - it's just tedius.",
                "Lectures were great -- Prof. Peters is a really engaging teachers. The TFs and the peer tutors were also amazing. The only problem with this course is that the exams did not in any way resemble what we learned in class or did in problem sets -- they were way more math-based and had tricky calculations.",
                "great prof who talks a ton about real-world applications and current events (which is awesome), but also a typical econ lecture where you're confused and bored most of the time",
                "Professor peters was the strength of this course. The TAs were great too, as were the peer tutors. Weakness was that it was at 9am, but thats nothing to do with how the course was taught.",
                "Strengths: interesting content, easy-to-follow lectures, engaging slides, different topics flowed very nicely\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: more practice problems for exams would be helpful",
                "z",
                "The main strengths of the class are Prof. Peters (who is wonderful and really enjoys teaching) and a good staff of TFs and peer tutors (the peer tutors were especially helpful). The main weakness is the fact that, to an extent the problem sets, but mainly the exams are frustratingly difficult, and are much more focused on testing whether you can do complicated and crazy algebraic gymnastics than they are testing whether you understand the economic concepts that were discussed in class. I get that the core econ classes are curved (which certainly helps our grades), but in my opinion, the fact that the median scores for the midterm and final were a 51% and a 54% respectively is a sign that the exams are way too difficult. Prof. Peters is a really great professor, and despite how hard I studied, I just never felt like I was truly able to demonstrate my knowledge on the exams because they were so absurdly hard, and as a student that can be really frustrating.",
                "Well organized lectures.",
                "Strengths: super interesting and relevant, pretty easy to understand \r\nWeaknesses: the midterm and final were not representative of the difficulty level of psets",
                "Overall I thought the course was taught pretty well. I appreciated how we connected the concepts we were learning in class to current events.",
                "very engaging lecture and extremely enthusiastic professor!",
                "Strengths: each module is very structured and one builds upon another, psets are designed to practice concepted learned in class and further develop understanding. Professor Peters is a GREAT instructor! He explains everything very clearly and in detail, and was patient to answer questions. I particularly like the \"in the news\" section at the beginning of most classes, where he discusses what's happening in the news and how we can use concepts in class to better understand what's happening in the real world. I could not have passed this class without Prof Peters's great teaching!\r\n\r\nWeakness: class is pretty fast-paced, and sometimes difficult to grasp the concept if we don't have the practice question in psets. It would be better to have more review sessions before the midterm and the final exam.",
                "strength: Prof. Peters was a great lecturer and he explains things really well. One of the greatest strengths is Wei (the teaching fellow) he really saved my finals. He always provides a comprehensive framework \/ bigger picture to facilitate learning\/exam prep. His office hour is super helpful as well. \r\nweakness: 9AM",
                "Amazing professor, solid group of TAs, Ed discussion board was very helpful tool.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Midterm exam was a bit too hard and unfair, class was at 9am",
                "IMO quantitative courses like this should be taught using the the blackboard not the slides\r\n\r\nThat said, the slides were very useful.",
                "really loved the professor",
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed the \"In the News\" section Prof. Peters gave us nearly every class, as well as the slow walk-through of the math. I also thought the problem sets were pretty fair (and graded very leniently), and I really enjoyed the help given surrounding the exam.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the office hours with TAs were more evenly spread throughout the week, as opposed to all being one day. I also thought the exams weren't entirely reflective of the problem sets, although I understand that this is likely just to test our ability to newly apply knowledge on the spot.",

                "The course had the right density of information for the time given. \r\n\r\nI appreciated that we thoroughly gave explanations and derivations for the models used in class, both theoretically and mathematically.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we were given a few examples of how we can use AS and AD curves to describe real-world boom-and-bust cycles. I wish we had more time to practice this type of modeling with contemporary examples around the world, or even historical examples.\r\n\r\nHowever, the \"In The News\" section at the beginning of class was great! We should keep that up. It was fun to think about inflation trends in the Russia and US over the past month for example. \r\n\r\nAlso, we had in class discussion questions in the beginning of the semester, but these out as the semester progressed. I'd like to see those return.",
                "Strengths: Professor Peters is a very engaging lecturer who frequently encouraged us to make connections between the material and real world events. There were ample office hours and sections available for students to seek help, and the TAs were all very helpful as well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe this is inherent to macroeconomics, but certain segments, especially the Solow and Romer growth model segments, were difficult to connect to the real world. Maybe some additional clarification on how the unrealistic assumptions that allow these models to work connect to real economic analysis would be helpful. Also midterms not being returned to students made studying for the final much harder.",
                "The lectures include many examples and applications which are really helpful in reinforcing the topics! However, I think the exams are difficult in a way that is not necessarily helpful in reinforcing the concepts.",
                "More office hours! More practice problems in class!",
                "Strengths: Michael Peters. He was a great and very understanding professor. Most of the time he was able to explain concepts very clearly and he encouraged questions if he didn't. Also the in the news segment to \"warm-up\" into the morning lecture was great and informative. Hopefully it continues in the future.\r\nWeaknesses: The 9am class time wasn't the best and I think that's why a lot of students did not show up and chose to watch the recordings. Also some of the slides were vague and hard to understand without the prof or TAs explaining what the main point was.",
                "Intermediate Macroeconomics is much harder than Intermediate Microeconomics and I sometimes find it hard to adjust to that. Plus, there seems to be a divergence between the problem sets and the exams, namely that the performance in one is not closely related to the performance in the other. For instance, I always pay close attention to all problem sets and I devote myself into completing them and I always get good marks. However, when it comes to exams, there are always some blind spots that I think that have not been properly covered in class or in problem sets. So even if I felt confident after the completion of problem sets, I still find exams very difficult. I wonder whether or not that was due to the design of the exams, namely that they were designed to be more difficult than problem sets, but if that is true, I am a little bit frustrated because I feel that I have not been properly prepared for exams in everyday learning. Another thing I dislike is that we don't have feedbacks for midterm exam. We only got a score and that's it. We don't have the problem sheet or the blue books, and even if we got the blue books, there were no markings or comments on them. We were therefore completely left in the dark after the midterm and found it impossible to learn from it. I hope this would change in the future.",
                "I wish the class was not taught at 9am; I believe then more students would show up to class, as Professor Peters was an engaging professor.",
                "This is a great class - Michael is a great lecturer and really cares about his students, their learning, and makes an effort to keep the class engaging by incorporating current news and asking for feedback. Weakness: it's at 9am, but do make the effort to go to the lecture, it's a great class and it'll make Professor Michael Peters sad."

                "yes, definitely take it with michael peters. he's the best at teaching this class. great at lecturing and is a really awesome dude.",
                "I took this course to fulfill a major requirement, and generally struggle with econ, so please take my feedback with a grain of salt. I would recommend this course to a student who finds economics interesting and is looking to further their economic knowledge by working solo and figuring out most of the course material through individual studying. This course is not well-suited to anyone who has difficulty understanding economic concepts. There is a lot of math in the course, and I found that a lot of the math was explained in more depth than economic principles, which I completely lack the intuition to understand without explicit assistance. Despite attending 4-6 hours of office hours each week (and attending all but one lecture in-person), I still found myself struggling to \"get\" the econ part of this class.",
                "Definitely! Obviously it's a course that's required for the major, but Prof. Peters specifically is an approachable person, engaging lecturer, and a good economist.",
                "Yes, but only if you've taken intermediate micro.",
                "Yes. I think that if you are set on taking intermediate macroeconomics then it should be with Professor Peters.",
                "Fulfills econ requirements",
                "I thought Prof. Peters was a fantastic professor. He was kind, cared about his students, enthusiastic, and very engaging. Although the material was difficult at times, his presentation made it feel much more approachable. I appreciated the insights into modern macroeconomic topics that every lecture began with. Perhaps the only weakness I could think of was that lectures could move pretty quickly at times, though given the amount of material that the course covers, I'm not sure how feasible it would be to slow down.",
                "I think that most students taking this course are doing so by requirement. Still, it helps to have a professor that cares, so take it with Dr. Peters if you can.",
                "Absolutely. I have not taken an econ class at Yale before and decided to take a stab at Intermediate Macro  was definitely a little nervous about the math and technicality of the material having only taken an econ class in high school before. But Peters is a fantastic instructor and I found the current events discussions to be super interesting and the material to be really relevant and exciting.",
                "Yes because you need it to be an econ major.",
                "Yes, it's a good course, as long as you know what you're getting into. Professor Peters is fantastic, and lectures are very interesting but the nature of the work itself is nothing surprising (optimization, partial derivatives...).",
                "No, but since it is a required course of the economics major, they will have to take it.",
                "Yeah sure, I do think its a solid overview of many of the classic and famous macroeconomic models while bringing a reasonably mathematical justification behind them; there are more algebraic manipulations  than one would expect, which I was personally very comfortable with because I have a math background, but may be unexpected for others (especially since a major portion of the exams are just problems involving a lot of simple formulaic manipulations and proving certain identities\/relationships mathematically). Sure the models are definitely not perfect and may accurately reflect the complicated trends in these times, but it is a solid foundational course. I definitely think it is more worthwhile to take than Intermediate Micro in terms of relevance to real world applications",
                "Not unless it is changed to focus more on theory and less on the convoluted math. If you have to take it, take it with Professor Peters.",
                "If you're an econ major, no choice but to take it! I would not really recommend it to anyone outside the major since it probably will be too much of a stretch to understand and won't be of much general use, introductory macro is enough for all of that. If you're an Econ major and like exploring broad-based macro topics in economics like inflation, COVID, recessions and monetary policy then you will find the course material very interesting.",
                "Yes, interesting but very challenging.",
                "If you are an EP&E student, Global or Stats person who wants to take higher level Econ classes, and obviously if you are an Econ major its pretty good. Not really worth it if not, the fundamental intuition is in 116 if you just need a basic understanding for PLSC courses",
                "If you need it for your major, I guess. Otherwise, no unless you love economics for some reason",
                "No",

                "Yes!!! Greta class that I was definitely engaged in. Super organized as well.",
                "I would, as this course explains economic activity relatively well.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student. Intro macro sometimes seems way too high level and the models seem too loose. Here, we start off with bigger models, and then dive deeper into each component of the model. I learned a lot in this class.",
                "Prof. Peters is great -- engaging, smart, interesting, really cares about the class. But if math is not your strong suit, however, maybe take this class a different semester taught by another prof.",
                "I mean, you're taking it because you have to take it. It's fine.",
                "If you have to take it then yes. Professor peters was super nice though, so if you have to take Econ 12, I would recommend taking it with him.",
                "Yes. This course is great for any student who is interested in economics, and provides a solid foundation in all the topics associated with macroeconomics such as labor markets, economic growth, inequality, short-run fluctuations, etc. The topics relate to the real world and the course often utilizes real-world data to back up ideas examined in class. 100% recommend.",
                "z",
                "Only if you need it for the econ, global, or ep&e majors. Especially for me as a global major, the really heavy emphasis on the math-side of macroeconomics never felt interesting or applicable to my area of study, and rather felt tedious and frustrating. I thought, especially after having taken the intro sequence, that macro would be more conceptual and less mathematical in comparison to micro, and while it probably still is slightly less math-heavy than 121, it is still very much an applied math course. If you are somebody who is interested in, as Prof. Peters refers to it, the \"beauty of the math,\" then go for it. While I appreciate the mathematical theory, it's not something that I am particularly good at, so I personally didn't enjoy the course.",
                "Yes, you learn a fair bit about macroeconomics and it is likely required for the major.",

                "Yes! Learned a lot about how the economy works",
                "If you must take Macroeconomics, definitely take it with Michael Peters! He is a great lecturer.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class! It improved the way I think about everything from economic growth to taxes to inequality, and gave me a framework through which I can better understand the news. I really recommend that, if you do choose to take this class, to REALLY attend lectures in-person, even if they are recorded. It definitely helped me grasp the material, and I think this class would've been really challenging had I not done that.",
                "This tends to be a major requirement for many people, so there is not much to recommend. However, between intermediate microeconomics and macroeconomics, the macroeconomics coursework\/topics are easier and more engaging.",
                "Yes if you know math.\r\nThis is an easy gut class for math major who wants social science credit, even if you have close to zero econ background like me. The economic ideas and models are interesting and are related to the real world",
                "Yes",
                "Yes - This course gives you a foundational understanding of how to evaluate a nation's wealth and prosperity from an analytical perspective.",

                "Yes",
                "I would since it's one of the core courses for a major in Economics, but I have reservations for the course design.",
                "I would only recommend this course if the student has to take it to fulfill a requirement or if they have a very strong background in economics.",
                "Absolutely, I'm a CS&Econ major and don't think I could completely consider myself an economics major if I hadn't taken economics. For context, I've never taken Intro Macro, but the level of mathematical rigor in the class is similar to that of Intermediate Macro. You learn so much in this class about the world and Professor Michael Peters really makes an effort to explain the why of economics and the importance of it. He's incredibly knowlegde able and the TAs are great - shout out to Wei!\r\n\r\nSometimes the psets can get long, so be sure to start them early!"
