    "I learned a lot about how to analyze world literature and think about books within their greater context.",
    "That writers from different countries all over the world use English in political, beautiful, experimental ways to explore gender, postcolonialism, race, hybridity, family, death, trauma, and so much more of what it means to be human",
    "I learned how to read and write about English world literature critically.",
    "Close reading and analytical skills",
    "continued close analysis of the definition of \"world literature\" or \"global literature\"; exposure to a geographically and nationally diverse collection of postcolonial literature, greater ability to analyze visual art",
    "This course taught me to understand World English Literature within in a colonial and post-colonial framework, opening and deepening the ways in which I understand the lives and afterlives of colonialism, violence, and imperialism. It also helped me to think about the ways in which literature circulates  why and how and where and for whom. And, even when the answers were overwhelmingly heavy, this course reminded me that human beings' capacity to create and reflect their worlds and lives is astonishing and invaluable, all around the globe."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: visiting the YUAG, the novels we read and the freedom we had to discuss anything we wanted to in the novel -- and the time we dedicated to really go deeper into the text \r\nWeaknesses: I feel like the short stories at the beginning of the course was not so well-integrated (but I understand that we were still figuring out what the best classroom routines were at this point because it was shopping period)",
    "Strengths are the books we read which offer a new perspective on English literature. However, sometimes I felt like we did not get very in depth during seminar discussion. We often simply repeated the same ideas over and over about a novel.",
    "Slightly monotonous. Needed some variation.",
    "strengths: well-organized curriculum, small class size that was conducive to more engaged conversation\r\nweaknesses: curriculum that is mostly fixed by the foundational course requirements",
    "strengths: the books were so well-chosen, and spanned an impressively wide array of places and cultures given the time limitations of the course. out of all the required courses for the English major, I found this to be the most rigorous in terms of engaging global realities and histories  it didn't shy away from naming and confronting the problems we should be facing as students studying English literature at an institution like Yale, which itself is complicit and should be placed within this context. also, on another note, the small class size made the class more engaging and challenging than it might have been otherwise. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: not many come to mind! i didn't like writing a reflection of what we'd read at the start of class and handing them all in at the end of the semester  I think that writing them to organize our thoughts, without the pressure of grading, would be a much more productive way to prompt in-depth class discussion."

   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend this course to students who want to read a lot.",
    "YES. Professor Iheka is a generous professor and facilitates great discussions about the novels. We read an array of non-British\/non-Eurocentric works that is so refreshing for English majors, and they're all SO GOOD. The themes of these novels are often universal and have taught me much more about the human condition, the hybrid, family relationships, and gender than what is bound by the genre \"global English literature\".",
    "Yes, because it is an important course to take for the non-Western perspective it provides. But make sure to take it with a professor who knows what theyre doing, because it will make the course much more rewarding.",
    "Yes. The books assigned are interesting.",
    "Yes--especially to English majors looking to fulfill their foundational course requirements, this is by far the most enjoyable and balanced out of the 5",
    "Absolutely  whether or not you're an English major, reading literature beyond the Western cannon is a practice we should all adopt, and I find literature to be one of the most useful and emotionally-rooted ways of understanding history and the workings of the world. Also, a great excuse to read a bunch of amazing books as your homework."
