                "Strength is that you get to learn a lot of Korean and interact with a lot of Korean that isn't common to people who live in the US. A weakness is that this course is very loosely organized so you can feel lost at times.",
                "Strengths: tailored to each student\r\nWeaknesses: syllabus is a little disorganized",
                "Strengths: very good for helping students improve on writing and reading skills. Interesting material \r\nWeaknesses: the instructor was very disorganized and it was unclear what homework was due when.",
                "The course is great in that a comprehensive overview of all the major historical events and social issues are provided throughout the course. The writing assignments are also well designed to make you reflect on the material. However, the course could be more organized, with clearer due dates and ways to submit your work. I would have loved it if Professor was able to provide feedback on all of my work. I feel I have learned more through writing a lot rather than through targeted feedback.",
                "I did get to learn a lot of vocabulary and practice writing in Korean, however I felt that the course itself was not very organized. Many of the assignments were not on canvas and were checked by the TAs.",
                "Maybe a little disorganized",
                "Strengths of the course include a high emphasis on building core vocabulary and advanced grammar skills, as well as strong support from the professor and the TA's\/ \r\nSome weaknesses include some level of disorganization, such as not having a clear place to check assignments and a place to turn them in. The class is also designed to cater to Korean Americans or Koreans from Korea in general, but foreign or American students who do not have a connection to Korea may find it difficult to adjust to it.",
                "The course was organized with a schedule, but the day to day running of the course was not helpful to learning. Some days it was unclear which words we should study and where to send homework because the Canvas assignments were not updated. There was not a lot of feedback in class or any grades received until towards the end which could be improved."

I would, however, not recommend it if you have finished middle school equivalent education in Korea, as I wish the intellectual challenge was greater. The course really is about how much you want to improve your Korean. If you try harder, you will become a better writer.",
