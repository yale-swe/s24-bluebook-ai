                "This course taught me a lot about the biochemical mechanisms of the brain that explain modern-day illusions.  The PSETS required critical thinking skills and a strong desire to apply what was learned in class. It acted more like an intro class to the biological aspects of neuroscience, so highly recommend taking after Human Brain if possible.  \r\nThe material itself was engaging and interesting.",
                "This class was an amazing dive into the five sensory systems, and I have come away with immense knowledge of how the visual system is organized, how we can disambiguate smells from each other, how taste buds work, how sounds travels through our ear, and how our sense of touch works.",
                "Sensory circuitry. Neural processing of information (peripheral and central)",
                "knowledge of sensory systems, input transduction cascades, and of illusions mechanics",
                "A lot. \r\nAs an art and cognitive science major I have yet to take a course that goes very in depth on molecular and cellular biological systems. I had studied perception, specifically visual, on a computational and cognitive level before but didn't understand the systems at play much beyond the anatomy of the eye. This course went in depth in explaining those systems in both vertebrates and insects, which offered a unique perspective and made me more interested in how insects work. \r\nFurthermore, I had no idea how olfaction or taste worked and now I feel like I have a good survey amount of knowledge in these area. \r\nAt the end of the semester I can now look back with some greater understandings, mainly how phenomenal it is that the constellation of data coming in from specialized receptor cells can lead to the all encompassing immersive experience that is perception. \r\nThe way that the class was centered around the illusions helped ground the class in the questions rather than the answers. That made it feel like important work. The textbooks were well selected.",
                "I learned so very much in this course. I learned to think critically about sensory systems and draw parallels between them, which is useful for other topics in neuroscience, as well.",
                "This course explored the molecular and circuit-based foundations of human sensory systems: the first half of the course explored vision, and the back half of the course focused on olfaction, taste, audition, and touch. For each sensory system, we learned how environmental stimuli are recorded and transduced into electrical activity that allows the brain to understand its environment. We learned about various proteins and receptors key to sensing the world around us; this understanding was deepened via investigation of various illusions that act on different sensory systems. Upon completing the course, I feel that I have been able to apply foundational neuroscience knowledge to the specifics of each sensory system. I have also been able to make connections between what I have learned in NSCI 329 and other courses involving biology, biochemistry, and neuroscience.",
                "This was en excellent course in learning more about the sensory story through neuroscience lenses",
                "This course provided a comprehensive overview of the body's sensory systems.  I learned about how we process our environment and integrate this information to create a mental representation of the world.",

                "Strenghts: professors are great, topics are interesting and format is very good\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes HWS/midterms were waay harder than expected",
                "The strengths of this course: the in-person demonstrations of the illusion and the categorization of the sensory topics by week. The overall organization of the course, it was easy to follow what was going on at all points in the course. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course: the midterm questions were poorly crafted and focused so much on memorization rather than application of the material, which seemingly was an important part of lecture",
                "The biggest strength of this class was that at no point did I feel we were rushing through material. Professor Clark and Professor O'Donnell really took their time in explaining the intricacies of the five sensory systems and the lectures were extremely well taught. The six homework assignments and tests were very fair and did not try to trick you at all. The grading system was also really nice  no one assignment was going to make or break your grade. Overall just an awesome course that I'm so glad I took. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness of this course was what one would totally expect for a class being taught for the first time. On occasion, there was a bit of disorganization, mainly in homework assignments being some-what sporadically assigned throughout the semester since they were being made for the first time. However, this should not be a weakness in the next iteration of this class.",
                "It was a new course, so the structure was a little hard to follow at times\r\nThe content is very interesting and engaging",
                "The structure of each lecture (illusion demonstration, sensory system elucidation, and illusion explanation) was a major strength of the course. No weaknesses.",
                "I think the strengths are the deep true knowledge both professors have. They are not bsing... these guys KNOW THEIR SHIT through and through. I enjoyed going to office hours and watching how they could answer any of my questions so precisely without hesitation.\r\nI think this may also be the weakness of the course... it is sometimes challenging to explain something to students that you learned a decade ago. I think of an increased awareness of how difficult the material is to understand at first could help the pacing of the lectures. \r\nI think that video explanations or recordings of the hardest parts of the lecture would have helped me understand. Sometimes the class moved to fast and since there are no recordings its hard to go back and understand the full explanation. If the professors don't feel comfortable recording I think refrences to many of the video explanations that are on the internet could be helpful.",
                "The olfactory section was very packed and a little confusing, but Prof ODonnell was always available to help us so that was okay. Prof Clark is very good about making material simple and understandable. The course was structured very well!",
                "This was an excellent course. The use of illusions to introduce sensory mechanisms was particularly entertaining and engaging, and I appreciated the high level of organization within the course. My one recommendation would be to create a few more, smaller assignments to lessen the weight of each PSET.",
                "It was a really fun experience to start the class with an illusion that we later tried to explain. It was very well organized and the material were very helpful",
                "The strengths include the professors' enthusiasm, the fascinating illusions/demonstrations, and the organization of the course.  Even though this was the first time this course was being taught, it was so well-structured and there were essentially no weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: I thought Prof. Clark did a very good job explaining the concepts and was very receptive to answering people's questions, the PSETs and exams were very fair and accurately tested the knowledge that we learned in the class, the illusions were fun and reinforced the concepts we were learning. Overall the class was well taught and the material was interesting. \r\n\r\nI didn't find there to be any weaknesses with the course",
                "This course was great! Professor Clark is a great teacher and the material was very interesting. We started every class with an illusion, and then talked about the sensory systems that explain it (or dont sometimes if it is still not understood). The tests were super fair and the homeworks were helpful and not too much work. Professor Clark was always available for office hours to help on the homework too.",

                "Yes yes yes! Take this course. Its incredibly interesting and its doable to keep up. If youre a neuro major interested in fun illusions and how they work, definitely take it. If youve got any kind of in te rest in illusions and why they work, and you like bio, also take it!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in neuroscience, biology, or human beings in general. Professors Clark and O'Donnell are fantastic instructors, the material is engaging, the workload is rather light, and various key themes are woven throughout the course such that new material becomes progressively easier to understand. Also, on a simpler note, this course is a lot of fun! Illusions are cool, the brain is cool, and the professors are cool. It's a win-win-win situation.",
