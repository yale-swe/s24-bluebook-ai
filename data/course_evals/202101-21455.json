            "comments": [
                "The professors do not care about helping the students succeed and limit interactions with the students like the stereotypical STEM professor. I was extremely disappointed in this approach to learning given COVID-19 and the difficulty many students are facing and was hoping for a more humane approach. I think that material as interesting as this would be a pleasure to learn if taught by professors that were interested in the students in their course.",
                "I wish the instructors would have spent more time on the more complex concepts and less time on the simple ones. The problem sets were also out of six questions which were each worth one point, so a mistake on one question would bring the overall grade of the problem set down considerably. \r\nThat being said, this course is somewhat outside my major, so the material may have been more difficult for me than it would be for the average student interested in taking the course.",
                "The recorded lectures were really boring and long and the live discussion lectures were not very helpful or engaging. The TAs and the professor weren't really helpful in explaining our mistakes.",
                "Better guidlines",
                "couldn't understand professor, not well organized, test prep poor.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hatzios is an extremely clear lecturer and also super clear when answering questions through email or during office hours. Live lectures were helpful in understanding some of the applications of what we learned from the recorded lectures and how we might be tested on the content. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The TAs were extremely incompetent. I honestly wish this was like many other STEM courses where there are peer tutors or undergraduate learning assistants since I feel like someone who had taken the class before would've known the content way better. I never felt like the TAs knew the material that well and many times they would either not know how to answer questions or provide answers that were incorrect. There was also very little coordination between them so when answering clarification questions on the problem sets, they would often give varying answers, which can be very confusing. The grading on exams and problem sets were also extremely nit picky. They would take off points for the littlest things. The questions were never specific enough to clarify exactly what they were looking for but if you didn't mention specific terms or phrases, you would immediately get points off. Professor Yan was alright as a lecturer but honestly very confusing and went a bit fast. I wish he went a bit slower and explained concepts more clearly. Also, the grading system is so unreasonable. They tell you that they can't determine letter grades until the end of the semester because they have to look at the total points, but that sounds so senseless to me. There is no transparency on how any student is doing, which makes it difficult for someone who might be considering dropping the course or credit\/d\/f the course. I also didn't like how they didn't disclose how letter grades would be determined. They say it's based on \"class performance\" but that's extremely vague and I feel like any course that grades on a curve just fosters a competitive rather than collaborative environment. Lastly, I wish they would've released the answer keys to problem sets and exams. The feedback was often unclear and I don't understand what the issue is with releasing the answer keys.",
                "Strengths: I appreciated the format of the class. Watching pre-recorded lectures and using the live lecture session to go over confusing concepts and apply our understanding was a good format. Also, Professor Hatzios was an excellent professor. She explains concepts very clearly and she was good at responding to emails and follow-up questions. Furthermore, I appreciated the fact that the teaching staff held office hours and review sessions multiple times a week. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think the TAs were competent enough to teach this course. When I went to office hours, the TAs were very restricted in what they could and could not say, they provided vague and confusing answers, and sometimes they guided us in the wrong direction. For example, I would go to one TAs office hours and she would tell me something completely different than when I went to another TAs office hours the following day. Also, I believe the TAs took off unnecessary and unjustified points on the Psets and exams. Often times I had to email the TAs who graded my assignments and argue for points back, but the TAs were nonresponsive and unreasonable.",
                "I found the material to be very interesting to learn about (especially given the pandemic).",
                "Strengths: Professors provide very clear lectures and are more than willing to answer student questions; open note tests are fair and reward studying; the problem sets are very short and the class has a relatively low workload; really organized with each assignment having both a release and due date on the syllabus\r\nWeaknesses: I would have appreciated more grade transparency-- we were told that the class was on a curve but know little else about how our final grades will be calculated",
                "This is a good, well-rounded course overall. Some challenging concepts, but fair exams and problem sets. I liked that it balanced more detail-oriented topics (ie., bacterial cell biology) with more big-picture\/broad concepts (ie., infectious diseases). \r\n\r\nOne area of improvement would be more communication on the part of the TA's in announcing things like midterm review sessions.",
                "The course felt straightforward enough and the content was interesting. I appreciated the effort to boost engagement with the live discussions, but they didn't always feel very effective. We were often put into breakout rooms for five or ten minutes to answer a question that only merited thirty seconds. This is more of a comment on Zoom and teaching remotely. The live discussions were a great review of material and opportunity to expand understanding of the content, but but I think that they could have been more efficient. Other than that, I thought the questions on psets and exams were sometimes poorly written. There seemed to be certain assumptions that had to be made that weren't explicitly mentioned by the question, which left me wondering what the question was asking or what information I was able to draw on.",
                "Fantastic class, I learned so much without being overwhelmed. Strengths include interesting lecture material and many ways to access professors\/TFs. Can't think of any weaknesses.",
                "I learned a lot from this class, and overall, I would recommend this course. Friends who took the class the years before told me the content material was enjoyable, but I couldn't believe it at the time  it turns out that was true! A large part of that had to do with the professors themselves: Yan and Hatzios were very thorough and clear in their explanations, and were always responsive to emails if you asked them a question. I found them incredibly helpful  I will say that I found Professor Yan's portion of the class to be significantly harder than Professor Hatzios' half, just because the first half focused more on the finer details of molecular mechanisms and bacterial cell processes.\r\n\r\nMy one complaint about the class, and this is a big one, is about the TAs. Oftentimes I'd go to office hours ahead of a pset to get some guidance on a question, and two different TAs would guide me along two different answers. If you asked any one of them a question during one of the review sessions, 75% of the time they wouldn't be able to answer it  and sometimes, when they did answer it, it was wrong... Additionally, their grading of psets and exams was terribly inconsistent. The answer they look needs to be worded a specific way in order for it to be graded fully correct  if you had a reworded version that still had the same idea, they would dock you. This has happened multiple times to me and some peers who also took this class  and this indicates that they didn't understand the material enough to see an answer rewritten and still perceive it as correct. Oh, another thing: we'd have psets due the week of an exam, for every exam we took. We never got those psets graded back in time before we took the test, and there was no answer key posted for those psets. That was a pretty annoying inconvenience.\r\n\r\nNormally for any other class, I'd be shy to go to the professors, instead turning to the TAs for my questions. But these TAs were so incompetent that I found myself turning to Hatzios and Yan unexpectedly  and this was not a problem because the professors were so helpful and kind anyway.\r\n\r\nPlease, for next year, I urge you to change the TAs. Two out of the four of them worked in a microbio lab and still gave horrible, muddled explanations, with no clear understanding of the course material.",
                "I think more practice questions should be offered but the pset questions did help provide guidance.",
                "Strengths- Both professor Yan and Hatzios were fantastic lecturers! Their lectures were not dry at all and were a pleasure to watch. The live discussion was also perfect for practicing the types of questions that they would ask, which was a huge help. I loved this course. \r\n\r\nWeakness- The TA's did not typically grade in a just manner. Some TA's were much more strict than others, and when they were asked to rational their grading they became very defensive. The head TA, Caitlyn Moss, was fantastic though.",
                "Strengths: recorded lectures were clear, virtual discussion sections were a good opportunity to ask questions and solidify knowledge with practice questions, problem sets were fair, and lots of help, in the form of review sessions and office hours, was available. Exams for the most part were fair.\r\nWeaknesses: more practice problems and more frequent problem sets could have been helpful to prepare for exams.",
                "strength - good foundation",
                "Strengths: Professors taught mostly clearly and teaching staff was very responsive and had many offerings of office hours and review sessions. Weaknesses: PSETs could have been more comprehensive; they were only 3 questions long, and there were no other practice problems given. It would have been nice to have more material to test our understanding of the material outside of the exams.",
                "It was well structured with lectures and in person review. The tests could be better designed.",
                "I enjoyed the lectures of both Jing Yan and Professor Hatzios",
                "Weaknesses include difficult office hours that would be inconvenient for students and hard to access TAs. TAs also did not have access to the problem set answers which led to students having incorrect answers due to TA office hours. The grading seemed arbitrary for exams, with similar answers getting points off and an apparent lack of standardization between graders.",
                "I thought the midterm exams were all very fair, but I wish the problem set grading had been clearer from the start. I would also have appreciated more clarification around grading for the overall course.",
                "Strengths: live lectures with experiment-based questions really provoked thought and challenged students to apply knowledge as if in lab environment; content of class is great preparation for research-style thinking; Professors Hatzios and Yan were also excellent in teaching the material, clearly knowledgeable, and very willing to assist students\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes questions on exams were difficult or exceeded scope of class; terminology was sometimes confusing too",
                "Strengths: Professors are great, there are a lot of office hours available to go to. Grading is pretty nitpicky, as most biology classes are. I liked that there were psets included this semester to help with distributing grade weight away from exams, but sometimes it was hard to get help on confusing questions and I felt like that made it hard to learn.",
                "This course was very well-organized, and it allowed me to learn much more about biological concepts.",
                "Strengths: strong and responsive teaching team, manageable psets, midterms are fair, took into account COVID (multiple opportunities for grading, get to drop a pset and midterm which was new this semester)\r\nWeaknesses: you have to adjust to the change in professor halfway through the semester, the content itself can be confusing\/difficult especially for Prof. Yans lectures but the textbook is helpful to refer to as well, I felt grading was a bit strict at times and TAs weren't as helpful with answering pset related questions\r\n\r\nNot a weakness but something to keep in mind: this class covers a lot of information so you need to stay on top of the lectures in prep for the final",
                "-",
                "The course material is in general interesting, and the workload is fairly manageable.\r\n\r\nThe TAs are relatively absent. It would be better if the TA participate more in our study.",
                "Some of the exam questions could have been more problem-solving based rather than being pretty close to lecture content. Overall a wonderful course.",
                "Strength was in the class leadership by the professors, along with transparency and class format. Weakness was possibly in the problem sets.",
                "This course is well-organized and effective in moving from intricate details about bacterial cell biology to broader topics like the microbiota, connecting all of them. Everything we learned was contextualized by the end of the course and it was fascinating.",
                "Include discussion of microbes other than bacteria, specifically viruses since they are the pathogens with the most pandemic potential!",
                "I thought the live lectures were super helpful to get practice of questions",
                "I absolutely LOVED this class. The material was interesting and combined other scientific knowledge from other classes (intro bio, biochem, genetics, molecular bio, etc.), which I always find to be rewarding. Even though the course was taught by two professors, there weren't huge discrepancies in the ways that they taught, and so the consistency was nice. There were a lot of office hours and review sessions available for us to utilize as well. I would have loved to see more material on viruses.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- lots of opportunity for interaction with teaching staff\r\n- comprehensive lectures\r\n- teaching staff was very nice\r\n- questions and participation welcomed\r\n- good\/respectful recorded lecture duration\r\n- the interactive sessions were great, very helpful in prepping for exams and generally understanding course content\r\n- psets were reasonable\r\n- feedback was really good\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none as of now"

                "There were no adjustments made to facilitate learning in the COVID-19 pandemic, the least effort I have seen to accommodate students among all the classes that I have taken.",
                "The live discussions need to be removed",
                "Poor.",
                "I think asynchronous recorded lectures were a good move. Live discussions for problems were also a good idea.",
                "Recorded lectures about the material were useful since you could go back and review. Similarly, I thought that having a live discussion was useful, especially with going over tougher material and also going over live practice questions.",
                "The structure of this class was good overall. The breakout rooms might be more engaging if students were assigned the same groups each time, which might foster more of a group\/collaborative dynamic.",
                "Live discussion breakout rooms could have been planned better.",
                "Nothing. This course was perfectly taught for COVID-19.",
                "The live discussion sections with breakout rooms were good for virtual engagement. It was kind of hard to keep up with watching all the recorded lectures though.",
                "i liked the zoom polls during the live sessions, made the class less stressful than what it would be if we had polls and live lecture for all the material. the recorded lectures helped make it less stressful",
                "I really enjoyed the live lectures, and I think they were definitely a strong point for this course. I wish we had spent less time on the questions in those lectures, however, so that we would be able to work on more. My breakout room groups almost always had at least 2+ minutes of left over time after coming to a conclusion.",
                "The virtual lectures followed by live, virtual reviews were very successful in my opinion. The timed canvas tests with announcements to answer questions could be improved.",
                "The once a week live lecture and two recorded lectures format was good for this virtual semester",
                "The combination of live lectures and recordings worked very well for this course. I appreciated being able to watch them on my own schedule, and then test my understanding with the live lecture problems. I also found it very easy to stay on track and keep up with the amount of material each week.",
                "two recorded lectures weekly and live virtual lecture could sometimes feel like too much virtual learning; cutting down time of live lecture or recorded lectures might have been helpful",
                "I liked the recorded lectures.",
                "All the practices made by the teaching team were successful and allowed everyone to be active in the course.",
                "It was nice that we can drop our lowest pset and midterm and that lectures and lecture slides were up on canvas in a timely manner",
                "-",
                "The course accommodates the pandemic very well. The recorded lectures gave students the freedom to work at their own pace.",
                "The class format was perfect for covid because there was a way to learn at your own pace and not be on zoom all the time.",
                "I thought the split between pre-recorded lectures and live lecture discussions was extremely effective. It gave me the flexibility to watch the lectures at any point before they were due and go back and rewatch parts if I didn't understand, which was especially helpful while studying, but also allowed for the engaged, conversational, group work that we usually lack during COVID.",
                "Live lecture discussions with group activities in breakout rooms each week were very helpful in reinforcing\/understanding course material! I also appreciated that the recorded lectures were not too long, helped me stay focused and avoided zoom fatigue.",
                "I thought the live lectures were very helpful",
                "The course format was really helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic. We could watch the pre-recorded lectures on our own time, and the live lecture sessions with breakout rooms made the class engaging. This was one of the few STEM classes during the pandemic where the students were required to interact with each other, and it brought a sense of normalcy to the class.",
                "Recorded lectures plus a live discussion format was very helpful in understanding the material.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- the recorded lectures \r\n- the interactive sessions\r\n- the review sessions\r\n- adjustments to psets\/exams\r\n- addition of an extra midterm and new midterm drop policy were incredibly appreciated!\r\n- organized Canvas\r\n- good use of breakout rooms\r\n- open-book exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none as of now"

                "Never, at least not with these professors. Their grading is inconsistent and also very harsh. The professors do not care about their students and some of the TAs are very detached and clearly have not seen this material in years and did not take the time to review it in a meaningful way, leaving them as lost as the students sometimes.",
                "No I would not. Take another MCDB courses if you need it for the major. It is really poorly taught and the students are not supported by the teachers.",
                "Only if the TAs are different",
                "no",
                "yes, if you need an advanced biology lecture, this is one of the best I've taken and perhaps the most suited for accessible learning",
                "The workload wasn't too bad and I think the content was honestly really interesting but there is a lot that can be improved in the course in terms of organization and communication amongst teaching staff.",
                "I would recommend this course if it was a requirement for your major.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. For MCDB majors or people interested in science, this course is a great core science class to take given its relatively okay workload. For non-science students, I would still recommend this course since the topics are, for the most part, not highly complex and I think having a general understanding of microbiology would be something everyone should at least know.",
                "Microbiology is a great course for anyone who is interested, and I would recommend it as someone who took it as a non-major. The professors make the material accessible to all and provide unique examples of interesting microbes that you wouldn't learn elsewhere. Understanding the sporulation of an anthrax relative, for example, was fascinating. In addition, I learned how to create causal studies-- a skill that I will carry forwards in the rest of my classes.",
                "Yes, to a student interested in biology or infectious disease, or to a pre-health student.",
                "This is an interesting MCDB elective with a very manageable workload, and microbiology is definitely a cool field with a lot of interesting things to learn about, especially with regards to the gut microbiome.",
                "Definitely, a must-take to any MCDB major interested in microbes. Could also be valuable for people interested in medicine who want to better understand infection-causing pathogens.",
                "Yes. If a student wants to learn more about bacteria and to improve this biology skills in the process, then this is a great course to take. I do love biology, so I am a bit biased. However, I think every student at Yale should look into taking a course of this caliber. It was excellently taught. I can't praise it enough.",
                "Yes, it's not too difficult of a course, and you get to learn some cool applications of microbiology. Lots of overlap with other biology classes, especially if you have taken MB&B 301.",
                "yes for a  foundational biology course, the grading is pretty vague though",
                "Yes, it is a solid MCDB core.",
                "Yes. Its a good MCDB core class with not a crazy amount of work. It may have been different during virtual classes but everything was open note so concepts and understanding were tested rather than pure memorization. Both Professor Hatzios and Jing Yan are very good lecturers",
                "This was the best MCDB course Ive ever taken. The professors are fantastic and not only knowledgeable, but amazing and interesting lecturers.",
                "I would recommend this class to any student interested in bacteria specifically. It was also overall a lower weekly workload, which was nice.",
                "Yes probably one of your best bets as an MCDB core",
                "Yes! Though at times challenging in experiment-style thinking required, the content of the course gives great preparation for applying microbiology in designing your own experiments in the lab",
                "Yes, if they're interested in the subject. This is one of the better MCDB core classes. It's well-organized and the grading policies are pretty generous (drop lowest midterm and pset), although that doesn't mean it's easy to score well (felt like the standards could be very nitpicky). The professors are both very kind and receptive to feedback -- they improved the psets and exams as the semester went on, which I appreciated. The course material also got much easier as we went on.",
                "Yes, I will certainly recommend this course to another student, it was a wonderful MCDB course.",
                "Yes, I think it's a solid MCDB course and it was interesting to learn about bacteria. I feel like it's a topic often overlooked in high school biology\/other college biology classes",

                "Yes the content is very fun and manageable",

                "I would! Great core class for MCDB majors",
                "Absolutely!! It is fascinating content and the professors are great!",
                "If you are looking for an easier MCDB core course, then yes. Otherwise the material is not super interesting, a bit dry.",
                "Yes I would if they want to learn about microbiology",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This class provides a great foundational knowledge of microbiology (important if you are a pre-med!). I took this course even though it was not a major requirement and did not regret it at all.",
                "Yes, this course is well taught and not difficult.",
                "I would recommend this course especially useful for those interested in biology research. This was a great foundational class for microbiology in the lab.",
