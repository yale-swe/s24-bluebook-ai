                "One of the most amazing classes Ive ever taken at Yale! Absolutely loved the in person field trips to the Boston MFA, YUAG, Beinecke, etc!",
                "strengths: Professors Bass and Peters are an impeccable team. They each bring such a unique perspective to the class and complement each other so well.  It felt as if they were learning as much from each other as we were learning from them, which is special in an undergrad course. The readings were generally fantastic and discussions were rich. It's obviously a treat to work in Yale's collections and this class took full advantage without ever fetishizing the objects at the expense of broader conceptual discussion.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: I think simply due to the broad nature of media studies, this class sometimes felt a bit confused. It took me 1/3 of the semester to really 'get' what we were doing and 'figure out' how everything in the class was connected. As a result, things could feel a bit random at times. I'm not sure this is necessarily a problem that can be fixedit might just be how learning work. But I did feel as though the earliest weeks in the class could have been couched with some more general readings on the history of the early modern Netherlands as well as a (longer) introduction to media theory as we would be applying it.",
                "Despite the curiosity cabinet of topics here I was quite bored sometimes. Sometimes I felt we were like cows, grazing.",
                "Prof Bass and Prof Peters are both awesome and compliment each other really well, it was such a treat to see them every week. I loved getting to take a class focused on handling objects, it's a really unique experience you can't get through many other Yale classes. The professors learned as the semester went on that we couldn't read Dutch, so there were some difficulties early on with difficulties understanding the objects. I also felt, as someone relatively unfamiliar with the class's subject matter, lost at the beginning, and wonder if there could've been some more grounding in why what we were discussing was interesting and important.",
                "Strengths: hands-on learning in the Beinecke / YUAG / MFA in Boston, successfully interdisciplinary - the course did an exemplary job demonstrating how the sciences and the arts are mutually supportive disciplines \r\nWeaknesses: none! the one thing might be that sometimes it felt like the scope of the course was too broad for 13 short weeks - we could have easily spent the entire semester on just one of the units",
                "The course is very well organized, includes many interesting trips to the Yale libraries and galleries, and included students with diverse academic backgrounds. Its exploratory and interactive nature, as well as the collaborative environment fostered by the professors, meant that students came to know each other well by the end!"

You don't need to know anything about the early modern period or the Netherlands or media theory or art history, but having some familiarity in one of these areas might be useful.",
                "I would",
                "I'd definitely recommend this course, it's a great environment where you just get to enjoy learning with other cool people. This class is an example of how studying the hyper-specific can lead to huge questions, which is a wonderful way to work and think. The professors are also both really curious and therefore flexible about interests for the final paper.",
                "I'd definitely recommend this course - it was one of the few courses I've taken that successfully integrated varied disciplines to show how each one can be enhanced by others. Having class in a different museum each week and the field trip to the MFA will give you a renewed appreciation for the resources we have at Yale and how to make the most of them in the final research project. The instructors are incredibly generous with their time and knowledge and are very accessible.",
