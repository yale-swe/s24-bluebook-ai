We looked at how subjectivity is constituted and how it interacts with social systems / identity positions. This is the first class I've taken that looks at this topic -- I think it is super helpful for WGSS majors as these themes pop up a ton in readings and may be hard to understand without a class like this with gives background on psychoanalytic and affect theories.",

She herself was a lovely and very supportive professor. She made space for every student in a way that Ive never experienced before.",
                "Prof. Lewis does such a good job at facilitating discussion and creating a learning environment. All of the readings we've done for this class have been super interesting (they could be a bit difficult, but because we had a reasonable reading load, we got to dive into all of them deeply).\r\n\r\nI loved how we were encouraged to link the topics of this class to our lives",
                "I think the course was amazing, the syllabus was amazing, the discussions were so awesome, I loved coming to every class. I think it could have been improved by me understanding it faster, but that is user error, not a fault of Professor Lewis. It helped me reevaluate the ways that I listen and learn. The transisition between concepts was masterful!"
