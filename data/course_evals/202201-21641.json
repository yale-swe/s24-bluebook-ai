The homework provided extensive practice in writing analysis proofs.\r\n* Prof Schlag's lecture style is very interactive. He focuses explicitly on motivating definitions and proofs with problem-solving intuition/illustrative examples, and he often asks for student input as he presents results so that we think with him during the lecture. Furthermore, relative to other math classes I have taken there was much less hand-holding in terms of working out small technical details of proofs discussed in class. Altogether, I felt that taking this class pushed me to developed greater mathematical maturity and reevaluate the way that I thought about math.",

His psets are very time-consuming, so buckle up, but I think they do a good job of reinforcing material.  Prof Schlag also gives 'generous help' (his words) on the more difficult ones.  Psets are returned promptly, and grading isn't overly pedantic (although graders change year-to-year).",
                "+ See (1).\r\n- Prof. Schlag's lecture style is probably best suited for auditory learners, since much of what he says (e.g. when he discusses intuition) is not written on the board. As someone who is more of a visual learner, this required a bit of adjustment.",
                "The course was fast-paced, but overall was very well-taught and fairly structured.",

                "The homework was much more challenging than I had anticipated, but given that this was cross-listed as a graduate course, I suppose that shouldn't have been so surprising to me.\r\n(In the end, I missed two p-sets)",
                "This class was very challenging, but I'm not sure that detracts from how interesting it was. I think if the problem sets were slightly easier, I think I would've enjoyed the course more while I was taking it. It's hard to appreciate how interesting a class is or a professor is when you're bogged down by work, but to be fair my impression of the course changed quite a bit once I began attending office hours. Dr. Schlag is quite demanding but certainly very helpful. He is the primary strength of this course. That seems kind of silly because what else could the strength be, but I would say that the strengths of this course are much more due to him than the actual content itself, an assessment I would not give to many other math classes I've taken at Yale. Taught by another professor, I'm not sure I would have had a positive assessment of the course given how much time it ate up.",

It nicely generalizes lots of things from linear algebra and uses real analysis for some cool results, which also have lots of applications if you're into physics or lots of other topics.  Definitely come to class because the course only sort of follows a textbook and includes many things not in the book.  If you want a low workload course you can easily stack onto whatever else you've got going on, then maybe look somewhere else, but if you're willing to sink time into something interesting, consider this course.",

You will not only learn about the big theorems in functional analysis, but you will also learn more about the motivations behind them as well as their important applications.

It took a lot of my time but I genuinely feel like I am a better student of math after this course.
