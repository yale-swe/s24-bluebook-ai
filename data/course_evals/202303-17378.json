                "I learned how to create a proposal for a project, conduct independent scholarly research, and work on and revise a semester-long paper.",
                "I learned how to conduct extensive research and writing at the same time -- it may sound basic, but carrying on a project of this scope and making progress in multiple directions at once is a feat and I learned how to do so through ENGL 490. The skills I developed in writing the thesis included: how to organize and plan such a long piece, how to make edits more effectively and critically, and how to engage in directed research and navigate extensive sources."

                "I liked how much freedom we had in pursuing our project; I definitely gained more from this experience than I do from a typical English course. I also think the benchmark due dates were really good for keeping us on track, but the additional assignments (like the annotated bibliography) felt like busy work. Personally, I didn't need the help offered by group meetings, but I do think they were good for community building.",
                "The senior essay challenged me to write at a volume and with focus I had never done before.  It may have been one of the most daunting things I've ever done at Yale, but the tutorial did a great job of guiding us through the process.  I grew as a critic, writer, and thinker through the process.",
                "I found the sessions that brought the essay writers together very nice as a way to meet other students and exchange ideas. No weaknesses. Prof. Campbell and our TF Micah did a fantastic job at cultivating community and were incredibly helpful in the writing and revision process. I appreciated how available they made themselves to help with writing, read drafts, and provide guidance.",
                "Having meetings where I could talk to the other members of my senior essay cohort was a really great part of this experience. It helped me feel less alone in the process because I would hear other people talk about having similar issues as me and be able to ask them for advice. I would suggest continuing to hold weekly meetings and writing workshops for future senior essay cohorts.",
                "Strengths: Professor Campbell and Micah were instrumental to my experience of the course. Their insights on the writing process somehow lifted up all 14 of the senior essayists who were all engaged in different projects and processes. More specifically, the strengths include having ample time to actually work and write your thesis! From formal deadlines to informal writing gatherings the class was well designed and paced to address senior essay-ists needs. This happened both because of the way the class was organized (reading examples of senior essays early in the year, discussing organization, editing discussions and groups) and because Professor Campbell and Micah regularly built in time for essayists to share their struggles, progress, and tips which made the class feel very connected and responsive.\r\nWeaknesses: Not a weakness, but doing the senior essay is a time commitment!!"

                "If there's a topic in literature that you're passionate about, then absolutely! It's incredibly rewarding getting to dive deeply into a self-driven intellectual pursuit. However, I would caution undertaking the Senior Essay unless you're really interested in your topic  you need to spend A LOT of time working on it, which can be either be fun or draining depending on how you feel about your subject.",
                "Yes!  This is a really self-directed scholarly project, and an amazing opportunity to explore anything you are passionate about with the help of faculty!",
                "Yes, I would highly, highly recommend the Senior Essay!! It is such a treat to be able to work on a long-form project on a topic of your choosing. The teaching team and community and fantastic. This is a very rewarding way to conclude your time in the English major.",
                "I would definitely recommend undertaking the senior essay to other English majors. While taking a senior seminar is also a great option, the process of ideating, creating, and producing the senior essay was really valuable for me and helped me find a sense of culmination after almost four years at Yale. I was also able to pursue an area of literature that I was very passionate about!",
                "I am so glad I did the senior essay! I would definitely recommend the experience because I have left feeling supported and proud of the work I completed. That being said, the senior essay may not always be the best fit based on your schedule or goals for senior year. I knew I wanted to do a senior essay and am grateful I had the opportunity to do so with Professor Campbell and Micah. It felt like my years of writing were able to culminate in this project."
