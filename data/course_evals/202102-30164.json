                "Strengths- the problem workshops and the problem sets. The test were fair and did not stretch beyond the scope of the course. The professor was kind and obviously wanted all students to succeed (which is an important attribute for a good professor). \r\n\r\nWeakness- The structure of the summer course was fast and ambitious. We would learn a whole new concept on a Wednesday and it would be included on the exam on Friday. I do think the exams were adjusted for this, but it was difficult and rushed nonetheless. This weakness is not a weakness of the professor, nor the class, but rather just the nature of the summer course.",
                "This course was taught well, but I think dedicating class time to getting through all the material first, and saving questions for the end could be useful.",
                "I really liked how we met with the teacher shortly after each exam. I left that meeting feeling better or at least understanding the problems better than i did after the exam.",
                "Strength - TA was amazing, he answered all my questions, hw was very clear on what went and what didn't. \r\nWeakness - Instructor knew which was the hardest topic and was not very prepared for the content. His teaching could be a bit better and clearer. More engaging as well. If we went over more series questions in the review sessions, it would have been more helpful.",
                "I think for a summer course especially the class was great. Obviously it goes a little fast but there really isnt another way. One thing is that I sometimes forgot to watch the videos on Canvas so maybe incorporating them into the quizzes would be better.",
                "The strengths is that it was very organized and the teacher was more than willing to help the students in any way! I don't know if this could be possible, but I think even adding one additional week to the course would make a big difference that helps everyone.",
                "The strengths of this class are Jim Roth's excellent pre-class lectures and Prof. Brett Smith's teaching!"

He does a good job lecturing and doesn't waste class time. This course is not easy, but is manageable when taught in a learning friendly environment.",

I generally thing people when fulfilling distribution requirements try to take the easy math or the easy science or the easy writing class. But in taking a course like this you will learn more and be more fulfilled in the end.",
