I also felt that there was a lack of historical context that would allow you to get more value out of the texts ingrained within the course and you had to do your own research or rely on your professor for this context.  There were also some texts towards the end of the semester that seem like they were inserted solely to combat the critique that DS is so exclusively Western-focused, as they were not presented with the rest of the course in an integrated way and I felt I lacked adequate context for these works and cultures.  In the future, more of an introduction to these cultures would smooth the currently abrupt transition from Ancient Greece/Rome smoother and allow students to get much more out of the texts."

If so, this will be one of the best classes you will ever take.  That said, it is obviously a lot of reading and writing, so don't do DS if you're not a fan of both."
