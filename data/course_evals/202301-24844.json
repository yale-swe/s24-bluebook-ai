There are a lot of ULA and professor office hours so lots of support.",

                "I think this course was taught well in class but the homework problems from the book were always either something completely different from what we learned in class or just severely complicated and in order to do well in the class I had to spend around 5 hours per week in office hours to complete the problem sets despite knowing what was going on in class. I think the problem sets were very frustrating and not at all helpful to the course as they did not reflect the style questions we saw in class and on tests.",
                "After resubmitting a concept check for the 3rd time, I think more guidance should be given. At that point its pretty clear theres something Im not grasping but were not allowed to receive help.",
                "Weakness: its math, so naturally it can get confusing and dull\r\n\r\nStrengths: C.J. is an amazing professor who did his best to make class exciting and understandable. He works hard to ensure his students take the most from the class."

                "I recommend this course to a student who isn't very strong in math or who hasn't taken a calculus class. I liked being able to learn basic calculus over the course of a year instead of a semester and found the extra attention from professors and ULAs very helpful. I often went to ULA office hours to ask questions about problem sets and they did a good job explaining and walking through problems.",
