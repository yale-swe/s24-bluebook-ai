    "I learned a lot about the Italian history during World War II. I practiced with expressing myself in hard\/philosophical discussions involving culpability and sacrifice and responsibility.  I got the chance to explore writing in different genres such as but not limited to historical fiction and comparative essay format. I also had the chance to explore translating works from Italian to English.",
    "I had never taken an Italian class before and this one was perfect! I learned so much not only about the Italian language and culture, but a lot about WWII from a lens that isnt normally explored- the Italian partisan movement.",

    "I think this class does an amazing job at investigating the narrative around the partisan movement during WWII through different primary and secondary sources including songs, memoirs, documentaries, movies and literature. However, since the theme is the same throughout the semester, I felt like we could move faster than we did at times. I wish we had more discussions comparing these sources (the way we did for thesis development for the two novels we read, the two films we watched etc.)",
    "I think it was well-run and engaging. I loved how we had group discussions every class."

    "Definitely! If you want to immerse yourself within the language you are taking, this class helps you learn more about the Italian consciousness and history. It was unbelievable that we ended up reading two Italian novels by two great writers in its own language.",
    "Yes! Great in-depth Italian course of the language and culture and also a great history and literature course.",
    "yes!"
