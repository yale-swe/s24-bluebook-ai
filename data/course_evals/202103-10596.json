                "I developed a more advanced and more theory-rooted way to analyze and understand popular and commercial music. Throughout the course, I began to understand some common harmonic structures in pop music, and I now have a much greater appreciation of the music I listen to every day.",
                "I learned about a variety of topics in popular music theory, including basic form, meter, rhythm, melody, modulation, and harmony. My favorite part was learning about common chord progressions in popular music and their variations.",
                "I learned a lot about the foundations of popular music and how to break them down and analyze each part.",
                "I learned how to apply concepts from music theory to popular music in interesting and non-traditional ways",
                "I gained a language with which to talk about music, particularly pop music, that I formerly lacked.",

                "This was a great course! Honestly, the only downfall in this course was just a lack of time in class.",
                "The course covered an impressive range of different topics in popular music theory with ample opportunity for in-class discussion. I would have appreciated more opportunities for discussion sections to go a little more in-depth with the material covered in class.",
                "I would say the strengths are the accessibility of the course. Nothing feels so difficult that you ever feel completely lost in the course. One weakness is that I think the music studied in the class tended to lean toward 20th century a little too heavily and I think a little more 21st century pop wouldve made the class a bit more enjoyable. Also a a greater diversity of artists.",
                "The course felt very dynamic in that the professor tended not to have a specific structure for a lot of it, and this was a strength and a weakness. Sometimes it led to interesting discussions and tangents about certain songs or progressions, and sometimes it felt disengaging.",
                "Strengths: Very relaxed, fun and interesting course about pop music theory. Mostly accessible to people without music theory backgrounds. Great 5th course that added to my semesters learning without stressing me out too much. Nate Adam is a gem.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: If the instructor/TF were leaving feedback on my assignment, I was unable to locate it on Canvas and see whether or not I was repeating the same mistakes in my later assignments. The lack of stressful, structured assignments is a strength of this class, but a bit more feedback would have been nice on the assignments we did have.",
                "The class assignments allows students to have a lot of creative freedom with the ability to choose their own songs to analyze.",
                "This course is not difficult and the content is quite interesting. However, it is not very well organized. The primary issue is that there is nowhere to review materials. We would listen to the professor lecture in class, but there was nowhere to review any of the info. The prof and TA were very available to chat, but I would have really appreciated some slides or written support.",
                "Great course though I feel like I wish we were taught some more formal things that expanded beyond the analysis we were doing in class. For example, I really enjoyed the discussion on different types of cadences and one of my favorite days was when we did modulation. It doesnt even have to be proper music theory but I think the terminology professor Adam came up with in that class was engaging and meaningful to be able to talk about certain topics using specific vocabulary"

Even students who are not as interested in theory will have the opportunity to learn about some really interesting trends in popular music and gain interesting exposure to a variety of genres in popular music.",

If you're looking for a course that goes more deeply into complex music theory, you might be better suited with another course.",
                "Definitely! It was a really interesting 5th course that was the first gut-rated course that actually felt like a gut in the best way possible. I learned a lot and wasnt stressed out about my grade because Professor Adam was super understanding on late work and had a really generous grading policy.",

                "Yes! Great course to understand how music theory applies to modern works",
