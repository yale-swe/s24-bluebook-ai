    "How to use matrices",
    "This class attempts to teach fundamental linear algebra skills for application in physics, computer science, and other fields.\r\n\r\nIt is not very successful at actually teaching such skills to the students.",
    "You learn the basics of matrix manipulations, linear transformations, and independence.",
    "I learned a lot about self directed learning and about linear algebra.",
    "I learned about the basic concepts used in linear algebra, including matrix functions and analysis.",
    "I learned a lot about matrices and how they work and how they can be applied.",
    "I learned about the fundamentals of linear algebra, including eigenvalues and eigenvectors, finding orthogonal bases with Gram-Schmidt, using Gauss-Jordan to find a matrix's inverse, and much much more. Very useful and engaging class for anyone who needs to learn the essentials of linear algebra with no background in proofs.",
    "Linear Algebra basics",
    "Linear Algebra, Matrix Operations including Projections, Transformations, and Determinants, Eigen-eveything and applications",
    "I learned a lot about how to think of natural phenomena in terms of matrices - a super valuable skill",
    "I learned about the fundamentals of linear algebra.",
    "Gaussian Elimination, fundamental sub spaces, orthogonality, projection matrices, eigenvalues and eigenvectors",
    "Ability to critically think about math, logic, and better solving problems",
    "The course covers a very basic introduction to linear algebra. Gaussian elimination, subspaces, orthonormalization, and eigenvalues are supposedly covered in this course. Of course, you're going to have to teach yourself everything anyway. So if you're comfortable learning everything from Gilbert Strang's MIT online lectures, you can get a lot out.",
    "matrix operations, eigenvalues, factorization",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Extremely dry, not engaging at all. There are no strengths.",
    "This is far and away the worst class I have taken at Yale.\r\n\r\nIt was disorganized, poorly taught, and lacked resources to supplement the poor teaching quality.\r\n\r\nThe only saving grace was the peer tutors who were very patient and well-meaning. Despite going to class and office hours regularly, I had to learn almost all the material on my own, largely through the internet, because the lectures were impossible to follow and the instructor did not follow along with the textbook.",
    "I thought it was a well organized course, but it was sometimes hard to stay focused for the entire 75 minute lecture.",
    "The course was not well taught and none of the concepts were properly taught. There was a lack of focus on fundamentals and on reinforcing understanding. The class was taught with focus on only equations and regurgitating information.",
    "I thought this course was well designed through assignments. The home work and extra practice provided were helpful. I felt a weakness of the class was the method it was taught. The concepts were introduced in confusing ways that became more clear after learning the entire section, or having to read the book and teach it to myself then.",
    "I think the strength of this course was Professor Liu's teaching. He was super clear and accessible, and simply by going to the lectures every day, I learned the material.",
    "I think the course covers a good amount of content but could cover more if it stretched itself a little. I felt like we spent a lot of time in review (but hey not necessarily a bad thing in my book).",
    "the online resources need to be improved - for example, the pset and midterm answers should be posted after they have been returned.",
    "Strengths were definitely Yuchen's lectures. He gives good, clear lectures that are a lot easier to understand than simply cold reading the textbook. As long as you pay attention, you'll learn just about everything you need from lecture if Yuchen is teaching. The main weakness for me, at least as compared to math 120, is the lack of emphasis put on providing resources outside of the textbook and lecture. Would love to see 222 have the same deluge of outside resources linked directly to the canvas site as math 120 has.",
    "Prof. Liu lectures kind of dry, but he understands questions REALLY well and gives decent answers. Also, the tests are fairly straightforward (nearly identical to the practice exams) and this shouldn't be a hard A if you are good at computation. However, I didn't like the computation focus this course had and wish he had taken some more time to give us a visual understanding of the concepts.",
    "The material itself is pretty dry, and I found myself having to use alternate textbooks and YouTube channels to actually understand the material.",
    "Course does NOT cover enough material and does not go over any applications of linear algebra. We basically learn how to be a matrix calculator, not how to use linear algebra in science and engineering. If you want to take a boring computation class, this is for you, else pick another course.",
    "Strengths: fair tests\/problem sets, clear notes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures dry and a bit confusing",
    "The course has very fair psets. \r\n\r\nThe course could be made drastically better by having a professor with some decency. Unequal grading, poor curving, and an unwillingness to discuss grading made for an opaque and genuinely disengaging course.",
    "This course is very well taught if you make sure to attend class. There are also weekly review sessions that can help for understanding concepts and practicing with exercises.",
    "Prof. Liu might not be the most engaging teacher -- his lectures feel a bit slow and I often skipped them. Grading might feel a bit harsh at times, but mind that psets only account for 20% of the final grade.",
    "Strengths: the psets are a good challenge at about medium difficulty, Professor Liu is a good lecturer and easy to follow, and his office hours are helpful when addressing my specific questions.\r\n\r\nBoth a pro and con: Though the practice exams are very hard, we go over how to do each problem in class and then the actual exams were exactly like the practice exams. But if I were given an exam of equal difficulty but different format questions, I don't think I would have been prepared for them.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the sections were not super helpful, it's mostly going over new practice problems instead of answering questions. There really isn't any application problems, we just don't spend much time on proofs and the professor didn't have too much patience for super conceptual questions. Also, I had a hard time focusing during 9am lectures but maybe that was just me.",
    "The lecture could be explained much better and examples would be helpful in helping people understand the material in general.",
    "This course was honestly terrible. I never felt like I learned in lecture. It also wasn't organized. There was no calendar, so you could never do readings for topics before class because you didn't know what sections from the book would be covered. Some sections from the textbook were also skipped. I felt that lectures never prepared me well for the exams. Reading the textbook was more beneficial than going to lecture, and I still felt unprepared after reading the textbook. It was more worth my time to watch the author of our textbook's MIT YouTube lecture videos than to go to class."

   "comments": [
    "No, do not take this unless you have to. The material is not well taught and the subject itself is not very interesting.",
    "No. Do not take unless absolutely required. Try to find a way around it if you can.\r\n\r\nThe teaching is awful, you aren't given a lot of resources to supplement the poor teaching quality, and then you're tested on things you haven't properly learned.",
    "I would recommend this course as a good baseline for other STEM courses, especially in engineering.",
    "Not if you can take another course instead. There is very little conceptual understanding offered in this course. It is called \"Linear Algebra with Applications\", but there are no applications taught in the course. The concepts and fundamentals are not reinforced.",
    "If it is not required as a math requirement, I would not recommend this class because it is difficult and not necessarily practical knowledge.",
    "I think with Yuchen, I would recommend this course. I've heard bad things about how this course was taught in the past, but this professor was super clear in his explanations.",
    "I would. It's a good course and honestly not too bad workload-wise.",
    "Yes, because the material is very applicable for other science and math classes.",
    "Only if you need it for something, but I've never been the kind of weirdo who would take a math class just for fun. If that's you, then more power to you, I'm sure you'll like this one just fine.",
    "Yes, it is necessary. But you might want to take 225 if you want a more rigorous, proof-based class that forces a lot more intuitive learning",
    "Only if you have to.",
    "Not at all. This course was a waste of a credit. We gained 0 applicative skills and I felt like this class was nothing but a burden. Only take this course if you truly need it for your major, otherwise MATH225 is a significantly superior course. The material of 222 only covers about 60% of the textbook and skips all of the relevant applicative material. This course is also not even remotely relevant to anyone studying Computer Science, S&DS, any form of Math, Engineering, or Science.",
    "Yes. It is a relatively pain free way to learn linear algebra.",
    "Absolutely not. Any student who wants to learn must stay away from this class. \r\n\r\nTake 225 if you don't want arbitrary grading, exams that are harder than psets, and to not learn anything from lecture.",
    "Yes because linear algebra is useful.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you need it for your major or are looking for another math class to take for pure interest.",
    "Definitely if you are a science \/ engineering major",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course! I knew nothing about linear algebra coming in to this course so every topic was a surprise, but even though matrices were completely new to me I thought the lessons all built on each other well and I could easily follow Professor Liu's lectures. (On two occasions professor Hoskins subbed instead and his board notes were kinda difficult to understand.) Despite the psets being medium difficulty imo, they were a good challenge, and I was able to get good scores on them without a study group or office hours (even though I probably should have taken advantage of them). So even if I didn't enjoy the psets or 9am lectures individually, I enjoyed the class overall.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless that person needs to take it.",
    "Only take this course if you have to take linear algebra."
