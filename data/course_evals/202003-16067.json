                "I gained a theoretical foundation in different definitions of populism and their implications in empirical analyses. We also learned to connect political rhetoric with mobilization and content, and analyze them in context of each other.",
                "This course thoroughly examined the concept of populism and how it applies in both historical and modern contexts. I enhanced my understanding of the material, but also enhanced my critical thinking and writing skills.",
                "I got a better understanding of the debates over populism, what it is, if it is a good thing. In doing so, I learned a great deal about political theory more generally. \r\n\r\nI got a good sense how to compare variants of populism in their national contexts and how this comparison tells us something about populism as a general phenomenon. This method is exceptionally useful for making valid theories about politics and life. I got a better theoretical understanding of how politics operates, as a result.\r\n\r\nI learned a great deal about argument in this class, much more than I anticipated. Word economy, structure, use of evidence are all emphasized."

Paris does a good job stoking this fire. He pushes back and leads well to ensure it is burning hot. \r\n\r\nParis also constructed the syllabus in a very logical way conducive to learning. He does what should be done in a good essay, telling you what the class will be about (populism), how we are going to study it (intellectual history and comparative politics), and leaves you to draw conclusions. \r\n\r\nAlso, the papers are a great way to study something relevant to the class but something of your own idiosyncrasy."

I do think that the reading load was very manageable and some of them were interesting, but I did not like the professor very much. He was nice and a fun guy, but I feel like he was not the most animated in our discussions. The two hours really dragged on, and I felt like much of his words were fairly monotone. I definitely think the content was interesting, but the professor did not make it the best class it could be.",
                "Absolutely! If youre interested in populism as a concept as well as case studies of how its played out in the real world, this is a really wonderful class. Prof. Aslanidis provides really helpful feedback, and he pushed me to improve my own thinking and writing. Some of the theory could be intellectually challenging at times, but in a rewarding way. Also super timely given everything happening in the world.",
                "I would recommend this course for anyone who has any remote interest in populism as with any full semester course on a specific subject, there is so much to unravel regarding the concept. This particular seminar here placed a unique focus each week on various themes regarding populism and how it can vary based on context. Workload mainly consisted of readings each week and were generally very interesting each week, with clear feedback given on assignment. The professor is furthermore very direct in being able to communicate what they are seeking, and thus I recommend this course for anyone who wants to place themselves in an informed-discussion heavy setting that allows them to explore populism.",
                "Absolutely. This course not only broadened my understanding of populism, but altered my perception of academia entirely. I don't believe there are many courses that can achieve this level of enrichment, making this one an exemplary selection.",
                "Absolutely. Any political science student should have a good grasp of populism. This course is a great way to study that and all related topics, which there are many. \r\n\r\nThis course does not require any special background. One just has to be ready to argue their point.",
                "Would absolutely recommend. Fascinating content matter and well-organized to address the topic from all angles. You also learn about methodology in a very clear and interesting way."
