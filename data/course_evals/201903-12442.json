    "Overall, Naval Science Lab is very well designed for students in Naval ROTC. It is a simple, low-time-commitment lab where you usually sit down and listen to interesting people discuss their experiences in\/with regard to the Navy. Additionally, some labs are more engaging and hands-on, like workshops, the Leadership Reaction Course, \r\n\r\nOne big thing that could be improved is the diversity of the speakers or the people that are invited to the lab. After someone in the chain-of-command mentioned that we should invite more people of color to speak, a company commander immediately refuted him and said that we shouldn't base things on diversity, but on merit instead, which is totally uncalled for.",
    "Great speakers this semester. More engaging than in previous years.",
    "Lab was the best it had been, so no meaningful improvements."

    "Yes! If you are at all interested in the military, I would encourage you to try ROTC. It could change your life!",
