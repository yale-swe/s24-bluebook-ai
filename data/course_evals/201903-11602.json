    "I learned about a region I knew nothing about going into the course and more about Political Science theory.",
    "An understanding of the conflicts and regimes of the Balkan countries in the 80s and 90s, and how this continues to influence them.",
    "I learned a lot about the region of the former Yugoslavia, the extremely complex relationships between the countries in the Balkans, and about what democratic consolidation and transitional justice mean. I also practiced writing a policy memo, and was able to gain specialized knowledge on a specific country in the Balkans.",
    "Prof. Aldrich is a fantastic teacher. She is well-read, clearly understands the historical significance of past events, and communicates the lessons well to her students.",
    "I learned about the history of Southeastern Europe",
    "Establishing a theoretical framework of democratic consolidation in a region devoid of any consistent democratic form of governance for nearly 70 years.",
    "This course broadly covers the recent history of South Eastern Europe, focusing mostly on the former Yugoslavia. I knew essentially nothing about any of this history or its present implications before taking the class, and I now feel quite well versed in the topic area, although there is always more to learn."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Prof. Aldrich is a great lecturer and she put together a multifaceted syllabus that covered a lot of ground.",
    "The strengths are Professor Aldrich and the interesting content\/history. Perhaps if the course remains small or medium sized, there can be more of a discussion and less lecture, although she is great at having us ask questions.",
    "The instructor was very passionate about the course material but her style of teaching was not compatible with what I would prefer. It felt like a lot of spewing of loosely-related facts rather than conveying a historical narrative.",
    "Strengths: This class was a laid back yet engaging study of the Balkans. The lectures were very clear and helpful, and I thought Professor Aldrich was very knowledgeable about the opics. The readings and films we were recommended\/assigned were very interesting, and I thought there was a great variety in the material we read. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes class time could be a little disorganized, the slides would have incorrect information on them (though this was minor). Likewise, the debate aspect of the class didn't feel like it was the best use of our time.",
    "Great prof!",
    "I felt that the course covered too broad an area at the expense of learning little about all. It would probably be better just focused on former Yugoslavia. A strength is that there arent many courses focused on this area of the world.",
    "Really approachable professor. The assignments help you get to grips with the material in a really subtle and interactive way too.",
    "This course was taught well as a small lecture, in which students could ask questions and Professor Aldrich could go into more detail regarding the actual content, which sometimes seminars miss. (These were largely both strengths, however sometimes student questions became a bit of a weakness, when they were no longer questions but their own stories.)"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I learned a lot and had fun.",
    "Definitely, it is a very misunderstood region and there are broader lessons to be taken.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because the material itself is very interesting and the instructor\/TF are very knowledgeable about the course material which makes for interesting discussions.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the region (or to those who have barely heard about it before!) Or, just take the class for Professor Aldrich alone.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes. Absolutely.",
    "I think Professor Aldrich is an amazing Professor, and really funny, but I felt that this course wasnt as intellectually stimulating and therefore less fun than other courses",
    "If this is a part of the world you want to learn about, then take it. It offers lots of opportunities to just do more of what you find interesting too, be it literature, movies or articles.",
    "This course is very interesting, and you should take the class if you are interested in the area, enjoy history-political science classes, or both!"
