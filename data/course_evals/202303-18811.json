                "Strengths were the homework problems and Munkres, which built off each other very well and helped to hone understanding; the difficulty was about just right. Prof. Wang is a clear lecturer and answers any questions very clearly, but sometimes the material gets a bit confusing and doesn't seem too motivated -- it would probably help if she explicitly gave the connection between the abstract structures we were working with (such as differential forms\/Generalized Stokes Theorem) and the computations typically seen in multivariable calculus. Also, sometimes the chalk was a bit light and hard to see. \r\n\r\nGrading was very fast, but sometimes a bit harsh.",
                "Strengths: The content of the class is incredibly interestingdifferential forms and manifolds are REALLY cool and incredibly applicable to Physics. Midterms were not too challenging as long as you drilled the practice problems. Prof. Wang is very clear about what you need to know and what you don't for the PSets and exams. Weaknesses: Prof. Wang can be a bit of a dry lecturer, but she is incredibly kind and tries to offer support as long as you reach out to her! The pacing of the class was a bit badI think we spent way too much time on integration in R^n, and as a result the last topic (tensor algebra, dual spaces, forms) felt very rushed. It's all really cool stuff and I wish I had had the time to develop a deeper\/better understanding of it, as it is also very hard... Also, harsh\/unequal graders on the PSets that can cost you your grade...",
                "One strength of the course is that the lectures were easy to associate with the analogous material in the textbook. One request I have would be that we could see examples in class that are more similar to problems on the problem sets.",
                "The material is fascinating. Lectures could explore more problem solving and examples instead of going over proofs that won't be needed for the exams or problem sets.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-The psets were difficult, but they were solvable; they really helped you to prepare for the tests, to the point that if you were sat in front of the exam, only having done the psets (well of course), you should be able to get at least and average\/decent score.",
                "The lectures were alright: essentially just very rigorous proofs with one or two examples of applications at the end. It was interesting, but you had to put in the work outside of class to understand geometrically\/analytically what a proof meant or how it was constructed. We followed James R. Munkres' \"Analysis on Manifolds\" to a T.",
                "Strengths: Class was very organized, lectures were clear, instructor was very clear on deadlines for assignments and responsive to questions\/feedback. \r\nWeakness: You can easily get by in this course without fully learning everything so tests\/homework won't force you to learn all the math. Could also be a pro if you want easier work.",
                "Class followed the textbook very closely",
                "The content of the course was a strength: I found it very interesting and informative to learn the theory behind Multivariable calculus. However, the content towards the end of the semester became a little too convoluted and felt rushed to arrive at the final result of the course (Stokes Theorem). I wish we had more time to dive into it.",
                "Strengths: much of the material in this class, especially on a more abstract level, is really interesting. Manifolds especially are a pretty cool concept that (outside of middle school demos like the Mbius strip) are something that I had never really seen before this class, and learning the math behind them is interesting. I also think this class does a good job at reinforcing important concepts from single-variable analysis and their natural multivariable extensionsthe (multivariable) definition of the derivative, for example, was interesting and well-taught.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: overall, this class was poorly organized and poorly taught. Granted, I'm not the biggest fan of analysis to begin with, but this course certainly did not improve my opinion of it. The material, while interesting on an abstract level, is pretty boring on a more detailed level; the first half of the manifolds section of the course, for example, mostly involved proving that functions are \"coordinate patches\" (bijective, class C^r, continuous inverse, etc.) which becomes quite tedious and uninteresting. On top of this, I thought that the class could have been taught a lot betterlectures were not very engaging, and it was often quite hard to follow Professor Wang's train of thought. It basically got to the point where, even though I attended lectures, I basically re-learned all of the material after class on my own time from the textbook and the class notes from a previous semester of the course.",
                "A strength of the course was that it was very clear what we were expected to know, and there were no surprises on homework or tests. Professor Wang did a good job in lecture, but it was hard to be engaged because the material was covered more or less the same and in more detail in the book. Still, this meant that there was ample opportunity to learn the material.",
                "This course was nothing more than an exercise in technicalities.  Familiar ideas were repeated in unnecessary detail, and new ideas were not presented understandably or interestingly.  We spent too much time on the foundations that we did not have enough time to cover any interesting material.  Stoke's theorem was covered way too quickly at the end because we were running out of time, and we didn't do any interesting math with it.  The problem sets also had way too many calculation questions for a proof-based math course.  I found myself losing significant points for minor calculation errors.",
                "A weakness of this course is the textbook; Calculus on Manifolds by Spivak is in my eyes a much better way to learn this content than Munkres. Additionally , I think the psets were much less instructive this term than when it was taught by Neitzke.  The exams were also not very interesting, although tedious and requiring long solutions, as they tended to repeat past pset problem or even problems from previous exams.",
                "interesting material and the psets\/exams are very fair but lectures are rather boring",
                "The lectures were basically just a the professor reading and writing down on the board a condensed version of the textbook without any real additional explanations. I felt like I had to teach myself most of the content from the second half of the class because there were so few resources to catch up once I fell behind. Office hours were all at unhelpful times that I wasnt able to make and there were no office hours in the two days leading up to the pset due dates, which is of course exactly when most students will be looking for help.",
                "strengths: 302 covers a lot of ground in both differentiation and integration in addition to introducing a lot of novel content (manifolds, tensors and differentials, etc.), content was well-paced, lectures focused on proofs whereas psets focused on applications\r\n\r\nweaknesses: pset grading was way too harsh, many students were often lost during lecture proofs (luckily, the psets did not test proofs)",
                "The tests were very fair and balanced, through it was a little on the easier side because the practice exams were almost identical. Professor Wang was a good lecturer and very friendly. However, sometimes the lectures felt a little slow paced. Both of the ULAs were also extremely helpful and fantastic. My major complaint is one of the graders. They graded way too harshly; for example, on one of the homework, when I defined a function that equals 0 (in R^6) when an element of an orthogonal group is chosen and even shown that the function equals 0 when such an element is chosen, I lost about 5 points out of 10 because it was \"too much of a leap in logic.\" But when I wrote the same exact proof on the test, I got full credit."

I hesitate to recommend it to a student who hasn't taken something like Math 120, though, because a lot of the things may seem unmotivated without some knowledge of multivariable calculus.",
                "Depends. IF you pure Math major taking this class to learn how integration, differentiation, and manifolds are rigorously defined in R^n then I would say yes, this class covers some really cool material that's incredibly useful for application to other branches of Math and theoretical Physics. Prof. Wang is incredibly sweet and a great Professor if you try to get to know her. She responds to emails and offers to schedule appointments outside of her office hours if you cannot make it to those. Lectures were a bit dry, and it did feel like we spent a bit too much time on integration in R^n to the point where multilinear algebra, tensors, and forms felt a bit rushed. Unfortunately, class enrollment was less than 40% by the end of the semester, but if you went to lecture, Prof. Wang would give you all the necessary Definitions and Theorems you needed, which made struggling with the (in my opinion, not the best) textbook (Munkres) less necessary. Grading on the Psets was a bit harsh, but it was more to do with the graders we got stuck with rather than it being the Professor's fault. HOWEVER, IF you are thinking of taking this class just to learn Calc III... Don't. Take Math 120 instead. Trust me. This class will NOT teach you Calc III (in fact, I feel like Math 120 should be a prerequisite, because I have no idea how I would have gotten through some of the material had I not taken it!) It's not a Professor thing, but rather how this class *is*you do proofs and no applications (for example, if it's taught in the way it was this semester, you will nevernot even oncehear the words gradient, divergence or curl in this classthey aren't taught. Neither is Green's Theorem, nor Lagrange multipliers, nor the ordinary Stokes's Theorem in the form it's taught in Math 120). So if you are expecting to know how to deal with the vector calculus needed in other STEM classes like E&M or Econ after taking this class... you won't! I promise you that. But of course, applications aren't the point of this classthis is more of a warning for anyone thinking of this class as a \"more serious\" Math 120it's not. They are completely different. Although the PSets were mostly computational, it was Proof-based computation that doesn't teach you how to actually do Calc III, but rather the type that teaches you how to apply the theorems in the book to book-specific problems. This was a bit challenging to do, because very rarely did we do examples in class and Munkres is an awful textbook when it comes to actually showing you how to apply the theorems it gives you (I have never seen a math textbook with LESS examples in my entire life!). The Proofs in that textbook are also quite awfulmost of them are several pages long and very difficult to follow, which can be quite overwhelming, especially at the start of the semester. TA's weren't the most helpful and office hours were at a very awkward time (last weekly office hours were the morning 2 days before the Pset deadline). BUT the class was overall doable and a good experience.",
                "I would recommend this course to mathematic students or students interested in theoretical physics, although they should be willing to invest significant time into understanding the material.",
                "I'd recommend this for anyone who enjoyed 120 and would like to understand why all those theorems and formulas hold.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who will be studying mathematics, or working in some field at the intersection of mathematics. I feel like the whole introductory mathematics sequence is well designed to foster a student's mathematical and problem solving maturity. I have only take 225, 255, and now 302, but I already feel so much more mathematically mature than when I came to Yale, it is actually incredible. The material of this class can be difficult, but the exams are somewhat forgiving (the questions are not too bad, but they are quick exams, meaning there is not a lot of time per question). It is a great course to improve mathematical maturity, and to prepare one for future rigorous treatment of multivariable functions and manifolds.",
                "For the math\/math-adjacent major, this course is a must. However, be prepared to do some work either with the book, with videos, or with ULAs to get a better idea of what each concept is. The homework given by Prof. Wang wasn't too bad - it took on average 3-5 hours per week. Our exams (2 midterms, 1 final) were very representative (almost exactly the same) as the problem sets, so nothing was too unexpected. Just be prepared to do some practice problems and review if you want to understand and be fully prepared for the exams.",
                "Only if you're a math major and interested in courses where this course is a prerequisite (eg differential geometry). It's definitely a fun course, but it's also not a \"core\" math requirement. Most higher level courses won't require this as a prerequisite, so think of this course like an elective.",
                "This is a great course for a student seeking to have a good understanding of mathematics. I found this course to be less theoretical than Real Analysis, which allowed us to apply the results that we proved in class. Much of the course is a natural extension of what was learned in Real Analysis, which made it feel both familiar and new at the same time. The Munkres textbook was not my favorite, but still a good resource for the first two-thirds of the course. The exams were very reasonable with many problems coming directly from the homeworks.",
                "No. I hate giving negative reviews, but this was probably my single least favorite class I've taken so far at Yale (and I'm a math major). The material is interesting in theory, but the lectures are not super engaging, and the problem sets are more tedious than fun. In addition, while Professor Wang is both incredibly smart and very understanding\/helpful, she is not the best lecturer or teacherit's very hard to follow her train of thought during lectures, she does very little to make lectures interesting\/engaging, and when you ask her a question, she usually just repeats exactly what she just said (even though I didn't understand the initial explanation).\r\n\r\nDespite having already taken multivariable calculus, in hindsight, I would have considered taking Math 120 just to avoid this classand anyone who has never taken multivariable calculus should definitely take Math 120 instead. I've heard this class can be better if a great professor is teaching it, but if that is not the case, I would not recommend this class.",
                "Yes. While the topic is the same as math 120, the approach is completely different. I feel that strength in regular multivariable calculus has as essentially nothing to do with success in this course, but analysis knowledge and proof writing does. As a physics major, I feel like the sections on the derivative and jacobian were immediately useful. This class also covers tensors and differential forms which are useful and not covered in other courses to my knowledge.",
                "Don't take this course with Professor Wang.  She just read straight from the textbook and was not an engaging lecturer.  I just ended up skipping class and learning from the textbook.  The midterms and final were also near exact copies of the practice tests, so performance was not based on understanding of the material, but rather memorizing the solutions to the practice tests.  The pacing of the course was also quite bad.  We spent way too long on the basics and barely covered Stoke's theorem at the end.  Familiar ideas were repeated in unnecessary detail, and new ideas were not presented understandably or interestingly.  This course might've been more engaging with a different professor, but I can't say for sure.",
                "For math majors I would definitely encourage taking this over 120 to fulfill the multivariable requirement. Otherwise, there are more interesting math courses to take I would say.",
                "yeah, more interesting multi course than 120",
                "Not unless Neitzke is teaching it",
                "Yes to the course, but No given the current professor\/graders. I found the grading to be excessively harsh and not a fair representation of measuring student capabilities. Most points per question were docked for even minor mistakes. However, I enjoyed the content itself (a step above multi calculus) although I did find it on the easier side.",
                "Even if you do not have to take the multivariable calculus requirement for the math major, I highly recommend taking this class because not only does it teach fundamental concepts, such as manifold, but it also lead to higher level courses, including differentiable geometry and algebraic geometry. Even if you are not interested in any of the things above, learning the same topics from math 120 but in rigorous, formal manner was very interesting."
