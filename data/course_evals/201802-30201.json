    "I learned so much about what autism is, the science behind it, how it affects families, and social policy concerns. I had a very sketchy idea of what this disorder was before, mostly based on movies like Rain Man and random comments from uninformed people, and this course answered so many questions.",
    "I learned a ton about clinical diagnostic assessment",
    "I learned much more about the intricacies of autism and the science behind it. I've also now decided this should be my line of work.",
    "I gained a great breadth of knowledge regarding autism spectrum disorder.",
    "Understanding the history of autism, how it has been defined and changed throughout the last 50+ years, how diagnostic criteria differ from coutnry to country, how mental health services are provided and how their availability has changed over the last 50 years, novel findings in genetics and neuroimaging that ground autism research in more scientific concepts, and improvements in interventions.",
    "I learned about the difficulties in diagnosing and treating ASD. Through the course, I was exposed to the complicated nature of the disorder and of the various social and cultural aspects impacting it.",
    "I learned a lot about autism that I did not know before.",
    "I gained insight into autism and psychological evaluation",
    "Learned about the definition of autism and related ongoing debates. Also discussed evidence based treatments and their efficacy."

   "comments": [
    "The course is amazing given that we had such a short period of time. I was worried about not being able to volunteer and see kids with autism, but the professor offers the option to volunteer during the semester and makes sure to show videos of kids with autism and Asperger's, which I really enjoyed. I also loved all the guest lectures, especially the one with John Miller.",
    "There will be weaknesses with any online course, such as technology that does not work. Strengths include information presented in a clear, concise way.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is the knowledgeable professor who presents the material in an interesting way that engages the students.",
    "The strengths were the Professor and teaching fellow who were both easily accessible, the discussion sections which were highly informative and interactive, and the course materials which were engaging and easy to understand. One weakness was the emphasis on the material from the first half - I think we could have spent a little less time on this and more time on concepts from the second half. In addition, I think that having comments on our reading responses could have highlighted which concepts the Professor\/teaching fellow thought we had down and those which they thought we could spend more time studying.",
    "Very informative, but as an introductory course, broad in nature.",
    "I loved the content and it was incredibly interesting. The only thing was that even after the whole course, I still feel like I don't understand what the available treatment options are. I think it would have been helpful to look at some case studies and see what exactly their treatment plans were, or how their education was altered for best possible outcome.",
    "Strengths--good discussion, weaknesses--some material was repeated",
    "Great topic, Professor Volkmar is extremely knowledgeable and highly regarded in the field. Could be improved with more concise lectures, some of the information was a bit repetitive."

    "Yes, definitely! The professor is amazing and so knowledgable and the structure of the course is really well done. The workload isn't bad at all but you will learn so much. There will definitely be some topics that you will be genuinely interested in and want to learn about, and you can easily find additional sources or ask Prof. Volkmar for resources to explore those interests more fully .",
    "Yes",
    "I would, especially if they are interested in autism or psychology.",
    "Absolutely. This is a fascinating course that gives a wealth of information regarding a health issue that is exceedingly relevant in todays society.",
    "Yes, if they want to learn about a social learning disorder with an interesting history and a heavily politicized\/sensationalized presentation in the media. It clears out a lot of the bs that you've inherently picked up on and makes clear that we know a lot more about it that most people think.",
    "Yes! ASD is a fascinating disorder and one that is receiving more attention today. The course also delves into the cultural and social aspects of the disorder, something that I feel is sometimes ignored in the search for medical diagnoses.",
    "Yes, I loved this course and Professor Volkmar is very knowledgeable and kind.",
    "Yes it was very useful",
    "Yes, allows you to really delve into the topic of autism, even without any prior knowledge or personal experience. Provides scientific and clinical context for a really prevalent mental disability."
