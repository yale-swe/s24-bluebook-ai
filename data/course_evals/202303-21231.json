I had never taken a language course before coming to Yale, and I was very worried about the idea of going through the process of learning language at such an older age--as compared to most other students here--but the way the course was handled (and largely thanks to the way Professor Del Percio taught) made it such an enjoyable class, and I think it's great for those worried about language classes and those looking for a truly enjoyable class that's also incredibly intellectually fulfilling. Also, the class is small, for now, and the connections I've made with my fellow classmates are truly magical.",

                "The strengths largely lie in the professor who always made the class such an enjoyable experience. It never once felt like a chore going to class everyday, which isn't something that many students taking entirely in-person language classes every day of the week say, at least in my experience.",
                "Amazing diversity of how we learn, from videos to discussion. I would get rid of the Memrise and See, Say, Write as they are mind-numbingly lengthy and jam too much into our brains at once, in favor of shorter daily homework.",
                "The daily speaking activities and environment of the class was the strongest part. There was never a day that I felt uncomfortable for making a mistake in the class. The weakest part was the online activities. The memrise lessons were long and didn't assist much in my personal learning process.",

                "I've been recommending this course to everyone I know since the second day. College is one of the last times we truly get to explore new things entirely without consequence, and learning a language like Cherokee in particular (a language that isn't as widely spoken) is such a unique and special thing that anybody looking for a truly great college experience and a great education should partake in, and learning a Native American language knowing the long history of Native American communities is an important and worthy endeavor. Even if you've already fulfilled you're language requirement, I highly recommend this course because on top of being educationally exceptional, it's also just fun, and I don't throw the word \"fun\" around lightly.",
                "Yes! This was a welcoming and inclusive space which taught me a lot about the Cherokee language.",
