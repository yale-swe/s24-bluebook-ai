We also explored a variety of different policy arenas, including health policy, immigration policy, environmental policy, etc.",
                "I learned more about public policy in the United States. Specifically, I was enlightened by information on healthcare, demographic changes, climate change, our two-party system, and the flaws in our democracy. We talked about many relevant issues and learned political terminology to identify them.",

The class helped me refine my ability to write policy memos - a key skill - and forced me to develop the ability to communicate succinctly. It also provides a great overview of the current state of American democracy and policy which will provide you with new insight when observing the ongoing politics of our day.",

            "comments": [
                "Very interesting lectures and good guest speakers, assignments were well explained and relevant to the course",
                "Strengths- prof Hacker is great and very passionate about the material. The class in itself was super interesting. Readings were also interesting, and this may be an unpopular opinion, but I thought the reading was a perfect amount and the workload was perfect as well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses-not a big one, but I think it would have been interesting to write the policy memos on topics that we wanted to instead of a structured, assigned topic",
                "Strengths: Discussion sections, topics covered, Prof Hacker's demeanor (when I told my PL I was taking this class, my PL, who took the class a couple years ago, said the incredibly true words \"Jacob Hacker's biggest fan...... is Jacob Hacker\"). You'll read a bunch of Prof Hacker's writings and I'm sure he'll show you a video of his name being mentioned in the UK house of parliament on the first day of class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Guidance on papers (there is basically little to none, but luckily the grading is pretty forgiving), large amount of reading (TMFR - to quote an example course evaluation response Prof Hacker provided us with in our last class), breakout rooms during lecture.... discussion sections exist for a reason.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hacker and our TF's were great at engaging with us, and the content of the course was very interesting and enlightening, and definitely my favorite of the courses I've taken.\r\nWeaknesses: I think maybe two policy memos instead of three would have been good. I found them to be challenging.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hacker is a great lecturer--very knowledgeable and engaging. I loved that this course covered so many diverse areas of public policy; it was perfect as an introduction, and in-depth enough that as a junior with political experience, I was not bored. Another strength was the guest lecturers, who came (to Zoom) not only from Yale, but also from universities all over the country and shared their expertise. I loved the different opinions and perspectives they brought to the class. Weaknesses: I am a liberal, and I wish we had learned more about the conservative arguments for\/against the policy solutions we discussed in class. I feel like I have a deeper understanding of the liberal\/progressive argument for certain approaches, but if a conservative tried to challenge me on anything, I wouldn't be able to engage in the way I would like.",
                "Strengths: It's an awesome intro to political science and how political science is used to analyze public policy. All of the course topics are extremely relevant to the current political situation and will continue to be relevant in the future. The guest lecturers are stars in their field and provided a new perspective on the issues we discussed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We only had 1 semester.",
                "I think for the wide set of topics this class covered, it did a good job",
                "Strengths: A lot of really interesting topics discussed and a lot of interesting guest lectures. The policy memos were also a great way to learn more about policy\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked to go more in depth on certain topics. The class also sort of assumes a liberal position. It is not that conservative viewpoints are silenced, but whenever they are raised it is mostly in order to argue against them rather than really engage with them.",
                "It was well structured and covered a wide swath of issues. The readings could be better distributed across the weeks. The guest lecturers were great.",
                "Overall, really fantastic course without much to complain about. I found the workload to be super manageable and the TFs very helpful. Really awesome survey of a variety of political issues.",
                "This was a great course! Professor Hacker really planned it out well! You learn about the most important issues that our country needs to address, including immigration reform, criminal justice reform, and environmental reform.",
                "I believe the number of guest lecturers we had in the course was excessive. However, the topics were so interesting that student engagement was always very high.",
                "The strengths of this course include: the lectures (and guest lectures), Prof. Hacker who's extremely knowledgable on the course's subjects, the TFs who were responsive and clear in their feedback, and the readings which were very informative. A Zoom strength of the course was that it was recorded which made it much easier to review any parts you'd missed during the lecture. Can't think of any weaknesses of the course aside from some weeks having fairly long\/dense readings.",
                "Strengths - professor, guest lectures, coursework level\r\nWeakness - too much reading",
                "I liked how he structured his slides and the breakout rooms and sections were helpful",
                "The course was very engaging because it covered current political issues and was very applicable to our current political climate.",
                "The strengths of this course are that the policy issues were very interesting and that you learn a lot of helpful skills to go into the policy area. I don't think there are any particular weaknesses of this course.",
                "One of the strengths of the course is the wide scope of topics covered. Because of this, the class was never dull and I feel I gained a lot of insight in a bunch of different policy areas. Another stregnth of the course was the prevelance of guest speakers. It was very productive to hear from field experts and be able to ask them questions about their area of work. One way the course could be improved is by placing more focus on how to write an effective policy memo. I think an explicit lesson in this topic would have aided me to write stronger policy memos.",
                "I didn't particularly enjoy the breakout rooms (having to report back to the class was anxiety-inducing personally. Professor Hacker was really kind when facilitating these discussions and made it clear we could let him know not to call on us but I think I was afraid it could impact my participation grade at the time) but I know it's difficult to make class discussions feel natural on zoom and I appreciate the effort Professor Hacker and the TFs made to coordinate this. In terms of readings, I was unable to keep up with all of them but I think the lectures contained enough content that I didn't feel lost. I really liked the broad range of topic areas we covered and the ability to choose any area for our final paper. The guests lectures also kept the class varied and engaging. The policy memos made me think deeply about the topics and I found them a useful exercise for better understanding class topics.",
                "The lectures were really interesting and engaging and required you to really think about the issue Prof Hacker was lecturing about.",
                "Strengths: the topics that were covered, the guest lectures, the professor's knowledge about these topics. Weaknesses: the readings were not always very relevant towards the course assignments.",
                "I really love the structure of the course, the materials, and the topics covered.  I can think of no major changes to the course that I would like to see.  I particularly loved the large number of outside guest lectures who came in.",
                "Strengths: The course is great at introducing you to a variety of public issues and potential solutions. Prof. Hacker's lectures were extremely engaging and his guests were even better. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I can't really think of any weaknesses other than the scheduling issues that occurred as a result of changes to the calendar last semester.",
                "The course was pretty strong overall. The TF's and professor Hacker were awesome. Assignment wise the final paper could have been a bit more guided in terms of content. You learn how to write a great policy memo in this class and students should note that they will spend most of the time on the policy memos."

                "Yes! If you are interested in public policy and want to learn about how policy is made and how it is written, please take this course!",
                "The class lecture itself was dry but the discussion sections were very dynamic and engaging. Honestly, I feel like I learned more in the discussion section than in the class itself. Overall, I would recommend it as a good intro to public policy, but be warned, it is a lot of work (especially if you do all the readings)",
                "I would! I think it's really important to learn about the intricacies of policy, and I think that Professor Hacker did a great job at communicating that. You learn a lot about the complexities of issues in ways you wouldn't have otherwise, and I feel a lot more capable of tackling issues such as healthcare inequality and immigration than I did previously.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in a fast-paced overview of various areas of U.S. public policy (immigration, climate, health care) and how they relate to our political landscape. You'll discuss political polarization, inequality, and other important issues. Make sure you are prepared to write three 5-6 page research papers and a 10-12 page research paper -- that's 25-30 pages of writing for just this class! If you're genuinely interested in the issues, though, it's fun, and you can be creative with it.",
                "Yes. Please take this. If you ever want to live in the United States and be a responsible stakeholder, take this. Prof. hacker is a legend in public policy and political science. All of the course is extremely relevant to current issues but is grounded in political science literature from a long span of time, and historical analysis is a piece of the conversation. You learn how to write policy memos, which is extremely valuable if you ever want to do anything related to public policy.",

                "Yes, it's an interesting class. Professor Hacker is a great lecturer and there are many interesting guest speakers. It is relatively introductory, so it often felt like a review of commonly heard policy problems. The workload is manageable, without counting the readings, you only need to do the memos really. It makes more sense to take it as a WI, I didn't do it but my friends did and the only difference is that you get feedback after your first draft and need to submit a revised copy, vs the regular that you don't need to resubmit anything; and it helps your grade.",
                "I would actually recommend it to anyone who is remotely interested in public policy (and not necessarily just politics). Policy memos are a great way to work though how you would want to solve a given problem you learn about, and Professor Hacker is a really engaging and passionate teacher.",

Prof. Hacker and the TFs are incredible and understanding of unexpected challenges\/circumstances. Recorded lectures!",
