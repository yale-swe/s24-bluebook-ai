    "The science of natural disasters",
    "In this class, I learned a lot about the science behind natural disasters, something that has especially become more relevant in recent years, as well as practical skills that come into use when these disasters occur. Overall, Professor Bercovici and Professor Long has given me the knowledge to frame situations in an environmental context.",
    "Better understanding of natural disasters and their courses",
    "I think understanding why we experience various natural disasters, or even simply natural events (such as thunderstorms) is very important. This class also forced me to apply learned concepts rather than memorize factoids, which is a helpful skill.",
    "A little bit about the science of natural disasters, but also about the human impacts of these disasters.",
    "In addition to lots of knowledge about natural phenomena on Earth including disasters--a broader appreciation for the importance and beauty of science.",
    "plate tectonics, atmosphere circulation, volcanoes, earthquakes, hurricanes, extinctions, etc.",
    "I learned about how natural disasters work.",
    "I learned a whole lot more about the workings of the inner earth and how the earth functions as a planet in the solar system",
    "Learn about geologic, cosmological disasters.  tons of extensive knowledge about plate tectonic cycle and related disasters, geologic connection to climate change, solar system creation, disasters, etc.",
    "I learned a lot about all types of natural disasters, how they work form a physics perspective, and much more!",
    "I learned about the driving forces of geological, atmospheric, and cosmological disasters.  I also learned a more in-depth scientific view on climate change\/global warming.",
    "Good general understanding of mechanisms that drive natural disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, etc.)",
    "Natural disasters! Tornados, hurricanes, thunderstorms, volcanoes, earthquakes, etc",
    "I learned a lot about cycles in the earth, feedback, natural disasters, the formation of the planet.",
    "I thought the class did an exceptional job at providing a survey of all earth systems, while still holding true to its word and teaching us all the death and destruction the class name provokes.",
    "You'll be surprised by how much of geology is applicable to everyday life. This class dives into the source of natural disasters and explores many case studies. An incentive to take this class is that it takes you on a trip during spring break!",
    "Built a stronger understanding of how geology underpins climate and other planetary systems and how they play into disasters that affect our lives.",
    "During this course, I learned the science behind natural disasters, and how humans and other life contribute to these geologic processes. I also learned many quantitative ways to determine certain characteristics of these disasters as well.",
    "Got a good understanding of the earth processes",

    "Positive and negative feedbacks of our planet, how earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and more occur.",
    "basic geology",
    "You know, I am a bit surprised by this but I actually learned quite a lot of decent information that I did not previously know about natural disasters and our weather system in general. This class covered A LOT of ground, and I found that they did it in a pretty concise and reasonable way. I did not have high expectations for this class, but it ended up being pretty interesting and practical. I especially enjoyed our conversations about weather systems and how the Earth is broken up into three cells per sphere. It helped explain a lot.",
    "I developed a broad scope of knowledge regarding the formation of the Earth, the natural events that occur due to the atmospheric and internal makeup of the Earth, as well as insight to how life is formed and sustained on Earth.",
    "Learned a lot about geology and what leads to natural disasters",
    "SO MUCH!! This was one of those classes where everything you learn is very relevant to the world you live in. Beyond just weather patterns and interesting natural disasters, the class delved into historical aspects and other ways geophysics has had an impact on human history.",
    "We learned a thorough knowledge of the natural disasters: their causes, processes, and effects. We learned about many examples of natural disasters, as well.",
    "I learned the workings and functions of various kinds of natural disasters.",
    "I gained a more complete understanding of the Earth's climate and how it works. Furthermore, I have now learned how closely relatef climate and human history has always been.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It's a science credit. It's a very average class, feels a lot like a high school class.",
    "Lectures were very unclear and difficult to follow. PSETs were tedious and forced us to do way too much unit conversion as opposed to actual thinking.",
    "The strengths of this class is that they offer a lot of support through sections and supplementary office hours. This class is not only science based but also requires some historical and quantitative knowledge which makes it a pretty well rounded class. A weakness of the class is that oftentimes there are too many lecture slides so the professor ends up going through the lecture slides really quickly, making it a little trickier to grasp the concepts on spot.",
    "strengths: a lot of material, really interesting lectures especially Professor Long\r\nweaknesses: slides and lecture material covered too quickly. Difficult to absorb",
    "Office hours\/review sessions were both very accessible and helpful; however, lectures were not. After the first midterm I stopped going to lectures because so much material was packed into 50 minutes it was more beneficial to just go through the posted lecture slides later on at my own pace. Plus, even though the professors were engaging lecturers, I felt they often went off on tangents at the expense of covering more relevant material.",
    "I like that the course had clear expectations from the start and a nice, spread-out workload over the semester. The problem sets were challenging, but plenty of help was offered if you wanted to take advantage of it. Overall a very good class.",
    "Strengths are absolutely the instructors.  Prof Bercovici and Prof Long both care deeply about student learning and go the extra mile to make content engaging, approachable and meaningful.",
    "male lecturer always went superrrrrr fast that we'd just sit there, not absorb anything or be able to take any notes because he'd talk so fast and go through 60 slides in 50 minutes. sections were super helpful though in learning the material and doing the psets.",
    "Strengths: The professors are great! Very engaged, and very knowledgable and enthusiastic about what they teach. They respond quickly to emails as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The problems sets were nearly impossible to do without going to section, and it's not even because the math is hard (just algebra). The questions are sometimes just poorly worded, and at times can be incredibly convoluted for no reason. The exams were graded by TFs who had a very different idea of what the grading should be like as compared to the professors. I asked Prof Long about a sizeable point deduction on a question that I agreed that I had not answered fully, but also did not deserve to get 7 points taken off (out of 10). I originally got scored a 3\/10, and then got 5 points back!",
    "I absolutely loved the in-depth lectures as Professor Long made them super interesting and explanatory and really took the time to show her interest in the subject",
    "Prof B and Prof L's lectures complement each other really well, and Prof L's lectures should not be missed.  You learn a lot, but its relatively manageable as long as you stay on top of everything.\r\n\r\nPSets are not too hard but enough work\/thought that you can't just skim over them.",
    "the only weakness is that we cover a lot of material every lecture (usually 60 slides worth in a 50 min period) but aside from that, the teachers are amazing, the TAs are amazing, and I am so glad I took this course.",
    "The in-depth lectures were very captivating and interesting.  However, some of the content lectures had too much information and because of that, the slides were rushed and it was difficult getting all the notes on time.",
    "Overall good: material wasn't bad, tests were fairly based on what was covered in lecture and homeworks.",
    "The course was very well taught with many interesting demos for the various natural disasters. The office hours and discussion sections were also very well run and the professors obviously cared about the class and the students",
    "Strengths: professor long. She is a sweetheart and is so good at explaining things. Homework help was also very very helpful \r\nWeaknesses: the p sets were often really hard to do and did not necessarily reflect things that were learned in class. And it was never clear how to do them in order to succeed.",
    "The weekly problem sets were definitely a weakness. I understand that we are not going quite in-depth enough to really do work, but a lot of the quantitative questions seemed more like busy-work than teaching us stuff. The qualitative questions, however, were very helpful.",
    "While the physic concepts may seem daunting at first, Professor Long breaks them down in the in-depth lecture, where she demonstrates the concepts with in-person experiments. Professor Bercovici moves incredibly fast because for some reason he needs to review 70 slides in 50 minutes. I suggest breaking it down into more concise slides, maybe moving the background information to section discussion or pset questions.",
    "Strengths: course content was very interesting, good structure, fair assignments and exams, caring professors and TFs, access to resources and help whenever needed. I really, really appreciated the class's emphasis on overarching themes and concepts rather than factoids and quantitative problems.",
    "Lectures are interesting, professors are kind, it's just kinda dry at some points and i think more conscious effort tying it back into the central themes of the class would help alleviate this dryness.",
    "The lecture slides were quite dense, making it a bit different to complete the entire range of information that needed to be presented in one day. Making lectures more concise would add greatly to clarity and general understanding. \r\n\r\nThe extra-help sessions were very helpful and greatly aided in my understanding of the coursework.",
    "The lectures moved really fast because there was so much material to cover. The class is great at breaking down complex ideas and making them very simple and understandable for anyone. They teachers are also great at making sure key concepts are well understood.",
    "Problem sets very hard",
    "There was section offered multiple times a week, and that was very helpful. However,  graded problem sets werent given back to us so it hindered our ability to correct mistakes a bit.",
    "Strengths: generally really well run! Both professors were great lectures and sections went through the homework each week. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes there was a lot of extraneous information in the lectures and it was not always clear whether what was necessary to know for exams and what was not.",
    "A strength of this course was the support offered by the professors. A weakness of this course was the number of lectures.",
    "messy lectures that are confusing but loving professors",
    "This course is a well-oiled machine. It runs very systematically: each week you have a pset, every month and a half you have a midterm, and the three lectures each week are supplemented by an optional section that basically goes through the homework with you. That is basically all there is to this course, and expectations are extremely clear and simple. However, the systematicness of the course is also where problems arise when you are asking for the professors to be flexible. Because both professors are still very active in their fields, it is hard for them to make time for students outside of class who might have had to miss a class for personal reasons. After missing a class, I emailed them and was denied office hours with them because (understandably) they were away conducting other work. However, I also even had trouble getting notes on the \"in-depth\" day due to the fact that I knew no one else in the class and had to rely on the professors to help me. Because they were busy, this took several weeks. \r\n\r\nAnother thing- it would be helpful for students if you posted slides before lecture. Because Prof. B would move at such a quick pace, I could never take notes in class. If we had the slides beforehand, we could keep up by adding little notes to the online slides in order to note the supplemental info he said in class and then transfer that to written notes later. Just a thought. I also think that any student who would just look at the lectures rather than come to class is already the type of student who isn't coming to class.",
    "I think some of the explanations regarding how natural disasters are formed could be more consolidated and organized (the textbook and teaching sometimes differed and I wasn't sure how deeply to go into the material since the textbook was overly comprehensive).",
    "Its so nice that there is a discussion section you can go to to get help with your psets",
    "I can't really think of any weaknesses. The only thing is that Prof Long taught fewer days than Prof B and they both rock and wish they taught equally. A strength is that it moved in a very logical way and each piece built on the last. I really enjoyed the material in the class. Another big strength is the non-required sections in which the professors and TA help with Psets. If you are struggling in the class, they are super helpful.",
    "STRENGTHS \r\n- The content was really interesting \r\n- The lecturers were fantastic, especially Professor Long, who explained things really clearly and greatly helped my understanding of the material in section\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n- There were too many slides per lecture (sometimes up to 75), which meant that we did not have time to learn many things in depth, or write coherent notes. Oftentimes it felt like a huge rush to go through every slide, and sometimes there would not even be enough time allocated to each slide for the lecturer to read everything on the screen. \r\n- There were some grading issues with the exams, in the sense that many people were initially not given marks they actually deserved.\r\n- How much I got out of section varied greatly depending on whose section I went to - this is an issue I think because people will have different understanding of the material based on what times they are free to attend section every week.",
    "Strengths: material was fairly engaging, both Professors were helpful and engaging as well\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the material was overwhelming in quantity, not the difficulty.",
    "The sections were very helpful in clarifying many concepts.  A weakness is that sometimes there was so much information in the lecture that it would become overwhelming and a bit difficult to follow in class.",
    "This course is very strong overall and could only be truly improved if there were more chanced to discuss the psets in class of during office hours.",
    "I think one weakness was that we barely learned any physics that was on the psets. I really liked how the professors offered section every week where they went over the psets in depth.",
    "The course is well organized and easy to follow. Lecture notes could be more clear.",
    "Strengths: weekly discussion sections\/homework help sessions are very helpful in terms of going over the problem sets and the important concepts from lectures; really strong professors; lectures are interesting, material is mostly straight-forward\r\nWeaknesses: problem sets are sometimes hard or very long but mostly able to understand them",
    "Goes beyond just explaining natural disasters, explaining earths geological and meteorological systems and how they impact us. A full and comprehensive course.",
    "Strengths: Profs. Long and Bercovici made the course fun, especially the first part of the course. In-depth lectures allowed me to visualize the topics that were discussed theoretically in content lectures. The subject matter is important to learn. The exams were very fair. Lecture content was posted online to help for exam review. Sections helped a ton for problem sets!\r\nWeaknesses: Some lectures felt too rushed due to the sheer amount of slides per lecture powerpoint. Some of the material felt a bit irrelevant to natural disasters (e.g.: learning about bacteria and archaea) so I felt like it could be cut out to focus more on the processes behind the actual disasters without breezing through and trying to cover everything. The math on the problem sets was very difficult for students unfamiliar with that type of math, especially since nothing like that was ever on the exams. Problem sets in general felt tedious, specifically the math\/physics questions (most of the content-based problems were very helpful for exams-- that's good!)."

    "If you need a SC credit, take it.",
    "No. Lectures were very unclear and difficult to follow. PSETs were tedious and forced us to do way too much unit conversion as opposed to actual thinking.",
    "If you are not much of a STEM student and are looking to find a science credit, I recommend taking this class! The professors are super nice and easy to talk to and the material that's covered in class is actually very interesting and relevant to today!",
    "This is not an easy A science credit. The psets are heavily physics and math and take a bit of time to do, even if you go to section to work through the problems. There is a lot of material and the midterms are not always straightforward",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another Yale student. I think it's a great science credit for anyone who isn't a STEM major. That being said, this course isn't a gut. As long as you put in the work, you'll definitely do well, but don't expect to do nothing.",
    "The class isn't too hard and the material is pretty interesting. Definitely recommend.",
    "Yes, really a great interesting\/engaging science course if you're curious about Earth & geological phenomena.  Prof Bercovici and Prof Long are fantastic instructors.",
    "yes, a painless science credit although a lot of problem sets and 3 exams!",
    "I would recommend this course if you need a science credit! I'm excited about the spring break trip (which, by the way, is subsidized and application-based but I heard that they've been able to take everyone who wants to go). Learning about natural disasters was relatively interesting.",
    "For sure. Although I myself am not very interested in being a science major, I found the study of the Earths wild processes and events very interesting and I would recommend it for anyone who wishes to learn more about how the world works and why some of the events that happen on Earth happen.",
    "Great science credit--interesting, you learn things of substance so that its not a waste of a class for a science credit.  Professor B and L are great, lectures are engaging, content is interesting.",
    "Yes yes yes. I can not say enough good things about this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student just slightly curious as to why natural disasters occur.",
    "Yes, if you need a science credit.",
    "Yes, the course was very interesting and applicable to real-life natural disasters. Also well taught by the professors",
    "Yes, if you want to put in a lot of effort to get a science credit. This course is hard. I know everyone says its easy, but its not. It requires a lot of time and effort. I will say definitely take the course to get to know Professor Long. She is so so kind and is so intelligent, and really takes the time to get to know her students and explain material to them.",
    "Yes I would. More than ever before I think it's important to understand our earth processes and forthcoming problems we all will feel.",
    "Yes! The geology department is one of the most underrated majors at Yale. This is a great introductory course into the major, and the concepts you learn in Natural Disasters is applicable to several other fields.",
    "Yes! I LOVED this class! With climate change intensifying and expanding, it is so important to understand the underlying geologic processes. I learned so much, and it actually sticks with you because you are told to focus on understanding the overarching concepts rather than just factoids and equations. The exams and problem sets are also very fair.",
    "if you need a science credit, it's fine but there's easier ones",
    "Yes, because there is a lot of interesting and relevant information offered. Also, the courseload was light but very engaging, providing the perfect balance for stress-free learning (especially when done in conjunction with attending the extra-help sessions).",
    "Yes! If you are interested at all in natural disasters, climate, and other topics related to the planet and\/or solar system. Also, if you do well in the class, you have the chance to go on an incredible, once in a life time trip.",
    "No",
    "I would recommend this course, not only is it interesting, the workload is not that bad",
    "This is a good class to take and gain a solid understanding of geology and geophysics if science is not necessarily your expertise. The material is presented clearly and is relevant and interesting especially considering its lack of prerequisites. Grading is straightforward and office hours are really great for help; Professors Bercovici and Long really want you to do well and understand the course material. I feel like a lot of the core concepts will stick with me and be useful in the future.",
    "Absolutely! This is a great science credit for non-stem students. Although, if science courses are not as easy for you, then it's not totally a gut unless you go to section each week. But if you are on top of lectures and go to section, its smooth sailing.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning more about the processes that govern our climate.",
    "Yes, learned interesting information about natural disasters, professors were great",
    "depends on if you need a science class!",
    "Yes, I would! But something to note: If you are looking at this review to take a science gut, do know that there are a couple of rules that the teachers are unwavering on, the most relevant being that there is NO curve, but the material is relatively easy, so if you actually put effort in you'll be fine. Do NOT wait until the night before to do psets, and go to section because it's actually helpful for homework. Most importantly, have an interest in natural disasters!! If weather, plate tectonics, and tsunamis do not interest you, then this might be boring for you.",
    "I would, as a good science credit that doesn't require excessively convoluted thinking, but a steady progression of learning and consistency with memorization will mean doing fine in the course. You'll also learn a combination of basic biology\/chem\/physics applications to the material which is super interesting (nothing too technical or hard).",
    "Yes for a good science credit for non science majors",
    "Yes! If you think the class is a total gut, you're wrong. It is relatively easy, but if you don't have any basic high school physics and struggle with some of those simple concepts, that might be difficult. However, the optional sections are super helpful if you are having trouble. But I adored the class and would recommend it to any and all students. It was one of those classes where I learned things that actually matter and explain things about the world. TAKE THIS CLASS! Also Maureen and David are so incredibly engaging and interesting and know and love what they teach.",
    "Yes! I loved it!",
    "Yes, good science credit for non-stem majors. Not too difficult, and interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course with the warning that the course requires a decent amount understanding the concepts of the natural disasters, but its is all very straightforward and the professors do a good job of telling you what you need to know for the tests. Also, definitely go to section. They explain how to do the p-sets in a step by step process. If you can, go to Maureen Long's section.",
    "I would recommend students to take this course as a science course which offers a lot of information which covers many different areas at once. This is a great course to get a broad basis of understanding about natural phenomena which defines human life.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is good at math.",
    "If you need a science credit, this is a good one.",
    "Yes, was an engaging and interesting class especially if you need a science credit. Problem sets are mostly quantitative, but tests and lectures are more conceptual. Professors are also very approachable and helpful.",
    "Yes - if you want a deeper understanding of the planet we live on and our relationship with it, you should definitely take this course",
    "Absolutely! The science of natural disasters is relevant to any course of study-- both STEM and not (e.g.: economics, history). The professors are awesome and you learn about real-world science!"
