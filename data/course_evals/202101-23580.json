                "I developed a much deeper understanding of the political and historical origins of extremism in the United States. I thought that our consideration of white supremacist and anti-government organizations, particularly, was especially useful in understanding our current political moment. In terms of skills, I learned to write a political science paper and follow the conventions of the discipline. Writing our papers in segments and receiving feedback on each portion before moving to write the next section was really helpful. I would feel confident entering another political science class and preparing a research paper on any subject because of the new skills I gained this semester.",
                "I learned about the emergence of domestic extremism in America, its roots, the increase of right-wing extremism in recent years, and how the media frames \"terrorism\" which then affects how society and the law view these crimes. I developed research and writing skills more specific to the area of political science which I had not yet been exposed to.",
                "I learned so much in this course about the history and present day causes and impacts of extremism and domestic terrorism. I also learned lots of skills about writing research papers, as this course utilized a step-by-step paper format that was really helpful (beginning with a review of relevant literature, then an overview of our research design, and then finally the research in action).",
                "- Ability to write a political science paper (very useful)\r\n\r\n- Ability to critically read political science papers\r\n\r\n- Strong base of historical knowledge on rightwing extremist movements in the U.S. and around the world\r\n\r\n- Decent base of policy knowledge on countering extremism, how researchers think about extremism, etc.",
                "I learned about extremism in the US and elsewhere.",
                "This was my first political science course, so I would say the largest skill I developed was how to write a political science paper. The professor divided the sections of the paper so that we had 3 major submissions over the course of the term which was great because all three sections required research but all of different kinds. The actual course design of weekly readings and reading responses was familiar to me as it mirrors other social science courses. In terms of knowledge, I was most excited to take this course because of how topical the information is. Definitely the most rich portion of the course content-wise was tracking the emergence of the white power movement."

                "I thought that Professor Lotito did a great job choosing relevant, interesting readings that provoked insightful discussion in class. When I first registered for the course, I had expected the weekly reading responses to be either tedious or stressful, but I actually really appreciated the chance to gather my thoughts and ask questions. Professor Lotito also did a great job incorporating our questions and insights from those responses into our class discussions. It was an intense subject, especially for a Monday morning, and I think an in-person environment would build a more comfortable environment than trying to have discussions over Zoom. Nevertheless, the readings, discussions, and assignments were well chosen and well led.",
                "The seminar format facilitated great conversation. Having assignments that were geared towards teaching us how to write political science research articles in the future helped immensely in improving my writing skills.",
                "My only comment is that I wish we talked more about left-wing extremism in the US. Other than that, I really really enjoyed the material and discussions of this class! it was really accessible and paired really well with current events.",
                "I think Professor Lotito integrated really important material on the syllabus; I found all of the courses' readings to be highy relevant and very interesting -- that was a major strength. I think one way it would be cool to see this course improve is if students were to direct portions of the discussion (bringing their own questions for discussion, background research, lesson design, etc.) just to keep students more engaged throughout the semester. Another strength I believe was the reading response portion of the course - these responses encouraged me to engage with the course's readings in a really constructive way that prepared me for in class discussion (I think all courses should adopt a method like this!).",
                "The readings were interesting but often felt repetitive. The reading load couldve been reduced, especially considering each weekly response required citing all of the readings",
                "Strengths:\r\n\r\nGreat discussions and good moderation\r\n\r\nInteresting readings that felt relevant to the material\r\n\r\nReading response assignments helped elevate the discussion\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nWould have been interesting to learn about other American extremist movements from different sides of the political spectrum",
                "This course was very accessible and touched on a wide range of topics. It seems that it could certainly be made more challenging and in-depth.",
                "The design of class discussions (guided question + raise hand function) was a major strength of this course. I felt that my class was not aiming to regurgitate the readings but actually listening and engaging with the comments of their peers. I would also say that this course felt very geared towards the final paper, but did a good job of balancing the two priorities of in class learning and individual final projects. In terms of improvements, the early weeks of the course were the most exciting because I was learning a lot of new information. That being said, I felt the pacing of tracking the white power movement was a bit off. For example, we spent a decent amount of time talking about the psychology of radicalization, but Belew's book \"Bring the War Home\" was definitely the most important in catching the transition from blatant racism to a white power movement and then to the movement today. So basically I felt weeks 4-6 could have used an extra week because that aforementioned leap was a bit more difficult to parse than I think the professor realized. After week 6, the course started to bounce around a bit, which wasn't bad, but maybe was more difficult to resonate with \"the point.\" Exceptions include learning about the identity politics of extremism and lone wolves/school shootingswhich may say more about my particular interests than anything about the course."

The readings are interesting, the discussions make you think about issues in new ways, and the final paper is a great opportunity to explore an area of your choice while building skills for political science writing. And Professor Lotito is great! Especially in a challenging semester, he was always kind and showed how much he cared about our class. He was intentional about the work he assigned, and he did his best to make sure we were getting as much as we could out of the class.",

I definitely think it's a self-selecting course, but just for context, I was admitted off the waitlist and hadn't even reviewed the syllabus and was just super intrigued by the course title and it was amazing. I can't speak to how this course compares to other political science seminars as this was my first but the professor was so kind and thoughtful the entire semester.
