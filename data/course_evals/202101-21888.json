                "Strengths: The course material is interesting and the literature deals with interesting themes such as; women's role in society, immigration, single-parent experiences, the impact of war, etc. Un Sac de Billes was a wonderful book, if at times rather daunting. You also just, in general, become much better at writing, speaking, and reading French.\r\nWeaknesses: The course feels far too dense at times. Some units feel borderline unfair in how much content you need to cover. The Course Packet feels a tad bit outdated and sometimes the assignments in the CP felt overwhelming. The unit devoted to Un Sac de Billes was incredibly interesting, but it felt extremely rushed; it was hard keeping up with everything that was happening.",
                "Strengths - excellent geographic and cultural diversity of course materials, effective small class size for enabling seminar participation, and ample exercises and repetition for language learning\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - every exercise in the course packet should have an answer key for providing immediate feedback",
                "I really enjoyed this course - I thought it moved at a good pace (challenging but not overwhelming) and I appreciated the smaller class size and opportunities for questions and discussion.",
                "The strengths are that I learned a lot, especially with workbook practice and livrables. A weakness is that the workload felt unmanageable a couple of times over the semester. The books/stories that we had to read could also be improved and selected to deal with better and less stressful topics.",
                "The main strength is the instructor. She is absolutely the best instructor I have ever had. She legitimately puts so much consideration into every one of her classes and it shows. She goes out of her way to make class engaging, even through Zoom. She came up with a variety of different ways to engage the class, such as Jeopardy games, Breakout rooms to discuss questions, diverse course materials, the idea of having students present on topics in French culture, etc. All in all, I was able to learn so much through such a range of learning mediums. I've never had a professor, in person, or virtually, put so much effort into making the course material engaging. Secondly, she is genuinely so caring and considerate towards her students. She always mentioned that we should take care of her well-being, and she made it clear that she would always be there for us to turn to. She is a natural teacher, a natural mentor, and a naturally empathetic person.",
                "Strengths: Extremely well organized (in Canvas), amazing professor, clear communication about expectations. Interesting texts for discussion and engaging topics. \r\nWeaknesses: There was less listening and speaking practice than FREN130 and there was little feedback on course packet activities.",
                "Good mix of reading and listening exercises. I didn't find the grammar textbook very helpful as it's very dry and technical, and sometimes I had to search the internet for more comprehensible explanations. The audio programs were very helpful in integrating grammar with the reading, and I would love more of that."
