    "Grammar skills: continued to work on subjonctive, imperfect and various tenses. Grammar focused as well on idioms and writing. \r\n\r\nthis course focused provides a muched more balanced review of reading\/literature and grammar than 130.",
    "The course gave students a strong foundation in writing, grammar, and oral speaking skills",
    "Became a better French speaker.",
    "I learned brand new grammar I'd never seen before in high school, which was refreshing if a challenge.",
    "I solidified a lot of the grammar I learned in high school. I also learned how to read French novels because they taught the pass simple. My speaking and listening also improved"

    "The course was very well structured towards facilitating student learning and highly engaging. The texts discussed in this French course in particular are really fascinating and engaging too!",
    "Strength: we read some challenging full-length books and critically acclaimed post-colonial short stories by francophone writers, which makes the reading interesting and rewarding to have achieved this level of proficiency. \r\n\r\nWeakness: we do not practice speaking very much",
    "Not of the assigned audio homeworks were very effective. A lot of them were very long and since it was a call and response type of thing, they felt a little unnecessary to do"

    "Yes, but be prepared to have a good amount of work.",

    "Yes, if you enjoy classroom French learning, participate a lot (Professor Koundi doesn't favor shy students) and don't mind writing literary analysis for the Rdactions. The workload of this class is VERY high. The professor claimed it would be less than in L3 but this time you actually need to do all of it. That being said, we learn a lot of new grammar and read some interesting\/challenging literature.",
