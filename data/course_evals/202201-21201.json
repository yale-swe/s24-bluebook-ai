                "Sadly, I struggle to think of any valuable knowledge, skills, or insights I have developed from this course. The course syllabus describes junior seminar as \"the theoretical debate surrounding the function of artistic production and visual culture.\" I'm all for theoretical debate and conversation, but I found that this course and its structure were so far removed from anything applicable to us as student art majors that I questioned why it should exist at all, let alone be required for the major. Some examples of class discourse are the group discussing vague texts about the interconnectedness of nature and truth versus facts. These conversations are not useless, but they were remarkably ungrounded. We hardly ever talked about ourselves as artists, or about other artists, or about the art world. The only conversation I found practical value in as an artist was reflecting on the concept of IAE (International Art English), which engages with, among other things, the pretentious elitist qualities of the art world. This class ironically became a strong reinforcer of these qualities through an abundance of remarkably dense texts ripe with obscure and referential language, leading to the class environment feeling unwelcoming to free flowing conversation. I don't want to invalidate the texts provided for the course. They are important, but looking at the demographic of Yale junior art majors, nobody's practice is developed enough for the things that we discussed to have been valuable or applicable. Ultimately this class made me lose trust in the art major as it currently exists.",

                "This course unfortunately had few strengths and many weaknesses. I do not fault the professor, I frankly just don't think believe this course should exist. The feedback on my artist statement was very limited and primarily to simply \"read it out loud to myself.\" There was no time provided for us to discuss our own work and interests with each other in depth. I leave the class with my knowledge of the other students solely limited to their final presentations of their creative work. Again, most of the time our readings and class conversations felt not only disconnected from our predicament as students in art/design, but were hardly related to the art world. The class environment was stressful and awkward. Students were not motivated to engage with the material, likely for the reasons above, which led only a few voices left to dominate conversations, which often went on tangents more irrelevant to the course objectives.\r\n\r\nSome specifics: the weekly QCQs were a good concept, but were not engaged with properly in the generation of class conversation. We pretty much never referred back to them and I wish questions brought up in the QCQs were directly asked by the professor, which would have led to more direct engagement with the material. Also the description of what to include in the QCQs were vague. I enjoyed the art I hate presentations and I also liked the Grad Critique / Artist Talk / Exhibition Notes assignment, and I wish that the class was structured around these more concrete ways of engaging with visual culture and art production. I would have been far more interested in discussing the different exhibitions and talks other students went to with the group, which could lead to a discussion about what makes an exhibition successful, for example!\r\n\r\nA really great strength of the course was the studio visits, I gained a lot of insight from listening to other working artists and asking them questions about their creative processes. I wish we had more of these, and could even imagine an entire Yale College course to be structured around a new studio visit each week - artists learning directly from other artists (perhaps visiting a mix of SoA grad students and places such as NXTHVN and Erector Square!\r\n\r\nI think the most valuable reform of this seminar would be a radical restructuring process turning it into a \"Junior Studio.\" where we devote the majority of class time to discussing our work with each other and our desires for the future, the whys and hows of it all! Why do we want to be painting, drawing, doing graphic design, film etc in the art world as it currently exists? This class currently does not provide us any momentum to answer that question for ourselves. The course is not generative. A more broad note about the art major is that I strongly believe that there should be a Junior Studio devoted to MAKING. Most liberal arts art programs give their juniors (and even sophomores) studio space (even if its just one communal classroom and not individual subdivided areas), and the fact that art majors at Yale don't have access to space to create until senior year (sometimes senior spring) is debilitating and antithetical to artistic development.",

                "No I would not recommend this course. I don't think that it should exist because it does not benefit students in its current state. Being completely transparent, I have spoken with about half of the students in this class and numerous older art majors who have taken junior seminar in the past and I have heard the same criticisms I've written above about Junior Seminar. Art majors seem to universally have strong negative opinions about this course. The only positive thing I have heard (and agree with) about Junior Seminar is that it is a great opportunity for art majors to meet each other. I dont mention these conversations out of spite! I am expressing this in the hopes that the course is radically restructured in the future to best work for art majors today, because I think it definitely can be!",
